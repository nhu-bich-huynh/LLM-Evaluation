"It is not enough simply to increase resources and step up police cooperation."
"There also has to be cooperation at a deeper level between the authorities and the information services industry."
"What is required is the rapid dissemination of experiences and technical knowledge to enable the child porn homepages to be filtered out."
"The joint action put forward in the autumn of 1998 deals precisely with improving this type of cooperation, and stresses in particular the importance of working with the industry and the public authorities."
"Furthermore, the Member States agree to review what special requirements the Internet service providers should be obliged to meet."
"We should also be seeking to ensure that Community programmes such as STOP and the action plan on Internet abuse are properly used to increase cooperation as part of our common efforts."
"I agree with Mr Schmid when he says we could go further."
"In the first place, I think that trading in child pornography should be made a criminal offence in all the Member States and that there should be a Union-wide age definition of a 'child', although I am aware that this is easier said than done."
"At the same time, I also know that there is a sense of justice throughout Europe which demands vigorous action to end all aspects of child exploitation."
"The present climate should be highly conducive to moving the boundaries here."
"Finally, I should like to say a word about the d'Ancona report and the battle against drugs."
"The Union's current action plan on drugs comes to an end this year."
"The European Council has therefore asked the Commission to prepare a new action plan."
"The work was begun during the winter and is now more or less complete."
"In spite of the present circumstances, I hope to be able to bring forward the proposal."
"In her report, Mrs d'Ancona places particular emphasis on the importance of preventive measures."
"The same aspect is also one of the main themes of the Commission's proposal."
"It is also wholly in keeping with the guidelines approved during the UN's special session on drugs last summer."
"We also attach considerable importance to what we call an integrated and global strategy."
"Isolated efforts are not enough, no matter how well executed they are."
"Everything that is done in this area must hang together and form a coherent whole."
"For instance, the ground must be prepared by preliminary work so that legal action can be taken against drugs-related crime and drug abuse."
"A repressive approach should always be accompanied by a strong social commitment."
"It is therefore clear that measures adopted at national level should take account of the possible effects which they may have on the global community as a whole."
"Drugs-related issues have become a priority."
"People also expect clear signals from the Union as to how we plan to meet the challenges that lie ahead of us."
"It is therefore vital that there should be a wholehearted commitment on the part of Europe and all its institutions."
"I know that Mrs d'Ancona is also satisfied with the interinstitutional cooperation which has been established during the past year between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in the battle against drugs."
"In her report, she also highlights the need for effective cooperation, as well as coordinated measures."
"I am wholly in agreement, and I sincerely hope that the cooperation which we have succeeded in establishing will be further developed during the coming years."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Migration, right of asylum and integration of refugees"
"Mr President, these past few weeks have surely opened the eyes of those who did not understand before."
"The tragedy of hundreds of thousands of people being forced to flee Kosovo has clearly shown that migration policy in general - and asylum policy in particular - can no longer be tackled by countries on their own."
"Europeans will only be able to confront this serious problem by working together."
"However, it is not enough to make erudite and solemn declarations."
"These must be backed up by actions and specific political measures."
"And that is where the shoe pinches."
"As far as the Maastricht Treaty is concerned, which has only been slightly modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam, political initiatives concerning migration and asylum policy are the responsibility of the various governments."
"Yet this intergovernmental policy does not work."
"More than twenty conventions or joint actions have been adopted but they have yet to be ratified."
"They are thus ineffective and of little use."
"What is even more serious is that the Council has still not reached any agreement on the text that would have greatly assisted us in the Kosovan crisis, in other words the 'joint action on the temporary protection of persons displaced by conflicts'."
"Politics will not be able to work effectively in Europe if we continue in this way."
"With regard to migration and asylum policy, the main obstacle is Europe's inability to take decisions at Community level with a qualified majority."
"I therefore welcome the fact that the Austrian Presidency reopened this debate by presenting a strategic document on the Union's migration and asylum policy."
"It is in the light of this future policy - which we hope will win support at the extraordinary summit in Tampere - that Parliament is setting out its ideas on this issue."
"To begin with, we do not want migration and asylum to be confused."
"The right to request political asylum is a fundamental right based on the Geneva Convention; it cannot be violated."
"Instead, we must harmonise reception conditions, streamline and speed up the procedures for processing applications, and increase solidarity between the Member States in terms of sharing refugees and the burden imposed by the massive numbers arriving."
"Nonetheless, irrespective of what we do, the right to request political asylum is a fundamental human right that cannot under any circumstances be violated."
"As regards migration for the purposes of seeking employment, we must support all efforts aimed at ensuring that legal immigrants are fully integrated into our society, to which they make a positive contribution."
"However, illegal immigration is a completely different matter and must be combated effectively, particularly where criminal activities are involved."
"Illegal immigration networks and trafficking in human beings are new areas where serious organised crime is taking hold."
"European countries will only be able to prevent this most inhumane form of crime by pooling the resources they have to combat this phenomenon effectively."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the migration and asylum policy is an issue for the future."
"If we do not tackle the problem together and propose effective solutions, we may well fail."
"The European Parliament does not want to see any such failure."
"It is therefore proposing an effective and workable action plan and it expects the governments to take action and put it into practice."
"Mr President, Commissioner, my report deals with the 'Eurodac' system, which is designed to enable us to take the fingerprints of applicants for asylum and to compare them."
"The aims are threefold. Firstly, it should put us in a position to combat abuse effectively."
"We have established that there is an increasing number of multiple applications."
"What is taking place here is social abuse."
"We have also established that more and more criminals are applying for asylum in order to avoid the effects of legislation relating to aliens."
"What we have also discovered is that more and more illegal immigrants apply for asylum if they are apprehended after entering a country illegally."
"The second aim, after combating abuse, is to achieve an indirect sharing of the burden."
"It is in line with the Dublin Convention that people who are seeking refuge apply for asylum in the first country they have entered, and these countries are then required to examine the application for asylum."
"The third, very important, aim is that the true refugees, the real victims of persecution, must be granted maximum assistance as quickly as possible by ensuring fewer applications for asylum, faster processing of asylum procedures and effective use of the money available for the real asylum seekers."
"What led to the drafting of this report?"
"The first document was the Eurodac Convention."
"As we know, the document was complete and there was agreement in the Council, but it was not signed and as a result of course it has not been ratified."
"Despite this we have racked our brains over how to extend the system to include taking the fingerprints of illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the border or in the country, to compare them and to establish whether an application for asylum has already been made; this would also allow us to effectively implement the Dublin Convention."
"The Protocol and the Convention have resulted in Parliament being asked to deliver an opinion in a relatively short period of time, even though they were not ratified and even though it was established in the Council that once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force the Commission and the Council are expecting to come up with a new regulation anyway."
"Parliament discussed this in committee and unanimously decided that it should nevertheless deliver an opinion, quite simply so that the Commission could also include Parliament's ideas in its proposal under the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The report which I subsequently presented has been debated twice, and when it was put to the vote on 16 March, the situation changed as a result of a U-turn by the PSE, the Greens and others."
"Suddenly a report was no longer needed and the draft was rejected."
"As rapporteur, I note the result in committee, even if I do not share its view, since my opinion is what was previously agreed unanimously by the entire committee, namely that Eurodac is necessary to combat current problems."
"I should like - not as rapporteur but as a Member of this House and of the Group of the European People's Party - to make a brief comment about this."
"What happened here at the end of the debate was a pathetic spectacle because the Socialist Group and others on the left simply caved in. They were not prepared to send out a signal that asylum abuse must be combated at all costs and that Parliament must exercise its authority to put forward proposals to the Commission that strengthen our position in the areas of asylum applications, the proper processing of applications and combating abuse."
"Finally, I would appeal to the common sense of the House to support the Council proposal at tomorrow's vote and to send out a strong signal in favour of an indirect sharing of the burden and combating abuse."
"Mr President, I am speaking as rapporteur and as draftsman of an opinion, but in relation to two different reports."
"I would first of all like to talk about the Council's draft Joint Action on the creation of an early warning system for the transmission of information on illegal immigration and facilitator networks."
"In our view, this basically consists of extending to the 'enlargement countries' the decision taken in 1992 on the creation of the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on the Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration and concentrating its activities on rapidly detecting cases of supposedly massive immigration."
"Parliament criticised the creation of this Centre for Information in 1992."
"It was decided at that stage that CIREFI was to be involved in the issues of illegal immigration and the smuggling of humans."
"This proposal requires the 'enlargement countries' to cooperate where possible. However, in my view, it also raises quite a few doubts, just as the creation of the Centre did at the time."
"Firstly, it is difficult to understand why the Commission is not involved in this work, particularly as we approach the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"This new communication also raises doubts in that respect, yet that is not the only thing that leads me to question its effectiveness and its purpose."
"First of all, what kind of information do we hope to gather and how do we hope to gather it?"
"Are we not aware of what is going on around us?"
"I would be surprised if that were the case."
"In my view, nothing was as easy to foresee as the humanitarian crisis we are seeing on our television screens; nothing was as easy to foresee as the crisis that Europe is now experiencing in Kosovo. Equally, few things are as easy to foresee as the fact that in the months ahead, the Straits of Gibraltar and the Mediterranean will once again claim many people who, taking advantage of the good weather, will try to get across in tiny boats and vessels that are in terrible condition."
"In any event, we know that illegal immigration causes great concern and Parliament hopes to act responsibly. As I said before, we are surprised at the lack of cooperation with the Commission."
"The Commission has the help of Eurostat and in the near future will be able to rely on the Schengen information system or the European information system. In my opinion, these elements would be perfectly adequate and we should not duplicate remits, duties or structures."
"Because of all these doubts surrounding the future of this draft action and the Centre itself, I seriously considered rejecting this proposal."
"However, as was mentioned earlier, we are aware of the dramatic problems that the illegal trafficking of persons generates in Europe."
"We are therefore calling on the Council to put forward a new proposal for a regulation, in the light of the Treaty of Amsterdam, within the next year. We are also asking it to include the Mediterranean region and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as an area for action under the scope of this new proposed regulation."
"I will now go on to look at the opinion I drew up and the report presented by Mrs Reding on the strategy paper on migration and asylum policy."
"I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur very sincerely for her work and her ability to move such a controversial report forward in such a short time."
"I am sure all the Members of this House would like to thank her for enabling us to give our opinion on this issue at such an appropriate time and before we complete our work here."
"I welcome the Council's document, particularly as it gives fresh impetus to a fundamental debate within the European institutions and between our institutions and the people of the Union."
"On behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to point out that our immigration policy and the treatment of 'legal' immigrants in the European Union are going to become increasingly vital issues in our relations with third countries."
"An example of this is the talks we are currently holding with the Mediterranean countries on the conclusion of association agreements."
"I therefore believe that we should manage migratory flows not only on the basis of our internal policy, but also by taking account of the Union's actions in other areas, such as the common foreign policy or our development policies."
"In my view, dialogue with third countries, combined with measures aimed at development, is the most important element here. Indeed, such measures involve immigrants as they send a large proportion of their income to their families and this constitutes a significant amount of aid for both the families and the countries themselves."
"I must stress that dialogue is more important than joint action and more important than repressive measures or measures imposing our requirements on other countries. Dialogue is essential, a fact which is highlighted in the document."
"There were certain elements that I was less satisfied with, and I am speaking now more on behalf of my group than on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"Firstly, although we are pleased with this document, we would have been much happier - as I said in relation to the previous issue - if the Council had provided a strong impetus by approving the documents already on the table, which were presented by the Commission in recent months, not to mention years."
"I am referring here to the convention for the protection of displaced persons, which was mentioned earlier and which we desperately need."
"I am also referring to the convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals."
"We would have preferred to receive a clear signal of support and approval for these measure, rather than an analysis of the issues, despite the fact that this in itself is to be welcomed."
"As we are seeing, we need an asylum policy and we need an immigration policy."
"I would like to take the few moments I have left to ask the Group of the European People's Party to act in line with the House's vote on the convention on rules for the admission of third-country nationals, and, in relation to the debate initiated here by the Council, to vote in favour of the amendment calling for the rights of third-country nationals residing legally in the Union to be regulated."
"To my mind, this issue is of vital importance."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights my task was to deal with the legal issues raised by the additional protocol to the Eurodac Convention."
"The first difficulty here was that we do not know the Council's reaction to the opinion delivered by the European Parliament on this Convention."
"After all, the extensive data protection measures that we called for are at least as important for the additional protocol."
"In my opinion the second problem continues to be whether solely illegal entry or solely illegal residence is sufficient to justify such an encroachment on a person's individual rights."
"On this point my view is quite different from that of Mr Pirker, who spoke earlier."
"After all, the person's fingerprints are not just taken and compared but also stored for years to come."
"Is this really necessary?"
"In any event, the Committee on Legal Affairs cannot decide this because in my view it is a moral question."
"On the whole, it must be said that the Council has made significant efforts to draft a text that guarantees that stored fingerprints should be used to enforce the Dublin Convention, although in my opinion it has not gone far enough."
"We must clearly vote against an extension of the Eurodac database, as called for by the rapporteur."
"That is why we voted against it in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and spoke out against the adoption of this report."
"We did not 'cave in', as the rapporteur said; however, we did express our opinion that we are not convinced that we can just treat people in this way."
"In my view a Europe in which all the data relating to a particular person can be retrieved at any time is not our Europe, nor does it correspond to my vision of Europe."
"Mr President, I have three comments to make on the reports on asylum policy which feature on our agenda for the plenary this evening."
"Firstly, in recent years the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs has highlighted time and time again the need for a harmonised approach to matters of asylum and migration."
"Resolutions were drawn up by Mr Wiebenga, by myself and by Mrs Lindeperg prior to the reports on our agenda now by Anna Terrón, Mrs Zimmermann, Mr Pirker and Mrs Reding."
"Mrs Reding's report is a really good one, if I may say so."
"The European Parliament also decided last year to set up a fund for refugees."
"In stark contrast to that, and this is my second point, we see the inability of the Council to be effective: inability to agree on how to admit refugees at the appropriate time and how to share the burdens; inability to agree a definition of what constitutes a refugee; inability to set up a common fund to pay for the reception, integration or return of those whose cases have been processed."
"It beggars belief that even in the terrible circumstances we are witnessing today, there is no will to work together."
"This brings me to my third point, which is really a question."
"How can it be that the Council is working on a kind of negative accompanying policy which seems to suggest that harmonisation does in fact exist?"
"Asylum seekers are not allowed to apply for asylum in more than one Member State, it was decided in Dublin."
"Hence a system called Eurodac, which enables this to be verified using asylum seekers' fingerprints."
"Parliament produced a consultation paper on this with a great deal of difficulty, because we really thought that it went much too far."
"But the Council's intention to extend this system to illegals really is too much."
"We do not want police state operations, and nor do we want attacks of this kind on people's physical integrity."
"And I agree with what Mrs Zimmermann has already said."
"We want just one thing: an approach to European asylum policy which is at all times fast, efficient and humane."
"It is unfortunate that there are perforce no Commission initiatives in this area at present."
"I believe, and I wish to make the point, that Commissioner Gradin has done an extremely good job here."
"We are feeling the lack of a president because the Council is taking its time in putting together a new Commission, and I have to say that in this regard there is just one thing we need, namely a decision by the Council so that the matter can be addressed properly at last."
"Mr President, in this joint debate, the Community action programme to promote the integration of refugees - for which Mrs Zimmermann is rapporteur - has assumed particular importance in view of the current situation."
"The European Parliament had the foresight in 1997 to create a number of new lines in the budget which give the European Union the scope to implement specific measures in this area."
"It is important to highlight the fact that the action plan will help us to coordinate Community initiatives and those of the Member States."
"In my view, this coordination is vital for the successful development of the action plan and we must therefore ensure that the various administrations involved collaborate in a clear and effective manner."
"The way the Commission has organised the pilot projects carried out in the last two years has not been particularly satisfactory, since the Member States have not been properly informed about the development of the projects and nothing has been done to help them to participate."
"Therefore, Commissioner, we must rectify these mistakes and try to make the most of the results of the measures taken earlier."
"In this respect, it might be useful to assess the results achieved through the earlier projects with a view to preventing any similar mistakes in the future."
"Moreover, given that the programme also aims to promote transnational cooperation, raise public awareness, and so on, it is important when trying to make the most of future actions to take other EU initiatives into account, such as those that come under the European Social Fund, the action plan to combat racism, or other programmes such as 'Youth for Europe', which could also have repercussions on issues concerning refugees."
"We will thus be able to avoid a duplication and therefore dilution of any efforts made."
"As regards the joint action on voluntary repatriation, it is important to ensure that the aid is not used for this purpose alone, but is also used to improve the refugee reception centres in the Member States. In addition to improving the buildings, we must also allocate funds to train those working in the centres so that they can properly receive the refugees and provide them with the help they need for their future integration."
"On another matter, and without going into an in-depth analysis of the legal basis for the approval of the action plan - Article 235 - I simply want to point out that it might possibly have been better to wait until the Treaty of Amsterdam comes into force and to adopt these measures under the framework of Community action to promote social integration, in accordance with the new Article 137 of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Nevertheless, Mr President, Commissioner, we are very much in favour of the adoption of these proposals and we hope that they can be implemented as soon as possible."
"Mr President, this debate is overshadowed by the war in Kosovo."
"For two years, the European Parliament and the Commission had been pressing the Council of Ministers for decisions on how to cope with refugees and how the financial burden should be shared in the event of major human disasters of the kind now happening in Kosovo."
"The European Union ought to have learned from its experience with the half a million refugees from Bosnia."
"The relevant legislative proposal, a form of joint action, was accepted last year by the European Parliament, but the Council of Ministers has done nothing about it."
"We have no system for the acceptance of refugees, although we do have a very small refugee fund of EUR 15 million or so."
"But on the other hand, virtually no financial provision has been made for emergency aid."
"All this is a sorry state of affairs."
"Last week's decision of the Council of Justice Ministers about what to do with displaced persons from Kosovo said essentially that they should be taken in, in other words accepted in the Balkan region."
"That is in itself a good decision."
"I refer you, for example, to paragraph 26 of Mrs Reding's excellent report."
"We must endeavour to make it possible for these people to go back to Kosovo as soon as possible, to their own homes, because ethnic cleansing cannot be accepted as a fait accompli ."
"The Austrian Presidency's strategy paper is a good starting-point for a new European policy on migration and asylum."
"But it should be the last paper."
"What we need now is legislation."
"Mrs d'Ancona has said this already."
"The previous paper, and it was not a Council one but a European Commission one - Commissioner Flynn issued it in 1994 - was virtually ignored."
"The debates on it, if I can mention merely one example, talked of the migration monitoring centre."
"This was a monitoring centre, a unit of the European Union, which was to have the remit of monitoring conditions in refugees' countries of origin."
"Nothing has come of it."
"And now, and I am looking here at Mrs Terrón i Cusí's report, we are talking about an early warning system for illegal immigration, controlled by the Council of Ministers."
"That is not a good idea, because a monitoring centre for migration of the kind discussed earlier ought to come under the responsibility of the Commission, and should have a broader remit."
"We need a European policy on asylum for the future, and we need it fast."
"The Tampere summit will be too late to help the Kosovars."
"But the Heads of Government should seize the chance to break the years of deadlock over the devising of a policy such as this, a uniform European policy on asylum, just as they did last year over monetary policy and as they did recently in Berlin over financial policy."
"Mr President, it is difficult not to be shocked and moved by the flood of Kosovar refugees fleeing the barbaric acts of the Serbian militias."
"Yet it is also difficult to ignore the hesitation and ambiguity of the Member States about accepting these refugees and their catastrophic inability to predict these obvious expulsions."
"They are hesitant to commit and share out the funds needed to accept the refugees, yet the high cost of the weapons used has never been challenged. They are ambiguous about the status of these refugees since certain Member States are only proposing to grant them territorial asylum with reduced rights, rather than strictly applying the Geneva Convention."
"Such ambiguity is also evident in the presidency's strategic document on immigration and asylum."
"The initial document from the Austrian Presidency created such an outcry that the German Presidency modified it."
"It clearly removed or watered down the most controversial aspects, but retained its fundamental approach, emphasising repressive action as well as the methods of preventing migratory flows into the European Union."
"Unfortunately, this document sticks very closely to the policy that is currently being followed in many Member States, a policy that is increasingly restrictive and repressive towards immigrants."
"The immigration policy is considered first of all from a security viewpoint, with the construction of what amounts to a judicial and police barricade prohibiting access to the European area."
"Immigration is all too often wrongly linked to the rise in unemployment, a notion that has unfortunately been repeated here in the House."
"During a recent debate on a draft convention from the Commission, this House justified applying the Community preference - which is terrible in itself - and national preference in the field of employment."
"My group strongly condemns such moves and also opposes quotas on immigration."
"These quotas are based on neocolonial attitudes and their only aim is to select immigrants according to the European economy's needs, both intellectually and in terms of manpower."
"I will continue to stress, here and elsewhere, that there is no correlation between immigration and the rate of unemployment, and studies by the OECD have demonstrated this."
"We must put an end to this strategy of finding scapegoats and rid ourselves of our obsession with security."
"The process of regulating the status of illegal immigrants that is applied in certain Member States does exactly the opposite of this strategy, but we must not stop there."
"That is why my group is proposing in an amendment that the Member States should regulate the status of illegal immigrants, while respecting human rights and the relevant international conventions."
"I would call on our governments to ratify and implement all the international conventions, particularly the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families and the 1992 Council of Europe Convention on the Participation of Foreigners in Public Life at Local Level."
"The provisions of these conventions should be included in the future Community policy on immigration and asylum provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam, instead of this arsenal of administrative controls that simply increase in the number of files to be dealt with."
"In recent times, the right of asylum has become more and more restricted."
"In fact, in France, in 1997, 83 % of applications for asylum were rejected. These included applications from Algerian victims of terrorism and from Kurds who were the victims of oppression that was as severe as that now experienced by the people of Kosovo."
"The presidency's strategic document does nothing to alter this trend."
"Along with other Members of this House, I have therefore signed the appeal backed by the High Commissioner for Refugees stating that it is unacceptable to allow Europe to enjoy the benefits of its economic and financial environment yet ignore the distress beyond its borders."
"In conclusion, I would like to mention the analysis by the president of the European Union Migrants Forum, as it is also an appeal to all elected representatives and governments."
"In his view, those seeking asylum, refugees and migrants all form part of European society both now and in the future."
"Treating them as possible aggressors to be discouraged from approaching our prosperous Europe means that only the well-off will be allowed into this very private club."
"And as far as the poor are concerned, be they nationals or those from other countries who have already arrived, all they have to do is wait and their turn will come."
"Indeed, in his opinion, they will soon be looked on more as intruders who should not have any rights and who deserve only hand-outs."
"Our struggle is therefore a struggle on behalf of our entire democratic society."
"We are not only fighting for ourselves and for all those who have had the misfortune to be born with the wrong papers; we are also fighting to strengthen the democratic foundations of our societies."
"Mr President, this report takes on an even wider significance following the tragic events in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, right in the heart of Europe."
"I wish to refer in particular to the proposals on the fingerprinting of illegal immigrants."
"This is the thin edge of the wedge."
"It is Orwellian in its theory and probably, if it is ever put into practice, something even George Orwell would not have thought of."
"Instead of tattooing them, the modern-day Europe is going to identify those who make us feel uncomfortable by fingerprinting."
"After immigrants, we take on the gypsies, then citizens we do not like the look of."
"Immigrants and those we feel uncomfortable with in society are branded, as criminals are today."
"I strongly oppose this proposal."
"I admit there is no easy solution."
"If there was, it would have been found by now."
"Issues of high politics are caught up in issues of human rights."
"There is an overwhelming and immediate need to protect and care for the victims of war, to stop the genocide and to find a solution acceptable to all sides, including respect for and understanding of the needs of neighbouring countries."
"Top priority continues to be the need to protect and to care for the refugees."
"Families have been separated and sent to different countries."
"Refugees have died in holding pens in modern-day Europe, without sanitation or proper services."
"The UNHCR has been very slow to react, to say the very least."
"We have to act, as the interior ministers did last week, when they suggested that long-term admission of Kosovars to countries outside the region would consolidate their displacement from their homes."
"We have to be certain that the wrong signals are not sent to the Serbian regime, that it is possible for the Kosovars to return home eventually to safety."
"We welcomed the launching of the general debate last year on a consistent approach to the questions of migration and asylum."
"The strategy paper, which has been under consideration in the Council, has enabled a serious analysis of the many aspects of migration and asylum to be undertaken so that constructive solutions can be found."
"In the light of the present crisis we also welcome the fact that the strategy paper developed last year examined the possibility of making a single member of the Commission responsible for all matters relating to migration policy."
"This could be a significant advance given that at present several members of the outgoing Commission are responsible for different areas, which range from the legal aspects of migration, humanitarian aid and the free movement of persons to the foreign policy aspects of migration."
"A number of the points set out in today's reports overlap as, for example, the services and reception facilities to be provided for asylum seekers and refugees."
"Finally, I wish to pay tribute to the Commissioner."
"It may be my last opportunity to do so publicly."
"She has been a great asset to the Community and a great source of support on issues that have very often been discussed in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"I wish to pay tribute to Mrs Gradin and wish her every success, whether she comes back or not."
"Mr President, my group supports the reports by Mrs Zimmermann and Mrs Reding."
"Even in the last few days it has become clear once again how urgently we need a European policy on refugees and immigration."
"The atrocities, the expulsion and the genocide in Kosovo and the sometimes unpleasant way in which some Member States are dealing with the displaced persons who need our support illustrate once again that we need a harmonised policy on refugees and asylum, but one that must be humane in accordance with the Geneva Convention."
"The harmonised minimum level for certain services and reception facilities must apply to all EU Member States."
"We cannot have a situation in which some countries, like my country, Germany, bear a far heavier burden than others."
"This also applies to the area of migrant labour."
"Mrs Reding's report contains some very welcome demands for a differentiated approach involving three groups: refugees, migrant labour and the victims of smuggling networks."
"I would like to thank Mrs Reding on behalf of my group for presenting such a differentiated report."
"With regard to what Mr Pirker said, it is not true that we did not or do not want a report on Eurodac."
"We wanted a report but not the one that Mr Pirker has given us."
"We would have liked to have discussed and adopted a critical report, which is what our voters elected us to do and expect of us."
"When it comes to civil rights and avoiding the same old arguments we have a huge responsibility, even here in the House."
"That is why we rejected his report: because it was not appropriate for this House."
"Mr President, the report by Mrs Reding is both courageous and intelligent and I am pleased to pay tribute to her today."
"I must point out that it follows on from the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency."
"This initially led to some controversy but it also opened a debate that has proved to be quite fruitful."
"The report analyses four key problems."
"The first relates to the right of asylum, its unique characteristics and all the other rights that correspond to it."
"The second involves immigrant labour and the mobility of the labour force."
"The third point highlights the problem of the illegal immigration networks, whilst the fourth deals with the statute for legal immigrants."
"Until now, a certain vagueness surrounded all these concepts, a sense of confusion, which, helped along by ideology - even passion - and demagogy, led to very serious problems."
"I need look no further for proof of this than the words of our colleague Mr Pirker, who just accused the left of caving in to its own supporters."
"I must point out to him that the immigrant supporters are not necessarily the best we can find."
"Secondly, as far as the right of asylum is concerned, it is important to stress that everyone has the right to request asylum and that the Geneva Conventions - the conventions themselves and the additional protocols - which are the founding texts, represent a frame of reference that cannot be violated."
"We need to think very carefully about the proposed replacements, which the report very clearly rejects."
"The report also stresses that there should be minimum standards for the services and reception facilities to which asylum seekers are entitled. It highlights, too, that we need to respect the conventions, speed up procedures and, above all, guarantee the rights of those seeking asylum until a final decision has been taken by the judicial authorities to proceed with deportation."
"Finally, we should pay tribute to the genuine efforts being made to reconcile the judicial proceedings and regulations involved with the human dimension."
"After the ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission will be able to take legislative initiatives."
"If the Commission continues along the same path it has followed until now - and perhaps we should pay tribute to the Commission today, particularly as we do not do so very often at the moment - it should be aware that it will find in Parliament, be it this Parliament or its successor, a reliable and faithful ally."
"Mr President, Parliament previously expressed its support for the Eurodac Convention."
"We were told at the time that it was designed to make it easier to apply the Dublin Convention by offering security both to those seeking asylum, who would be assured that they could apply for asylum in a Member State, and also to the countries themselves, since the system enabled us to prevent multiple applications."
"However, the reasons given by the Council today, to which the rapporteur has just given his support, for extending Eurodac to include certain categories of illegal immigrants through a protocol are far from convincing. We feel that the risk of abuse here is quite considerable."
"Our group therefore hopes that the protocol will be rejected, just as the entire committee hoped that it would be rejected."
"Unfortunately, I do not have time to talk about the excellent reports by Mrs Terrón and Mrs Zimmermann, but I would like to take a moment to look at the report by Mrs Reding."
"I must congratulate her because, although dealing with a very sensitive and controversial subject, she has succeeded in finding compromises on most issues and they are likely to be supported by the vast majority here. At the same time, she has also managed to maintain the fundamental points and principles that I and my group fully supported and that she herself has just explained very clearly."
"We were somewhat concerned about certain aspects of the strategic document presented by the Austrian Presidency and, in our view, it was vital that the report should set out these concerns very clearly."
"The first of these relates to the necessary distinction between the problem of asylum and that of immigration."
"The implications of this are very important, particularly as regards access to the territory of Europe and, thus, access to the procedure put in place for the many people applying for asylum who, for reasons that are very easy to understand, do not have the relevant documents."
"We must not liken these people to illegal immigrants; that would be like riding roughshod over the principle that asylum seekers should not be expelled or returned."
"I am also pleased that the report is very clear on the fact that we must ensure the full and complete application of the Geneva Convention and refuse to accept any attempt to renegotiate it."
"The gaps in the Convention need to be filled, particularly through the creation of a statute on complementary protection, but under no circumstances must we replace the Convention itself. Furthermore, we strongly oppose a policy based on an 'institutional offer' at the discretion of each Member State."
"Another important point is our request for a broad interpretation of the Geneva Convention, particularly as regards taking account of persecution by third parties."
"Parliament has often expressed its view on this issue, yet there has not been the slightest shift in the Council's position or in the measures taken by the Member States."
"Finally, the tragic events we are currently witnessing prove that it was vital to express our disapproval of the fact that the joint actions proposed by the Commission on the temporary protection of displaced persons have been blocked in the Council, and many of the speakers here have mentioned this."
"Commissioner Gradin had hoped to learn from the experience of the Bosnian tragedy, and quite rightly so."
"Unfortunately, the Council's procrastination has meant that the system she is proposing cannot be implemented to help tackle the tragedy in Kosovo, and this does Europe no credit."
"Although the refugees from Kosovo are apparently covered by the Geneva Convention, such massive immigration flows clearly prevent us from considering each case individually in a short period of time and using the normal processes. Temporary protection would undoubtedly be the appropriate instrument in such cases, but without permanently ruling out the possibility of invoking the Geneva Convention."
"I therefore welcome the report by Mrs Reding. However, I would point out that, despite its merits, we are unfortunately left to wonder how effective it will be, as until now the Council has not paid a great deal of attention to the very many consistent recommendations Parliament has made."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is increasingly apparent that the Austrian strategy paper on asylum and immigration in Europe has become the basis for an extremely productive and, above all, necessary discussion."
"It is necessary because asylum and immigration will be communitised with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Even if they are dependent on unanimous Council decisions for the next five years, they will still be removed from the jurisdiction of the Member States and transferred to the Community."
"This means that in the areas of asylum and immigration we must force ourselves to think in Community terms, and that is the task of this Parliament."
"I would like to focus on one point here."
"I believe that we in Europe and here in the European Parliament must answer one question very clearly, a question that is fundamental to this whole discussion: generally speaking, do we in Europe want to take in immigrants or not?"
"And here I am not talking about political refugees."
"There is absolutely no question that these are to be taken in, a point which cannot seriously be disputed by anyone."
"I am not talking either about civil war refugees, other quota refugees or family reunification."
"I am discussing only the basic issue of whether we in Europe wish to take in immigrants, as we are occasionally asked to do."
"Here I would say, ladies and gentlemen, that Europe is not an immigration area like the United States was in the last century and possibly still is today, or like Australia, New Zealand, Canada or any other countries which desperately sought people to fill up their space."
"We are not in that situation: on the contrary, we have 20 million unemployed."
"As a result of this we have no choice but to restrict immigration."
"I would like to emphasise once again that I am not talking about asylum and related issues but only about immigration, and particularly illegal immigration."
"In my view it is irresponsible to reject the Eurodac Convention when we consider that 80 % of illegal immigrants are victims of trafficking networks that cynically exploit the misery and suffering of these people."
"One of the things that is needed in order to put a stop to their activities is the signing of the Eurodac Convention."
"Those who reject is are playing straight into the hands of the smuggling networks by voting against it."
"Please consider this."
"On the subject of asylum we are essentially in agreement."
"Everyone here is in favour of granting asylum to the victims of political persecution."
"We now need to settle the matter of the procedure."
"Should all asylum seekers in Europe have an individual procedure or must we resign ourselves to considering institutional guarantees?"
"I believe that speedy processing is particularly in the interest of applicants for asylum."
"For this reason we must open up this second possibility."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I took great pleasure in listening to Mrs Reding presenting her report."
"I must say that there is nothing I would have put differently, especially when I have in my hand two pages of conclusions reached during the meeting of justice and foreign affairs ministers in Luxembourg last week."
"One might ask oneself whether this is really the outcome of a conference attended by 15 ministers: an expression of thanks to Albania and a statement to the effect that we are prepared to provide protection for refugees from the Kosovo region."
"Is this the level of solidarity we are able to display in Europe?"
"We are capable of action when 2 000 Kurds are knocking at our doors, but not when hundreds of thousands of people are suffering."
"We have a collective responsibility for the tens of thousands of people who have vanished and for those who will probably die of starvation."
"It is now up to all those countries that have talked about a European identity and the importance of solidarity to do something in the present situation."
"I also have to say that today I am ashamed of being Finnish."
"We have a prime minister who might very well not have seen on television over Easter or even be aware of the anxiety and suffering in Kosovo."
"I apologise for being Finnish, but I am nevertheless pleased that our government has at last done something, since that is what people want."
"Our solidarity is being put to the test."
"We must hold our ground in the European Parliament."
"In particular, we must stand firm over the proposal relating to a European fund for refugees and for increased Community resources directed at those in need."
"Mr President, so far the EU's policy on refugees has consisted solely of restrictive measures."
"The Dublin Convention and Eurodac should also be viewed in the same light."
"In practical terms, moreover, the Schengen Agreement has played a major role in generally making it more difficult for asylum seekers to persuade the EU authorities to look into their reasons for requesting asylum."
"EU policy bears the stamp of repression and police involvement, which in turn explains - or very largely explains - the growing influx of illegal immigrants and refugees."
"What is required instead is, above all, a shared responsibility throughout the whole of Europe, and not just in the EU, for those who need protection."
"We also need rules based on the UN Convention on the status of refugees to ensure that they are well treated."
"In addition, there should be a means of guaranteeing the rights of those who are legally resident within the EU, for example their right to be able to move around freely within the Union."
"Eurodac is central to the system devised under the Dublin Convention for applying the principle of the first country of asylum."
"This principle has numerous shortcomings, as does Eurodac itself."
"The principle of the first country of asylum is currently being applied, in spite of the fact that the Member States acknowledge that differences exist between asylum seekers."
"The principle is irrational and may well lead to arbitrary decisions being made."
"Secondly, there is also an obvious danger of the Eurodac register expanding and being abused."
"And thirdly, fingerprinting infringes the integrity of the person and should only be done where it is genuinely necessary."
"Today's proposal on Eurodac should therefore be rejected in its present form."
"I should also like to say a few words about the Reding report concerning the strategy paper on migration and asylum policy."
"Last year, the Austrian Presidency put forward an exceptionally cynical proposal regarding the EU's future asylum policy."
"It constituted what amounts to a frontal attack on the foundations of a humane asylum policy."
"Consequently, I welcome the fact that, on a number of important points, Mrs Reding disagrees with the proposal, particularly in her defence of the Geneva Convention and the role of the UNHCR."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the increasingly restrictive measures that we have been discussing and unfortunately adopting for years are always claimed by the Right in this House not to be restricting refugee policy but merely combating abuse."
"It was against this background that we created a regulation concerning third countries which is clearly contrary to the Geneva Convention but also does not do anything to combat abuse."
"It was against this background that we removed persecution by non-state violence from the grounds for recognising refugee status."
"It was against this background that the Austrian Presidency's strategy paper on refugees ultimately came into being, which represents a clear attack on the Geneva Convention."
"But even if these Members really were only concerned with abuse and not, as Mr Nassauer said, with the actual refugees, then today we have come to the moment of truth, Mr Pirker, Mr Nassauer: today 200 000 people are fleeing Kosovo, and they are being denied refugee status in violation of the Geneva Convention."
"Why do you not stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention, which clearly provides protection for people who are persecuted for ethnic reasons, be observed?"
"Then stand up and demand that the Geneva Convention be observed and that these people be granted refugee status!"
"Mr President, I too must compliment Viviane Reding on a particularly humane and balanced report, but I am sure she will not take it amiss if I say here that it is particularly cynical for the European Parliament to be discussing today a strategy paper from the presidency on asylum and migration policy, at a time when hundreds of thousands of people are being driven out of Kosovo, deported, are stuck in the mud in refugee camps, locked up even, or being driven back into Kosovo."
"It is cynical to be talking of a strategy which should result in a common approach of the Union at the autumn summit in Tampere, when the Council meeting in Luxembourg could not even agree a joint strategy for the admission of refugees in one of the biggest humanitarian disasters which Europe has even seen."
"I find it shameful that the European Union, which is wealthy and prosperous, merely salves its conscience by giving a few tens of millions of euros in aid to the region."
"In all honesty, Commissioner, I cannot understand either the stance expressed by Mrs Bonino on behalf of the Commission that she was against settling refugees in the European Union."
"Of course it is good to keep people in their own area, always provided it can be done in decent conditions."
"But the television pictures and the reports from humanitarian organisations have shown us clearly that this is not possible, that the countries bordering on Kosovo are, moreover, too poor and too unstable to be able to cope with this influx appropriately."
"The political reluctance shown by some Member States of the Union is disgraceful too."
"Nevertheless, this strategy document says quite clearly that the European Commission's proposals for acceptance of refugees, which have been on the table for two years already, as Mr Wiebenga rightly pointed out, must be approved as speedily as possible."
"So I think this debate should prompt us to urge the Council once again - and forcefully - to conclude an agreement without delay on collective action on refugees and on a statute giving them guaranteed rights and protection."
"If the 15 cannot manage this, Commissioner, I am convinced that those Member States which do wish to cooperate will have to conclude an agreement on how to deal with refugees - a kind of humanitarian Schengen, if I can call it that."
"I am not at all pro-Schengen, but in this case it seems to me to be absolutely the right course."
"Finally, I should like to raise another point which is terribly important both in Mrs Reding's report and in the crisis in Kosovo."
"I refer to the reuniting of families."
"Every day on television we see the tragedy of families which have become separated, of children, men and women who cannot find each other."
"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives everyone the right to live in a family."
"That right must be upheld for refugees and displaced persons too."
"That right must be guaranteed by the Union for refugees from Kosovo and for any other asylum seeker or refugee."
"I think we urgently need to revise and add to the Dublin agreement on this point."
"The yawning gap which divides the few good proposals contained in the strategy paper and European dithering in this area - I have no other word for it - shows that it will really take a miracle if we are to achieve anything specific at Tampere."
"I hope the Commission will show perseverance and I hope Parliament will continue to be involved in preparing policy, because the Council gives the impression of having to protect Europe against the refugees, rather than wanting to protect the refugees themselves."
"Mr President, Viviane Reding has drawn up an excellent report and we must point out that she was particularly sensitive with those of us who participated in the debate and very receptive to all our contributions."
"When talking about immigration, in my view, there are two key elements: solidarity and the human dimension of the problem."
"Solidarity is important because every human being, irrespective of nationality, sex or religion, has the right to a decent life and to sufficient resources to enable him to survive."
"We cannot understand immigration if we are only concerned about our own borders, our own welfare or our own geostrategic interests."
"The human dimension also requires considerable efforts on the part of the Member States if it is to be reconciled with the legislation needed to regulate the entry and exit of third-country nationals or a period of residence in our countries by those who are seeking work, refuge or asylum from persecution in their own countries. We must finally introduce a common policy to regulate the administrative and judicial procedures involved."
"This policy must allow us to pursue and sentence those who exploit human beings. It must also help us to ensure that the most fundamental rights of any immigrants in our countries, be they legal or illegal, will be respected, even in instances where they have to be expelled or returned to their country of origin."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not only the responsibility of the European Union."
"It is also up to the countries from which the immigrants come to strive to make the most of the human and material resources they have available, that is, both their own resources and those provided by the European Union in the form of assistance. They must also become more democratic and guarantee respect for their citizens' rights."
"Mr President, first let me congratulate the four rapporteurs involved in this joint debate on migration, asylum and refugees: Mrs Zimmermann, Mrs Terrón i Cusi, Mrs Reding and Mr Pirker."
"It is impossible for me in three minutes to discuss adequately the details of these four complex reports, ranging from early warning systems for illegal immigration to integration of refugees, from migration policy to fingerprinting applicants for asylum."
"Instead I will try to touch on a number of principles which I believe should be the basis for the policy that we pursue in all of these areas."
"First let me say that the European Union must have the ability to make choices as to the immigration policy it wishes to pursue."
"With a borderless Europe these choices can only be made together, rather than separately."
"Our current policy limits immigration to a few cases of family reunion, plus some German and Greeks from the former Soviet Union who are entering their own countries."
"Provided that, in the future, such policies are arrived at in a non-racist way, by open and democratic debate, then I can support them."
"Secondly, we need to make it clear that asylum seekers and refugees are not immigrants."
"Sometimes this is an issue that is confused."
"Our responsibility with regard to their applications for asylum or for refugee status go further than with respect to immigration."
"It is inhuman for us to send people back to face torture, physical abuse and death."
"Of course some individuals will try to abuse the system - just like Members of the European Parliament! - I do not see that refugees and asylum seekers are any different."
"I have no problem, therefore, in supporting measures to prevent multiple applications."
"My problem is a different one: I will not repeat my colleagues' comments, particularly those from the Socialist Group, on what is happening in Kosovo but I will reiterate a point I made in an earlier debate."
"Some years ago Member States of the European Union were refusing applications for asylum from those courageous individuals in Serbia who had refused to be conscripted to join in ethnic cleansing."
"That crime may well have contributed to the larger crimes being carried out against the Kosovo Albanians while we speak."
"The refusal rate is not a measure of need, but a measure of failure of will and courage by Member States who are refusing to recognise that the level of valid applications may well be substantially above the level of those currently granted either permanent or temporary leave to remain."
"Thirdly and finally, within the Union we have four million black Europeans and 12 to 14 million third country nationals."
"We have a responsibility to ensure not only that all citizens have the same rights and same duties within the European Union but so do all residents."
"It is only then that we can build the kind of Europe that I would like to see."
"Mr President, it is not easy to round off this debate as the most important issues have already been discussed repeatedly."
"In the previous debate, I said that we are at a stage where European public opinion is very much aware that it wants Europe to be more than just a market; it wants Europe to be a project for civilization."
"And the best way of seeing exactly what we want Europe to be is by looking at how we present ourselves, how we present our internal environment to those who knock on our door, be they immigrants, those seeking asylum or refuge, or displaced persons."
"That is why today's reports are so important."
"I would like to stress one aspect that has already been mentioned, but that, in my view, has perhaps not received the attention it deserves, namely, the legal framework."
"Parliament often tends to be proactive here."
"I believe that the legal framework is our safeguard and our responsibility."
"It represents the defence of the weakest, in other words those who, in this case, are seeking asylum."
"It is Parliament's responsibility to defend it as far as possible."
"As I said before, we must interpret the Treaty of Amsterdam as broadly and as boldly as we can, yet we must not go beyond its framework. If that is not sufficient, then we must hold an intergovernmental conference to revise the Treaty."
"What we do not want to see in this process of European integration that we all desire is a violation of the Treaty, through the back door and by means of concrete measures."
"Two specific questions remain in relation to the reports."
"As far as the Eurodac report is concerned, we are now waiting to see what approach the Commission regulation takes under the new legal bases. We must also recognise that at this stage the political focus of the document is incomplete."
"It does not contain all of Parliament's beliefs and wishes, nor, I am sure, does it include all that the Commission hopes for."
"This must be resolved so that it does not appear as if this is our position on Eurodac."
"As regards Mrs Reding's report, which is very important, extremely interesting and comprehensive, I would merely like to take these last 30 seconds to highlight the issue of respect for the legal framework, which I have already mentioned."
"Mrs Reding has reached an interesting compromise between our desire to stretch the Treaty to its limits and ensuring that we do not go too far and allow it to snap."
"Mr President, I find the debate unrealistic and rather hypocritical."
"What is real is the challenge presented by hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo."
"What is real, Madam Commissioner, is the scandalous meeting held by the Council of Ministers, at which it recently decided not to bear the costs of relieving the refugees' suffering, and to place the burden on neighbouring countries. However, these countries are unable to assume this burden, either economically, politically or socially."
"The destabilisation of these countries is beginning to unfold, and when this happens the Council and, I imagine, the Commission too, will not have the legal basis to help there either."
"They told us hypocritically that they want the refugees to stay in the area, so as not to send the wrong political message to Mr Milosevic."
"Just hark at that!"
"In other words, the messages sent by the missiles and the bombs are not enough?"
"Will the refugees become messages too?"
"Shame!"
"Or are our leaders anticipating a swift solution to the crisis? Judging by the credibility of their forecasts thus far..."
"What can I say! Dark vistas are opening up for the refugees and for the neighbouring countries!"
"This debate, Madam Commissioner, could become less unrealistic if both Parliament and the Commission found a way to call on the Council urgently on whatever legal basis to immediately re-examine its position, which is unacceptable and befitting of Pontius Pilate."
"As for the rest, dealing with this at intergovernmental level and within the Community, and all the things that have been quite correctly said here, we can examine them in the future."
"The present is here and it is posing a multitude of threats."
"Mr President, one of last year's most important initiatives was the Austrian proposal concerning immigration and asylum policy, which triggered a much-needed debate both in the Council of Ministers and in this House."
"Mrs Reding also attaches great importance to the initiative in her report."
"I share her view that immigration and asylum should be treated as separate issues and, furthermore, this was one of the aspects I raised when the Austrian Presidency submitted its first draft."
"I also agree with the rapporteur that immigration should not be regarded as a problem; it can be an asset, and is a natural part of the life of the international community."
"It is something we must learn to understand, accept and deal with."
"At the present time, the rules on immigration vary from one country to another."
"The Commission has therefore submitted a proposal for closer approximation of the rules."
"Amongst other things, we have raised the issue of the fundamental rights of immigrants, particularly as regards their access to the European labour market."
"Naturally, I am hoping for strong support from the Council of Ministers, as well as from Parliament."
"For my own part, the situation of immigrants in the community is the most crucial element."
"As Mr Ford has said, this concerns the living conditions of some ten million people who have been residing legally in our Member States for many years."
"Some clear political signals are therefore required."
"In addition, the battle against illegal immigration must be stepped up."
"So long as immigration is subject to regulation, people will try to circumvent the mechanisms of control."
"This has led to the existence of a large-scale market in the smuggling of human beings."
"It also lies behind the proposal for a system for rapidly exchanging information on illegal immigration, which Mrs Terrón i Cusí deals with in her report."
"I regard this proposal as an important part of our efforts to effectively tackle the cynical practice of trafficking in women for sexual purposes which is taking place throughout Europe."
"It is especially important that such a system should also include all the Central and Eastern European countries."
"During the past year, we have seen far too many women from those countries, who are being exploited in this way, on the streets and in the brothels of our capital cities."
"Ever since I first arrived in Brussels, I have been striving to get this issue onto the EU's agenda."
"The problem is that we have only a limited knowledge of the details of people smuggling, and in particular of what is actually taking place in the countries of origin."
"A system for exchanging information such as that described in the resolution would represent a considerable step forward."
"We need to be able to find out more quickly, for example, when new illegal smuggling organisations are discovered in the countries of origin."
"Our knowledge of smuggling tactics and methods, as well as the routes used, also needs to be improved."
"From the report, it is clear that Mrs Terrón i Cusí would prefer the Commission to be responsible for managing an information system of this kind."
"I appreciate her confidence."
"The Commission's role in the area of migration policy will be increased in the next few years with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"In the short term, however, it is essential to ensure that the work continues as quickly as possible."
"The 1951 Geneva Convention provides a sound basis for a common refugee policy."
"At the same time, the convention will soon be celebrating its half century."
"The world has changed in the intervening years, and the refugee situation with it."
"Many of those who need protection today do not fulfil the criteria established during the cold war era."
"Moreover, we are increasingly being confronted by refugee crises on a massive scale which flare up quickly."
"Other, supplementary instruments are therefore now required."
"The need for protection should always take precedence over formal rules."
"The refugee crisis which we are now witnessing in Kosovo is merely the latest tragic example."
"On countless occasions during the past four and a half years, I have called in vain for Europe to equip itself with new asylum instruments to supplement the Geneva Convention in precisely this kind of situation."
"Moreover, I have launched several initiatives to bring such instruments into existence: one on temporary protection, another on burden sharing, and a third that would increase the effectiveness of the asylum process."
"I appreciate the support which I have had from this House for the last initiative."
"On the other hand, the Council of Ministers withdrew its support when the members saw its actual implications."
"Nor have we made much progress on temporary shelter or burden sharing."
"I am convinced that Europe will continue to shoulder its responsibilities as regards the crisis in Kosovo."
"Last week's special ministerial meeting also gave a clear indication in this respect."
"Already, a massive effort is under way to help the whole region to cope with the hundreds of thousands of refugees who now find themselves in Albania, FYROM and Montenegro."
"Moreover, further help is on the way, both from the Member States and the Commission."
"The Member States have also, in different ways, expressed their willingness to receive refugees in their own countries if no other alternative is available."
"At the same time, it is worrying that we have not learned anything from our costly experiences in the war in Bosnia."
"The war in Kosovo has shown yet again that Europe must equip itself with a coordinated refugee policy."
"Another important aspect concerns the integration of refugees into the community."
"Mrs Zimmermann, in her report, lays great stress on an integrated approach."
"I totally agree with that."
"The Commission has submitted two separate proposals: one to encourage the reception and repatriation of asylum seekers and refugees and another on integration."
"The rapporteur questions this approach."
"I share her basic viewpoint, but since the Amsterdam Treaty has not yet entered into force, there was no practicable alternative."
"I might also mention that the German Presidency, in its conclusions resulting from last week's ministerial meeting, decided that the Commission should revise the section relating to the reception and repatriation of asylum seekers and refugees in order to make use of the EU's release of EUR 15 million for the refugee crisis in Kosovo."
"I have already approved the original proposal, and I have the support of my colleagues for tomorrow's meeting of the Commission."
"I also assume that I have the support of the Council of Ministers, as well as of this House."
"We should also hold a joint discussion, at the earliest opportunity, on whether this amount is in fact proportionate to the level of need."
"For the rest, I note that as regards the proceedings of the committee, Mrs Zimmermann takes the view that they should be as simple as possible."
"I wholeheartedly agree with that."
"Finally, let me say a few words about the Pirker report and Eurodac, the European system for the comparison of fingerprints."
"It is very important to have such a system in place."
"It is a precondition for the application, as envisaged, of the principle of the first country of asylum and the provisions of the Dublin Convention."
"As you know, the Council of Ministers has now finalised the wording of Eurodac and asked the Commission to revise the proposal so that it is in accordance with the terms of the new Treaty."
"The intention is therefore to wait until the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force, and in this way to strengthen both the democratic and legislative control."
"All the issues we deal with in the area of justice and home affairs affect European citizens in their daily lives."
"In a sense, it is paradoxical that internal European cooperation, which has the greatest impact on people's lives, is something they know least about."
"The introduction of more openness and transparency in our working methods would be a way of changing this."
"Another way would be to ensure that we can arrive at some concrete decisions on certain key migration issues."
"People should be able to see that what we are doing is having some effect."
"A good deal of political will is also needed if we are to make the right decisions during the coming year."
"I therefore regret that the requirement for unanimity will continue for the next five years."
"It is certainly true that cooperation in this area is still a sensitive issue, particularly with regard to immigration policy."
"Therefore, a very important task for the coming years is to ensure that there is sufficient confidence in the EU's efforts in that area to allow the introduction of qualified majority voting to become a possibility."
"Furthermore, we must give the concepts of freedom, security and justice enshrined in the Amsterdam Treaty a clear and precise meaning."
"The Tampere summit in the autumn will therefore be a milestone."
"Parliament also has a very important mission to perform."
"Clear signals must be given on the direction which European immigration and asylum policy needs to take."
"I also think that the two debates we have had tonight have been valuable in illustrating how important that is."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Electronic interchange of data between administrations (IDA)"
"Mr President, this piece of work has a very long title for a project which is about the benefits of electronic transmission of data between administrations within the European Union."
"It really is a success story, showing the citizens of the European Union how decisions taken on their behalf and the implementation of those decisions can be made much more transparent and readily identifiable."
"Two or three projects are always quoted and are worth repeating: one is the work of the Medicines Evaluation Agency in London; another is the project about helping people in the European Union find information about job vacancies right the way across the European Union; and the third is a scheme concerning early contra-indications of toxic substances and drugs that can be dangerous to young people in particular."
"The projects had their early teething troubles."
"At this stage I wish to pay tribute to the work of the Commission officials with whom I have had many discussions; between us we have put a great deal of effort into addressing many of these problems."
"However, the work I am presenting to you here this evening is about ensuring that some of the early difficulties and the unnecessary duplication of efforts and compatibility problems are well on the way to solution."
"There are also some issues concerning implementation."
"I wish to stress that it is very important not only that each particular scheme has the benefit of electronic means of exchange of data but also that the methodology involved in each project can be transferred in its turn to other projects and is not just a one-off."
"I hope that the comparatively small number of amendments from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy will meet with your approval."
"I have no hesitation in commending both reports to you."
"I should also like to draw attention to the updates in the reports produced by the IDA team, which provide a very valuable reference base of examples of how the work of the European Union institutions is bringing real benefits to the citizens of the European Union."
"We have an unusual problem this evening in that we are running very much ahead of ourselves."
"Mrs Peijs is not here yet."
"The Commissioner due to respond was Mr Monti who, I understand, is still somewhere above the earth in an aeroplane."
"However, Mrs Gradin is going to manfully stand in."
"Mr President, I shall try to be Commissioner Monti for a few minutes."
"In December 1997 the Commission presented its proposals for a second phase of the IDA programme."
"Those two proposals have the objective to establish interoperable telematic networks in support of interinstitutional communication and the implementation of Community policies and activities."
"In this second phase of the IDA programme, the Commission proposes to shift the focus from building infrastructure to coordination and support, with special regard to improving cost efficiency."
"Thus, for instance, IDA projects will now benefit from generic telematic services acquired from the market."
"These ideas have been fully endorsed by both the European Parliament and the Council in the first reading."
"The Commission has already expressed its satisfaction that the Council has incorporated a majority of Parliament's amendments in the first reading."
"Moreover, the Commission accepted both common positions and recommended their rapid adoption."
"In this second reading the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy proposes two amendments to the decision on guidelines and one amendment to the decision on interoperability measures."
"These are based on amendments that the Council declined in the first reading."
"However, the Commission believes that the formulation now proposed by the European Parliament not only would refine the political priorities of the IDA programme and increase its transparency but also could be expected to remove the objections raised by the Council in the first reading."
"I am therefore pleased to announce that the Commission accepts all three amendments proposed by the European Parliament in the second reading."
"Let me thank you once again and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Read, for the constructive attitude with which Parliament has received these proposals of the Commission."
"I am confident that, with your support, political agreement with the Council will soon be achieved and we will be able to resume this important task without delay."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The sitting was suspended from 8.30 p.m. until 9.15 p.m."
"Liability for payment of VAT"
"I should first like to inform the House that Mr Monti has probably already landed and is likely to arrive at any moment."
"We have resumed an extra 15 minutes later to enable him to take part in the debate."
"The next item is the report (A4-0174/99) by Mr Harrison, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the determination of the person liable for payment of value added tax (COM(98)0660 - C4-0705/98-98/0312(CNS))."
"Madam President, the purpose of the Commission proposal to amend the 1997 Directive determining the person liable for payment of VAT is to simplify the current very complicated system."
"It is raised under the SLIM proposals, whose object is to make access to the single European market easier, especially for SMEs."
"The underlying principle guiding the Commission proposal is to identify the person responsible for VAT, where companies are operating in more than one EU state, as the person who performs the taxable transaction, irrespective of whether he or she is established within the country where the transaction takes place."
"It should further be noted that the proposal is interim in nature."
"The Commission still fully intends to move to a definitive system of VAT collection and liability based on the principle of a single place of taxation."
"Also, attached to this proposal, is the separate, but very welcome, idea of tackling the problem of VAT tax avoidance related to the supply of continuous products like gas or electricity."
"Here it is proposed that tax should be charged on an annual basis where there are no pre-established successive statements of account."
"So far, so good, but this is where the problems begin."
"This delay of the definitive VAT regime is regrettable in itself but even more frustrating for the SMEs, which we want to be active participants in the single market, is the introduction of an interim system which seems as confusing as its predecessor."
"That is why I have asked the Commission, to no avail, to quantify the problem and, in addition, to set out a strategy and timetable for this interim regime before the definitive system is introduced."
"Why is the Commission so reluctant to do this?"
"Secondly, as rapporteur, I am alarmed to learn from the Commission details of their consultation with the small business community on the proposal."
"Why, for instance, did the Commission consult SMEs from only seven Member States?"
"Furthermore, was the Commission not concerned to learn that one in three SMEs thought the present proposal might lengthen, not slash, VAT red tape."
"Perhaps the Commission might reply to these points this evening, if it arrives on time."
"Thirdly, the reverse charges system which keeps intact the principle of fraction payments should not in itself be over-used or abused."
"Nevertheless, the abundance of exceptions allowed seems to deny the principle of simplifying, not complicating, the interim system."
"Incidentally, I have still not received an explanation from the Commission why lawyers, consultancy bureaus and agents concerned with the transport of goods qualify as exceptions able to use the reverse charges system."
"Why these and not others?"
"I think we should be told."
"Fourthly, the mutual assistance facility provided to SMEs to help them pole-vault over some of the recognised barriers to the market has itself been found to be unused and hence ineffective."
"What has the Commission to say about this?"
"Fifthly, I should like the Commission to clarify its position vis-à-vis NGOs which persistently lose valuable income because they are penalised by a system that frequently leaves them high and dry with irrecoverable VAT."
"Finally, is the Commission prepared to deal with the outrageous practice whereby SMEs operating in Belgium and in other Member States are obliged in fulfilling current requirements for identifying their VAT tax responsibilities, to lodge financial guarantees with local banks, thereby absorbing valuable resources which cause mortal cash flow problems and which inhibit many such SMEs from entering the market"
"I would like to pause here and thank my colleague Mr Rübig for his two amendments which I accept."
"They are aimed at helping the SME sector although I realise that we are adding to the exceptions I have already talked about."
"This Commission proposal seeks to help business succeed in the single market."
"Its aspiration is fine but its application is suspect."
"I hope the Commission can reassure Parliament on all the concerns I have raised tonight in my report and I hope the Commissioner who has been unable to listen to the arguments I have set out - it seems rather purposeless when he is not here - will be able to respond to those specific points."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by saying that our group broadly shares the arguments put forward by the rapporteur, to whom we are grateful for his work in this important field."
"We particularly welcome all the measures which facilitate the work of SMEs, in keeping with the SLIM exercise which lies behind some of the proposals now before us."
"We also welcome the pressure being brought to bear for a re-examination of the question of NGOs, so as to devise rules better suited to their activities, rather than imposing on them a seemingly unjustifiable fiscal regime subjecting them to irrecoverable VAT."
"Our group came out against Amendment No 7, and I should now like to explain why."
"In our opinion, the wording of this amendment is somewhat complicated: it covers various bodies, such as NGOs, which should have been handled separately."
"In other words, we are afraid that - although several references are made to the definitive system, which we wish to see introduced as soon as possible - to lay down rules facilitating the transition without establishing a precise timetable is in fact a kind of pretext for postponing again and again a decision which should be taken as soon as possible."
"The House, and Mr Harrison in particular, will recall that my own report on this subject called for a specific deadline: admittedly it was a little over-ambitious, but it was at least specific."
"Unfortunately, the House rejected that proposal by just a few votes, most notably those of Mr Harrison and his group."
"In conclusion, our group will vote in favour of all the amendments, albeit with two recommendations: firstly, that the Commission should take up our line of reasoning, Amendment No 7 in particular, so as to streamline and clarify the text; secondly, that our request for a swift transition to the definitive VAT system should be reflected somehow, by setting a deadline or by giving strong arguments for the continued postponement."
"Amendments Nos 8 and 9, with which we agree - because there could be simpler ways of providing guarantees than those envisaged - would, for instance, become redundant if the definitive system were introduced."
"Finally, we can endorse all Mr Harrison's arguments during this interim phase; let us vow to move ahead as rapidly as possible, and then many of these problems will cease to exist."
"Madam President, I want to congratulate Mr Harrison on the presentation of his report."
"The present system of VAT is so designed that the tax receipt is directly collected by the Member States on whose territory the consumption of the goods or services sold is deemed to take place."
"In order to ensure this direct allocation of the tax, complex rules have been laid down."
"Traders who wish to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the advent of the single market on 1 January 1993 usually perceive the need to fulfil tax obligations in several Member States as a barrier to the free movement of goods and services."
"The internal market could not operate in a productive manner unless more user-friendly rules were implemented at national and European level in the area of tax collection."
"In May 1997 the Commission proposed that VAT collection be included in the second phase of the SLIM programme."
"Following this recommendation the Commission undertook to introduce legislation to simplify tax representation."
"A panel of experts was also employed to advise the European Union on these various tax matters."
"I welcome the efforts being made by the Union to simplify the tax regime in the area of VAT."
"The Sixth VAT Directive allows traders who carry out taxable transactions in a given country to be the person liable to pay tax to the appropriate authorities."
"However, the main features of the present legislation, as regards the determination of the persons liable for the payment of tax, are extremely complex and there is a wide difference in its actual proposed applications due to the many different tax options which are available to the Member States in addressing this issue."
"In conclusion, I support the broad thrust of these measures but there is clearly more work to be done in simplifying the area of tax across the Union."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this report by Mr Harrison is an important step that will allow us to further simplify VAT legislation by means of the rules governing the legislation on VAT representation and on mutual assistance on recovery."
"I feel that these points are of particular importance for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"We already know that the VAT system has many different legal bases in the European Union."
"In my opinion Amendment No 6 is a typical example of how the system can be simplified, for instance in the case of goods installed, so that simplifications can also be made in this area."
"Unfortunately, Mr Monti has not yet arrived."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Taxation of energy products"
"The next item is the second report (A4-0171/99) by Mr Cox, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a Council Directive on restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products (COM(97)0030 - C4-0155/97-97/0111(CNS))."
"Madam President, I regret that Commissioner Monti is not here, not because I want to make a pedantic point about his absence, but rather because I would have liked to say this to him personally and have it put on the record in the House."
"But even in his absence I am happy to do so."
"He is one of a number of Commissioners in the present caretaker college whose resignation because of circumstances not to do with himself I deeply regret."
"He has performed his European public function commendably and I would like to put that on the record."
"I do not know whether in the future he is likely to be renominated or redesignated but in any event he is one of the many innocent victims of the fall-out of recent events and I would like to record that on my own behalf."
"For those colleagues who are here I have little to add to what I said several weeks ago."
"In substance the report before us is based on the Commission's proposal, which is itself a useful proposal."
"In terms of Parliament's approach to it I hope we vote 'yes' to new taxes, but 'no' to more taxes."
"In other words we want to see the tax base expand through the energy tax, but we want to state clearly and politically to the Commission and to the Council that we would like to see offsets of this new expanded energy tax base being recycled into lowering the tax wedge, the tax cost and labour."
"That is the reason we support this; it is not the only reason but a major reason."
"To those who look at structural unemployment problems in the European Union and who condemn the high levels of unemployment but who refuse to contemplate, through their votes in this House, a broadening of the tax base in areas such as energy, I would say: could they please tell us on the record where will we find the alternative resources to address the tax crisis in a number of states to do with structural problems and unemployment."
"My second general point: this proposal should not be exaggerated."
"It is modest but useful."
"However, in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs it is riddled with too many exceptions."
"We support the Monti proposal but we want a greener Monti proposal."
"We support some exceptions but we want the emphasis on green exceptions."
"With regard to tax rates, as before we propose not a complex system of coming back on the question every so many years, but an accelerator principle to be subject to review potentially every five years."
"We recognise that in some firms and sectors the energy cost may be very high as a proportion of total cost and for such firms and such sectors we need a mechanism to recognise and address the competitive handicap."
"We believe that competitive handicap can be addressed by allowing Member States some degree of discretion, but in my view it should be subject to Commission review."
"There is an amendment tomorrow to that effect, specifying how the Commission might review requests from sectors and Member States who plead a special case, and that amendment should be adopted, because this should not be used as a carte blanche simply to ignore the tax."
"In summary, we support a new energy and eco-tax system but we do not support more taxes per se ."
"In other words, we demand fiscal neutrality."
"We insist that the price of introducing this is that we lower labour taxes."
"We want a simpler and more certain tax- based definition."
"We want a more predictable base-deepening formula through an accelerator principle to determine the evolution of tax rates, given the new tax base."
"We want competitive handicap to be recognised and addressed but only where that is genuine and not simply a carte blanche to ignore the tax altogether."
"If that happens - and I hope it will happen in the vote - then I will recommend to colleagues that this is a report worth supporting."
"Last time out, Madam President, we narrowly missed getting a majority."
"That arose partly through a misunderstanding of some of the detail."
"I hope there will be no misunderstandings tomorrow and indeed that some of the sceptics might re-read the report in substance and realise it is the way of the future."
"I therefore commend the report to the House."
"Mr Monti has just arrived."
"I can only tell you, Commissioner, that Mr Cox has just had some very kind words to say about you, but perhaps you will be able to read them afterwards in our verbatim report of proceedings!"
"Madam President, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, I would like to say that, in general, we agree with the three objectives put forward by the Commission in this directive: harmonising taxes, reducing emissions by increasing costs, and using this revenue to reduce social charges."
"However, this is not very well planned, Mr Cox. Do you know what kind of a reduction we would see in the emission of pollutants, particularly CO2 , if we were to increase prices, as you propose?"
"We would not even see a reduction of 1 %."
"We are making too great a fuss over something that will provide very few results."
"Furthermore, we are currently trying to lower the price of electricity and gas through the liberalisation of the markets because energy in Europe is expensive and it is very difficult for us to compete with Japan and the United States."
"We are trying to do everything at once but this is not the time for that."
"We must do one thing at a time."
"In any case, the amendments you are proposing will produce an increase in charges."
"Nevertheless, according to the economic studies carried out by the Commission's advisers, 150 000 jobs would be created and a 1 % reduction in CO2 emissions achieved."
"It is true that the macroeconomic effects would be minor - neither inflation nor the deficit would rise a great deal - but at the moment our countries are all committed to their stability programmes."
"In other words, I do not believe that your report is very timely, although this does not mean that I do not think that it is a good report."
"I do not feel that this is the right time for it, nor is it the right time for the Commission's proposal."
"I am sorry to say that our group will not be supporting your amendments, Mr Cox."
"Indeed, if this report is voted through, it will be quite unrealistic since it achieves very little."
"In any event, you and I can be assured that progress will be made in this area in the future. But perhaps this is not the right time for it or the right time to introduce new taxes."
"You say 'no new taxes' and you are right."
"But this should also apply to energy, since it is already very highly taxed in Europe."
"Madam President, Mr Cox's report was good and is now better."
"It deserves our support, as does Commissioner Monti."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Cox, as we said before when discussing this report, our position has not altered since Mr Cox's position has not altered in his report."
"At the time, we put forward our analysis of the Commission's proposal, which indicated that it was perhaps overly ambitious."
"It hopes to achieve three objectives through a single set of rules, and we all know that the effectiveness of a set of rules is normally inversely proportional to the number of objectives it has."
"As Mrs Estevan Bolea pointed out, the three objectives are quite ambitious and Mr Cox's report tries to help us understand the exceptions and how they will be applied. This is difficult to achieve with a set of fiscal rules that are actually designed to extend the scope of the tax."
"In cases where new scope is defined for fiscal rules, such as VAT, there are many very detailed exceptions."
"We are talking here about rules proposed by the Commission that increase the excise duty on oil products and increase taxation on energy products."
"These are complicated rules and they also seek to meet environmental objectives that are difficult to achieve or that entail massive marginal costs, as Mrs Estevan Bolea explained. Moreover, there is no certainty as to the fiscal neutrality of the rules, or at least we have not been able to find it anywhere."
"We therefore have no guarantees that the rules will be fiscally neutral."
"We believe that Mr Cox has tried to simplify the exceptions, but we do not agree with this as we believe that it would be very difficult for the Commission to manage."
"We are back to the famous method of giving the Commission, via the Member States, countless individual cases and authorisations to deal with according to the level of energy consumption, and so on."
"Nonetheless, we do believe that there have to be some rules. And, as Mrs Estevan Bolea mentioned, we will eventually have to do something."
"Perhaps we will have to divide up the objectives into various sets of rules and simplify the application of the ones we are discussing. Their objectives are commendable, but we believe that it would be extremely difficult to work towards them at this present moment in time."
"As a result, Mr Cox, we will maintain the same position tomorrow as we did a few weeks ago, since, as far as we can see, the substance of your report has not changed in any way and, therefore, the Commission proposal has not been altered."
"Madam President, Mr Cox has collaborated in producing a report which creates a sound basis for a review of energy taxation, for which I thank him sincerely."
"Obviously, our group supports its chairman's report."
"Energy taxation is one of the best and most effective controls which society can use to reduce emissions and try to protect and improve the environment."
"The main argument in the report is that Member States should be left some leeway when it comes to applying taxation, so long as the single market is not affected."
"This has to be regarded as only right, as does the principle that renewable energy sources should not come within the scope of the directive."
"The argument that there should be continued support for the production of combined electricity and heating is extremely important and most welcome."
"The rapporteur, Patrick Cox, has already simplified and clarified the Commission's proposal, but in my opinion it could have been simplified still further."
"The minimum levels of taxation mentioned in Articles 7 and 8 could even be harmonised."
"Levels of taxation for fuels used for production and those used for heating are now so close to one another that they could be harmonised."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of two details here. Firstly, peat should in future become recognised incontrovertibly as a renewable biomass."
"A marsh will produce roughly the same amount of peat in a year as a forest does wood pulp per unit area."
"Thus, peat is unquestionably a renewable source of energy."
"It is important to make this point, as peat is and will be of tremendous importance in the Nordic countries and Ireland too, for example."
"The second point is this. The tax on aircraft fuel should be left for individual countries to decide themselves."
"There are big differences in air traffic density among the Member States."
"Internal air traffic in small countries is insignificant, but in the large Member States, such as Finland, it is extremely important."
"For this reason, a harmonised taxation system would not treat different Member States fairly."
"Taking these observations into account, I believe the report is excellent and I give it my wholehearted support."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome this report as a small step in the right direction."
"It is clear to all of us that a great deal still remains to be done before we can finally achieve a breakthrough in the area of energy taxation."
"But it is essential for us that the second stage of ecological tax reform in Germany is not slowed down by Brussels and that in the medium-term we can finally reach a stage where there are pioneer states that can lead the way in the European Union."
"We are particularly pleased that there are exceptions that are 'green' and that involve not only energy-intensive operations but also - and this must be clear to everyone - environmentally friendly renewable energies that can be exempted from energy taxation."
"The fact that nuclear energy is also to be taxed pleases us greatly, as otherwise we would have an imbalance in the energy taxation proposal."
"We are pleased that our amendment received a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy because it is crucial for us that local public transport can be exempted."
"For there is one thing that we must not forget: this energy taxation has a purpose, which is to help the environment and help to meet the commitment that we undertook to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"This is what all these various possibilities are designed to do."
"What we need now is for the Council of Ministers to reach agreement as soon as possible."
"In this context I am pleased to inform you that the German Minister for the Environment, Mr Trittin, is endeavouring, during his visits to the Member States, to ensure that we reach agreement on this issue as soon as possible."
"Madam President, it is most regrettable that the Cox report is only now coming before the plenary again after being postponed for two months."
"On the other hand, I am glad that Mr Cox's report has not lost too much of its force in the intervening period."
"It still offers a clear alternative to the hybrid Commission proposal."
"A large number of counter-productive derogations have been scrapped, and I shall be glad to support the Cox report."
"The Council must now make up its mind."
"Either it sticks to the international agreements on limiting CO2 emissions and reducing environmental pollution or it opts for the unclear situation of the status quo, with further damage to our climate system as a result."
"I am in favour of abolishing the exemption from tax for civil aviation fuel."
"If the European Union unilaterally introduced a tax, however, this might lead to considerable distortion of aircraft movements."
"I think an excellent alternative would be an overflying tax as advocated earlier, in conjunction with air traffic control services."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in international competition we need a sensible form of energy taxation."
"In my opinion there are several reasons why the issue of energy taxation is one of the most forward-looking debates in the European Union and beyond."
"Positively speaking, it mainly involves a system of incentives to encourage an economical and efficient use of our resources."
"But we must proceed with restraint to ensure that the baby - and therefore the economy - is not thrown out with the bathwater."
"After all, we are not against the introduction of harmonised energy taxation in principle."
"However, with it we must guarantee a level playing field in terms of competition."
"My country, for example, has taken a leading role in this area."
"Accordingly, the general introduction of upper limits on taxation for energy-intensive firms, as provided in Article 15 of the Commission proposal, makes a great deal of sense."
"We should not forget that such firms have already in the past updated their technical equipment and brought their energy consumption closer to minimum levels."
"In this case higher energy tax cannot achieve any further saving."
"We can prevent the increased costs that this would entail and thus support the competitiveness of our companies and of Europe as a location for business."
"For this reason we should also think about discontinuing the optional exemption of energy products that are not used as fuel and of energy products that are used to produce electricity and heat, as provided in Article 13."
"In any case, those Member States whose energy taxation rates are above the minimum level should at least be given the opportunity to adjust their taxation levels accordingly."
"A flexible system of upper limits could make it possible to find reasonable solutions."
"I should like, first of all, to present my apologies to you, Madam President, as well as to all Members of Parliament in the Chamber at this time, in particular to Mr Harrison and Mr Cox, the two rapporteurs."
"Although I had planned my flight with plenty of time to spare, that proved insufficient. I apologise for this."
"I would like to thank Mr Cox for what I understand have been very generous words on his part."
"I would also like to thank Mr Spencer."
"Mr Cox, the report you have drafted and the conclusions you have drawn are extremely interesting and important."
"I am very pleased that you support the reasoning behind this proposal and the manner in which that reasoning is translated into action."
"The Commission has put a proposal to the Council, the main thrust of which is the need to modernise the Community system for the taxation of mineral oils and to extend its scope to all energy products."
"This is necessary to improve the functioning of the single market by reducing the tax-induced distortions that exist at present."
"The Commission has also used the proposal to meet its obligation to review minimum rates of taxation on mineral oils and, at the same time, to respond to the ECOFIN Council request to come forward with new proposals following the deadlock in the negotiations on the CO2 energy tax."
"I need hardly add that in this context there is growing concern about the environmental effects of the combustion of fossil fuels."
"This has been highlighted by the recent adoption by the Council of emission targets for the Union in response to the Kyoto Protocol."
"The achievement of these targets will not be easy and fiscal measures are one of the concrete tools which can be utilised to assist in the task."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 23, 32, 33 and parts of Amendment No 25."
"However, the suggestion that we should move straight to the second stage of minimum rates from January 2000 and increase these annually by the rate of inflation plus 2 % for five years cannot be accepted."
"So far as deletion of the initial stage of the minimum levels of taxation is concerned, it is true that the operative date of 1 January 1998 belongs to the past."
"However, discussions in the Council have shown that even the proposed minimum levels are causing difficulties for a number of Member States."
"Any increase in these levels is therefore not acceptable."
"The same applies to the suggestion that minimum tax levels should be increased annually by inflation plus 2 % for a period of five years."
"The Commission proposal restricts the increase to the rate of inflation in order to assist Member States who would be required to impose substantial increases in tax simply to attain the proposed minimum levels."
"To require them in addition to impose further increases in excess of inflation is unacceptable."
"The removal of most of the proposed compulsory and optional exemptions and reductions relating to products which are not currently taxed cannot be accepted."
"These exemptions and reductions have been formulated for a number of reasons."
"Some exist in current legislation; others are necessary to reflect Community obligations under international agreements and a further group is considered necessary to protect the competitiveness of Community enterprises."
"Finally, I should just add a word or two on Mr Harrison's report."
"This exercise in simplification, which recently led the Commission to present a proposal for a directive on the right to deduct, is a top priority for us."
"This proposed directive constitutes one more step in that direction; in essence, its aim is to prevent national administrations in future from obliging non-resident traders to appoint a tax representative."
"I am pleased to note that Mr Harrison's report backs this approach and welcomes the Commission's proposal."
"However, the amendments do not strike me as acceptable; but I assure you that the Commission shares the rapporteur's view that the adoption of the definitive system will constitute the final and most important simplification for traders."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Heating systems for passenger compartments"
"The next item is the report (A4-0170/99) by Mrs Billingham, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Council Directive 78/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to heating systems for the passenger compartment of motor vehicles (COM(98)0526 - C4-0552/98-98/0277(COD))."
"Since the rapporteur is not present, Mr Rübig is the first speaker."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, you will all remember the discussion that we have had several times in this Chamber in the course of the last year."
"Parliament developed a completely new approach to technical legislation in the context of the debates on the EU bus construction directive and the Murphy report."
"The European legislator would draw up the political framework, then the users and experts, particularly from the field of standardisation, would sort out the details in working groups."
"In this way we would achieve a greater degree of agreement and acceptance among those concerned."
"We take the key concept of simplifying legislation very seriously."
"The present proposal could also be implemented using this system."
"The text might then read as follows: 'Interior heating systems for cars must be such that they can be operated safely; they must be covered sufficiently to prevent passengers from being burned, and finally they should emit few harmful chemicals'."
"A technical working group could then have developed the details from these principles."
"In this context I am keenly awaiting the Council's common position on the bus directive, as I am sure that through codecision we will not only find a solution to this dossier but we will be able to set the course for the future."
"With regard to Parliament's report it remains to be said that we fully support Mrs Billingham's amendments."
"Moreover, we consider efficiency tests for heaters to be both necessary and important as the quality of fitted heaters must be quantifiable, for example whether the engine coolant can be brought to operating temperature before the engine is started."
"Amendment No 10 also deals with the passenger safety aspect."
"If the heater is to be installed in the passenger compartment it should be securely compartmented off."
"We do not wish to restrict ourselves to a single type of design for this, however, and for this reason, in Amendment No 12, we advocate a general heat-resistant material."
"I would like to express my thanks for the cooperation that was achieved with the experts and the rapporteur, and I look forward with anticipation to tomorrow's vote."
"Madam President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Billingham, for her in-depth examination of our proposal and her excellent report."
"The aim of the proposal amending Council Directive 78/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to heating systems for the passenger compartment of motor vehicles is to broaden the scope of the directive, extending it from cars alone to all vehicle categories."
"Furthermore it contains new provisions on combustion heaters, to ensure that such systems comply with strict safety and environmental protection standards compatible with modern technology."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and Nos 8, 9 and 11."
"Amendments Nos 1 to 3 and Nos 5, 6 and 8 basically clarify the original proposal, whereas Nos 4, 9 and 11 relate to specific safety aspects of combustion heaters."
"The Commission too is keen to lay down adequate safety provisions and therefore welcomes these amendments."
"However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 7, 10 and 12."
"No 7 commits the Commission to drawing up proposals for testing the efficiency of combustion heaters by 1 October 2001."
"The Commission believes that it will be market operators who guarantee a high level of efficiency in this field, and that legislative action is therefore unnecessary."
"What is more, the conformity of combustion heaters with the provisions of the directive will ensure that high levels of safety and environmental protection are maintained, in line with modern technology."
"If any specific problems or technological innovations change this situation in the future, the Commission will be informed by the national type-approval authorities in the appropriate working groups and will adopt the necessary measures."
"Moreover, as regards the date of entry into force, 1 October 2001 seems a somewhat unrealistic deadline for new legislative initiatives."
"Amendments Nos 10 and 12 offer an alternative to the positioning of combustion heaters in the passenger compartment of coaches and minibuses."
"The Commission proposal permits the installation of heating systems in the passenger compartment as long as a hermetically sealed casing is used which is fireproof even if it overheats."
"The wording of these amendments guarantees a level of safety which is equivalent to, if not lower than, that envisaged in the directive; in particular, they do not explicitly guarantee the same safety level in relation to the risk of fire."
"In conclusion, the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 to 6 and Nos 8, 9 and 11, but is obliged to reject Amendments Nos 7, 10 and 12."
"The Commission intends to pursue its useful dialogue with the European Parliament in the conviction that a constructive solution can be found."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The sitting was closed at 10.04 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"That will be corrected, Mr Balfe."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Mr President, I want to draw to your attention the fact that the agriculture debates will be starting in a few minutes."
"The amendments to two of the reports are still not available in English."
"I asked for the amendments yesterday evening."
"One set had appeared by this morning - to the Fantuzzi report - but there are still no copies in English of the amendments to the Jové Peres and Happart reports."
"It really is not good enough to expect us to debate when we do not have the amendments in our own language."
"Mrs Hardstaff, I have been informed by my services that there was a technical problem."
"The translations will be circulated as soon as possible."
"Mr President, I merely wish to refer to the problems concerning the accessibility of the airports around Strasbourg."
"Along with many other Members, I am often unable to arrive on time at the start of a sitting. This is because although the city of Strasbourg provides us with a free transfer service, the operators try to make up large groups of passengers, and at times we have had to wait one and a half or two hours for a sufficient number of travellers to arrive."
"I am grateful to the city of Strasbourg for the service it provides for us free of charge but I do feel, however, that the previous arrangements should be reinstated to ensure a more flexible service."
"We have been informed of budget cuts, and I appreciate that cost is an important consideration. Nevertheless, if we are truly serious about saving money, we should only come to Strasbourg once or twice a year and meet in Brussels the rest of the time as it is much cheaper."
"We all enjoy coming to Strasbourg, but we would like to see a return to the previous standard of services."
"Thank you very much."
"I think we are all mindful of what you have just told us."
"We will continue our representations to the French authorities and we shall see if there is some way in which we can improve things, since I am aware of the problems that you face."
"Mr President, yesterday morning I left home at 8.10."
"Having arrived at the airport and boarded the plane, I was told my flight had been cancelled."
"We arrived here last night at 10.40."
"That is 14 hours of travelling to get to this place."
"Quite frankly, if Air France cannot provide a better service to Strasbourg airport then a lot of British Members are just not going to turn up in Strasbourg."
"Mr Corrie, I would not be adding very much if I said that you have all our sympathy, but that does not change anything."
"Yesterday evening, we heard a similar story in the Bureau from Mr Collins, a Vice-President."
"Unfortunately, there are problems."
"However, I do not want to continue this discussion now."
"Mr President, I would like the European Parliament to take note of the fact that last night a missile fired by NATO hit a passenger train in Yugoslavia, claiming dozens of victims, both dead and wounded."
"It is not yet certain - at least I do not know - whether there were Greek journalists on that train who were travelling within Yugoslavia."
"I believe that this catastrophic act perpetrated against the people of Yugoslavia and against a civilian means of transport is a clear violation of human rights and may even be regarded as a crime against humanity."
"I think that the European Parliament must denounce these actions and this disaster that is taking place in Europe."
"Mr Theonas, a debate will take place tomorrow in the presence of the Council and the Commission on the situation in Kosovo and all these problems."
"Mr President, I want to raise a point of order."
"Although the preceding points of order may all seem rather disparate, in actual fact they are not."
"With regard to the transport problems, I must remind you that we are allies and so, in this case, Air France should not be criticised because the problems are due to air traffic having been disrupted by the military flights over Serbia and Kosovo."
"Those who like criticising France may gain satisfaction from doing so but they are quite simply mistaken."
"Thank you very much for those explanations, Mr Duhamel."
"I think we have dealt with enough problems that are outside the agenda, and we must now proceed with our agenda."
"Agriculture"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0168/99) by Mr Happart, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposals for 16 Council Regulations on the prices for agricultural products (1999-2000) (COM(99)0038 - C4-0077/99 to C4-0091/99 and C4-0093/99-99/0025(CNS) to 99/0039(CNS) and 99/0801(CNS)); -the report (A4-0164/99) by Mr Jové Peres, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, onI.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending and correcting Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (COM(98)0647 - C4-0709/98-98/0309(CNS))II.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits (COM(98)0647 - C4-0710/98-98/0310(CNS)); -the report (A4-0173/99) by Mr Fantuzzi, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on measures to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries (COM(98)0683 - C4-0158/99-98/0330(CNS)); -the oral question (B4-0159/99) by Mr Colino Salamanca, to the Commission, on imports of garlic from third countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am today presenting my final report to this House as I will be standing down at the elections on 13 June."
"I will be returning to southern Belgium to continue my work of promoting European construction in other ways."
"We need Europe and our children even more so."
"Before the 1992 reform of the common agricultural policy, the report on agricultural prices was one of the most sought-after and most prestigious reports."
"Although this has now lost its attraction, the prices for agricultural products still form the bulk of farmers' income, providing between 60 % and 80 % depending on the types of product."
"My intention with these proposals to adjust agricultural prices is to send a clear message to the European farming community. I want to assure them that this House intends to defend their legitimate interests at a particularly difficult time when doubt is creeping in among farmers, particularly the younger ones."
"We are increasingly telling our farmers about the necessary enlargement of the European Union and they are not against this."
"Some have already set up in the new areas, mainly in Poland."
"However, they do not want the farming community to have to foot the bill for this enlargement."
"They are prepared to make the necessary effort and sacrifices as citizens of Europe, like everyone else, but only to a fair and equal degree."
"This is why I am talking about adjustment and not increase."
"Is it a crime to compensate for the loss of 1.9 % due to the changeover from the green ecu to the euro?"
"Is it a crime to include farmers when compensating for the inflation rate of 1.9 % given that other European workers are justifiably benefiting from this compensation? For example, I am very happy for the German steel workers who have obtained a 4 % wage increase."
"The European Parliament must ignore the Council of Ministers and the national governments which only want to recover the unspent amounts in order to help balance their domestic budgets."
"In addition, the richest of these governments want this money in order to partially renationalise their agriculture, with blatant disregard for farmers in the poorest Member States."
"If the Council had at least had the courage to refinance the Structural Funds by transferring the budget allocations, farmers could have been bailed out."
"What hope can we give and what jobs can we offer for the future to the 200 000 farmers leaving the profession every year in Europe?"
"Between 500 and 600 farmers are leaving farming every day, with this figure reaching over 3 000 per week in certain areas."
"The desertification of the countryside due to the farmers' exodus is killing the rural environment."
"If we cannot save the rural society of the poorest regions today, what will we do tomorrow when the USA, having imposed on us its dollar bananas and hormonised meat, forces us to abandon these areas in the name of the World Trade Organisation?"
"I do not want a society 'made in the USA' for my children, where money is more important than people."
"I want the opposite."
"If we do not adjust these prices and provide the necessary refinancing of the Structural Funds, we will destroy the individuality of European agriculture where diversity goes hand in hand with quality."
"Mr President, the Commission's proposal amounts to minor modifications of the COM in fresh fruit and vegetables and the processing of citrus fruits."
"Where fresh fruit and vegetables are concerned, it is proposed to meet the cost of selecting and packing products to be distributed free of charge from the Community budget."
"Clearly, if what is involved is providing an alternative to the withdrawal and distribution of products, free distribution should not become burdensome to the producer organisations."
"In addition, the Commission has proposed authorising members of producer organisations to sell part of their produce outside the commercial circuits of the producer organisation to which they belong."
"As a result of the 1996 reform, most of the instruments designed to regulate the market were replaced by producer organisations' operating funds."
"The producer organisations play a central role in the COM and it is essential to avoid any modification of the regulations which might weaken them."
"The Commission has proposed making it easier for members of recognised producer organisations to sell a limited part of their produce direct to the consumer."
"We might wonder how a producer organisation can regard as a right the abandonment of its main purpose - marketing its members' produce."
"To date, direct sales have been severely restricted and can only take place on the producer's farm."
"This approach could have a negative effect on the main role of producer organisations - marketing their members' produce."
"Although current regulations ought to be sufficiently flexible to adapt to local situations, there is no justification for jeopardising the general system in order to comply with local practice which is far removed from areas where the bulk of the Community's production of fruit and vegetables is concentrated."
"In such cases, it would seem wiser to resort to subsidiarity and to allow each Member State to regulate local practice as appropriate."
"However, to avoid undermining the main purpose of producer organisations, any exemption should be accompanied by a tightening of the limits on the amount of its members' produce that can be marketed outside the producer organisation so as to offset the producer organisation's loss of marketable production."
"Concerning the production of citrus fruits for processing, the present system leads to serious delays in the receipt of aid. In the case of citrus fruits processed at the start of the season, aid sometimes arrives twelve months later."
"The anticipatory scheme only partly compensates for these delays and some producer organisations are likely to be tempted to stop handing over their production for processing and to opt instead for the withdrawal arrangements."
"The Commission has come up with an appropriate proposal to resolve this problem."
"Aid has been granted for the processing of citrus fruits since 1976, and in the intervening period it has proved necessary to correct and prevent interference between the withdrawal scheme and the processing scheme."
"Great care should be taken when setting the conditions for aid to processing in order to prevent withdrawal from becoming a more attractive option than processing."
"The Commission's proposal does not resolve the imbalance between the thresholds set for the processing of citrus fruits and production reality."
"This situation could result in the processing of citrus fruits becoming less profitable than withdrawal."
"An increase in withdrawals would have a negative effect on the environment and public opinion would be much more strongly opposed to it than it would be to aid to processing."
"The lack of balance between the commitment appropriations and the actual payments highlights the imbalance between the instruments for the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables."
"Following reform of the COM in fruit and vegetables, a surplus in commitment appropriations of ECU 400 million over payments was recorded. Yet the thresholds set for processed citrus fruits have resulted in chronic inadequacies in budget allocations."
"It is therefore proposed to increase the threshold to the average quantities processed in the last four years. An additional expenditure of ECU 64 million would be involved."
"This figure falls well within the financial margin of expenditure not incurred for withdrawals."
"Another cause of destabilisation of the system is the lack of a penalty limit."
"A 20 % limit on penalties should be set."
"In this connection, it is worth remembering that such a system existed in the past and is indeed still applied to other regulated produce subject to thresholds."
"Mr President, I wholeheartedly welcome this proposal for a regulation on measures to promote agricultural products in third countries."
"It is a sign that, despite all the difficulties and uncertainties over reform of the CAP following the agreements reached in Berlin, some important and innovative moves are afoot."
"It is also a sign that agricultural products are in need nowadays not so much of policies to defend and protect them but of aggressive, innovative policies to promote them judiciously on third countries' markets."
"All too often - not least in this House - we have heard talk of globalisation as though it merely meant net losses for European agriculture."
"This initiative puts us back on the right track: globalisation also offers unique opportunities for European agriculture."
"After all, there is growing demand in the world for high-quality farm produce and food, and the EU has the highest standards of food, safety and quality in the world."
"Therefore we should not stand on the sidelines hoping for the best, but should equip ourselves with the appropriate instruments and strategies to be competitive and to make the most of this growth in demand around the world for high-quality agri-food products."
"Flooding world markets with low added-value commodities is the wrong approach, since it will be increasingly difficult to compete on such commodities with countries whose costs are lower than our own; furthermore, as we are aware, the WTO has placed both volume and value-based ceilings on export refunds; and lastly, we know that the new Millennium Round talks are to begin soon and should not have too many illusions."
"What is more, Commissioner, we might get into hot water over these issues and make our presence felt rather late in the day."
"I see from the budget of the US Department of Agriculture that, in the three years from 1996 to 1999, over USD 150 million per year was spent on policies to support the internationalisation of agriculture."
"Of course, some promotional work has already been done in the EU - geared likewise to non-European countries - in the general context of promotion activities, the most outstanding in recent years being support for the IOOC initiative to promote olive oil on world markets."
"I should like to conclude with four points."
"The first is that this should be an opportunity to bring together and integrate all the promotional measures, not just those geared to external markets, but also those relating to the European internal market."
"Too many fragmentary initiatives have been devised with different motives, timing and procedures, and this opportunity should be taken to put them all into some kind of order."
"The second is that a budget increase is required."
"If this initiative is to be a serious one, it cannot be restricted to EUR 15 million - a derisory sum - and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has proposed that, for 2000 to 2003, the funding should be boosted from EUR 30 m to 50 m."
"By the same token, the funding for all the promotional activities scheduled under Agenda 2000, limited to EUR 100 m from now until 2006, may be inadequate."
"My third point is that a more long-term view is needed."
"It is no accident that we have proposed extending from two to three years the period for revising the list of products to fall under the promotional measures and the duration of the programmes, in order to lend greater certainty and effectiveness to the measures."
"My fourth and final point is that the basic principle behind this regulation should be adhered to, namely subsidiarity and complementarity, in order that initiatives are not imposed from Brussels in a clean sweep but that they complement, blend with and in turn stimulate similar measures devised by the national authorities and by producers' associations, so that all the players involved in European agriculture and in its future challenges are following the same approach."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in the explanatory statement of the opinion I am privileged to present to you today, the REX Committee has indicated that, in its view, the Commission's proposal is very important and represents a great opportunity."
"The reform of the common agricultural policy in the framework of Agenda 2000 ought indeed to include a package of external measures providing for the development of actions to promote and provide information on agricultural products in third countries."
"Such actions must be aimed at increasing the competitiveness of European products on the world markets, and to this end, it is essential to promote their image."
"Information and publicity ought to result in good outlets for quality Community products with regulated designations of origin, particularly when countries with stringent quality requirements are targeted. These countries usually have high purchasing power."
"The present initiative is particularly timely as the results of the campaign to promote olive oil and fibre flax, to which Mr Fantuzzi also referred, are already available. Sales of these products outside the Community have increased thanks to ad hoc methods of promotion."
"The proposal, which has been amended by the Committee on Agriculture, lists a whole range of possible actions. Nevertheless, the best publicity will always be the quality, safety, hygiene, labelling and respect for the environment that are characteristic of Community products."
"The REX Committee is certainly in favour of this proposal and believes that it merits consideration."
"Nevertheless, as Mr Fantuzzi also pointed out, there are some grounds for concern as to whether such an ambitious project can be adequately financed through the annual sum of only EUR 15 million allocated to it until the year 2003."
"In view of the large sums allocated to the CAP, there could well be scope for an increase in funding. If wisely managed, this would enable our exports to grow in an increasingly globalised international trading environment."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by reiterating that the REX Committee supports this proposal. The committee is particularly in favour of the principle on which the proposal is based, namely, strengthening the Union's commercial policy through the promotion of agricultural products in third countries."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should like to put an oral question concerning the present state of the market for garlic."
"This is certainly not a new situation. It is a recurring problem, but I feel it is important to draw attention to it, particularly as unofficial imports of garlic from third countries are directly responsible for the collapse of the garlic market."
"I should reiterate that this is not a new situation, and the reason for putting this question now is that in accordance with Regulation No 1137/98 of 29 May, the period in which import licences may be granted for a maximum of 12 000 tonnes of garlic from China is due to expire on 31 May."
"According to the figures I have available, total imports for 1998 total approximately 50 000 tonnes, though average imports for the European Union in the period 1990-1997 were only of the order of 40 000 tonnes."
"It is surprising to find references to countries such as Malaysia - which did not export any garlic to the European Union in 1993 - Jordan and India suddenly appearing. The figures of 7 300 tonnes, 6 167 tonnes and almost 1 000 tonnes respectively for 1998 are quoted, over and above the nominal 12 000 tonnes from China."
"This immediately gives rise to suspicions that triangular operations may be taking place involving garlic of Chinese origin which arrives here following deals with third countries."
"As a result, the quota and safeguard procedures are becoming meaningless. The situation has been further aggravated by the failure to insist on certificates of origin for imported garlic and by the failure to apply the appropriate tariff codes correctly to differentiate between green garlic with undeveloped cloves and garlic to be sold dried or partly dried."
"It seems that the Commission needs to be reminded that this particular crop is of great social significance in certain areas: it is produced mainly in regions with structural problems - Objective 1 regions."
"What is at issue is a fall in production in areas such as Castile-La Mancha, Castile-Leon and Andalusia, which are all Objective 1 regions. Their economic activity revolves around this product as it represents the only means of making a living in these areas."
"Documents produced by the Commission reveal that it is aware of the problem."
"For instance, Regulation No 1197 states that, since 1993, the Commission has noted a significant increase in imports of garlic from China relative to previous years."
"As far as I am aware, the cost of producing garlic in the European Union is of the order of 220 pesetas per kilo whereas Chinese garlic is priced at around 135 pesetas per kilo. Clearly, the ensuing fall in the price of garlic could cause a significant upheaval in the Community market."
"In Regulation No 544, the Commission states that following the introduction of a safeguard clause relating to the import of garlic from China, a significant increase in imports of garlic from certain third countries with no tradition of exporting garlic to the Community has suddenly taken place over the last few years."
"The Commission itself has suggested that this raises doubts as to the true origin of the garlic imported from these third countries."
"Imports of garlic of dubious origin have continued to increase."
"In the light of this data provided by the Commission itself and since the market is collapsing, it is essential to put pressure on the Commission to take action to remedy the situation."
"Given that the Commission is aware of the situation and that it is also aware that the measures taken so far are inadequate - as the state of the market proves - it is simply not acceptable that no further measures are being taken."
"The garlic producers have raised the possibility of setting a maximum world trading quota, and of even setting a deterrent tariff barrier for quantities above this maximum world trading quota."
"I realise that these issues will be dealt with during future negotiations."
"We would, however, urge the Commission to remain vigilant and to introduce appropriate measures to prevent the annual drop in producers' incomes. I should emphasise once again that their income has been falling year on year since 1993."
"Finally, I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to express my support for the reports by Mr Jové and Mr Fantuzzi, particularly as regards the processing of citrus fruits and aid for the promotion of agricultural products in third countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to bear with me if what I have to say takes some time, but I do now have to comment on four different reports."
"I should like to start straight away with the price proposals for the 1999/2000 marketing year."
"The proposals which the Commission has made are in line with the same stability policy which has already been pursued in preceding price packages."
"They are primarily intended to guarantee the rollover which is necessary for legal reasons."
"The reform will in any case mean that in future, far fewer market management parameters will need to be set on an annual basis."
"Under these circumstances, the Commission is proposing not to increase the amounts."
"I believe that we should confine ourselves strictly to measures which do not run counter to the overall strategy agreed in Berlin."
"At this point, I should also like to thank Mr Happart very much for his report, along with the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the members of the other committees who were actively involved in the preparatory work for this report."
"With your permission, I will now turn to the amendments."
"I will begin with those which seek to increase all the prices and aids so as to take account of the inflation rate of 1.9 % and the introduction of the euro."
"This concerns the following groups of amendments: firstly, Amendments Nos 13, 16, 23, 33, 38 and 42 on the rate of inflation; then Amendments Nos 14, 17, 24, 34 and 39 on the introduction of the euro; and finally, Amendments Nos 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 27 to 31, 36 and 41 on raising prices."
"The Commission cannot agree to these amendments, because they would run directly counter to the need to improve the competitiveness of Community produce, both in the internal market and on the world markets."
"Secondly, this would involve additional expenditure of EUR 463 million for the year 2000."
"If that is applied to the forthcoming financial framework from 2000 to 2006, the additional costs come to over EUR 3 billion."
"Finally, this would also mean that we would be unable to honour our international commitments in full, that is those on reducing internal support."
"Incidentally, Council Regulation No 2799/98 on the new agri-monetary arrangements provides in any case that if there is proven loss of income as a result of the introduction of the euro, then compensatory payments may be granted, provided that the conditions specified are met."
"On Amendment No 1 on compulsory set-aside, which amounts to keeping the set-aside rate as it currently stands for the coming years, I should like to point out that part of the Berlin compromise is that a basic set-aside rate of 10 % should apply for the whole of the period from 2000 to 2006."
"Amendment No 2 concerns flax and hemp and aims to promote the use of these agricultural products for non-food purposes."
"I understand the reasons behind this amendment."
"But I cannot agree to it, because this issue needs to be considered in a wider context."
"It will also need to be taken into account when the future set-aside rate and the options for rural development measures are discussed."
"Amendments Nos 4 and 5 seek to introduce new measures to manage pigmeat production."
"I should simply like to draw your attention here to the fact that subsidising the pig sector at the present time will only compound the problem, because farmers will be less willing to reduce the size of their herds."
"Implementing a proposal of this kind would also be very costly."
"Incidentally, I might also point out here that in the management committee we have repeatedly invited the Member States to make structural proposals."
"We have discussed all the variants which have been mentioned here."
"The Member States did not find a single one of these attractive, and stated on the contrary that appropriate market management was a sufficient measure."
"I now come to the amendments relating to the wine sector."
"Amendments Nos 3 and 32 on the granting of permanent abandonment premiums in respect of wine-growing areas and extending the deadline for submitting applications for premiums for the 1999/2000 marketing year from 31 December 1999 to 31 March 2000 do not cause any difficulties."
"However, the Commission is unable to accept the remaining amendments on the wine sector for the following reasons."
"Firstly, this will either pre-empt the reform - which has been agreed at political level - or might even go against it."
"Secondly, as regards the ban on planting new areas under vines, I might point out that this was extended in the last price package until 31 August 2000, and that in 1998 an additional 10 000 hectares of planting rights had to be granted for both the 1998/99 and 1999/2000 marketing years."
"The Commission cannot agree to the other Amendments Nos 26 and 31 on the monthly reimbursement of storage costs for sugar, simply because the proposed reduction is indisputably due to the fall in interest rates."
"In the light of the new timetable for the reform of the common organisation of the markets in the milk sector, Amendment No 35 is unjustified."
"Finally, as regards the three amendments on the beef and veal sector, Amendments Nos 37, 40 and 41, I would point out that they are unnecessary in view of the proposals to reform this sector."
"In conclusion, I would ask you to bear in mind that while we are waiting for Agenda 2000 to be implemented, we should on no account lose sight of the fact that underlying these price proposals are efforts to achieve greater simplification and stability which are reinforced by the broad consensus in this debate."
"Since the report Mr Happart has presented today is his last, I wish to thank him very much and, Mr Happart, you can take this assurance with you for your continued political career: for as long as I work here, I will not allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture, but like you will fight for us to retain our independence in Europe!"
"I now turn to the report on a number of adjustments to the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables."
"As you know, this is only the second marketing year that this new market organisation has been in force, and you also know that in any case it is intended to carry out a general review of the way this market organisation is operating next year."
"This being the case, I think it is too early for us to make more far-reaching changes than the ones proposed at this stage."
"During the recent negotiations on the price package, however, the Commission did agree to make a few minor adjustments so as to improve the way in which the market organisation operates."
"That alone is therefore the aim of these proposals."
"I should like to thank Mr Jové Peres for his report, in which he also registers a large degree of support for the Commission's proposals."
"Like him, I too believe that it is necessary to strengthen the producer organisations, on which the major burden of market management clearly falls."
"Mr Peres also refers to a number of problems which we will have to deal with during the forthcoming review."
"The Commission therefore believes that many of the proposed amendments are premature and would not appear to be feasible without a detailed analysis."
"This applies to Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4 and 6 to 9."
"I can assure Parliament, however, that the Commission will pay careful attention to these points when it reviews the market organisation next year."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 and 5, because the producer organisations need to have the financial and technical capability to monitor their products appropriately."
"That brings me to Mr Fantuzzi's report."
"Here too, my particular thanks go to the rapporteur, but also to the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the other committees which have given their opinions on this proposal."
"I am glad that the proposal has met with broad support."
"The aim of the proposal is to create an operational instrument which will increase the international competitiveness of European agricultural products."
"We must certainly not - and here I agree with Mr Fantuzzi - stand by and watch while our most important competitors in the new markets - such as those in south-east Asia and Latin America - pursue an active policy of export promotion, when we have nothing even remotely equivalent to set against it."
"We will therefore have to make considerable efforts in this field in the future and develop a wide range of information and promotional measures so as to consolidate our position in these markets, particularly because European products are as a rule highly processed and that can only mean that jobs are also at stake here."
"The Commission will observe the principles of subsidiarity and complementarity and will essentially confine itself to acting as a link or as a catalyst and ensuring European added value."
"Of course, we can only take action within our limited budget, and we should also make use of the best available know-how from outside."
"This approach therefore requires the Member States - both the private and the public sector - to be heavily involved in terms of making cofinancing available and providing the necessary support for managing and monitoring the measures."
"I should like to say the following on the proposed amendments: firstly, as far as the criteria for selecting the eligible products are concerned - this concerns Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6 and 9 - we believe that these amendments are superfluous because the Commission proposal already covers these points in a more general way."
"According to the Commission proposal, the products which can be selected are those which are intended for direct consumption or processing."
"In just the same way, organic products or products made using other specific production methods may be selected, as can processed foodstuffs, provided that the information and promotional measures are of sufficient benefit and are in the European interest."
"As regards the nature and content of the measures to be supported, I can accept Amendment No 7."
"The more precise statement of the target groups at which the measures should be directed, analysed in Amendment No 8, does not, however, seem to me to be necessary."
"As far as your proposed adjustments to the procedure for drawing up the list of products and the question of how long this should remain valid are concerned - this relates to Amendments Nos 10, 11 and 14 - this might pose problems if we still want our policy to be sufficiently flexible and if we also want to keep it up to date at all times."
"I actually think it would be better to consult the Standing Group on the Promotion of Agricultural Products - as it is called - from the very outset, if time allows, and also for the lists we draw up to remain valid for no longer than two years."
"Introducing such rigid rules, as proposed in the amendments, could prevent our policy from having the best possible effect."
"Your proposal only to work with those organisations which represent exclusively the Member States of the European Union or to which at least two Member States belong is not one I can accept, because we also attach great importance to working with international organisations, which of course have to show an appropriate European dimension."
"You only have to think of the work of the Olive Oil Council."
"As regards the obligation to consult the relevant management committee rather than simply to inform it, I am willing to examine this proposal in more detail."
"I have to reject the remaining points, however, because our experience has shown that programmes should not run for longer than three years, and because when we implement this scheme we want to adopt a bottom-up approach."
"In addition, the professional organisations have to obtain the prior agreement of the national authorities before they submit their proposals to the Commission."
"Obviously, the proposer organisations may also appoint bodies to be responsible for implementing the planned measures."
"It must be clear, however, that these bodies must be selected on the basis of an invitation to tender at Community level."
"I cannot accept Amendments Nos 3, 4, 15, 19 and 24 on the tendering procedure, because the Commission believes that external support facilities must be selected on the basis of an invitation to tender, so as to ensure maximum transparency of Community interests."
"We also think that the Member States should have sole responsibility for monitoring and making payments, in so far as measures are to be prefinanced by them."
"On your request to show more flexibility when determining the part of the funding to be paid by the Member States and in certain cases not to require any financial contribution at all - this is expressed in Amendments Nos 22 and 21 - I should like to say that I think that the Commission proposal is more balanced here in terms of the financial contributions of the three parties involved, namely the Community, the Member State and the proposer organisation."
"On the proposal to increase the appropriations, as contained in Amendment No 22, I should like to say that a substantial increase would not be acceptable at the present time because the sums spent on export refunds are in no way linked to the promotion policy, since the proposal we are discussing primarily concerns quality products and products displaying high added value."
"But obviously here the ultimate decision rests with the budgetary authority."
"I now turn to the comments made by Mr Colino Salamanca concerning imports of garlic from third countries."
"The Commission is currently investigating the possibilities open to it within the WTO for resolving the problems in the garlic sector and is also preparing to introduce a new system which provides for an appropriately high rate of duty on all garlic imports, with the exception of imports falling within the proposed tariff quotas."
"In accordance with GATT rules, quotas would have to be set on the basis of average imports from third countries over a previous three-year period and allow for an appropriate annual increase."
"A draft recommendation for a Council decision authorising the Commission to hold negotiations with the third countries concerned about this change in the bound rate of duty is currently being prepared."
"In the meantime, as an initial measure, the safeguard clause, which exists in principle and which we have applied in recent years, is being further extended."
"Proposals have already been made on this."
"I discussed both these possibilities in detail with representatives of the garlic industry a few weeks ago, and in principle they also gave the green light here and signalled their agreement."
"Applause"
"Mr Fischler, I have to say that I let you speak for 22 minutes. However, I believe this is justified when Commissioners have to reply to a number of reports which deal with many aspects of a subject, and because many important events have taken place in this area in recent times, not least in view of the interim agreement reached by the ministers and the decisions taken at the summit."
"I would like to ask the House to let me depart from the standard practice of the Chair, so as to add my comments to what Mr Fischler has said on the departure of Mr Happart."
"For many years, Mr Happart has been one of the more lively elements in the European Parliament."
"Those of us who have followed his activities will feel very sad that he will not be with us next time."
"We wish him every success in his career and in his new political endeavours."
"Mr President, if I may, Commissioner, I will echo your words of farewell to Mr Happart."
"The fact is - and this is one of our colleague's attributes - that those who swim against the tide sometimes introduce rather more oxygen into the water."
"That is what Mr Happart has done throughout his long and successful career here."
"Ladies and gentlemen, where expenditure is concerned, soundness, financial stability and continuity are of great importance, and in recent years - we can almost go back to the beginning of the European Union - they have not always been valued as much as we in the European Parliament, as representatives of the taxpayer, would have liked."
"One of the major successes of the Berlin summit was, for the first time in fact, to move this self-evident truth to centre stage."
"That is a success."
"However, there is another side, a darker side, to almost every success, and in this case the politicians in the Member States are not yet aware of it."
"To be cautious about this, I should like to express it as follows: alongside this stability, social justice and solidarity with the weaker members of society must of course also be key features of this policy, not only at European level but also right down to each individual locality."
"One of the things which disappoints my group and me personally is that at the present time there is still no instrument - and this could have been decided on in Berlin - through which greater justice and a higher degree of solidarity with smaller and weaker farmers might be achieved."
"It is painful to observe that there is currently no instrument to prevent the old principle from applying whereby price increases mean that more is given to the rich, while all that remains for the poor are the crumbs which fall from the table."
"In fact, it is not so much pricing as extending the second pillar of the integrated policy in rural areas which can be one of the ways of really providing help, and not least an opportunity of moving into a different sector for those who are evidently exposed to risk as businessmen and farmers."
"This opportunity must also be open to their successors."
"That is our social democratic creed; that is what we believe to be essential."
"Although you also complimented Mr Jové Peres, Commissioner, I do have to say that his proposals are somewhat premature."
"Of course, Parliament often points the way ahead and some people - yourself excluded perhaps - then go down that road rather hesitantly."
"I hope, however, that the ideas which Mr Jové Peres has presented here today will actually also be translated into practical policy in the future."
"What this is really about - and in this respect all these reports belong together - is gradually dismantling this rigid market segment, this regulation down to every last detail, and going back to a free social market economy in the European Union."
"That is why it is obviously necessary to use our common sense to refocus the marketing initiatives undertaken very successfully by many producer groups in many countries of the European Union and to make it possible for them to sell anything they have that still needs to be sold."
"Only here too there is another side to the coin: it will not do for farmers to sell potatoes to the producer group when times are hard, and for them to distribute the potatoes on the open market when times are good and they can obtain a good price."
"That would mark the end of this help, this effective help of marketing."
"Of course this is also about marketing."
"Mr Fantuzzi's report also contains proposals to give greater support to marketing in the European Union."
"It is quite astonishing that when it comes to marketing, the economic giant of the European Union is still in its infancy and is faced with the task of trying, with a very small budget, to emulate the marketing pioneers and giants."
"We need a robust marketing campaign here."
"Unfortunately, good things cost money."
"We need to build on what we have at regional level."
"The economic giant, the EU, has to be a marketing giant as well!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to talk about the CAP reform negotiated in Berlin until tomorrow, in the debate on the summit's conclusions."
"I just want to say that I share the Commission's disappointment about this reform, expressed at its first plenary meeting after the Berlin summit."
"As mentioned at this meeting, the annual price packages were in the past the main instrument for defining agricultural policy."
"It is since the 1992 reform that the price packages have gradually ceased to be this policy-defining instrument. This is due to Commissioner Fischler who, since the start of his term of office, has consistently advocated the desirability of the common agricultural policy being increasingly defined by medium-term horizons."
"We now have this reform for 1999 before us in which, once again, agricultural policy is defined according to a medium-term horizon, in this case of seven years."
"However, in the future the price packages will basically be used to adjust agricultural policy measures during the medium-term horizon."
"With regard to this 1999-2000 price package, it is clear to everyone that this has no role to play in defining agricultural policy. It is only a bridge between the past and the future, a transitional measure preserving the status quo until the new CAP is applied at the beginning of next year."
"If we are to have any sense of responsibility, there is therefore no point in proposing new measures, in particular price increases, when the Agriculture Council has just unanimously reduced these same prices within Agenda 2000."
"If the European Parliament were now to approve these measures, quite frankly it would lose its credibility."
"The PPE Group cannot therefore support the amendments tabled by Mr Happart nor those tabled by other Members in this respect."
"However, I must congratulate Mr Happart on some of his analyses which are apposite, particularly with regard to the pigmeat sector."
"I also want to thank him for all his work and cooperation with us during his time in this House. I wish him every personal and political success in the future."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to join in thanking Mr Happart."
"I think he has been a good friend to agriculture and the countryside and many others share my view, even if I do not always see eye to eye with him."
"Instead, I support the Liberals on this issue, in other words the Commission's proposal for the most part rather than the amendments."
"Since the Berlin summit, the immediate future for farmers in terms of agricultural policy looks brighter than the Commission had previously envisaged."
"However, there are a few points I should like to raise."
"In making savings, agriculture should not be the target of any economies that are required as a condition for eastward enlargement."
"The countryside, agriculture and other neglected areas should never have to pay for enlargement; it should fall to those sectors which can best afford it."
"For the same reason, there should be no renationalisation of agriculture."
"Until there is a fully functioning global market, the CAP needs to be safeguarded."
"And there is a strong likelihood that it will be some time before the market functions reliably."
"I also agree with Mr Fischler's comments to the effect that European agriculture should not become Americanised."
"However, we should be aware that in the slightly longer term, the significance of the market and competition will increase."
"As a result, European agriculture will have to become more efficient in terms of quantity and possibly even more so as regards quality."
"In this context, I should like to say that what emerges from Mr Fantuzzi's report about endeavouring to increase sales is constructive."
"Agriculture should be something that Europe can rely on, and we should be able to feel confident about its capacity to provide food products that will be profitable in the long run."
"Finally, we must give the right signals to farmers."
"We should lose no time in initiating a discussion on a more far-reaching reform of our agriculture and rural policies, not on the grounds of enlargement, but because it is needed."
"It is time to make changes which will last well beyond the year 2006."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our debate on the agricultural reports and the question for oral answer cannot be kept separate from the conclusions of the Berlin agreement on CAP reform and from our assessment of this agreement."
"In one sense this agreement is positive as, due to the mobilisation of farmers and the rural world, the Heads of State and Government refused to apply the extreme ultraliberal measures prepared by the Commission."
"However, on the whole, the European leaders did not abandon the logic of allowing agricultural prices to fall, as imposed by the major European and international economic and financial operators."
"This logic can be seen in the Commission's regulation on prices for agricultural products. This regulation does not even guarantee that prices will be maintained in line with inflation or will compensate for the abandonment of the green ecu."
"It also does not correct the imbalances occurring between products and between producers. This logic of allowing prices to fall can also be seen in the lack of determination and means to defend products such as garlic which is the victim of practices which contravene our regulations."
"We therefore need a policy to promote our agricultural products, provided that this has adequate financial resources, unlike the current proposals."
"It does not take a genius to predict that the logic of allowing agricultural prices to fall, as adopted in Berlin, will perpetuate a system of production which destroys employment, food quality and the environment."
"However, the introduction of some negative measures in the CAP reform is to be staggered, which gives farmers, rural dwellers and the people of Europe time to demand that the CAP be genuinely reoriented in the direction defined by this House."
"This is even more of a possibility as we move towards the European elections which will give the people the chance to take part in the debate and decisions."
"I believe there is still work to be done on the CAP reform and the content of this policy can and must be reformed."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Happart's stance is perfectly normal. He has always defended production and naturally does not always submit to the limitations imposed by financial policy."
"Obviously, this view of general stability may seem outrageous and blasphemous but I understand and support it."
"There is no doubt that the 1992 reform, which was based on historical production rates, created a sharp difference in aid throughout Europe, particularly between rich Europe and poor Europe."
"There is no doubt that the 'compensation aid', which will now be called 'direct aid', does not compensate for the fall in prices."
"There is no doubt that farmers are earning less, except in the case of industrialised agriculture."
"I do not therefore feel that Mr Happart's proposal is so outrageous or so blasphemous."
"It is a normal proposal from someone who is trying to defend producers as well as consumers."
"My group therefore supports the proposal."
"What Mr Jové Peres says in his report is extremely important. It is particularly essential to maintain the balance between producer organisations and producers and to guarantee that the latter can remain faithful to their organisations without this constituting a kind of controlled economy in which they are forced, like slaves, to sell to poorly managed organisations."
"The main problem facing us is how to ensure the proper management of these organisations and, at the same time, meet the needs of producers."
"I cannot agree more on the subject of withdrawal."
"This often provides a large profit because it is frequently implemented fraudulently in that payment is made for products to be withdrawn which are then sold on external markets."
"I have seen this happen!"
"The promotion of products as indicated in the Fantuzzi report is extremely important."
"We have been asking for this for ages and it clearly seems ridiculous that Europe has not taken a more aggressive stance given the gradual loss of our international markets."
"For example, Portugal has lost the olive oil market in Brazil to products of terrible quality against which we can easily compete."
"Finally, garlic is a normal problem."
"We believe that, in view of the organised crime and laundering which the Commission has allowed in recent years, in this case strict control would solve the problem."
"There is a desire to control what we import."
"Mr President, I must also congratulate Mr Happart. His work has always been efficient and consistent and he has also sometimes acted as a necessary irritant to this House."
"With regard to his report, the Commission's proposal to leave agricultural prices unchanged for the next season has come at a time when agricultural income has fallen considerably in certain Member States, which the Commission acknowledges."
"We therefore clearly understand the rapporteur's amendments which aim to adjust prices in line with the rate of inflation and in particular to compensate for the negative effects of a new agri-monetary system resulting from the changeover to the euro."
"I fully understood the Commissioner's position just now."
"However, we will support the rapporteur's proposal on two express conditions."
"Firstly, the price adjustment must apply to all agricultural products and not just cereals, sugar and beet, butter and skimmed-milk powder and adult bovine animals."
"Secondly, the increase resulting from this proposal must benefit the 80 % of farmers who are the most disadvantaged."
"This is the aim of my amendment to the recitals which I have tabled on behalf of my group."
"With regard to Mr Fantuzzi's report, this proposal is much more important than it seems at first sight."
"In view of the changes in the world agricultural trade, it is clearly imperative that the European Union implements a common action policy to promote and provide information on its products in third countries."
"In order to sell our products, and to sell them well, as shown by the specific case of olive oil, Europe must be united and must develop its own model of agriculture. Its products must focus on quality, the protection of the environment and the maintenance of land and farmers."
"Given that our main commercial competitor - the United States of America - spends approximately EUR 140 million per year on promotion, not to mention indirect aid, the Commission's proposal to allocate EUR 15 million to the promotion of agricultural products is derisory."
"This is why we support the rapporteur's proposal to increase this figure to EUR 50 million between now and 2003."
"In line with the positions which I have always defended with my group and with other Members in order to make our European model of agriculture consistent and real, it is vital that the amendments are supported as they are intended, first of all, to make the professional organisations and the Commission jointly responsible for implementing this promotion policy. Secondly, they are intended to monitor the use of funds by providing for post-evaluation audits of spending in relation to objectives in order to judge their effectiveness and to reorient these funds if necessary."
"Finally, our group supports the report by Mr Jové Peres."
"Mr President, Commissioner, a few days ago the Agriculture Committee decided that Mr Happart's draft report on agricultural prices could not be adopted as it was."
"A few moments ago, Commissioner Fischler rejected outright all the amendments which could potentially alter the Berlin agreements. It should be remembered that these agreements were reached without the European Parliament giving an opinion on them."
"There is therefore nothing left for me to do but congratulate Mr Happart on having been willing and courageous enough to realistically attempt to defend the profitability of agricultural holdings."
"This is why, on behalf of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations, I participated in the tabling of amendments on an across-the-board increase in institutional prices and aid of 1.9 %. The aim of these amendments is to compensate for the effects of inflation and of the green ecu being abolished from 1 January 1999."
"I did in fact table these amendments last year when I was rapporteur on the price package."
"Like Mr Happart, I thought that the dual effect of inflation and the abolition of the green ecu would cause an unacceptable fall in prices for farmers given that we were also imposing constraints on them in terms of the environment, animal welfare, traceability and so on. The fall in prices and in agricultural compensation will end up forcing farmers towards greater intensification when all they want to do is balance their budgets."
"In addition to these two sets of amendments, I have tabled amendments with Mr Chesa on wine-growing."
"In anticipation of a future reform of COM 1, it is essential to set up the mechanisms specified in this in order to prevent any breakdown."
"These amendments involve extending the duration of planting rights, allowing planting in advance and providing for new planting rights in order to respond to market changes."
"I deeply regret this situation which will unfortunately prevent a balance being achieved in European agriculture and between each Member State."
"Mr President, as everyone else has already congratulated Mr Happart, I will refrain from doing so as well."
"Rather than concentrating on the issue of prices, on which we all agree with Mr Happart's struggle, I wish to focus on an issue which I feel is symbolic in this joint discussion. This issue is garlic."
"It is symbolic not just because it is a product like olive oil or wine which is subject to replanting rights and not just because it is representative of an era of civilisation, but also because it serves to demonstrate, like honey and other products, what European construction is really about."
"This is a well-known issue."
"We produce garlic in Europe, in the Cuenca region of Castile in Spain and in the Drôme and Gers regions of France. This is quality garlic whose cultivation is ecological in two respects."
"Firstly it requires little water and secondly it can be grown in problem areas thereby helping to ensure that people remain in these areas."
"Our producers should therefore be protected by customs duties and controls."
"However, in addition to traditional imports from Egypt, Argentina and the United States, we also receive imports from China which has a quota of twelve thousand tonnes."
"Yet in reality thirty thousand tonnes are imported from China via countries involved in garlic fraud such as, dare I say, Malaysia - which sends us hundreds of tonnes without growing any itself - India, Jordan and a whole range of other third countries."
"Both the official and illegal Chinese garlic leaves China at 10 centimes per kilo."
"It arrives in Europe at 4.50 francs per kilo which is 0.70 euro, whereas our producers can only produce it for 10 francs per kilo which is approximately 1.5 euro."
"This garlic is then offered to consumers at 3 euro or 20 francs per kilo."
"In other words, our producers are facing unfair competition from garlic produced at half the cost, quite obviously by prisoners in labour camps."
"What is the Commission doing while all this is going on?"
"It is considering referring the matter to the World Trade Organisation following on from its success in the banana dispute."
"No controls are being applied at the frontiers even though the Italians have shown that these can intercept the immigrant or, dare I say it, fraudulent garlic."
"The Netherlands and the United Kingdom, who are involved in these illegal imports, are being allowed to continue. Customs duties are not being imposed whereas the United States applies 376 % customs duties to imported garlic."
"Like the honey adulterated with sugar cane, beet or corn syrups and many other imports, we are allowing adulterated garlic to be imported which can be up to two years old, thus leading to germination problems."
"We are allowing our producers to be destroyed, as with the banana producers in Guadeloupe, the Canary Islands, Martinique and Madeira and our wine producers."
"Prices are falling and inflation is being ignored."
"This is what European construction is really about, Mr President and Commissioner."
"Once again, the circle of stars on the European Union flag is blinding us to a world trade involving leniency and fraud. This really is internationalism."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my disappointment at the outcome of the Berlin summit."
"It is difficult to discuss these matters without also seeing them in the light of what actually happened in Berlin."
"Compared with the Commission's proposal, which we supported, Berlin was in fact a disaster for European agriculture."
"Things we have been working on for a number of years were not completed, and prices were not cut sufficiently."
"I am unhappy about that."
"I agree with those who have expressed regret that Mr Happart will no longer be here, but I would also like to tell Mr Happart that unfortunately I disagree with him - as he is well aware - about this price proposal."
"It is clear that the idea behind the report was to ensure the best possible terms for farmers."
"But I believe we have to recognise the fact that we should have brought our agricultural prices down to a level which reflects the world market price, and so we will have to find other methods to compensate for the social distortion which may result."
"Next I would like to say a few words about Mr Fantuzzi's report on measures to promote our agricultural products in third countries."
"This is an important area in connection with both Agenda 2000 and the forthcoming WTO negotiations."
"We are sympathetic towards the Commission's move, but we believe that the favouritism shown to the olive oil sector is untenable in relation to all the other products which we would also like to sell on the world market."
"To use 40 % of the budget on this sector is perhaps a little excessive."
"However, we cannot endorse the proposal on national cofinancing."
"I do not in fact consider it appropriate to have national cofinancing, because it entails a risk of differential treatment between countries and increases the trend towards a repatriation of common policies."
"That is why I believe that general promotional measures should be financed in full by the Union, and far more funding should be allocated for this than has been proposed by the Commission."
"We also support the rapporteur on this point."
"It is important for us to have an effective instrument to promote exports and react to US measures in this area."
"A fact which has also been pointed out by others in this debate is that the USA spends far more money on promoting exports than the Commission is planning to do here."
"However, where more specific sales promotions are concerned, I think that the private companies and producer organisations involved should also participate in the financing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to congratulate Mr Jové. True to his record, he has once again presented us with a report which is not only technically accurate and thorough but also well balanced from a political point of view."
"The changes to Regulation No 2200/96 establishing the COM of the fruit and vegetable sector may initially appear minor, yet certain aspects of them do give cause for concern."
"A central feature of the COM as it was set up in 1996 was the key role of the producer organisations in terms of both marketing their members' produce and regulating the markets financing withdrawal operations."
"The Commission is now proposing to allow members of producer organisations to sell part of their produce outside the commercial circuits of the producer organisations to which they belong."
"We agree with the rapporteur that such authorisation - doubtless intended to ensure the survival of traditional practices - should not have a negative effect on the operation of the producer organisations. This is particularly critical when allowing direct sales both on the farm and elsewhere."
"Parliament does not object to a certain amount of flexibility, but we must ensure that the main role of the producer organisations is not eroded."
"I therefore welcome the differentiated quantitative limits set by the rapporteur depending on whether the sales take place on the farm or elsewhere."
"I feel that these measures will ensure that the bulk of production continues to be marketed through the producer organisations. Exceptions will remain exceptions and will not become a general rule that weakens the system."
"As regards the modifications to Regulation No 2202/96 providing for aid to citrus fruit producers, the measures introduced by the Commission are indeed sorely needed to compensate for the delay in the receipt of aid. The Commission is therefore to be congratulated on dealing with the situation."
"Unfortunately, the Commission has failed to address the major shortcoming of the COM: the imbalance between the thresholds set for the processing of citrus fruits and production reality."
"The rapporteur has suggested increasing the thresholds to the average amount processed during recent years. The financial implications are reasonable and could be covered under the COM's financial statement."
"He has also suggested setting a 20 % limit on penalties. This could help to stabilise the future of the processing industry by preventing the producers from breaking their contracts and directing their produce to withdrawal which would naturally have a negative effect on the environment and the common dimension of the COM."
"Commissioner, if Mr Jové's proposals prove to be reasonable and well balanced, and if there are no technical objections, there is no sense in waiting for an eventual reform of the COM."
"Instead, the proposals should be implemented immediately, taking advantage of the fact that these regulations are currently being reviewed."
"In my view, what is important is not where ideas come from but whether they are fundamentally sound. On this occasion, Mr Jové has presented us with significant alternatives which could easily be implemented in view of their low cost and sound technical basis."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the average income of farmers in Portugal has continually and systematically shrunk in recent years, particularly between 1996 and 1998."
"The official statistics prove that farmers now earn just over half of what they earned three years ago."
"This is the concrete and dramatic effect of the famous 1992 CAP reform on the weakest farming sector in the European Union."
"This situation should have been corrected by the European Council in Berlin but unfortunately was not, with the incredible acquiescence and even approval of the Portuguese Government."
"As a result of the Berlin agreement, prices will continue to fall, the weakest Mediterranean products and farmers will continue to be discriminated against and the smallest farmers in Portugal will continue to receive the scraps of the financial transfers allocated to Portugal. This means that less than 10 % of the cake will continue to be distributed to more than 90 % of those actually working the land."
"As a result of the Berlin agreement, the big food industries, the large European farmers and the main cereal crops will continue to be favoured and to receive the lion's share of the Community's agriculture budget."
"The Berlin agreement is simply continuing the 1992 CAP reform which was not altered at the end of March when it should have been."
"In this context, the Commission is trying to bring forward the Berlin decisions and is proposing further price reductions for next season."
"We therefore feel it is useful to support the attempt by the rapporteur - who we congratulate - to block these reduction proposals, although we consider that the fair and across-the-board increase which he is proposing, despite applying to all sectors, will still not solve the existing discriminations."
"I must briefly mention the pigmeat sector."
"It is clear that one of the reasons for the grave crisis which has affected and which is continuing to affect this sector has been the Commission's refusal to establish market regulation and intervention mechanisms. These would over time have prevented the accumulation of such large surpluses."
"The Commission should draw the respective and requisite conclusions from this and accordingly not insist on, or even abandon, its proposals to abolish market intervention mechanisms in other agricultural sectors."
"Commissioner, the price package for 1999/2000 is being fixed at a decisive time for the future of European agriculture when farmers' income is continuing to shrink."
"In 1997 and 1998, their income fell by 6.5 % overall."
"The fall in market prices which began in 1998 is continuing in 1999 and the prospects on the world market remain uncertain in some sectors."
"The abolition of the green rates and the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 have resulted in a fall of 1 % to 2 % in the agricultural conversion rates in each Member State."
"It is now clear that the Commission's proposal on the price package is still paltry and gives farmers little room for manoeuvre."
"We must clearly reaffirm the benefits of agriculture in terms of the economy, self-sufficiency in food production, which is its primary function, and occupation of the land."
"We must maintain a prosperous and successful agricultural sector and, in particular, we must prevent the disappearance of certain categories of farmers due to falling income."
"We must not allow agriculture to be taken over by bureaucracy due to an increase in public aid as this would restrict farmers' freedom of action."
"Dare we say that European agriculture has a cost which cannot be reduced any further without calling into question our model of agriculture."
"Furthermore, European consumers benefit from this model because they are assured of quality products and a regular market supply."
"We have also been able to develop the products from our land and the products from organic farming."
"Our agri-food industry also represents a high value added."
"In twenty years, the price of a metric quintal of wheat has fallen by 40 % whereas production costs have increased by 20 % and more in certain sectors."
"It is therefore not difficult to understand why European farmers are worried about their futures."
"The European Union's role is not to sacrifice its agriculture on the altar of enlargement or Americanisation but to allow our farmers to carry out their work and to have a standard of living equal to the average in Europe."
"This is why I will support Mr Happart's amendments. I also wish him every success in his new work."
"Mr President, I welcome this opportunity this morning to speak on the situation regarding agriculture within the European Union and the effects of present policy and of the recent decisions at the Berlin Summit."
"To some extent prices have very little effect on the farmer's actual future, because while we sit and talk about prices and say there will be no inflationary aspects, in the final analysis it is the actual income to the farmer that is important."
"If we look at statistics throughout Europe over the last two to three years, we can see that actual income to the farmer on the ground has dramatically dropped."
"Every year the income drops."
"The question we have to ask ourselves is how long can this continue?"
"How long can agriculture sustain itself in this position?"
"The other question we have to ask is: will there be any future for the industry if young people do not continue to enter agriculture?"
"That is the long-term challenge."
"If we do not have young people coming into agriculture - young farmers beginning at the bottom of the ladder to work their way up - then in the longer term agriculture has no future, long-term or short-term."
"To some extent what we are involved in at the moment in Europe is short-term policies that have no long-term vision."
"We require long-term vision for the future, for the future of agriculture."
"There are also areas within European agriculture that are not covered by any regime, such as the situation in the pig industry and the situation in the poultry industry."
"We are allowing imports to come from third countries outside the European Union; we are allowing food to be imported into Europe that would not come near European standards."
"At the same time we are laying down standards, we are telling our farmers how they should produce food."
"We are tying farmers' hands behind their backs."
"Frozen chickens are being imported from Brazil and from the Far East."
"I challenge the Commission here today to tell us whether these chickens are being examined and whether they meet the same standards as we have?"
"Our processors are being put at risk."
"This is why there is high unemployment."
"Our processors are being put out of business."
"I challenge the Commission here today."
"Let us look at ourselves, let us not ask our farmers in Europe to produce food to a standard that others in the rest of the world cannot match."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the difficulties facing European agriculture are sufficiently well known."
"They are of course being discussed at this very moment."
"Small-scale farmers have problems competing directly with factory farms overseas."
"I am favourably disposed towards the idea of selling more quality products from European agriculture on the world markets by means of the measures proposed in the Fantuzzi report."
"However, as with all support policies, two points need to be taken into account here."
"Firstly, we must ensure that no new bureaucratic bodies are created."
"There is already a proliferation of forums and committees."
"I am therefore critical of the proposal to arrange our own trade visits."
"It begs the question of whether associations already in existence might not be able to perform this task."
"Secondly, the financial burden and the risk must not be borne predominantly by the public sector."
"Only if the operators also bear a considerable proportion of the costs will sensible projects be implemented without public money being wasted."
"That is why the amendment stating that the Community should pay 60 % of the costs in each case rather than a maximum of 50 % is not acceptable."
"Overall, I believe that the measures will unlock new sales potential for our farmers."
"I therefore support the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, I should like to start by saying that 15 minutes ago there were still no amendments in English to two of the reports despite your assurances at 9 o'clock that there would be some within a couple of minutes."
"I turn now to the price package."
"I am afraid I cannot support the rapporteur's amendments calling for price increases across the board."
"Yes, many farmers are struggling at the moment, but large, richer farmers, though profits are down, are very far from the breadline."
"The extra expenditure is not justified overall and these amendments go against the whole thrust of the CAP reforms agreed in Berlin."
"More appropriate would be temporary special measures to assist particular sectors to survive through short-term difficulties."
"Mr Fantuzzi's report on the marketing of EU produce to third countries, mirroring similar schemes within the EU, is one such instance which could assist."
"I wish to welcome the proposals on fruit and vegetables, in particular the move to allow up to 20 % of produce to be sold directly to consumers at the farm gate or through farmers' markets."
"In the UK in particular, the large supermarket chains are gaining ever greater control of producers, insisting from a semi-monopoly position that their suppliers conform exactly to their requirements."
"There has been a reaction against this."
"We have seen the growth of farmers' markets and the demand from consumers for less standardised fruit and vegetables in terms of size, seeking rather flavour and freshness at prices which provide a good deal for both producer and consumer."
"I therefore particularly welcome this proposal."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, ever since agricultural policy was converted into a price support system in the agricultural reform of 1992 to 1994, agricultural debates have in fact lost much of their charm."
"That is why I should like to focus on the future."
"Mr Jové Peres's excellent report also talks about controlled and integrated cultivation."
"I have a very clear request to make to the Commission here: this method of agricultural production is a very good one and deserves to be supported because it takes account of the environment and heeds consumers' wishes."
"However, its impact and the form it takes vary across the Member States."
"Integrated cultivation is not the same thing in each Member State, and that is why we need uniform directives on the integrated and controlled cultivation of fruit and vegetables to be transposed in the Member States."
"However, I should now like to turn to the rural development programme - the second pillar of the new agricultural policy - and say the following: the remarkable feature of this programme is the variety of measures for farmers and rural areas."
"Nevertheless, I do have a question for the Commissioner."
"The risk here is cofinancing."
"How can we guarantee that it will be possible to bring these programmes - which are really good for rural areas - to the people, when governments are refusing to proceed with cofinancing?"
"Early retirement for farmers, the setting-up premium for young farmers and modernising agricultural holdings to reduce production costs, for example, are extremely important measures, and I should like to welcome the fact that they are presented here in a separate rural development pillar."
"But there is still the risk that if cofinancing is not guaranteed by the Member States, then how are the people who live in areas of this kind going to benefit from these programmes, which are undoubtedly valuable, but which cannot be implemented if they are not taken up by the Member States?"
"I have one final question for you: in Germany, can the Bundesländer also act as treaty partners, so that the programmes can at least be implemented in those Länder which are prepared to provide cofinancing?"
"The debate is suspended at this point; it will be resumed this afternoon."
"We shall now hear a statement by the nominee for President of the Commission, Mr Romano Prodi."
"Statement by Mr Prodi, nominee for President of the Commission"
"The next item is the statement by Mr Prodi, nominee for President of the Commission, followed by a debate between the political groups, without a final resolution."
"I therefore give the floor to the nominee for President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, whom I would also welcome to the House."
"Mr Prodi, you have the floor."
"Loud applause"
"Thank you, Mr Prodi."
"I give the floor to Mrs Green."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Group, I wish to welcome Mr Prodi here today."
"His nomination by the European Council came swiftly and decisively in the wake of the resignation of the present Commission, and my Group welcomed the speed with which the Council responded."
"We had urged the Heads of Government in Berlin to act quickly to end the uncertainty and confusion which followed the unprecedented resignation of the 20 present Commissioners."
"We welcomed the Council's clear understanding of the political nature of the moment and of the opportunity it offered to create a new relationship between the European Union institutions and its citizens."
"It could not have acted more quickly and, it has to be said, that it acted with uncharacteristic speed."
"Mr Prodi's statement to us here this morning is the beginning of our ratification process of the new Commission."
"My Group wants the new European Commission to come into office as soon as possible."
"It must be said that the timetable which the European Council has set us is not an easy one."
"Given the European elections in June, given the imminent introduction of the Amsterdam Treaty and given the convergence of general elections in two of our Member States on the same day as the European elections, the timetable presents us with a logistic headache of monumental proportions."
"However, we must find a way around the problems."
"All of us in this House want to see the present Commission leave office as soon as possible."
"To be fair to them, they too have expressed a desire to leave as soon as possible."
"They remain in office only as a caretaker Commission, as the Treaty obliges them to do. It is a situation unloved by them and grossly unsatisfactory to us."
"To carry out our role now with regard to the next Commission, we may have to put our own parliamentary calendar and personal diaries under considerable strain."
"So be it."
"The conclusions of the Berlin Summit asked this Parliament to deal with the nomination of Mr Prodi and the new Parliament to deal with the ratification of the entire new Commission."
"We insist, however, that the ratification of the next President of the Commission must be done rigorously, seriously and properly by this Parliament."
"I welcome very much Mr Prodi's consent to come here today and begin that process in that spirit."
"The role of this Parliament in recent events has been fundamental."
"It is important that we now demonstrate our maturity and see the process through to its conclusion."
"My Group believes that now, together with the Council and a reforming Commission, we can set up a structure and decision-making process which is more appropriate, more in tune with modern governance."
"First and foremost, we want a strong Commission."
"The new Commission must have clear direction, a firm political leadership which is open, it must practise genuine transparency and partnership with the European Parliament and not just pay lip-service to those values."
"None of us here underestimate the problems and challenges of creating such a European Commission."
"However, I want to make clear to Mr Prodi today, on behalf of my Group, that if the next Commission makes a genuine attempt to reform with the courage and vigour which he has expressed this morning, then it will receive the support of my Group."
"My Group will not play toy-town politics with this process."
"We would not do it in January of this year and we will not do it now."
"Mixed reactions"
"Some in this House welcomed Mr Prodi to Parliament; some in this House seem determined to play solely national electoral politics with this issue, ignoring the importance of the moment for Europe, for its policies and for its people."
"Mixed reactions"
"Those concerned for the evolution of this House as the real democratic voice of Europe's people will work together to enhance its role and its rights, which is what our citizens are waiting and watching for."
"My experience during the last few weeks campaigning in Britain has been that, for the first time ever, people know that the European Parliament exists as a force to be reckoned with - not just the subject of myths about curly cucumbers and curved bananas - but a body which has delivered objective evidence through the report of the Committee of Independent Experts and then acted on it."
"My Group takes considerable pride in our role over recent months."
"Mixed reactions"
"We believe that we have acted in the best traditions of parliamentarians: responsible, exercising leadership and acting with integrity."
"Mixed reactions"
"Mr Prodi, you have come to this House today as the Council's designated candidate."
"You come with excellent credentials as a good European and a proven track record of personal integrity, the authority of having held the highest office of the land in one of the largest Member States of the European Union and one of the founding states at that."
"You have demonstrated your ability to put together a reforming government and develop a consensus with all sectors of Italian society, to ensure that Italy was able and ready to enter the first wave of the single currency."
"In this you have confounded the sceptics."
"Hopes in this Parliament of just what you could achieve with those formidable skills as President of the European Commission are high."
"I believe, therefore, that when you come to this Parliament next month, we would like to hear some clear idea of the direction you will take on two fronts."
"It must be said that you began that statement in a very clear and very strong way here this morning, and we very much welcome that."
"Firstly, given the trauma which led to the collapse of the present Commission, we expect to hear a clear commitment - not just to implementing the programme of reforms already agreed by this Parliament and the current Commission in January and the subsequent agreement on the independent investigatory body OLAF - but to further and deeper reforms of substance, in particular (and I was glad to hear you mention it) with regard to the acceptance of political and personal responsibility for work done by officials at whatever level in the European Commission."
"We also expect that you will give due account to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts and work with us in Parliament to examine, assess and implement the necessary reforms."
"Secondly, for my Group, the real substance of the programme of the European Commission is political."
"We understand that, if your appointment is ratified, you will not be able to present a full political programme until you have negotiated with the governments on their nominations to the Commission under the new rights given to the President of the Commission by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We understand from various interviews which you have given, that you intend to use those rights to the full."
"We would not only support you in doing so but would also encourage you to do so."
"The new Commission must act like a college and not like 20 fiefdoms and the moulding of such a Commission will lie in the hands of the new President of the Commission."
"However, for my Group the political content of the programme which will be produced by the new Commission is crucial."
"Last week when you visited my Group, I presented you with our objectives for the next five years in the form of our manifesto for the European elections."
"From this you will see that our agenda is for jobs, training for jobs, protection of the environment, the fight against social exclusion, the need to protect the health and safety of our citizens in a world now having to deal with issues like BSE and genetically modified foods, the struggle against cross-border crime, working together for a stronger Europe in the world and carrying out the necessary reforms to ensure that we can enlarge the Union at the earliest possible moment."
"We will judge the European Commission to be established in the coming weeks on both its political programme and its programme for reform."
"I for one welcome your human and intelligent development of your thinking here this morning - economic, cultural, social, based on peace."
"I think all of us here very much welcome that."
"Finally, I wish to touch on the issue you raised at the end of your speech."
"Many in my Group feel a strong democratic affinity with the proposals of Jacques Delors that we move in the future to a position where the President of the European Commission should derive his or her credibility from the electoral process."
"For this to happen there has to be agreement between the Council and Parliament on the process."
"The sensitive balance between Member States and the institutions of the Union cannot be jeopardised by precipitous action which could damage the process of European integration, in which respect for differing political cultures and democratic practices are paramount."
"In this respect, you, Mr Prodi, have already been unanimously nominated for the office of President of the European Commission by all the Heads of State and Government in the European Union."
"You do not come to this nomination through any defining electoral process."
"However, one of your great strengths is that you bring with you a great experience of success at consensus building."
"It is in that context that my Group very much welcomes the statement you made today that, whilst, of course, you will engage with those with whom you are politically aligned - as we and the Commissioners have always done - we welcome your clear statement this morning that you will not stand as a candidate to this House."
"We might have expected that, with just over three weeks of the life of this Parliament left to go, we might be on the gentle slope towards an election."
"Usually parliaments ease their way out or drift away as legislation peters out and parliamentary life comes to an end."
"In the last week of the last parliamentary term, in 1994, we had to mobilise all outgoing Members to vote on the enlargement of the Union."
"On this occasion not only do we have Agenda 2000 but also we have to face the consequences of a resigned Commission and a new President of the European Commission."
"This is a serious process."
"Mr Prodi, the programme you develop after this debate and your discussion tomorrow evening with the European Council represent an important step in the development of European democracy."
"Applause"
"Mr President, as I listened to Mrs Green's speech I felt the need to apply a brief reality check to it and to the procedures of this House."
"Is this the Pauline Green who, in December, recommended that we vote confidence without even thinking?"
"Applause"
"Is this the Pauline Green who, in January, defended collegiality?"
"Is this the Pauline Green today who promotes individual accountability? I salute her for being one of the few genuine revolutionaries in this House since, on this issue, she has never stopped spinning."
"Sustained applause"
"I should like to say to Mr Prodi how welcome he is here today."
"He is a European of the first rank."
"The ELDR Group looks forward to deepening our engagement and dialogue with him, and to a very productive period for the future."
"But is not for this Parliament, in this mandate, to appoint the president of the Millennium Commission."
"That is the moral, political and legal responsibility of the next mandate."
"Recent events have established, through the work of this House, the need to establish ethical and normative rules for the conduct of European affairs."
"But this is also representative of a significant maturing in the European democratic process, with major institutional and constitutional implications."
"This House will no longer be the junior partner."
"We do not need to be first among equals, but we assert the right to be treated as an equal among equals."
"That is why I welcome the presence of Mr Prodi at this early stage and the dialogue we start."
"I should like to say to you, Mr Prodi, directly on behalf of my group, not as advice nor as an instruction but as a suggestion that you might like to think about, that you should seek in the coming days - and especially tomorrow in your dialogue with the European Council - to assert your own independence, not just of the needs of this House, but of some of the parameters of the Council itself."
"I believe you are your own man."
"You should assert that from the outset."
"I believe you should explain to the Council that it is not appropriate that we should, in a procedure in May, elect you as the legitimate head of what would be an illegitimate Commission."
"I believe you should not launch your project in such a sea of political and institutional ambiguity."
"I would like to think that in May we could give you a political mandate to act as formateur, to go from this House in May to begin to explore in substance, as formateur with a political mandate, what you might do."
"It would be most unfortunate if you should start in a procedure where you are legitimate in the context of a Commission as college - I speak not of individuals but of a college - which itself is discredited."
"In the context of being your own man it is also correct that you should consider getting your project right rather than getting it early."
"What you are dealing with is vitally important for all of us."
"I note your political discretion in saying you will step down from running in the European Parliament election."
"That discretion is your choice and I respect it."
"But I would say to you: be engaged in that election; maintain your political conviction; and fight the cause with those colleagues whose list you will not now head."
"In doing that you will establish that you, Romano Prodi, come to us not as a bureaucrat, not as a technician, but as someone dedicated to European politics, as a politician, and that as a politician you will lead a strong, independent political Commission."
"If you decide to be your own man, to be political, then you will do us all a great favour."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today beginning the process, itself completely new, of appointing a new Commission. This will have the task of completing the term of office of the previous Commission which was forced to resign en masse in order to avoid a motion of censure."
"There are two consequences of this unusual situation."
"Firstly, a new College must be established as quickly as possible. This is because it is detrimental to leave in office for too long a weakened body which under the Treaties can only deal with current business, the limits of which are rather vague."
"The various governments must appoint their Commissioners as quickly as possible so that the European Parliament can, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty, confirm the appointment of the new College. This could take place, in the best-case scenario, during an extension of the constitutive sitting after the June elections."
"Secondly, it would not be right for the process to appoint the new Commission, whose term of office will end at the end of the year, to overlap with the process initiated to establish the Commission which must be appointed to complete a normal term of five years from the year 2000."
"This overlap would have the major disadvantage of obscuring the deep-seated reasons currently prompting us to establish a new team, namely the need for large-scale and profound internal reform of the structures, procedures and working methods of the Commission."
"This is perhaps not an exciting task for the nominee for President but it meets an immediate and unavoidable need."
"The actions of the European Parliament which led to the resignation of the Santer team would seem senseless if this priority of sorting out the Commission institution was not fully understood by the new College."
"This matter requires in-depth examination."
"The Commission must refocus solely on those powers expressly conferred on it by the Treaties, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity reaffirmed by the Amsterdam Treaty."
"The Commission must once again become what it was originally, namely an administration with a mission, responsible for making proposals to the political authorities of the Council and Parliament and for explaining their choices."
"It must not represent the beginning of a European government invested with many poorly fulfilled management tasks."
"The management of common policies must be extensively decentralised. This requires both substantial reinforcement of the control bodies and the establishment of a central anti-fraud office which is independent and has the resources needed to fulfil its mission."
"In light of the conclusions to be announced by the Committee of Independent Experts, which should be available in September, the Commission must establish real internal financial control. It must also introduce professional and totally transparent procedures for awarding public contracts together with procedures for recruiting and managing staff which finally put an end to the nepotism and favouritism which recently have unfairly stained the reputation of an administration whose powers and availability are otherwise acknowledged."
"Finally, a shake-up is required together with the pruning of any dead wood following the disciplinary and legal proceedings which are now in progress."
"This is what we expect from you, Mr Prodi, in the coming months."
"Your vision of the future of European construction is all very interesting but you must, as a priority, return to working order the institution for which you will be required to assume responsibility when your appointment has been confirmed by the European Parliament."
"Applause"
"Mr President, our group - the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left - would like to thank Mr Romano Prodi for his presence in the House today."
"In our view, the political implications are clear."
"Mr Prodi does not wish to be simply the Council's nominee for President or the governments' President. Rather, he wishes to become the President of the people of Europe through a close relationship with the European Parliament."
"The new President will be appointed at a critical stage in the construction of Europe."
"Over and above the institutional crisis, we are faced with a crisis in the wider Europe."
"As Mr Prodi himself pointed out, war has come to Yugoslavia 42 years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome and 10 years after the end of the cold war."
"Human rights are being infringed in the Balkans, most particularly in Kosovo."
"NATO has initiated military intervention."
"Yet the European institutions and a sense of European identity have been absent."
"Could we ever envisage managing the euro if the European Central Bank were not fully operational?"
"How then can we expect European policies to operate effectively under what is merely a caretaker Commission and with Parliament almost at the end of its fourth term since 1979?"
"There is plenty of scope for debate on whether we should be aiming at more Europe or less Europe."
"Personally, I am in favour of more Europe."
"However, I think we all agree that we would like the existing European powers to be imbued with greater democracy, and hope that the sectoral policies will be managed more efficiently."
"That is our message to the nominee and I am sure there is consensus on this."
"As far as we are concerned, this new era in the history of the European Commission must be defined by four conditions or characteristics: a sound democratic basis, transparency, the Commissioners' individual and collective political responsibility to Parliament, and effectiveness in fulfilling objectives."
"In this respect, I am referring to political responsibility to a Parliament that has come of age, and this should be made abundantly clear."
"Parliament is now a mature institution and will soon be embarking on its fifth term. It certainly has not transferred its powers and responsibilities to any committee of experts."
"It simply asked for a report to be prepared to clarify certain situations."
"I do not intend to concentrate on the responsible attitude my group has shown throughout this crisis. After all, as the old Latin saying goes, excusatio non petita, accusatio manifesta ."
"I would merely remind the House of the events and our response to them."
"In conclusion, I should like to make it clear to Mr Prodi that we are keeping an open mind on his investiture."
"We are of course already aware of his record in Italian and European politics, and we shall doubtless learn more about it. Nevertheless, our vote will be based on the programmes and objectives he presents at the investiture sitting, on the credibility of his desire for change and of the necessary proposals for reform, and on his political strategy for dealing with the difficult challenges facing European society."
"We are concerned about the timetable for his appointment and the appointment of the Commission, and would like to set out our position on two issues."
"Our group hopes for a swift procedure and a clear presentation of the Commissioners in line with the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"We are no longer concerned about Mr Prodi's possible candidature in the Italian elections."
"He has clarified the situation very well and in a responsible manner."
"Mr President, I shall finish by pointing out that in view of the serious problems concerning enlargement and our social and economic policies, our group feels that what we need is not just a President of the institutions, but a President of all the people of Europe."
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, your achievements in Italy unquestionably make you a most worthy candidate, because you have done things there which no one thought possible and in the European Union you will face tasks which are every bit as difficult, if not more so."
"Vaclav Havel once said 'what use are the most beautiful of buildings if they serve no purpose?'"
"You have made statements in recent weeks to the effect that the European Union needs a purpose."
"But what does that mean exactly?"
"We think that what matters most is that you should make the Union, which is currently so remote from its people and has fallen into such disrepute as a result of mismanagement and fraud, into a democratic and transparent Union which demonstrates that it can take responsibility and is willing to answer to the people and to the elected Parliament."
"Your appointment has been swift, and that is a good thing."
"But the problem is that the whole of the outgoing Commission, which no longer has the confidence of Parliament and which has truly been discredited, will be staying put until September."
"This, ladies and gentlemen, gives rise to a situation which is politically untenable for us and unworthy of the European Parliament."
"At a time when the Union needs to be forceful, when we have a major political catastrophe in Yugoslavia and beyond, we have a lame-duck Commission."
"So we are urging you, Mr Prodi, to make every effort to come before Parliament with a capable and forceful Commission as swiftly as possible."
"We consider it most important that you should put forward sound proposals for reform of the European Commission which will enable it to exercise collective responsibility in a real and proper way and will also determine the individual responsibility of Commissioners and the responsibility of directors-general, because things have to change in this respect as well."
"We should have liked to hear in your statement a reference to the need for radical adjustments to the European Union's economic policy, because belief in unqualified growth ignores the absolute need to restructure our economies to take account of environmental imperatives."
"We trust you will take on board Parliament's proposal that more women should be appointed as European Commissioners, that they should be able to play their proper part in developing further something which is a part of our acquis communautaire in this context."
"Lastly, we find it splendid that you have said here today that you will not be standing in the elections."
"This is a political decision, worthy of a good European."
"In conclusion, we would say that we are looking for a strong Commission, but a strong Commission which is happy to be accountable to a strong Parliament."
"Only then can we have a new basis for trust."
"Mr President, Mr President-designate, your presence here today is a very positive sign in the spirit of the Amsterdam Treaty which will shortly enter into force. Our group thanks you for coming here."
"During your meetings with the Members of this House, you must have realised the expectations and I would say the high hopes resting on the new Commission, in terms of both the interim Commission and, later on, the permanent Commission to be established in January 2000."
"Naturally, these hopes primarily concern the new Commission President whose role will be absolutely vital."
"We are hoping for and indeed we demand a strong Commission."
"This firstly requires a strong President."
"The current crisis and the resignation of the outgoing Commission under pressure from Parliament have primarily been caused by the Commission's gradual loss of authority."
"Even though important work has been achieved over the last five years, for example with the single currency, this loss of authority is serious because the European Union needs a politically strong Commission."
"The Commission must be strong faced with the national governments, all the more so if the number of countries increases following enlargement."
"It must be strong faced with Parliament, as one of the elements of this strength is precisely its political responsibility before this House."
"It must be strong faced with public opinion because the Commission, whether it likes it or not, is the very personification of the European Union."
"Although this political strength is our main demand for the future Commission, we also have other demands, particularly regarding the internal working of this Commission."
"Even though there are other deep-rooted causes for this situation, as I have just mentioned, the immediate cause of the crisis which prompted the outgoing Commission to resign was the problems in the organisation and working of the College of Commissioners and also in the organisation and working of the services under the authority of the Commissioners."
"Questions must also be asked about the increasing number of powers entrusted to the Commission. This increase in the number of tasks seems paradoxically to have weakened its prestige and certainly has not helped, which speaks volumes."
"Mr President-designate, your work, I should say your mission, will be immense."
"You have already shown in Italy that you are capable of taking it on."
"I have also noted everything you have just said in your introductory speech and your concern that the democratic link between the members of the Commission and universal suffrage should be reinforced."
"On behalf of my group, I hope that you will be courageous and enjoy every success!"
"Applause"
"Mr President, the Europe of Nations Group would also like to congratulate Mr Prodi on his nomination."
"We regard you, Mr Prodi, as a centralist and super-federalist in favour of a United States of Europe, and we are therefore going to vote against your appointment."
"We regard you as Jacques Delors the Second."
"The Europe of Nations Group promises you critical and constructive opposition."
"We shall be critical every time you propose a step in the direction of more Union."
"We shall be constructive every time there is even the slightest chance of having greater openness in the corridors of the Commission."
"What we need now is not a new Commission, but a spring clean by independent individuals who can dispense with any Commission work which is not transnational in nature and introduce complete openness for what remains."
"We need a modern law on public administration, with decentralised responsibility and consequences for those who do not fulfil their responsibilities."
"There should be an end to 50 years of secrecy and privilege."
"Officials who came to Parliament with revelations of fraud should be reinstated on full pay, and those who obstruct investigations should be fired."
"It is scandalous that the current Commission, after its resignation, has decided that Mr Van Buitenen is not allowed to help the Belgian police to investigate any of the matters which led to the Commission's downfall."
"Officials at the Commission should be servants of democracy in our countries and not new overlords."
"To personal friendship and political enmity: 'Benvenuto, Signor Prodi! '"
"Mr President, Mr Prodi, Alleanza Nazionale endorses the formal commitments which you are to make concerning institutional reform in the Union - which the Amsterdam Treaty unfortunately deals with in insufficient detail - and the launch of political union."
"If ever proof were needed, the tragic events in Kosovo and NATO's military intervention there demonstrate the pressing need for the European Union to adopt a common foreign and defence policy, without which it is as though Europe did not exist."
"Developments over the past few days have confirmed the absence of Europe as an independent entity."
"What we are experiencing now proves conclusively, as never before, the urgent need for a European political identity and a recognisable presence on the international stage, with due regard for the alliances to which we belong."
"The European Council stated a long time ago that it would nominate the new Commission President before the elections."
"What displeases us is that your decisions on the Italian front might have been influenced by the European left, which is seeking, somewhat surreptitiously, to prevent you from standing at the elections."
"But in our opinion - turning now to Europe - a sound democratic foundation for the next Commission should enable the political groups to propose to the European Parliament their candidates for Commission President, rather than always having to react to proposals from the governments."
"Therefore, Mr Prodi, we look forward to the 'age of reform and change' which you announced in your speech, but the reforms should be real ones and not just vague proposals: a political union to reinforce the economic union, so as to have a foreign policy, to address ourselves to the Mediterranean, as you said, but also to deal with immigration and crime, as well as humanitarian aid - and here I include the agricultural products which Europe is still throwing away or not producing, to the great detriment of our economy."
"GATT must be overhauled too, since despite our good relations with the United States, we cannot be held to ransom over the safeguarding of our manufactured products and our production system, while being compelled to import - duty-free - products from third countries which obviously result from dumping practices."
"So, Mr Prodi, one aspect of planning the future is to demand explicit social clauses of the countries to which the EU gives aid: third countries, or indeed fourth countries, including the republics of the former Soviet Union."
"The idea, then, is that the Commission and Parliament should plan the future together, reminding the Council that it cannot take all the decisions; otherwise the European people will feel that they count for nothing."
"That is how to begin planning the future!"
"Mr President-designate, you expressed a wish for a strong Europe."
"I fear that your attitude will only contribute to the ultimate disappearance of the European Union."
"You start by accepting that the provisions of the Treaty are not being correctly applied."
"Article 159 requires new Commissioners to be appointed as quickly as possible."
"It also requires the European Parliament to approve one Commission, which will be in place for six months, before a new Parliament approves another Commission which will remain in office for five years."
"You are also preparing yourself to take on the responsibilities of the Commission President without learning the lessons from what has just happened."
"The Commission - and you are surrounded by outgoing Commissioners - was challenged initially by a majority in this House which refused to grant discharge for 1996."
"The accounts for 1996 have therefore not been closed."
"Whatever Mrs Green may say about 'toy-town politics' - and actually this is just what she has been playing at throughout this year - the whole College of Commissioners, and not just one particular Commissioner, was censured by 232 votes."
"The Committee of Experts was extremely severe in its report and comments, stating that none of the Commissioners should be reappointed."
"If you really want a strong Europe, you must therefore be responsible for ensuring that a new Commission is established very quickly."
"This Commission must implement a shake-up, it must provide a cure as far-reaching as the diagnosis and it must permanently change its working methods, without which the whole European Union will die."
"Mr President, we may hear flights of rhetoric, but they can also turn into futile debates."
"And now there are also flights of bombers, carrying your lethal weapons."
"I must formally protest about the policy of war being conducted in Europe, supported by the European Union on the orders of the Americans!"
"Exclamations"
"This criminal policy of aggression against Serbia and its small heroic population is a violation of the UN Charter and also of the NATO Treaty. It is also a violation by France of its Constitution!"
"The continued bombardment of economic targets and civilian populations is one of the most cowardly and unpardonable acts in 50 years!"
"May God ensure that you do not turn out to be the sorcerer's apprentices allowing a third world war to break out!"
"Mixed reactions"
"I give the floor to Mrs Green under Rule 108."
"I would remind her that she has the floor to rebut any remarks that have been made about her person in the course of the debate or opinions that have been attributed to her, or to correcting observations that she herself has made."
"Mr President, I wish to make a personal statement as my name has been mentioned."
"I want to say that for a British parliamentarian the cut and thrust of party politics which we heard here this morning is actually like manna from heaven and say to those who are shouting at me I actually thrive on it."
"I note that the level of personal abuse towards me from the right of this House has risen as the right's political fortunes have fallen all across the European Union."
"Mixed reactions"
"I can accept that, and the European public are aware that it was the European People's Party which split from top to bottom in March on the motion of censure in this House, with a majority voting the Socialist position."
"Mixed reactions"
"Their shouting and abuse is designed to obscure that fact."
"Mr Martens is fond of telling us in this House that in March his party asked for the resignation of Mrs Cresson."
"He forgets to tell the House that he, and his party, also asked for the resignation of other Commissioners who were found not to be guilty by the Independent Group of Experts."
"Finally, may I say to Mr Cox that his statement was in line with the cheap opportunism for which his political family is famous."
"Mixed reactions"
"I shall give the floor to Mr Martens on the same basis, but I would ask for an end to these constant personal references, which will turn this into a never-ending issue."
"You have the same right, Mr Martens, and you have the floor."
"Mr President, Mrs Green has the unfortunate habit of turning a political remark into a personal one."
"Applause"
"I would just add that in January of this year she tabled a motion of no confidence, saying that the Socialist Group would vote against."
"That was the start of the crisis, and if she is criticised for that political misjudgement she should not take it as a personal comment."
"Applause"
"As was previously agreed, Mr Prodi will reply to all these speeches during the forthcoming investiture debate. I do not think we should interrupt the sitting."
"We ought really to move straight on to the votes, because as things stand at the moment, we are due to deal with 200 votes today, a further 300 tomorrow, and we are already running a quarter of an hour late."
"VOTES"
"Parliament approved the Commission proposal"
"Mr President, I would like to speak to Amendment No 12."
"However, before I do that, I would like to apologise to the House."
"Last night my report was called and I was not here."
"I set off yesterday mid-afternoon from London City Airport."
"Seventeen hours later I arrived here. To add insult to injury my suitcase was lost."
"So I was deprived of my opportunity to speak to this worthwhile report which makes motoring safer for all citizens of Europe."
"I am very much aware of Mr Rübig's amendment, I approve of it and I recommend to the House that we vote in favour."
"It is an improvement on the amendment voted through EMAC."
"Applause"
"I must say you are looking very glamorous this morning."
"One would not have known your suitcase had not arrived."
"Laughter"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"A word or two if I may, Mr President."
"We noted here at yesterday's sitting that it was the first time, in point of fact, that a report on drugs had been able to command broad support, but also that the balance should not be disturbed."
"I myself have tabled an amendment, and it transpired in the debate that this might give rise to difficulties."
"I would ask you to remove the word 'uncontrolled' from the last line of Amendment No 9, or to agree to a split vote in which people can vote for or against this word."
"But I would prefer you to delete the word 'uncontrolled'."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Mr President, we have received a document today from the services telling us what Members should do to prepare themselves for the move to the new IPE IV building."
"The majority of Members have never seen the inside of the IPE IV building, though I am told that lots of people who are not Members have been taken around."
"I wonder whether during the next plenary part-session arrangements could be made for those Members who would like to have a preview of the building, to be able to do so?"
"I do not see any difficulty with that."
"I suggest that you contact the security service if you wish to be escorted round the building."
"The problem until now is that work has been continuing in the building."
"I would also suggest that perhaps we could organise groups of Members to go round."
"Mr President, the action plan on an area of freedom, security and justice, presented by the Austrian Presidency and adopted by the Vienna European Council in December 1998, is quite a rigorous text. Its clear aim is to ensure that the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty are implemented in a realistic way."
"The same cannot be said for the European Parliament report on this subject which has just been adopted by the House today. As usual, it seeks to put the federalist obsession before the real needs of the people."
"For example, the European Council's action plan declares from the outset that although freedom of movement is a fundamental objective of the Treaty, this must generally be assessed bearing in mind the security requirements."
"According to this text, freedom involves more than the free movement of people as 'it is also freedom to live in a law-abiding environment'."
"On the subject of immigration and asylum policies, the Council text then adds that 'particular priority needs to be attached to combating illegal immigration'."
"However, the tone changes completely in the European Parliament report."
"The main priority becomes, and I quote, 'a more positive definition of fundamental rights and European citizenship'. It is as if the Member States used to be part of a semi-barbaric state where the rights of the individual were constantly being violated and where we had waited for centuries for the Eurocrats to appear and finally impose the rule of law."
"Clearly, we are all being taken for half-wits."
"Under these conditions, it is no surprise to see that, on matters involving the movement of people, the European Parliament regards freedom of movement as the primary Community right, whereas combating illegal immigration is buried in the middle of a list of other objectives."
"Our position is obviously closer to the Council's although we would stipulate that each Member State must retain sovereign control over its territory."
"The development of the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice is extremely important for the people of Europe, and we therefore welcome the Bontempi report."
"However, we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area."
"Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens."
"As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law."
"Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental."
"The Danish Social Democrats have abstained from voting on the Bontempi report."
"The report is a broad survey of the various instruments aimed at ensuring the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Danish Social Democrats are in favour of ensuring the basic rights for people living in the EU."
"However, there are several demands in the report which we oppose."
"These include the introduction of a 'Corpus Juris', harmonising the basic provisions of procedural law in the Member States and operational powers for Europol."
"We have therefore abstained from voting on the report as a whole."
"I welcome this report with great satisfaction."
"It provides a fair analysis of the action plan of the Council and Commission on implementing an area of freedom, security and justice."
"This plan responds to the demand of the Cardiff European Council and is part of a clear and ambitious approach to engage the Union in reforms which will bring it closer to the people of Europe."
"An area of this kind clearly can only be constructed gradually."
"The Schengen Agreement, the Maastricht Treaty and, of course, the Amsterdam Treaty have been important steps in this construction process."
"I am also pleased to see that a new Title headed 'Visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons' has been inserted in the Treaty establishing the European Community. This will allow consistency to be increased in the key areas directly affecting the people of Europe."
"However, I must indicate my disagreement with the retention of the exemption clause benefiting the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland."
"Everyone is well aware of the exorbitant cost in terms of consistency of an overly flexible Europe."
"The challenges of creating such an area are extremely great."
"The rapporteur rightly asserts that this area must be one of the Union's priorities."
"I support this idea because we must meet the expectations of our people who aspire to live securely within the borders of the European Union."
"The response to this legitimate demand requires improved border controls and the prevention of crime."
"Being secure also implies knowing that you can assert your rights by having recourse to justice."
"We all know, myself in particular, that cross-border disputes sometime pose inextricable problems."
"We must therefore act to simplify access to the courts and to facilitate cooperation between the judicial authorities of each Member State."
"Finally, one of the basic points is to draw up a Charter of fundamental rights."
"Such a text will clearly identify the rights which the people may assert within the European Union."
"This will ensure that the famous concept of European citizenship, which for many remains an empty shell, will finally take shape."
"The level of these rights must be as high as possible."
"The Court of Justice of the European Communities must act as guarantor of these rights."
"It is absolutely unacceptable that the latter's jurisdiction is limited on such matters."
"I hope that the debate which will take place on this subject in October 1999 in Finland will be productive because there are still gaps despite the positive advances."
"The role of the European Parliament must go beyond simple consultation and the unanimity rule must be replaced by the qualified majority rule."
"We are voting against Mr Bontempi's report on the provisions on establishing an area of freedom, security and justice, because we believe the report puts the European federal state at the top of the EU's list of priorities."
"The report emphasises its support for the so-called 'Corpus Juris' proposal, which is aimed at introducing a European public prosecutor who would be in charge of legal proceedings. At the same time, it stresses that minimum rules should be established for what constitutes a criminal offence and what penalties should be applied."
"If these efforts come to fruition, it would mean the establishment not only of a political area but also a judicial area in the EU, where Member States would be obliged to harmonise their different legal traditions and different moral views about what constitutes a criminal offence."
"In doing so, we believe that EU cooperation is taking a major step towards the establishment of a federal state."
"No one knows what implications the proposals in the report carry with them, but it is clear that the proposed encroachment on national sovereignty is in conflict with the derogations provided for individual Member States with regard to the police and the judiciary, for example."
"The EU's efforts to establish an area of freedom, security and justice are aimed at safeguarding the legal rights of individuals."
"We do not believe that legal rights and public confidence in the judicial and political systems will be strengthened by undermining the various judicial cultures of individual Member States and by transferring competence to a system which does not have substantial support among the peoples of the Member States."
"The provisions in the field of justice and home affairs should therefore be a matter for national governments."
"We think this is an excellent report."
"On one point, however, we see things somewhat differently."
"We believe that the definition of a child as laid down in the international conventions, namely anyone under the age of 18, should be adhered to."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted in favour of a joint action to combat child pornography on the Internet."
"The fight against crime on the Internet is transnational by nature, and there is therefore a need for international and European cooperation in this area."
"So this joint action, including practical cooperation which also involves Internet service providers, should begin as soon as possible."
"However, we do not support the call for harmonisation of the age of consent in the Member States."
"Setting the age of consent is the responsibility of the Member States."
"No further proof is required of the urgent need to start relentlessly combating the child pornography networks which are invading the Internet."
"This is why I support Mr Schmid's report."
"Although Internet users and service providers clearly have a role to play in this fight for human dignity, we cannot rely on them alone."
"I therefore believe that certain individual or collective initiatives must be welcomed."
"Thanks to this cooperation with the competent authorities, many examples of these abhorrent dealings have been stopped from causing harm."
"However, in my opinion it is essential to pool our human and material resources through Europol in order to make the fight against these crimes more effective."
"In this respect, I share the rapporteur's opinion about the description of this child pornography as this is indeed a crime against which the Member States must act accordingly."
"However, although the European Union is taking an important step in this fight, it is essential that we establish a strong initiative with regard to third countries so that these networks cannot gain a foothold in any other countries."
"Finally, it is imperative to include the site 'hosts' so that the effect of the actions undertaken in this area can be increased, while ensuring that the main feature of the world wide web, namely freedom, is maintained."
"Yet this freedom cannot under any circumstances become synonymous with irresponsibility and anonymity."
"I will be supporting this report."
"Some argue that the Internet should be completely uncensored."
"I disagree."
"Although I take a permissive view of what should be allowed, certain images and demands are beyond the pale."
"Paedophilia is one limit; others, for example, are incitement to racial hatred and so-called 'snuff' movies which show real examples of torture and killing."
"It has been argued that control of Internet content is very difficult."
"That may be true, but so is preventing murder and we make that illegal."
"More recently Parliament's Scientific and Technological Options Assessment (STOA) unit prepared a report on technical aspects of Internet control which revealed that it may be simpler than originally thought."
"For example a feature of paedophilia and pornography is large areas of flesh tone."
"We may therefore have the means."
"All that is lacking may be to find the will."
"I will vote for the Schmid report as I believe one of the most disturbing consequences of the development of the Internet is the apparent freedom it gives to distributors of child pornography."
"Tackling child pornography requires the cooperation of Internet users who should be encouraged to inform law enforcement authorities if they discover or suspect that an Internet site is being used for the distribution of child pornography."
"As the Internet is no respecter of national frontiers cooperation between Member States to tackle this reprehensible practice is vital."
"In every Member State the production, processing, supply, distribution and possession of child pornography must be made a criminal offence and Europol should immediately be informed of cases of child pornography."
"This is a welcome step in the right direction of improved European cooperation aimed at stamping out this disturbing trade."
"Mr President, the CDU and the CSU were obliged to vote against the Reding report, because it was rendered unacceptable by amendments from the left."
"We regret that the important issues of asylum seekers and refugees from civil war are linked time and again to various ideological demands: see Amendment No 12 on voting rights and so forth."
"The hypocrisy of those who vote in favour of amendments of this kind is intolerable, since it is precisely they who are then not prepared in cases such as that of the Kosovo refugees and displaced persons to take in their share of displaced persons."
"Take France, for example: Mr Jospin has not taken in anyone from Kosovo."
"In Bavaria, we have already created the capacity for 7 000 people."
"This is about us providing real and practical help and not continuing to overburden this important subject with our own ideological and unrealistic desires."
"If this continues to happen and there is a real emergency, we will remain inflexible, we will not be able to help, and we will provoke unwelcome public opinion."
"That is why I call on the left of the House finally to reach a consensus on these issues."
"The strategy paper presented by the Austrian Presidency on the European Union's migration and asylum policy provides a worrying assessment. It states that 'Neither the potential will to emigrate nor actual emigration from the main regions of origin has decreased in the past five years (rather the opposite)."
"Furthermore, neither the control activities at the external borders of Schengen and the Union nor the Member States' laws on aliens and asylum stop illegal migration.'"
"The paper also very rightly notes the changes which have occurred in the types of migratory movement."
"In previous decades, these movements largely resulted from the bipolarity between the Western and Communist worlds whereas they are now mainly caused by conflicts between ethnic groups, which are followed by exoduses, or the precarious living conditions in many countries."
"As a result, the Council's strategy paper calls for a review of objectives and the 'Europeanisation' of instruments."
"In particular it makes the following proposals: reduction of migratory pressure at source by intervening in the main countries of origin of immigrants; reduction of illegal immigration by reinforcing controls and stepping up the fight against illegal immigration networks; definition of an overall concept of control of legal entry to the Member States, specifically in the country of departure, in the transit states and in the country of final destination, and finally, greater recourse to quantitative control methods (quotas) for new immigration, including the reunification of families."
"In view of these objectives, we can only be concerned about the proposal for a new refugee protection system which in many cases risks forming an additional magnet."
"Unfortunately, in the Reding report the European Parliament has tried to reduce or completely alter the force of these proposals. This clearly demonstrates the problems which we would face if an attempt was made to establish a somewhat restrictive immigration policy in codecision with Parliament."
"It is specifically in the second chapter, involving the institutional instruments of the policies to be conducted, that the Austrian Presidency's document seems most lacking."
"It goes without saying that the migration problem is affecting all the European countries and that it would be preferable to define a European response."
"However, this response would only make sense if it was more stringent than the current policy."
"Specifically, the European institutional system, as provided for by the Amsterdam Treaty, with the Commission's monopoly on initiative and the codecision of the European Parliament, risks producing a laxer response."
"We are therefore overwhelmed with contradictions."
"In addition, the definition of a European policy should not mean abolishing all national independence in decision-making."
"Otherwise, we risk removing responsibility from the Member States and once again achieving a result which is contrary to that intended."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations therefore believes that this policy must be maintained in a context where decisions are taken unanimously, with a safeguard clause to be used at the discretion of the Member States thus allowing rapid corrections if necessary."
"Mr President, Europe cannot take all the misery of the world on its shoulders."
"This is what the former French Prime Minister, Mr Rocard, once said about France."
"All the world's refugees cannot come to Europe."
"If they must be accommodated somewhere, they should be placed in countries with which they have the closest ethnic, cultural or religious links."
"If the Kosovar Albanians have to be accommodated, they should go to Albania or Turkey. They should not be placed in western Europe whose economic and social advantages attract anyone and everyone, thus leading to migratory influxes which are as harmful to the host country as to the country of origin."
"The European nature of the Union must be preserved in terms of its people, its culture and its religion."
"To achieve this, we must fix and adhere to an objective of zero immigration."
"This debate today is unfortunately very topical."
"Even as I am speaking, thousands of Kosovars are being brutally deported from their country, having been hounded from their homes, and are now packed into emergency refugee camps waiting to possibly return to their country."
"Some of them, particularly those in Macedonia, are being forced to board planes for unknown destinations."
"We, the Member States of the European Union, must welcome these refugees as required. This means that we must allow them every dignity and subsequently do everything in our power to ensure that they can quickly return to their country."
"It is in this context that we are discussing the proposed Joint Action today."
"I fully support its objectives which are to improve reception conditions for displaced persons and asylum seekers and to facilitate the voluntary return of refugees."
"We must improve the reception conditions in material terms but also in human terms because these people are more often than not in a state of utter psychological turmoil."
"I do not need to say any more for you have all seen the terrible pictures broadcast constantly on television screens around the world, except on Serbian television of course!"
"Reception is only the first stage."
"We must also facilitate the return of these people to their country and ensure their reintegration."
"However, I must point out a shortcoming, the gravity of which is underlined by the events in the Balkans."
"The Commission has omitted to include an essential aspect which the European Parliament put forward, namely emergency aid in cases of sudden influxes of refugees from a region affected by a severe crisis."
"Finally, I must highlight Parliament's commitment to refugees and its ability to anticipate events."
"For the 1999 financial year, this House proposed creating a European Refugee Fund."
"From the year 2000 this Fund should finance the whole refugee policy."
"And also from this date these matters will come under the competence of the Community, which can only be welcomed."
"With the Kosovo crisis raging a new urgency is given to the two Council proposals to deal with the situation of refugees."
"These two proposals are being made under the 'third pillar' and will need to be revisited when the Treaty of Amsterdam is in force."
"The first measure is intended to support and develop existing measures at local, regional, national and EU levels to make refugees independent and prevent them from becoming socially marginalised."
"The second measure is a proposal for joint action supporting the reception and voluntary repatriation of refugees, displaced persons and asylum applicants."
"The action aims to improve reception conditions for asylum seekers and displaced persons and to facilitate their voluntary return and reintegration in their countries of origin."
"The amendments suggested by Mrs Zimmerman are welcome and on the whole strengthen the proposals."
"In particular, the establishment of a European Refugee Fund and support for reception centres in Member States are important initiatives."
"In general, we support the use of environmental taxes as a means of bringing about improvements in the environment."
"However, we only support a common EU environmental tax as long as it focuses on the environment and as long as the proceeds are returned to the Member States."
"We cannot support the EU regulating these national economic instruments solely in order to promote trade and the internal market."
"We have therefore voted for individual parts of the report, but have abstained from voting on the report as a whole."
"We voted against the report in the final vote for the following reasons."
"The report contains a number of environmentally friendly proposals to which we have already given our support."
"However, the report is based on a system of so-called tax trade-offs that are designed to reduce countries' tax bases, drain national insurance systems and make social redistribution harder."
"On the whole the report is - and here we quote the Environment Committee - more 'brown than green'."
"There is no reference in the report to nuclear power and its problems."
"The implication of the report is that there would be interference in tax policy, which would impinge on the role of national parliaments to represent the people's right to decide on their own taxes."
"It goes far beyond the strict principle of minimum rates of taxation."
"It would give the power of taxation to institutions which lack democratic legitimacy and over whose policies the people have no control."
"We are voting in favour of the Cox report because these ecotaxes are a logical political measure which make sense under certain conditions."
"However, some important steps first need to be taken:"
"a fundamental tax reform with a general reduction in overall tax revenue; - targeted measures; - a clear promotion of renewable sources of energy.The ecotaxes, conceived as a policy instrument, should under no circumstances degenerate into a means of tapping new sources of revenue."
"That is also why we reject Amendment No 6."
"The proposal for a Directive on the taxation of energy products has returned before this House and I must again congratulate Mr Cox on the further simplification and rationalisation which he has tried to achieve. However, I must reiterate the concerns expressed previously and incorporated into the amendments for which I was jointly responsible."
"Regardless of the fact that a tax which alters the production functions cannot be regarded as neutral, it is important in terms of this neutrality to ask whether this is just one attainable objective or the ultimate objective to be attained."
"It is actually more important to achieve a more prosperous economy offering employment opportunities. This is a priority objective and we must determine whether this will be damaged by excessive taxation of energy."
"In any case, as one of the primary concerns must be not to distort competition between production sectors and means of transport, we must avoid unjustifiably penalising some and not others."
"The labour costs of each one must of course be taken into account but this cannot be the only circumstance considered, in case we unfairly let off other sectors and methods of transport which are equally noisy and polluting."
"It is not acceptable to aggravate the situations of families with more modest resources who must spend higher percentages of their incomes on energy. Also, the situation of peripheral countries must not be worsened by forcing these to incur higher transport costs, particularly where this involves means of transport which are necessarily large energy consumers - as in the case of road transport - for which realistic alternatives cannot immediately be found."
"The proposals before us are partly a response to the requirement to review the minimum rates of excise duty on hydrocarbons laid down in Article 10 of Directive 92/82/EEC. They are also a result of the Council's request, following the deadlock in negotiations on the CO2 /energy tax, to put forward new proposals in the field of taxation of energy products."
"The aim of any tax should be that it is simple to understand, easy to collect, predictable and difficult to evade."
"This is why we are in favour of the polluter pays principle."
"However, the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations shares with all sectors of economic activity a deep concern at the introduction of new taxes on energy products or the increase of the present taxes."
"We consider that the establishment of a Community framework for the taxation of energy products, with the Member States having the opportunity to act in a flexible manner in their application of indirect taxes, may provide an appropriate escape route from the dilemma into which the failure of the CO2 /energy tax has led the Union."
"This may also be a way of achieving the internal energy market and may provide a necessary response to the undertakings given in Kyoto."
"Taxation actually partly determines the price of energy products. It may therefore act as an incentive to optimise energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency and by reducing the emission of pollutants into the air and the overall generation of waste."
"We consider that a comprehensive ecologically-based tax reform may provide a real weapon for combating unemployment in the Member States, provided that an environmental clause is introduced into the WTO rules as we expressly requested during the last GATT negotiations."
"Otherwise, we will end up creating discriminatory measures which penalise our own companies."
"The increase in tax yield from energy consumption, if correctly compensated for by a reduction in labour costs on companies, may have a positive effect on employment. This of course depends on production tools in the industrial energy-consuming sectors not being relocated, as was seen for example in France during the 1970s in the horticulture sector."
"This is why our group voted in favour of the amendments promoting simple taxation, including the various dispensation principles, but rejected all the amendments which would systematically increase the taxation of energy products."
"Some amendments actually envisaged introducing a systematic coefficient of increase for all energy products, without taking into account the international constraints applicable within the WTO."
"Mr President, the European Police Office or Europol was set up with a purely intergovernmental status and under the control of the national parliaments. Its purpose is to gather information on international crime and exchange this between the Member States of the European Union."
"This is an extremely important task which deserves to be pursued very energetically, with the sole concern being its effectiveness in practice."
"However, the European Parliament is clearly not satisfied with this."
"As is apparent from the Nassauer report which we have just discussed, this House wants to take Europol and make it into an example of a supranational administration."
"This House is essentially asking for Europol to be converted into a European police unit with operational powers in the Member States and powers of command over the national police forces."
"Would this federal super-police force actually contribute anything more to the fight against crime?"
"The Nassauer report does not demonstrate this and indeed does not even consider this question."
"You would almost think that this was of no importance."
"The report's main objective is instead to advance the federalist cause."
"We therefore gradually learn that the supranational Europol should take orders from a European public prosecutor's office, itself under the responsibility of the European Commission, which would be accountable in this respect only to the European Parliament."
"This is all very well in theory."
"However, in practice it is clear that once again serious work and the progress which really could be achieved will be sacrificed to totally futile ideological quarrels. These will end up blocking all progress as the countries and parties square up to each other."
"The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations prefers serious work."
"We want Europol to develop within the intergovernmental framework because it will be more effective to rely on the national authorities to improve the exchange of information."
"We also want to really make the system democratic by placing it under the control of an interparliamentary monitoring committee. This would consist of representatives from the national parliaments who would be responsible for reporting to their respective houses."
"The development of the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice is extremely important for the people of Europe, and we therefore welcome the Nassauer report."
"However, we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area."
"Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens."
"As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law."
"Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted against an extension of Europol's powers."
"We do not support turning Europol into a supranational institution."
"We are not in favour of developing Europol in the direction of a European police force with operational powers. Nor are we in favour of setting up a European judicial authority to direct Europol."
"Europol should not develop into a European police authority, but should continue to be a form of intergovernmental cooperation."
"The report by our colleague follows on logically from our work on the fight against crime."
"As an elected representative of a cross-border region, I read Mr Nassauer's report with great interest."
"In view of the development of criminal networks, we must rapidly adapt our weapons against these. This is why Europol must be able to adapt accordingly."
"However, it has a credibility problem with the people."
"Like the rapporteur, I hope that Europol can become a genuine police force with cross-border operational powers."
"There are many cases which should prompt us to consider and accelerate this development in order to establish a unit which is capable of actively combating this scourge."
"In this respect, the European Union must have jurisdiction in order to conduct the investigations needed to combat crime."
"This House has already given its opinion on these matters on many occasions."
"It is now up to the Commission and our governments to take steps to ensure that crime is fought effectively."
"We have no time to lose on this."
"As the aim of bringing Europe closer to the people seems to be the stated desire of an increasing number of politicians, this must now be put into practice."
"By this means, I wished to emphasise once again that I clearly see that the lack of parliamentary supervision of Europol is a problem, and that any steps to resolve this have my full support."
"I have of course also voted in favour of these points."
"However, I think that the approach adopted in the report, of putting Europol under the supervision of a Commissioner and thus under the supervision of the European Parliament, is the wrong one."
"I certainly cannot agree to Europol having higher status than national officers either: this is unacceptable."
"For these reasons, I voted against the report in the final vote."
"Mr President, the whole idea of corpus juris is something that has not been discussed in public."
"There have been no public discussions on it; there have been no discussions in national parliaments."
"This has all taken place in secret, behind closed doors."
"What is most amazing is the silence of the British Members of this House."
"For Britain and Ireland the whole legal system is under serious threat."
"The proposal is to harmonise the EU criminal legal system on the continental inquisitorial model."
"The British and Irish systems are very different."
"I cannot understand why no British Member in this House has raised the question of what is going on here."
"The British and Irish systems are very much based on the presumption of innocence, trial by one's peers, as in the Magna Carta ."
"The issue of habeas corpus is also in danger here - the guarantee of safety while somebody is in custody."
"My main point is the whole lack of debate on this issue, the fact that all this is taking place in secret."
"It has been pushed through behind closed doors so that Members of this Parliament are not even aware of what are the real consequences of corpus juris ."
"They should look at what is going on."
"The British Members should look at whether they want to get rid of their own system and bring in this EU criminal legal system which will be based on the continental inquisitorial model."
"I do not think the British or Irish public want this kind of system."
"If they do, at the very least people should have the right to discuss what kind of system is being brought in."
"Going back to what the last speaker said, there is a major rush on here to harmonise everything within Europe, to actually set up a European police force."
"The next thing will be a European army."
"We are harmonising the legal systems, whether for better or worse, without proper public debate, without public accountability."
"This whole institution lacks any kind of democratic control or democratic accountability."
"The people of Europe have had no say whatsoever in the direction Europe is taking."
"Something has to be done about it."
"People in the Member States have to know the decisions that have been taken on their behalf which may not, in the long-term, be in their interests."
"The development of the EU into an area of freedom, security and justice is extremely important for the people of Europe, and we therefore welcome the Wiebenga report."
"However, we believe that the proposals it contains to give Europol operational powers and to establish a European public prosecutor are incompatible with what has already been laid down in this area."
"Europol should merely complement and assist national police forces and not be able to take direct action against our citizens."
"As regards the establishment of a European public prosecutor, we are opposed to such a move because there is no supranational cooperation on matters of criminal law."
"Cooperation in this area should continue to be intergovernmental."
"The Danish Social Democrats have voted against the introduction of a common European public prosecutor."
"We should not have a common European criminal law or public prosecutor."
"We can fight crime just as effectively with the existing instruments, including Europol and the conventions on extradition and mutual judicial assistance."
"We should not harmonise for the sake of harmonising."
"And in fact the differences between the criminal laws of the Member States are not so great that they cannot be overcome by using existing intergovernmental instruments."
"Efforts to successfully combat international crime are right and proper."
"Any obstruction of effective prosecution by an individual Member State must be prevented, so that public safety can be guaranteed."
"However, this does not justify the creation of a supranational authority which would intrude heavily on the authority of the individual Member States and thus flagrantly impair their sovereignty."
"Effective prosecution can only be guaranteed by the authorities on the spot."
"For these reasons, although I voted in favour of the report, I voted against the proposed appointment of a European public prosecutor in the final vote."
"The report from the Council to the European Council on activities on drugs and drugs-related issues under the UK Presidency is, generally speaking, a constructive one."
"The contents of the report reveal that the proponents of decriminalisation are now on the defensive."
"The drugs debate is now being conducted in an objective way here in Parliament, in spite of the differences that exist between the approaches taken by Members from countries which have different drugs policies. We think we have contributed towards achieving this progress."
"It means that in future the EU will be able to work in a more constructive manner."
"This is a vital achievement, since the problems posed by drugs are still enormous both in Europe and the world in general."
"I can certainly endorse some of Mrs d'Ancona's criticisms of the Council document on the post-1999 EU drugs strategy."
"I definitely share the rapporteur's demand that Commission and Council forces should be joined in a single document so that there is greater clarity and, above all, better coordination leading to more effective and rational action on drugs."
"I also endorse her criticism of the Council's attitude to Parliament: consultation did indeed take place at a very late stage."
"Finally, I can also go along with her comments concerning the need to promote prevention and information activities, to contribute to crop substitution and to ensure more effective coordination between the police and customs to combat drug trafficking."
"However, I certainly cannot endorse Mrs d'Ancona's habitual pragmatic approach to the problem of drugs."
"This pragmatic approach consists of resigning oneself to the fact that drug abuse is a social phenomenon which is virtually impossible to eradicate: according to the rapporteur, it can be contained and fought only by means of a damage-limitation exercise; in plain language, through the legalisation of soft drugs and the controlled administration of hard drugs."
"To the rapporteur, this is the only way of de-ideologising the drugs debate."
"I cannot share her reasoning: ideology and politics have nothing to do with a drugs strategy; all that really does count is the value of and respect for life."
"For these reasons, since I am convinced that a drugs strategy cannot ultimately be based on the approach set out by Mrs d'Ancona, I am voting against the motion."
"Voting on a report by Mrs d'Ancona on drugs and drug addiction has become something of an institution in this House."
"However, all the texts which she has presented through a unanimous Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs have had an inexorable tendency to be devoid of any proposals. They are simply mediums for general requests."
"However, by their very existence and the enterprise of those supporting them, these reports are still a constant means of pressure in favour of more libertarian measures."
"Mrs d'Ancona would like to ensure 'a de-ideologising of the drugs debate in Europe'."
"But what is the ideology of those who maintain that respect for human dignity requires us to ban anything which may harm us or of those who believe it is enough to control the use of drugs to limit their potential risks to health?"
"It is certainly essential to allow and develop cooperation between all those who, in one way or another, through either prevention or repression, are involved in the fight against this scourge of our societies. However, cooperation must also especially be encouraged with those who are victims of drugs and with their families."
"In this general context, it is not right to trivialise drug addiction as an insignificant activity of no consequence."
"At a time when restrictions on smoking are rightly increasing and when authorised alcohol levels for driving are being reduced, is it appropriate to provide a contrary example of irresponsible liberalisation, particularly when drug addiction causes greater harm to people?"
"We voted against this report and not just because, in the words of the supporters of decriminalisation, it contains nothing of interest. We feel it constitutes another step in this policy of gradual rather than rapid progress which has been rejected by a glimmer of common sense among a majority in this House."
"That concludes Voting Time."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.42 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Agriculture (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on agriculture."
"Mr Jové Peres has the floor."
"Mr President, I will try to be very brief and will confine myself to the oral question to the Commission on imports of garlic."
"The Commission's response on imports of garlic is quite a surprise, ladies and gentlemen."
"The problem does not lie in differences of analysis."
"For once, everyone seems to be in agreement."
"The problem is one of pace."
"The problem itself was identified as far back as 1993, but the solution was inadequate."
"Clearly, when the safeguard clause was applied to garlic from China, it was already possible to predict that a number of traders would set up triangular arrangements, nationalising the Chinese garlic in Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Iran, Malaysia, Jordan, India, or any other country."
"Such a system is easy to conceive and is also viable, given how slack certain Member States usually are when it comes to carrying out customs checks."
"Triangular trade has therefore continued to expand, and garlic production in the Community is moving ever closer to extinction."
"In Spain alone, 15 000 farms and more than three and a half million direct jobs are at risk."
"Furthermore, production is highly concentrated in certain geographical areas."
"The social and economic consequences of the present situation will therefore be very serious."
"Can this state of affairs really be due to administrative slowness?"
"Can rural development measures really compensate for such shortcomings?"
"It is therefore surprising that the Commission has stated that there is no time to implement an effective system this season because the procedure to establish a global quota and change tariffs in the World Trade Organisation has not been initiated."
"There has, in fact, been ample time to initiate it and if it has not yet been set up then emergency action must be taken until it is. Such action must involve applying retaliatory measures to countries taking part in the triangular trade and compensating Community producers for loss of income."
"Mr President, I shall confine myself to the Fantuzzi report."
"The promotion fund for agricultural products is seen by many as a substitute for export refunds."
"Now these refunds have been cut, we have to look to promotional activities, so the reasoning goes."
"This reasoning conceals a major risk, because it seems the Union is going to conduct its export policy along the same lines."
"This was an export policy which was certainly advantageous to Europe's farmers, but which had numerous disadvantages as well."
"It was a policy whereby the European Union dumped its internal market surpluses on the world market at the expense of the developing countries."
"We must abandon this export policy driven by quantity."
"There must be information campaigns to promote a clear emphasis on quality."
"Only products which pay proper attention to food safety, animal welfare and the environment should be considered for subsidy."
"Developing countries must be given the chance to develop their own agricultural potential."
"Subsidising the export of European products to these countries would seriously hamper that process, and I am against it."
"Nor must we equate promotional activities with export subsidies in terms of financing."
"The aim of export subsidies is to keep agricultural prices high throughout the Union."
"That works to the advantage of all Europe's farmers."
"So it is obvious that Europe should finance that."
"The same logic does not apply to sales promotion."
"Advertising is only effective if it goes together with a speciality or trademark."
"If the products concerned are made principally responsible for financing, that creates a new link between costs and benefits."
"European subsidies should at most play a supplementary role."
"Mr President, I should like to make a few brief, general points on the debate which began this morning and is continuing this afternoon, and which will perhaps be - if not the last - then one of the last on general agricultural matters to be held in the Commissioner's presence."
"The policy on prices has become well established over recent years."
"Let us hope that future crises and our commitments to the CEECs will not oblige us to downsize even further, and that other events do not compound two negative trends which have been noticeable in the past few years: not only the falling incomes of European farmers, but above all the drop in their numbers."
"What particularly concerns us, moreover, is that full-time farmers are steadily being replaced by part-timers, who cannot guarantee proper levels of professionalism."
"I am referring here to Mr Fantuzzi's report on quality: clearly, non-professional farmers cannot guarantee top quality, and this will have an effect on product promotion strategies both within the Union and in third countries."
"I agree with the offensive strategy proposed by the rapporteur."
"We should not wait for a disaster like BSE before promoting the consumption of European beef - safe beef, naturally - just as we should not have waited for globalisation, and hence the influx onto the EU market of wines from around the world, before deciding to promote European wine and explain to everyone that it is not harmful, especially as long as one does not over-indulge."
"What is more, as with all of life's pleasures - 'wine, tobacco and women are a man's downfall', as the Italian proverb goes - everything should be done in moderation."
"And so it is a matter of educating consumers: moderation, quality and teaching people how to drink - and, above all, how much to drink."
"Finally, I agree that the funding is excessively limited, ludicrously so, for a promotion campaign such as this, given the present cost of advertising."
"Mr President, I certainly hope that it will not be the last time that I am speaking here on agriculture to Mr Fischler as a member of the Commission, because over the years he has done an extremely good job."
"I very much agree with the price package that has come out of the Commission - it is very similar to a lot of the proposals I put forward two years ago when I was the rapporteur on that particular price package."
"I am concerned that we are making a singular mistake today if we think that the price package and the Berlin Summit are not intertwined."
"Agriculture is not about a short-term gain and short-term positions: it means planning for five or ten years."
"I work on a ten-year rotation; plans have to be made far further ahead than for any short-term positions."
"I totally disagree with Mr Rehder when he said that the Berlin Summit had been a great success."
"It has been a total disaster for agriculture!"
"It was a total misconception, it was done in a hurry, without thinking about the future of agriculture."
"That is why it is very important that we keep the discussions flowing and work for the benefit of agriculture."
"I wish to come back to a point the Commissioner made in his speech."
"He said very poignantly that we were not going to allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture."
"I was delighted to hear it."
"However, we are signatories to the WTO."
"Are we going to accept WTO regulations, even though it may mean somewhat expensive payments or having to take imports which we do not want?"
"Perhaps the Commissioner could clarify that."
"Finally, Mr Funk mentioned co-financing."
"I hope that co-financing is forgotten about forever."
"Mr President, Commissioner, given the time, I should like to confine my comments to the Peres report."
"Amending and correcting the regulation on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is extremely important."
"In my view, serious questions need to be asked about the waiver from the obligation to supply producer organisations for products which are marketed directly by the producer."
"This method of selling by means of direct marketing has traditionally had a very special status in Germany, which I myself have strongly supported for many years."
"You said this morning, Commissioner, that this is the second marketing year that the new regime for fruit and vegetables has been in force."
"Unfortunately, however, I have discovered that the Commission only takes the waiver in the market organisation to mean sales on the producer's holding."
"What is the position for sales in the field, at the roadside or at the weekly market?"
"This extremely restrictive interpretation is the result of a letter from Mr Legrand of the Commission."
"You are nodding; it seems then that there have been more recent developments."
"That would certainly be welcome."
"The proportion of goods permitted to be marketed directly is supposed to remain unchanged at 20 % of the produce of each Member State."
"In this context, one of the issues we discussed in the Agriculture Committee was how it is proposed to check up on this."
"Is it not the case that implementing this system in agricultural holdings will actually be extremely difficult?"
"If you consider agricultural practice, for example at asparagus or strawberry time, you might be forgiven for thinking that a certain amount of idealism is at work here."
"I do not believe that the rule of the game should be direct sales when demand is high and the producer organisation when demand is slack."
"But the monitoring of the whole scheme seems to me to have been too theoretically conceived."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I will confine my comments to the Fantuzzi report. We should not forget that it was under the Luxembourg Presidency in December 1997 that the Council acknowledged the need to continue developing the current model of European agriculture while strengthening its competitiveness, particularly on the markets of third countries."
"The proposal now before us is a result of that desire and also of the wishes of the Agriculture Ministers."
"This proposal is laudable and should therefore be approved. However, it is unfortunately too timid and too paltry, if I may say so, in terms of the financial resources of EUR 15 million."
"Moreover, the promotional instrument proposed should be simplified and rationalised. This instrument really must take advantage of the experience and know-how of the existing professional structures in order to encourage and implement promotional and publicity measures on agricultural products and processed products which can be exported or sold through new outlets in third countries."
"With regard to the financing, I agree with our rapporteur who has rightly pointed out that the United States annually devotes nearly ten times more than the modest appropriations indicated by the Commission for promotion on the markets of third countries."
"The Community should also be able to fully finance measures such as participation at events, fairs, exhibitions and so on. The financial participation of the Commission should also be rather more substantial, as we have proposed."
"In view of the problems which may arise when, on the basis of an open or restricted invitation to tender, the Commission chooses the body responsible for implementing the promotional measures, it would be safer and more transparent for the organisation proposing the programmes and measures to be responsible for implementing these and for choosing the necessary service providers."
"I proposed amendments to this end which were approved by the Agriculture Committee and which I hope the Commission will accept."
"Finally, I must insist on the strengthening of the consultation procedures of the Management Committees and the Standing Group on the Promotion of Agricultural Products."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you are all aware, garlic production in the European Union is concentrated in specific regions where this crop has great social and economic importance. It involves more than 15 000 farms and some three and a half million direct jobs."
"The amounts involved exceed the maximum overall quota of 33 600 tonnes. Moreover, imported garlic appears in European Union markets after crossing borders at which officials are not always conscientious as regards properly enforcing the correct procedures relating to quotas and quality."
"This amounts to a clear departure from the arrangements for commercial traffic envisaged in Article 115 of the Treaty."
"We therefore call on the Member States to provide the customs entry points with the human and material resources needed to undertake correct tariff classification, carry out phytosanitary inspections and check the origin of products. Further, we urge the Commission to demand that Member States be conscientious over border formalities."
"We also call on the European Commission to broaden the scope of Regulation No 544/97 introducing certificates of origin for garlic imported from certain third countries, and to apply retaliatory trade measures to those countries involved in fraudulent deals. According to Article 115 of the Treaty, such measures aim to prevent distortion in the movement of goods under the framework of the common commercial policy."
"In addition, a dissuasive customs tariff for imports over and above the set limit should be put in place. Measures to compensate garlic producers for loss of income should also be considered in order to tide them over until the other measures previously requested come into effect."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already had the opportunity today to explain the Commission's position in some detail."
"There is therefore no need for me to repeat myself now."
"I should simply like to thank very much all those who spoke in the debate for their constructive contributions and to respond briefly to three specific questions which have been asked in the meantime."
"Firstly, as far as garlic is concerned, I said that we want to work on two fronts here."
"We want to make use of the existing safeguard clause again, and to activate this for a further period."
"In this respect, I was asked how this will be monitored."
"It is quite clear that the task of monitoring falls on the Member States."
"We have already alerted the Member States several times to the fact that their customs authorities, in particular, must make it known that there is a risk of garlic being imported illegally from certain countries."
"The countries are also sufficiently well known."
"In addition, we have introduced our own certificates to make monitoring easier."
"We are aware, however, that these measures - at least in the way they have been implemented so far - are not sufficient to achieve satisfactory results."
"That is precisely why we are also prepared to go a step further."
"We will be tabling a proposal for a negotiating mandate so that we can negotiate a suitable mechanism for fixing quotas in the WTO."
"On the second question - raised by Mr Sturdy - about the WTO, Europe's position and how it proposes to act, all I can say to you today is the following: although this Commission is only an acting Commission at the present time, I believe that it is necessary and important - and I have therefore issued instructions to this effect to the services responsible - for us to develop a negotiating strategy based on the agreements reached as part of Agenda 2000 as soon as possible, so that we will then be in a position in the second half of the year to liaise with other countries about this forthcoming WTO round."
"You can safely assume that part of our strategy will be to take measures to strengthen Europe's position."
"I can reassure Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert: the object of our proposal for an amendment is precisely no longer to include only sales on the producer's holding - when they take place on the holding - but to treat sales at weekly markets and all the other direct sales measures you mentioned in just the same way as direct sales on the producer's holding, that is to say as an exception and thus as part of the 25 % rule."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"I have received three motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Informing and consulting employees"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the information, consultation and participation of workers has been a key subject of debate in Europe ever since the first social action programme was adopted by the Council in 1974."
"Since then the Commission has launched several initiatives, but these have often met with resistance."
"In a context of continuous change, the adaptability of employees is of crucial importance and forms an integral part of the employment strategy adopted by the Luxembourg European Council."
"Almost all the EU Member States have a legal framework - be it statutory or contractual - to ensure that employees are informed and consulted."
"It has to be said, however, that the current state of affairs - with its limitations and flaws - has proved not to give workers sufficient information and opportunities to be consulted on issues that really matter for the decisions of the undertaking."
"Consequently, the purpose of this initiative is to complete the existing national and Community framework, thereby helping - by improving the legislation - to prepare for change, ensure that restructuring takes place under reasonable circumstances and give employment the priority it now deserves."
"The proposed framework is therefore aimed at remedying the gaps and countering the shortcomings of the existing national and Community legislation currently in force."
"The objectives are: to ensure the existence of the right to regular information and consultation of employees on economic and strategic developments in the undertaking and on the decisions which affect them; to consolidate the social dialogue and relations of trust within the undertaking in order to assist risk anticipation, develop the flexibility of work organisation within a framework of security, enhance employees' awareness of the need to adapt and encourage them to participate in measures and operations designed to boost their employability; to include the situation and anticipated development of employment within the undertaking among the subjects of information and consultation; to ensure that workers are informed and consulted prior to decisions which are likely to lead to substantial changes in work organisation or in contractual relations; and to ensure the effectiveness of these procedures by introducing specific penalties for those who seriously violate their obligations in this field."
"I should like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative."
"There is no doubt that, with a single currency and a large single market, with increasingly interdependent economies and fiscal policies which, albeit belatedly, are starting to be coordinated, social policies are bound to become increasingly supranational in scale, so as to preserve and further promote our social model, which is recognised by a large number of authoritative sources as one of the decisive factors in our competitiveness."
"In particular, this proposal will ensure minimum standards for information and consultation to be applied throughout the Community, by harmonising the fundamental rights of employees and helping to strengthen the European social dimension."
"It is therefore deplorable that the negotiations between the social partners at European level for an agreement in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Social Protocol have failed, in particular because of one side's total unwillingness to negotiate."
"The Commission was quite right to fully exercise its right of initiative as sanctioned by the Treaty."
"The European Parliament, through my report, is proposing certain amendments."
"Here I wish to thank all those colleagues who have tabled amendments, thereby contributing significantly to the committee's work."
"Our amendments - on which we must hear the views of the Commission and which I hope the Council, in adopting its position, will regard as the European Parliament's firm wishes - are designed in particular to specify the means of implementing and defining information and consultation, especially as regards the point in time when information must be communicated, in other words planning, so as to enable employees to anticipate change, extending the content of information and consultation to other subjects which directly involve the rights of employees and their future; to extend the scope of this directive, proposing that it should include the public sector, and that the Member States should consider the possibility of including SMEs; and to ensure that minimum requirements are laid down at Community level from which it is not possible to derogate except to the benefit of employees."
"In conclusion, I am absolutely convinced that if the period of profound change which we are currently experiencing is to have a positive outcome, both in terms of increased competitiveness on the part of undertakings and of greater civil and social harmony, a major readiness for dialogue is required."
"This proposal, improved and strengthened by the report now under discussion, is an innovative means of promoting social dialogue, by informing and consulting employees, so as to guarantee stability and respect for the laws of the Europe we are striving to build."
"Mr President, Mrs Ghilardotti has done some excellent work on an important subject."
"This is a plank in the Commission's overall plan, to have information and consultation of workers and should be considered along with the directives on consultation in collective redundancies, consultation in transfer of undertakings, the European Company Statute and the European Works Council directives."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has supported me and we have put forward a number of amendments."
"There are concerns in some quarters that there is a problem with subsidiarity in this draft proposal but I believe that the reports I have already mentioned show that it is entirely appropriate for the Commission to act in this area."
"More particularly it fills a gap in employment legislation which was vividly exposed by the closure of the Renault plant at Vilvoorde and I congratulate the Commission - I should say acting Commission - for plugging this serious gap."
"My own country has some misgivings about the need for this legislation, but I would suggest that Her Majesty's Government visit some of the factories in my own constituency."
"All the factories that I have visited in the last few years in the West Midlands have information boards where they show productivity levels, productivity targets, health and safety information, etc."
"All sensible employers I know see informing and consulting workers as a top priority for increasing productivity."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should first like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for her report, which we support in every respect."
"I should, however, also like to thank the Commission for presenting a report here which has made it very easy for us to endorse its conclusions on this issue."
"This directive constitutes a further building block in a social Europe, coming after our adoption of the European works councils and - I hope - shortly before the European Company and worker participation legislation is adopted."
"However, it also constitutes a counterweight to capital in Europe."
"I believe that this is very important and sensible, particularly at the present time, so that the public realise that Europe does not adopt laws in a vacuum."
"I agree with Ms Oddy's assertion that of course this will not lead to national rules being abandoned."
"Those Member States which believe that employee involvement gives them increased and more extensive consultation rights will obviously keep their own rules."
"If you take a closer look, however, you will see that in many countries - including Germany - there are sectors in which employees are still unable to participate in decision making."
"The specific issue which I should like to address here is the size of the company."
"There is inadequate provision for small and medium-sized enterprises, including in Germany."
"That is why we would have preferred the company size threshold to have been set at 20 employees."
"I am mentioning this here quite specifically and hope that the PPE Group can, after all, decide to go along with our proposals."
"Similarly, I also hope that you, Mr Menrad, and the other members of the PPE Group will vote against excluding certain media companies and charitable organisations from the information and consultation obligations in connection with the provision on the protection of certain interests, and will endorse our proposal."
"The view expressed by one media company in a letter to us - that the human rights and fundamental rights associated with the freedom of the press will be violated if we do not vote for it - is one which I find absolutely absurd."
"In my opinion, there is a pressing need for there also to be worker involvement in media companies."
"I do not share Mrs Ghilardotti's misgivings about UNICE."
"I think that perhaps it is even a good thing that UNICE declined to negotiate."
"As a result, we have a reasonable proposal from the Commission which, particularly in terms of sanctions, contains much more far-reaching measures which we all support and which would certainly not have emerged from a social dialogue."
"Finally, I should like to express my hope and voice my request that the German Presidency and the Council as a whole should support this important building block in a social Europe as soon as possible."
"Commissioner, a central tenet of Christian social doctrine and of the PPE Group's statement of principles is partnership; that includes participation and joint decision making, as well as informing and consulting employees."
"It was on this basis that our group made an important contribution here in Parliament in 1994 to the directive on European works councils, which was adopted almost unanimously."
"Since then, it is true to say that European works councils have been a real success story and that with the agreement of employers, employees and unions they are increasingly widespread."
"One of the aims of the EWC is to pass on information received from central management to the local employees' representatives in good time - across borders - so that they can do their job."
"The system only works if national laws give the local employees' representatives adequate rights."
"Amongst other things, this directive seeks to ensure that this is the case by setting minimum standards - minimum standards for information and consultation, not for participation in decision making."
"Mrs Ghilardotti has produced a good and very thorough report, on which I would congratulate her."
"In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, she accepted a compromise solution on thresholds of 50 employees. That is acceptable, Mrs Weiler, and it is what the Commission and the Legal Affairs Committee had in mind."
"We are against total deletion of the provision on the protection of certain interest groups, as the report demands."
"However, in our amendments we propose a solution along the same lines as the works councils directive, which provides for this protection but severely restricts it."
"Quite simply, this is also about gaining broader support."
"It is particularly important - especially for small and medium-sized companies - for the Member States to provide for waivers if passing on information does considerable damage to the company."
"A release from these responsibilities must not be arbitrary, however, and that is why objective criteria need to be laid down and provision made if necessary for the granting of official or judicial authorisation."
"A framework for national rules on information and consultation which is structured in this way and which respects subsidiarity, Mrs Ghilardotti, is something we want to vote for."
"It is an important step towards building the social dimension and towards creating a proper partnership in the European Union and - you are right - it also has economic advantages."
"It is precisely at a time of rapid change and in a global economy that a lack of information engenders mistrust and ultimately fear, leading to a breakdown in relations."
"Information means transparency, which creates trust and avoids losses in European companies due to friction."
"Employers and employees are equal winners here."
"Mr President, on behalf of a considerable majority of my group, I welcome the Commission's proposals."
"I would remind you of the debates we had here on Vilvoorde and the Renault affair, for example, when we found that our rules on information and codetermination were not strong enough, and certainly not as far as penalties were concerned."
"This proposal is a major step forward in terms of informing and consulting employees at European level."
"The majority of my group will be voting for the compromise reached, namely that the legislation should apply to firms employing more than 50 people."
"I must reiterate how important it is to have information and consultation."
"Many firms which do this well take great care over how they treat their workers."
"And it makes for a level playing field that consultation and codetermination requirements of this kind should apply Europe-wide."
"It is, furthermore, a sign of the times."
"The rapporteur speaks tellingly in her report of the need to strengthen the social dialogue and promote mutual trust. And I think it can be seen as an example to the rest of the world, because we know that Japan and the USA lag behind us on this."
"From my own experience in the Netherlands, I know that works councils have often acquitted themselves better, when firms close down, than the management which was accountable to investors."
"I think we need to realise - certainly those who are still reluctant, and I am looking at my colleagues in my own group here - that this is an area which offers great opportunities for modern-day entrepreneurship."
"So I think we should wholeheartedly endorse this proposal, together with some of the amendments."
"Mr President, this issue of the framework for informing and consulting employees is controversial."
"It would be even more controversial if participation in the decision-making process, which this House has already asserted in various resolutions as being the right of employees, were added to information and consultation."
"In accordance with its well-established practice, the Commission was in favour of the social partners establishing these rules themselves."
"However, UNICE, the employers' organisation at Community level, believes this issue falls within the principle of subsidiarity."
"There were therefore no negotiations because the Commission was forced to present its proposal for a directive outside the social dialogue."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy was charged with drawing up an opinion on this report."
"This task fell to me and my intention was to help make real progress in the direction previously taken by the European Parliament."
"Most members of this committee did not believe this to be the way forward and actually adopted UNICE's position."
"No opinion was approved and the procedural page of the report states that the committee 'decided not to deliver an opinion'."
"This is to be regretted because this opinion would have contributed to the resolution which Parliament is going to adopt, whether my formulation was used or another one subject to more general agreement."
"This is why I congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti on her work and her report."
"If you will allow me, Mr President, I must say something briefly on another report on this area which came before this House today and which, due to Rule 52, was not debated or voted on."
"I am referring to the report on the organisation of work which must be regarded as a minor issue as it was rushed through Parliament."
"How our priorities are distorted!"
"We voted on the monitoring of marine biotoxins and roll-over stability, which are technical reports whose importance I do not deny, but we passed over the report on 'modernising the organisation of work - a positive approach to change'. Yet there are those who want the information, consultation and participation of employees to come under the principle of subsidiarity."
"And then we complain about the public's lack of interest in the European Parliament!"
"Mr President, there is a gap in the EWC directive; that became only too clear during the strike at Vilvoorde, as previous speakers have already pointed out."
"Clarification is needed on what information requirements actually exist."
"This is provided in the important and very fine piece of work produced by Mrs Ghilardotti."
"Of course compromises have had to be made."
"We particularly regret one of them: it is absurd enough as it is to bring company size into play where obligations to provide information are concerned, and then on top of that, 50 is far too high a figure."
"We have therefore given Parliament another opportunity to go further and have tabled an amendment proposing 20 as the threshold, well aware that actually this figure is absurd as well."
"As far as the protection of certain interest groups is concerned, we really have to say once again that this is a problem in any case because, for example, the freedom of the press is not the freedom of the newspaper owner, but the freedom of journalists."
"In churches too, church members have freedoms and these also need to be protected."
"But when it comes to information rights, this cannot have anything to do with the protection of certain interest groups."
"In German law, protection is provided for certain interest groups in joint decision making."
"There is some confusion here."
"If UNICE is now complaining that it is being ignored, then it ought to have cooperated constructively!"
"Mr President, I agree with Mrs Ghilardotti that there is a need for increased information and greater involvement of employees within companies, especially medium and large-sized ones, not least so as to avoid outright social injustices such as in the case of Renault."
"Allow me nevertheless to make one or two points."
"I believe in particular that it is only right to try to reconcile this legitimate expectation of information and consultation with the actual requirements of companies, above all small ones."
"In an economic climate as difficult and unstable as that of Europe at the moment, it would be inadvisable to burden companies with further legal and administrative obligations."
"I would point out that, at least in Italy's case, it is only large companies which, when experiencing a crisis, quite rightly and properly receive support from the State, whereas small firms, although they too are a precious resource for the Union, do not enjoy any such privilege."
"All too often, the heads of small firms have to face the uncertainties of the market all alone, shouldering all the risks without any protection or public assistance."
"I would therefore point out that prior consultation of employees would be meaningful only if it were one aspect of a genuine system of participation."
"What I mean is that, in a company which practises forms of participation - profit sharing or share ownership - prior consultation on company decisions is conceivable."
"In this case, there is a give-and-take relationship between employer and employees: joint decision making but also joint risk taking; the profits are shared but so are the responsibilities."
"To conclude, this proposal for a Council directive, and Mrs Ghilardotti's position in particular, introduces further elements of rigidity which the labour market - above all with regard to small businesses and micro-firms - can well do without, in my opinion."
"Such elements of rigidity would certainly not encourage job creation."
"Mr President, this report and the directive itself represent a very significant point in the progress of industrial relations."
"However, they are still less than the participation measures recommended some time ago, in particular by the studies of the European Foundation. This body carried out a major survey in 1991 and defined the following three models of participation: participation as a productive force, participation as a democratic force and participation as a set of positive forces."
"Participation is actually the main objective which we must pursue but it is just one point which Mrs Ghilardotti has made more effective, broader and more efficient."
"I must draw the Commission's attention to the fact that, in countries such as Italy, Portugal, Spain and Greece, only 5 % of managers allow consultation and information on subjects which are not exclusively related to health and safety in the workplace."
"We are therefore a long way from the European citizenship and democracy which we want for everyone. Political democracy is currently kept outside the company walls."
"We must hope that we can successfully implement this Commission initiative and the report which are intended to give people more freedom and make companies more productive while ensuring a greater human quality."
"Mr President, I am not against minimum requirements and a common framework for informing and consulting workers."
"I think that Mrs Ghilardotti has made a good effort in this direction, but I feel that, carried away by her - albeit very good - intentions, she has gone somewhat over the top."
"I think that if we adopt the report as it is at the moment we may end up achieving the opposite to what we all want, which is the protection of workers."
"Discouraging enterprises from making investments will, in the end, be detrimental to workers."
"I hold this view because we have different legislative approaches in the various Member States. Whilst in some Member States, such as Germany and Austria, what is being stipulated here is more or less already incorporated into their law, in other Member States a sudden change in legislation and a change of standards may have an adverse effect on the economy and on the labour market."
"Indeed, a positive step was taken when the original idea to implement the directive in enterprises with 20 workers was abandoned and 50 was introduced as the threshold."
"Nevertheless, there are still some things in the report I regard as negative and I would like to highlight a few as illustrative examples."
"Firstly, the Commission proposal provides for derogations, for example for certain specific organisations with religious and charitable aims. Amendment No 15 rescinds Article 2(2), which permits such derogations."
"I feel this is a mistake. These are specific cases and therefore special provisions are required to guarantee information and consultation and the proper functioning of these organisations."
"Secondly, Amendment No 24 (new) provides for final decisions to be postponed to allow consultations to continue so as to avoid adverse consequences for workers."
"In this way, companies will be unable to take decisions, possibly for long periods of time, and thus their survival may be compromised."
"Thirdly, Amendment No 26 offers workers the possibility of requesting the assistance of experts."
"Experts should not take part in information and consultation meetings, since they may disclose important information to third parties, and the protection provided in Article 5 is inadequate."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I personally am going to vote against this report."
"The proposal is a blatant example of a lack of respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"Firstly, there are no cross-border aspects to the proposal and, secondly, the matter is already regulated in most Member States, including my own country, Denmark, through cooperation agreements."
"This question should be regulated nationally and between the social partners."
"This would take account of both the principle of subsidiarity and the national differences and traditions in Europe."
"There is therefore no need for more EU rules in this area."
"It should be up to individual countries to establish national rules or set up agreements, as we have done in my own country."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for what is an excellent report."
"I should also like to thank the Commission for its proposal."
"There can be no doubt that this directive is needed, as developments during recent years have shown."
"I think it is obvious that employees should be regarded as a resource."
"It is therefore essential that they should have a right to consultation and information."
"However, I do not think the proposal goes far enough."
"In my view, 50 employees is far too high a figure - even 20 is too high."
"I believe that every single employee should have the right to consultation and information."
"However, I shall vote in favour of the proposal, since it establishes minimum rules."
"Countries which already have better systems - like my own country, Sweden - should be able to retain them."
"Therefore, all things considered, I regard this proposal as a successful step in a process whereby all employees will have the right to consultation and information in the future."
"Mr President, unfortunately, the principle that if you wait for long enough the outcome will be good does not always apply in European social policy."
"Many important decisions certainly take a long time, but then are not as good as we social affairs politicians would like them to be."
"The question of informing, consulting and participating has been under discussion at European level since 1974."
"All the Commission initiatives were defeated in the Council, because until the Maastricht Treaty came into force, unanimity was necessary for them to be adopted."
"The framework directive on the working environment was the first to include the field of information and consultation."
"Then in 1994, it became possible to adopt the EWC."
"Nevertheless, constant change and increased cross-border activities mean that there is an urgent need for action to be taken on this issue."
"As a result of limitations and shortcomings, workers have not been given sufficient information and opportunities to be consulted on issues that really matter for undertakings."
"Admittedly - and this is true - legislation does exist at national level."
"Unfortunately, this is increasingly ineffective in cases involving cross-border activities."
"That is why a minimum social standard is absolutely essential in this case too."
"This is nothing more than that."
"In this way, subsidiarity is fully guaranteed."
"After lengthy discussions in the committee, we agreed on the threshold of 50 employees."
"In smaller companies, business developments are clearer and information harder to conceal."
"The protection of certain interest groups has remained an open question."
"The PPE Group supports it here as it did in the case of the EWC, and we are still hoping for the PSE Group's agreement."
"However, we all agree that the minimum requirements must be adhered to, as must be the case for all minimum social standards."
"The right to have expert support must definitely be guaranteed, in the context of subsidiarity, because without it workers could be taken for a ride."
"After 25 years, I am looking forward to this directive for the benefit of workers finally being adopted."
"The idea behind this directive is also that European companies are different from American and Japanese ones, and work best if a consensus is achieved between the companies and their employees by means of information and consultation."
"Mr President, I could have done without this proposal for a directive."
"Unfortunately, this point of view has not gained much support in Parliament."
"In Denmark, both employers and workers believe the proposal could be a time bomb under the special Danish negotiating model whereby information and consultation are regulated in agreements on works councils between the social partners."
"During the committee procedure, I proposed an amendment which would have allowed Member States to refrain from implementing the directive if the social partners agreed that adequate schemes already existed."
"Unfortunately, it was not adopted."
"I would not like Member States which do not have adequate schemes for informing and consulting workers to be able to evade the directive."
"That is why it is needed."
"On the contrary, I am in favour of solidarity among workers in the EU, but at the same time I want a Member State such as Denmark - where over a period of more than 100 years the social partners have developed a successful model for information and consultation through collective agreements, in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue - to be allowed to retain such a system. Conversely, we should not prevent others from being raised to the level that we enjoy."
"Mr President, I should like to see the European Parliament reject this report."
"We should demonstrate that we respect the subsidiarity principle."
"To incorporate the contents into European legislation might run directly counter to our desired objectives."
"The proposal for a directive is at odds with the different traditions that exist in the Member States."
"It is an old-fashioned idea that the unions should acquire more influence through the EU."
"This should be replaced by a modern approach - which obviously means influence and participation on the part of workers - in every organisation that wishes to be competitive and dynamic."
"The necessary frameworks are best devised within individual workplaces and would only be hindered by the bureaucratic superstructure of a labour market policy, for which some people would now like to use European cooperation."
"Our role in a Europe in which human resources are being misused through high unemployment should be to create the right conditions for new jobs."
"The introduction of more rules and restrictions would mean fewer new jobs and less growth, development and prosperity."
"In other words, there would be many fewer workplaces in which there was consultation and information."
"I should not like to be a party to that, and I am glad that many of those present in the House today have said the same thing."
"Mr President, ever since the Community institutions first became involved in building Europe, especially social Europe, the information and consultation of employees has been a topic of substance, dating right back to the first Council documents in 1974."
"Today we are dealing once again, perhaps in an almost final version, with this fundamental matter of how to involve the basic elements of companies - in other words those who work in them, those who invest their labour to help them grow and remain competitive on the market."
"Many important considerations are set out in the rapporteur's text, for which we thank her."
"In particular, it is vital to include the public sector, provided of course that the Member States create mechanisms to encourage social dialogue."
"Clearly, social dialogue is especially desirable for SMEs, which appear to be excluded from this document, although - as we all know - they account for 90 % of companies in the Community."
"Therefore, in agreement with the Member States - and this is crucial - we must ensure the maximum involvement of employees in small firms, or rather micro-firms, those with up to ten employees, which currently form a majority in certain economic sectors and offer the greatest potential."
"The report has of course amended the initial proposal by ruling out a number of derogations on non-profit-making companies."
"We agree on this aspect, as long as it is properly applied within the Member States."
"In conclusion, in this age of globalisation, it would be unthinkable not to step up - and indeed to maximise - the involvement of employees in Community undertakings, because obviously business success or failure ultimately depends on them."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Ghilardotti and all the other rapporteurs for their work on this particular Commission proposal."
"I also wish to thank those Members who have taken the time to make valuable contributions to this debate."
"I should like to express my personal satisfaction and gratitude for your support for this very important initiative of the Commission."
"It is, in our view, an important proposal, which, once adopted, could add an indispensable missing element to Community European labour law."
"Having listened to what has been said here - and I have read the draft opinion - I believe you are willing and ready to play a decisive role in the negotiations leading up to the adoption of this proposed directive."
"Once adopted, it will complete and make more coherent the acquis communautaire in the field of employee involvement and make a decisive contribution to building the social dimension of the internal market."
"In a way Ms Oddy is right: it will fill a gap that needs to be filled in European labour law."
"Nevertheless, it is a controversial proposal, which is illustrated by the reservations which employers and some Member States have expressed."
"We are aware of the difficulty of the debate and that is another reason why I am particularly pleased with your position of clear support for the initiative, while having to be prudent about the caretaker Commission at the moment and what it can do with this proposal just at this time."
"So while the Council has not even started discussions on the text, and taking into account the absolute need to preserve the political viability of the proposal - notably within the Council - it is wiser at this time, and particularly at this stage, to act with some caution."
"I fully understand all of your requests at this time."
"Most, if not all, of the issues they raise were the subject of intense debate within the Commission in the period leading up to the adoption of the proposal."
"In the end the Commission reached a delicate balance between the different points of view and divergent interests on what is regarded as a very sensitive issue."
"It would be inappropriate to depart from this balance at this stage, at least as regards the proposed amendments relating to the four main sensitive issues of the proposal: the thresholds, the definitions of information and consultation, the extent to which the social partners may derogate from the directive's provisions and the question of sanctions."
"I am sure that all your proposals on these central issues are going to be very much at stake in the discussions between the European Parliament and the Council leading up to the adoption of the proposal."
"The Commission will play the role attributed to it by the Treaty in the course of the codecision procedure while facilitating the approximation of the positions of both parties and, in the end, ensuring consensus."
"So you will understand my caution when reacting today to some of your amendments, even if some of them could certainly be envisaged by the Commission in the future, in the light of the developments that will take place in the Council."
"In spite of my caution, I should like to be as positive as possible today."
"Some proposed amendments can clearly be accepted by the Commission immediately, and they certainly improve the text."
"This is the case for Amendments Nos 1, 17, 8, 10, the first and the third elements of Amendment No 13, and Nos 19 and 35."
"A second category of amendments concern more substantial issues."
"Nevertheless, I believe I can express my support for them as they are reasonable and do not seem to affect the delicate balance of the text."
"This is the case of Amendments Nos 4 and 15, Nos 6 and 32 - they are related to the non-aggression clause - No 16 on the level of information and consultation, No 22 - the illustrative list of issues subject to information and consultation - and the first part of No 33, concerning the application of the principle of the directive to the public sector, which is referred to, although the proposed formula needs to be reworked somewhat."
"While Amendment No 34 is wholly consistent with our approach of involving the social partners, we could not envisage that change to the basic formula used for the implementation of Community legislation."
"I could, however, accept a recital based on this amendment."
"As for the other amendments, in the light of the circumstances I have mentioned, the Commission feels it will be difficult to accept them."
"In any case, as I have mentioned before, they will be very much present in the future institutional debates on this important proposal and so the debate on these central issues is far from being closed."
"I must say to Mrs Weiler that it really is about minimum standards."
"It is very important for the European social model."
"As Mrs Ghilardotti said, in a way, it is all about mutual confidence between employers and employees."
"I regard this particular proposal as a key piece of European labour law."
"Even though I shall be watching it from afar, I will be extremely interested in the adoption of this particular piece of European legislation."
"It will do an amazing amount of good for employers and employees in the development of the European social model."
"I thank you for your support."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Working time"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0184/99 by Mr Chanterie, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time to cover sectors and activities excluded from that Directive (COM(98)0662 - C4-0715/98-98/0318(SYN)); -A4-0187/99 by Mr McMahon, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, onI.the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the organisation of working time for mobile workers performing road transport activities and for self-employed drivers (COM(98)0662 - C4-0716/98-98/0319(SYN))II.the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the enforcement of seafarers' hours of work on board ships using Community ports (COM(98)0662 - C4-0717/98-98/0321(SYN))III.the proposal for a Council Directive concerning the Agreement on the organisation of working time of seafarers concluded by the European Community Shipowners' Association (ECSA) and the Federation of Transport Workers' Unions in the European Union (FST) (COM(98)0662 - C4-0718/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is perhaps useful to start by saying that European legislation on working time is a matter of safety and health at work, and as such it is a right to which workers are entitled."
"It was enshrined in a directive in 1993 and upheld in 1996 by the European Court of Justice."
"But a number of sectors and activities have so far not been covered by this directive, namely a number of transport sectors, sea fishing and other activities at sea, and doctors in training."
"We are required today to look at the legislative proposals to bring these excluded sectors within the scope of the directive."
"The Commission has opted for a twin-track approach, on the one hand amending the existing horizontal directive and on the other hand putting forward three specific vertical directives for the transport sector, EU seafarers and seafarers aboard vessels entering EU ports."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has followed this dual approach, with Mr McMahon's report on sectoral legislation and my own report on adaptation of the existing directive."
"Broadly speaking, the committee favours bringing all the excluded sectors and activities within the scope of the directive."
"That will require, amongst other things, a revision of Article 17 on derogations so that better account can be taken of the specific features of each of these sectors and activities."
"For these reasons, I stand by my original proposal that the exclusion of seafarers should be reversed."
"Like transport workers, seafarers can make use of the derogations provided for in the directive."
"And maritime transport, like road transport, can have recourse to a separate directive."
"There is in any case a European agreement between shipowners and unions."
"So why exclude them further?"
"That is not defensible in either legal or political terms."
"One may even wonder if it is still defensible to single out another occupational group, the armed forces in peacetime."
"I think, Commissioner, that we need answers to these questions when the directive is revised in the near future."
"The second point of debate was Sunday as a day of rest."
"The 1993 directive provided for this, but the 1996 judgment of the Court of Justice declared it invalid."
"It is not Sunday as a day of rest as such which is being abandoned, but Sunday rest as an element of worker health and safety protection."
"So Sunday as a day of rest ought not really to be abandoned."
"What we need is a different legal basis to justify Sunday as a day of rest."
"The European Parliament adopted a position on this in its resolution of 12 December 1996."
"That resolution calls on the Member States and the social partners too to acknowledge the special character of Sunday as a day of rest."
"You backed that resolution, Commissioner, and you also confirmed it in a letter to me dated 8 January 1999."
"In seeking a solution, I would point to the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and in particular Article 151(4), which together with Article 128(1) of the Maastricht Treaty provides a suitable legal basis."
"A few words now on doctors in training."
"I think one of the most important merits of this legislation we are now enacting is that it brings to an end the inhuman working conditions, and various abuses, which a junior doctor has to endure."
"It is most important to patients too, since it has often become apparent that junior doctors who have been on duty or gone without sleep for 60, 70 or 80 hours on the trot are often not best placed to make the right judgements when emergency intervention is required."
"The European Commission's suggestion is to allow a temporary exemption, making the limit not 48 but 54 hours, for a period of seven years."
"The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs arrived at a compromise, to accept the extension from 48 to 54 hours but for just four years, not seven."
"As we know, the United Kingdom would like to go further than that, with a derogation for 15 years, but that takes us well into the 21st century, and I think we might ask whether members of the British Government would be happy to be treated in those conditions or not."
"They might prefer to go to a different hospital."
"In other words, we have to discuss and vote on all these things today and tomorrow."
"I believe that this, together with the Ghilardotti report, is one of the most significant pieces of social legislation we shall have produced by the end of this parliamentary term."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission on bringing forward legislation for the excluded sector."
"We have in front of us today a comprehensive package of proposals to protect about five million workers in road, rail and sea transport, as well as junior hospital doctors in training and offshore oil workers who are not covered under the original working time directive."
"The debate today is the first step in this Parliament, following the new Amsterdam Treaty, to ensure that minimum standards of working time are established for all workers throughout Europe."
"This is not an easy task."
"To match minimum health and safety standards and at the same time to have some operational flexibility, which may be necessary in certain circumstances given the nature of these sectors, is not going to be easy. We can be encouraged by the fact that the social partners reached an agreement in the rail industry and in maritime transport."
"I particularly welcome the seafarers agreement, given that it was a European social model, which formed the basis of our own wider agreement in the ILO Convention 180."
"Unfortunately, when we come to the road sector, the social partners were unable to reach an agreement."
"But they held important negotiations and they have learned valuable lessons."
"In drafting my report, which deals with the various transport sectors, my paramount concern has been the need to protect workers against the adverse effects on their health and safety of working excessively long hours."
"The report is also about ensuring safe and competitive transport systems in the interests of the general public."
"If we fail to deal with the regulation of working time in the transport sector, we run the risk not only of endangering the health and safety of the workers but at the same time of distorting competition within the internal market."
"This is particularly true in the road transport sector, where 78 % of transport companies are small businesses operating with less than five vehicles."
"It therefore makes sense to adopt European-wide rules on working time, which will operate alongside a tachograph and will ensure a level playing-field in road transport."
"I fully support, therefore, the Commission's proposal to extend the working time rules to all mobile workers in road transport, including self-employed drivers."
"These rules would protect road haulage workers, who are subcontracted out and end up becoming self-employed without any choice and without any health and safety protection."
"Not only will the Commission's legislation protect workers in the transport industry but it will improve road safety in the interests of road users and passenger safety."
"Up to 45 000 people are killed each year on the roads within the European Union and 18 % of all these fatal accidents involve either trucks or coaches, often as a result of driver fatigue."
"Only by providing adequate rest breaks, restrictions on hours and working patterns for mobile workers can safety be ensured."
"I have consistently argued in this report that too many derogations to the maximum working week, to rest periods or night work for mobile workers, would endanger health and safety standards."
"I am inclined to argue that the possibility to derogate from the 48-hour working week up to a maximum of 60 hours is, in itself, a substantial derogation and that no further derogations beyond that should be allowed."
"However, following a compromise we reached in committee, I have agreed that derogations can exist for weekly working time and rest periods, provided that this is negotiated and agreed by the social partners and the workers are offered compensatory rest."
"I would like briefly to address the situation of taxi drivers under these proposals."
"I fully support the Commission's proposal that taxi drivers should come under the scope of this proposed legislation in the interests of health and safety and fair competition."
"The Commission has been rather unfairly attacked on this."
"I do not believe that by introducing special categories of workers, we can fulfil our aims of providing basic level protection for all workers in the transport industry."
"Turning very briefly to Mr Chanterie's report I would like to congratulate him on his work and thank him for the discussions that we have had."
"I am particularly concerned about two areas."
"One is the offshore oil industry, which he has touched upon, where there are traditionally very hazardous hours for health and safety - we saw what happened with Piper Alpha."
"Some arguments have been put forward for the oil industry to annualise working time."
"Obviously this will have to be as a result of negotiation."
"Finally, on the question of share-fishermen. I welcome a clearer definition of what is a share-fisherman."
"I look forward to the Commission's proposals for a forthcoming directive on the whole issue of working time and fishermen."
"This is another area where there are very serious dangers and risks."
"Mr President, I should like to say at the outset how happy I am to be speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on this report as it is the transport sector that this legislation will have the greatest impact upon."
"Back in 1993 the working time directive excluded some six million workers."
"Over 80 % of these were in transport jobs."
"We said at the time that in particular the exclusion of these non-mobile workers was unfair and illogical."
"We are pleased now that this anomaly will be put right with this proposal."
"The European Parliament has always appreciated the problems that existed within the various mobile sectors, but it has always been a priority for the Transport Committee to ensure that a way forward is found to eventually bring them under the scope of the directive."
"We are delighted, on the whole, that the social partners, working with the Commission, have managed to come up with proposals that will put an end to excessively long hours that are dangerous to the health and safety of the workers themselves and to the travelling public as a whole."
"As far as the Transport Committee is concerned, our bottom line is safety."
"Safety has always been our guiding principle."
"In the rail and maritime sector, agreement was reached."
"We welcome those agreements."
"Unfortunately in the road sector there was no agreement between the social partners."
"We congratulate the Commission on taking an initiative to bring forward legislative proposals."
"I would also welcome here the trade unions' readiness to negotiate on working time for flight crews in civil aviation, within the joint civil aviation authority."
"I really hope that an agreement can be reached there."
"This issue is very dear to our hearts."
"It is the implementation and the monitoring of the legislation that now becomes important."
"It is all very well having good legislation, but making sure that it is adhered to is key."
"We want to see proper controls and all sections of public transport involved and included."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Transport Committee I would like to thank Mr McMahon for his cooperation and say that this has been a very good example of cross-committee joint work on legislation that will make a very great deal of difference to the health and safety of our citizens."
"Mr President, my group is naturally delighted that we are able today to look at two reports which in effect deal with cornerstones of social policy."
"It is remarkable too that all this is possible in the final months of the term of office of Messrs Chanterie, McMahon, van Velzen and Flynn."
"In my opinion, they will be sorely missed in future."
"But what pleases us most is that we now have an end to the situation in which whole sectors are arbitrarily excluded altogether from normal directives, whereby it is claimed that workers in those sectors are so special that they can be expected to work extremely long hours and with particularly short or ridiculous rest periods."
"I do accept that there are sectors in which exceptional circumstances obtain. We said to begin with that these were so special that they had to be excluded, but now we are saying that they must in principle be included and that if an exemption is granted, it can be granted only on the basis of an agreement between the social partners in the sector concerned."
"And that sits very well with Fiorella Ghilardotti's report."
"We have had people lobbying us, because take it from me, a great many lobbyists have been very busy."
"People have lobbied us saying that this will not work, because they do not have a social dialogue."
"We see the requirement that an agreement can only be accepted if it is based on social dialogue as a kind of incentive for people in those particular Member States to revive the social dialogue."
"Lastly, I think that after this debate we ought to have a further discussion, involving amongst others the Socialists and Christian Democrats, because there are a number of amendments which I think are very risky, in that grey area between self-employed and employed taxi drivers, for example."
"I am particularly afraid that there may be no parallelism between the circumstances of employers and employees, so that employees are forced into 'sham' self-employment."
"I would like a little more debate on that, because to my mind some of the PPE Group's amendments present a dangerous opening."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the two rapporteurs."
"This is a difficult subject and they have both done a fine job."
"So thank you very much, Mr Chanterie and Mr McMahon!"
"I can only agree with Mr van Velzen."
"We cannot exclude sectors from legislation of this kind just because they are problematic."
"One reason for this is the health of the workers."
"When I consider the demanding jobs done by mobile workers and self-employed drivers, I cannot see any difference between employees and self-employed drivers in terms of danger to health."
"I believe that protection needs to be provided for both groups."
"Of course this also applies to seafarers on board ships, offshore workers and in particular doctors, who certainly do not have an easy job."
"That is one reason, the workers' health."
"The other is of course safety, and unfortunately this also affects those who do not work in these sectors."
"You see, if an overtired lorry driver runs into my car, although I am driving properly, that is certainly not exactly good for me."
"If a ship carrying oil - and this is something we have experienced - runs aground because the master is asleep, this puts the whole environment at risk."
"It is therefore very easy to see the wider implications of the safety issue."
"I think that for this reason alone, this is very, very important."
"Mr van Velzen, I think that we should actually make renewed efforts within the two large groups - and perhaps with all the others who are willing to cooperate - to reach compromises on the amendments. I would see this as particularly important in these two areas."
"I also hope that we find a reasonable solution to the Sunday rest issue, one which the Commission is also able to endorse, without the European Court of Justice raising difficulties once again."
"Mr President, we are dealing here with sectors which have been excluded for a long time. The occupational groups concerned have in recent years asked us on many occasions, as Members of the European Parliament, to bring about a solution to their situation."
"I am thinking for example of aircrews, seafarers and doctors too, as mentioned by Mr Chanterie."
"My group will be supporting an overwhelming majority of the proposals and also some of the amendments."
"Our main concern here will be on the one hand the safety and protection of the personnel in question, but on the other hand the safety of society, which is also a factor here."
"Some speakers have already referred to this."
"From that point of view, I have also argued in my group that you cannot make a distinction between the self-employed - people who work for themselves - and the rest, because if he is overtired, a payroll employee is no less of a danger than a self-employed person."
"In virtually all the sectors we are dealing with here, there are two sides to the coin: not only the safety of the personnel in question, because otherwise you could say that employers should look after safety themselves, but also the safety of the rest of society, because there are always going to be sectors in which damage can be caused to the rest of society."
"So for us that is good reason to have the same legislation applying to both categories of people and to support that element."
"Let me add a brief remark on the subject of doctors in the United Kingdom."
"I find it bizarre that the United Kingdom continues to squabble over this, and given that we have so many UK Socialists in the House, I should like to ask whether, now that the colour of the government has paled somewhat, its position might not change?"
"Mr President, firstly I must underline the importance of the working time issue for the excluded sectors, in particular road transport, as this involves both social justice and road safety."
"In view of the dramatic accident in the Mont Blanc tunnel which has plunged both France and Italy into mourning, we need more than ever to develop sustainable means of transport, offering maximum safety guarantees and fully respecting the environment. These means include rail, inland waterway and sea transport."
"Everyone here agrees on this need which must be translated into acts containing provisions to improve road safety in particular."
"This would specifically involve combating the social dumping practised by the road transport sector whereby drivers have to work shocking hours under conditions which are outrageous in the present day."
"This should be the main aim of the reports presented today."
"The inclusion of self-employed drivers and a better definition of working time are steps in the right direction, as also is the assertion by Mr Chanterie of the importance of Sunday rest."
"But that is not all that is needed."
"Accepting a 48-hour working week when 35 hours is being considered in many countries is a major departure and we must not go beyond this."
"Allowing the possibility of a working week of 60 hours, provided that the average of 48 hours is respected over a four-month reference period, constitutes a blank cheque for all kinds of abuse."
"Remember that accidents increase after 55 hours' work."
"On the subject of night work, the two-month reference period is also too long."
"For effective control, the reference period should not exceed one month for day work and one week for night work."
"The trade unions are firm in their demands for this."
"My amendments specify these requirements and they also demand a break after four and a half hours' work."
"Why not when the highway code recommends that car drivers should take a break every two hours?"
"Finally, I must mention something which is purely linguistic."
"It concerns the translation into French of the term 'standby'. This is given in the report as 'période d'attente '."
"I propose that this should be replaced by 'période de grande interruption ' which corresponds more accurately to the spirit of the proposal."
"To conclude, we are dealing here with an issue which is of great significance."
"We must firmly establish the objective of a labour-oriented Europe which can really improve the situation of the employees concerned."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs on their work and also the draftsmen from the various committees for their assistance on what is a very difficult area to legislate on."
"While I welcome the general commitment towards ensuring the health and safety of workers and also guaranteeing that there is cohesion across the Member States with regard to the minimum protection that will be available, I fear for certain sectors."
"In particular, when we mention imposing similar restrictions on self-employed people we are in danger of becoming too much of a nanny state where we try to control everything and regulate what everyone does."
"Allowance should be made for the self-employed running their own businesses, who should not be confined in the same way as other people."
"However, be that as it may, the matter of transport in particular impacts very much on the general public."
"Because of the dangers which are present because of lack of proper controls and rest periods for people involved in the transport sector, it is essential that we have common regulation across the European Union."
"The only criticism I have of that section of the reports is that I do not feel there is enough flexibility built in to ensure that the so-called standby or waiting period is taken into consideration."
"Having read the report and the amendments I am still not fully convinced that the distinction is clear enough between the standby duties and the waiting time."
"Secondly, with regard to the question of junior doctors in training, it was unfortunate that when the original working time directive was proposed by the Commission, this sector was excluded."
"Junior doctors play a critical role in patient care."
"There are instances where junior doctors in training are working 120 hours a week."
"Some of them are working straight shifts of 36 and 37 hours without any rest period or sleep."
"It is impossible for any human being to perform properly under those circumstances but, more importantly, it is more difficult for a doctor to make proper clinical judgments with regard to the treatment of patients while working under those conditions."
"So I welcome the proposals put forward by Mr Chanterie to try to bring some regulation and flexibility into that sector."
"Finally, I should like to pay tribute to the Commissioner himself."
"It may be the last opportunity I have to do this in this House."
"When he started off in this job many years ago, he came forward with many legislative proposals which many people in this Parliament said were pie in the sky and would never be achieved."
"I hope this Parliament, the media and the public will recognise his tremendous record in not only completing his legislative programme but bringing Parliament along in support when people said it could not be done."
"Mr President, I think that we should start with the concept of flexibility."
"It is true that in a complex situation, we need rules which vary slightly and which are adaptable."
"But at the same time, we need clear minimum standards which ensure that the quality of the work, the safety of third parties and also the safety of the employees themselves are not at risk."
"I do not think that there should be room for any flexibility here, and nor do I see how anyone, regardless of the type of contract they have - whether they are a franchise-holder or an independent trader or whatever - can suddenly be exempted from these minimum requirements, which concern their own and other people's safety."
"Having said that, I must also welcome the compromise reached here, because it is a first step towards bringing these sectors - whose exclusion, when we have an internal market and when these very activities are expanding, was unjustified from the outset - back into a system of statutory regulation."
"They are complex, and therefore need rules which vary slightly."
"In this context, we need to give much more recognition to the role played by the social partners in terms of implementation, and I think that experience shows that all those who are involved in the practicalities of implementing rules of this kind on the ground - which means experts, which means the two sides of industry, as the British call them - should be given a tangible role in the implementation process."
"Basically, this is what has happened."
"In this respect, I think that the two reports are on the right track."
"I have one further comment on Sunday rest: I do not see why it should not be possible - in our modern flexible world of production - for us to agree on a time of rest."
"That too is an important part of social cohesion and communication and ought to be attainable."
"Mr President, the main principles underlying the directive on working time are important and are indeed worthy of this Parliament's support."
"The stated objectives are fairness to all workers in their conditions of employment, as well as recognising issues of health and safety that are able to be addressed by at least some of the Commission's proposals and some of the rapporteur's opinions."
"However, measures designed to achieve desirable objectives, I would contend, must be practical and be capable of recognising the special nature of certain sectors and the unique working conditions and practices therein."
"I represent, for example, offshore workers in two very different industries: in fishing and in oil."
"On the one hand share-fishermen, who work for themselves, resent the possible imposition of yet more restrictions on their working practices."
"Yet, on the other hand, I know from many letters from constituents on this subject that hundreds of offshore workers in the North Sea oil and gas industry would welcome being brought under the working time directive."
"However, I am concerned that, as things stand, its implementation may not have much direct and positive impact on those it is really designed to target."
"For example, I am concerned that many offshore contract labourers would still not be entitled to paid annual leave because of the shift rotas which they work."
"It would be an irony if the working time directive was imposed upon fishermen who do not need or want it but fails to benefit oil workers who do."
"We must make sure that our policy is flexible enough to target the real problems."
"We must ensure that our proposals are workable and acceptable to those most directly affected by them."
"I am aware that Mrs Bonino's officials are exploring possible ways of taking account of the special needs of the fishing industry."
"I certainly hope that a satisfactory solution to that will be found with the support, I hope, of Mr Flynn."
"Here in Parliament we have a chance to show that we are responsive to the real needs of sectors such as offshore workers and to prove that we are not a remote and inflexible bureaucracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission proposal now before us is based on the 1993 working time directive and concerns the sectors and activities which were excluded from it."
"We know from the background to the process of adopting that directive that it met with considerable resistance in the Council."
"This change is intended to bring the sectors which were excluded - some of them without good reason - within the scope of the directive."
"Of course, like previous speakers, I am concerned about protecting the health and safety of both employees and the others who are affected."
"At the same time, this begs the question of whether having extended and all-embracing rules at European level is compatible with the principle of subsidiarity."
"This week we shall also be discussing the need to modernise the organisation of work."
"Working time is an essential part of this."
"We know from statistics how much working time varies across our European countries, and that it is dependent on factors such as production technology and particular cultural features."
"European legislation applying to all sectors and to the whole of Europe should not stand in the way of these traditions."
"I also have a comment on Sunday rest: in my opinion, Sunday rest is particularly important in today's restless world, especially for family life, social occasions, keeping up traditions and for clubs and organisations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent and well-informed report."
"There are many objectives behind the regulation of working time, and recently a lot has been said about the effect on employment of reduced working time."
"The subject is also linked to the idea of promoting health and safety, as has been mentioned here, and in many Member States we have seen that it is this area that has been affected most by experiments in reducing working time, in spite of the fact that the purpose was often to increase employment."
"The need to promote workers' mental and physical capacity for work through the regulation of working time still exists."
"Seen from this viewpoint too, Mr McMahon is largely right to support the Commission's directives, as he does in his report."
"There are good reasons for extending the health and safety protection accorded to employees to include self-employed drivers, not just for the sake of the drivers in question, but for the sake of the other drivers on the road."
"I myself dozed off at the wheel of a lorry in Finnish Lapland. Finland is the size of Germany and is Europe's most sparsely populated country, and a long road, a tired driver, and the fact that it was dark was a disastrous combination as far as I was concerned."
"Conditions are different among the Member States of the Union, and we also need to take account of the problem of night work. In Finland, for example, which is a big country, good, efficient services depend on a long-distance transport network."
"I therefore propose a qualification, but otherwise I am happy to endorse the report."
"Mr President, first of all my compliments to the rapporteurs, Mr McMahon and Mr Chanterie, for all the hard work they have put in on this directive."
"The working time directive is one of the most complex, but also one of the most important directives in the area of safety and health."
"Nothing is more of a factor in stress and poor performance than excessively long hours of work."
"The 1993 directive on the organisation of working time was therefore a major achievement."
"The UK Government got nowhere when it claimed that working time was not a health and safety issue."
"That position was rejected by both the Court and the Council."
"What was strange was that so many sectors were taken out of the scope of the 1993 directive."
"We in Parliament accepted that, but we did insist that equivalent systems should be introduced in the sectors that were excluded."
"In some sectors, the social partners have concluded agreements."
"These we can accept and transpose into legislation."
"In a number of other sectors, the Commission has had to resolve impasses, for example over doctors in training."
"Problems arose over these, to which satisfactory solutions have been found in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Two problems still remain."
"One concerns off-shore operations, and the other Sunday working, which was mentioned in the old directive."
"The Court has declared the sentence on Sunday working in the current text to be inapplicable."
"The sentence read as follows: 'The (minimum) rest period referred to in the first subparagraph shall in principle include Sunday'."
"This sentence relates to the principle that it is possible to limit Sunday working."
"That is an important value in our in some respects totally unregulated society."
"The Commission is totally ignoring this."
"It wants quite simply to delete the sentence, although the Court judgment does not inherently indicate that this is necessary."
"The Commission would do well to reconsider."
"This is a very important question of principle which has to be resolved in the light of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"We do not want to discard the article but reshape it."
"Consequently, we are not in favour of Article 1(b) of the Commission's proposal and will request a separate vote on it."
"Mr President, this working time directive concerns employees' working conditions, which is an important issue."
"A directive of this type should be based on agreements between the social partners as to what constitute reasonable working conditions, both for employees and firms."
"If it is to be applied in the right way, it is vital that it should have strong support from the social partners."
"With particular reference to my own country, Sweden, we make a point of ensuring that such support exists, so that rules of this kind have some meaning."
"The directive also concerns other important issues, namely protection of workers' health and safety, as well as of the surrounding environment; it is important to ensure that transport does not endanger either people or the environment."
"In this respect, the directive is of value."
"Its scope has now been extended to cover a further five to six million people, which means that it is even more important to ensure that the rules are both practical and constructive."
"There are one or two points that I should like to emphasise."
"Firstly, that it really is a question of minimum standards."
"Every Member State should therefore have the right to draw up tougher rules in the interests of both the environment and safety: that much is crucial."
"Secondly, regulation should be on the conservative side, rather than too detailed."
"Instead, those with practical experience should be allowed to interpret the minor details, in order to avoid being hemmed in by petty restrictions."
"Having made these few comments, I would in general support the proposal."
"In my view, it is a step along the road to a safer and healthier Europe."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr McMahon on the presentation of a very fine report."
"I will confine my remarks to the fishing and maritime sector."
"The fishing industry in my country and in Europe generally is not like any other commercial and economic activity."
"It is a peculiar industry with its own special characteristics and needs and European legislation should be tailored at national level to suit the unique circumstances."
"I have represented the fishing industry's interests in Ireland, both at local and national level, for many years and at European level for the past five years."
"While I support the broad thrust of the working time directive for many sectors of social and economic life, I believe that more specific legislation is needed so as to guarantee the exemption of the fishing industry from the demands of this working time directive."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur when he states that the specific derogation for share-fishermen's needs to be adequately defined."
"I agree with this proposition, but the European Union must at all times take cognisance of the special nature of the industry and of fishing villages throughout the length and breadth of the Union."
"The proposals in the maritime sector also include the European Commission's recommendation on the ratification of the ILO Convention on seafarers' hours of work and the manning of ships."
"The agreement reached between the social partners largely reflects the content of the Convention with regard to the minimum hours of rest, as well as introducing new provisions on health assessments and annual leave."
"With regard to the verification of working hours, the European Commission has annexed a model format regarding hours of work and rest for seafarers and has suggested that the Member States should harmonise their legislation in this manner."
"Any changes which are going to be brought about in this regard can only be done in agreement with the fishing industry in Ireland and in Europe."
"In conclusion I wish to congratulate Commissioner Flynn on his persistence in having the original directive accepted despite the many obstacles at Member State level."
"I would now ask him to begin to consider Parliament's view, the Committee on Fisheries' view, in relation to the unique circumstances of the fishing industry."
"Mr President, Directive 93/104/EC establishing the general rules on working time excluded several sectors including the transport sector. In this sector, the rights of employees are more often than not disregarded."
"It was under pressure from Parliament and also to plug this gap that the Commission adopted a White Paper on excluded sectors and activities."
"In its opinion on this report, the Committee on Transport and Tourism advocated extending the directive to non-mobile workers and including other aspects such as annual leave and rest periods for mobile workers."
"The reference period for these workers is quite naturally the whole year and I do believe that our discussions must remain within this framework. This is because this is a very specific sector which carries serious risks in terms of both working conditions and health and safety."
"For this reason, I believe that talking about annualising working time should not be regarded as outrageous, as long as this provides a clearer view of the real situation in this profession and provided that we can perhaps tackle its shortcomings more effectively."
"Working time could be reduced by taking the average weekly working time, calculated over the year, and prohibiting anything over 48 hours per week."
"However, on a more general level, by this I mean taking into account mobile and non-mobile workers, the basic question is as follows: has the directive changed the life and work organisation of European employees?"
"Clearly the current answer is no."
"Once again we have a fairly vague framework which does not define strict enough limits."
"As a result, our labour-oriented Europe solely consists of a minimum framework and although harmonisation favours a limited number of European citizens, it represents a backward step for the majority."
"While Europe as a force for labour remains restricted by this framework, it will never become sufficiently visible to the public, just like the monetary side of Europe today."
"Mr President, like Mr Sainjon I believe both that this directive is long overdue and that its content does not match the hopes of employees in this sector."
"It is overdue because the road transport market in the Community was fully deregulated over a year ago and the social dumping which was already very apparent in this sector is simply increasing."
"It is inadequate because it does not provide any significant progress overall in terms of either public safety or the working conditions of employees or self-employed workers in this sector."
"The figure of 48 hours proposed as the maximum working week is more than what was specified in Regulation 3820/85 establishing the organisation of road transport."
"In order to be consistent with this regulation we would have to consider a maximum working week of 46 hours."
"Yet it is clear that this figure of 46 hours is well in excess of the target of 35 hours and is by no means a massive reduction in working time, which seems to be one of the main areas of progress to be prepared and achieved in this century; this will also leave gaps in terms of public safety."
"Even worse are the exceptions, or rather the exception, provided for by the directive and involving the maximum working week of 60 hours."
"You can imagine the effect that this will have on public safety and the living conditions of drivers. This exception is not acceptable."
"However, in order to improve the directive, even though we condemn the principle behind this exception, I would ask you to support Mrs Moreau's proposals."
"She believes that this time should be less than 60 hours - I would remind you that the authorised driving time is 56 hours - and in particular that this should be calculated over a period limited to 28 days. This corresponds to the time which can be monitored and appears more reasonable than a period of four months during which abuses will be easy to perpetrate."
"To conclude, this directive is inadequate despite the small hesitant steps which I must welcome, specifically the similar treatment of self-employed workers and employees."
"Although this is a start, it largely does not match the hopes of this Parliament and of employees in this sector."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have not always been able to take it for granted that Parliament and the Commission would regard rules on working time as part of protecting health and safety in all sectors."
"Thanks to the two reports we are debating today, this does at least seem to be clear now."
"I should therefore like to thank both the Commission and the two rapporteurs for their work, and in addition express my hope that the same opinion will prevail in the Council."
"I am speaking here on behalf of the PPE members of the Committee on Transport when I say that it is good that road transport - a sector with over five million employees - is not going to be excluded any longer; in my view, it is simply obvious that this should be the case."
"In road transport in particular, there is a direct correlation between working time and the numbers of accidents."
"I should like to stress once again how important it is for this to be implemented quickly, but also for compliance with all the measures to be enforced in all the Member States."
"Even though there is strong competition in the transport sector, it should not come at the expense of health or public safety."
"The two directives are being dealt with and adopted in parallel."
"This shows that we intend to be consistent."
"It seems to me that it is important - as the rapporteurs also emphasise - for these directives to establish minimum requirements, and thus for certain countries which might have stricter criteria on safety not to interpret the directives as a licence to dismantle them."
"Although these directives certainly resolve the working time problem to a large extent, let me nevertheless draw your attention to a particular problem, that of local transport."
"Local transport covers the carriage of passengers by both road and rail."
"To my mind, given that many countries already have appropriate rules in this sector, the derogation in Article 7 of Directive 98/319 ought to be maintained, or this sector should quite simply be incorporated into the 1993 directive."
"I believe that this is what both the Commission and the employees and employers in this sector would wish to see."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs and in particular Mr McMahon, to whose report my remarks are particularly addressed."
"I welcome the attempt to provide greater regulation and I regret that agreement could not be found with the social partners on road transport."
"However, I think there is a problem with the Commission proposals to which the rapporteur pays insufficient attention. That is that coach and bus drivers are effectively being categorised as road hauliers though they carry out very different tasks, requiring very different working hours."
"This leads to problems in two areas."
"The first is safety."
"These proposals are designed to ensure a high level of social protection for workers as well as a high degree of safety for passengers."
"No one would disagree with that."
"But the Commission statistics are slightly misleading."
"They tell us that 18 % of fatal accidents involve trucks or coaches and yet buses and coaches are actually one of the safer forms of road transport."
"Indeed, in the United Kingdom, only 2.2 % of fatal road accidents involve buses or coaches."
"It seems to me that the extra costs that these proposals will put on small businesses - in particular small coach companies - will lead to reduction of investment in safer and newer vehicles, which will hit the industry and perhaps undermine passenger safety."
"My second point concerns service."
"I am sure that Mr McMahon, like myself, regrets the destruction of the UK railways by the Conservative Governments and the way in which the road industry therefore developed."
"But the fact is that in rural areas, such as the one I represent, bus services are becoming increasingly rare."
"People rely on buses and coaches and the extra costs and lack of flexibility in using existing staff which these proposals would bring will have a knock-on effect which will lead to cutbacks in services."
"In conclusion, I propose that we ought to be looking at classifying road passenger transport with rail transport for the purposes of such regulation."
"This would allow services to be enhanced with no cost in terms of passenger safety."
"Mr President, earlier today Mrs Green, the Socialist Group leader, said that our agenda is for jobs - really?"
"If that is true, then we wait to see the Socialist vote against these two reports because these proposals would cost jobs."
"My own group has put down some very helpful amendments to them, but, as amended by our rapporteurs, these show old-style, old-Labour, Euro-social-engineering at its worst: inflexible, authoritarian and unrealistic."
"Everyone knows that the sectors originally excluded from the working time directive were left out because of the difficulty of including the workers they cover."
"Nevertheless, the Commission has put the proposals forward."
"In my view, Parliament's contribution might have been to try to help find a way of combining protection of workers with a flexibility that enables Europe to retain its competitiveness."
"The contribution of our two rapporteurs is to make things worse."
"Mr Chanterie confirms that he wants to include share-fishermen in the working time directive, cutting their working week, their ability to work as they wish and ultimately cutting their opportunity of making a likelihood."
"What sort of message is that to the fishermen in the south-west of England who are having a hard time making any living at the moment?"
"Mr McMahon hammers the taxi drivers of Europe by insisting in his amendment that the 48-hour week they are compelled to work within must include standby time, that is, time when they are not earning anything."
"He also insists that all self-employed drivers must have a tachograph."
"Mr McMahon and Mr Chanterie should listen to the words of a taxi driver - Mrs Wendy Smith - who has written to me from Sidmouth in Devon."
"She says: this directive would destroy private hire completely and I am afraid no-one is going to work under these conditions; there is a lot to consider before destroying the taxi service, but perhaps they are only interested in dictatorship."
"How embarrassing it must be for Britain's Labour Government to read the McMahon report!"
"We have asked in vain what the British Government thinks about it."
"Here, at last, they are faced with the consequences of Mr Blair's handiwork in signing up to European social policy and whatever he may say, such laws will be adopted by qualified majority."
"Get out of that Mr Blair!"
"I urge colleagues to vote against these damaging reports."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Democracy, rule of law, human rights and fundamental rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the recommendation for second reading (A4-0135/99), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position adopted by the Council (5240/1/99 - C4-0036/99-97/0191(SYN)) with a view to adopting a Council Regulation laying down the requirements for the implementation of development cooperation operations which contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms (Rapporteur: Mr Torres Couto); -the report (A4-0153/99) by Mr Galeote Quecedo, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) laying down the requirements for the implementation of Community operations, other than those of development cooperation, which, within the framework of Community cooperation policy, contribute to the general objective of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to that of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in third countries (9582/98 - C4-0508/98-98/0813(CNS))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today debating an extremely important subject for cooperation and development at European level. This debate concerns a recommendation for second reading, which I am presenting, on the general objectives of developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and of respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms in developing countries."
"With regard to the Council's common position, I must mention the following issues."
"The Council's common position does incorporate - sometimes only in part or with changes - a number of the amendments made by Parliament at first reading on the basis of the report by its Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"However, I note with regret that the majority of the most important amendments proposed by Parliament have not at this stage been adopted by the Council."
"This applies in particular to the amendments relating to budgetary aspects, those linked to comitology - which, it must be stressed, are of key importance for Parliament - and those seeking to strengthen the procedures for informing Parliament and to give the draft regulation an unlimited duration."
"Just as important as the amendments promoting democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms are those aimed at extending the scope and objectives of the draft regulation to cooperation operations for promoting the proper management of public affairs."
"This is a vital aspect which has nevertheless not been accepted by the Council, and Parliament should take a determined stance on this because it is fundamental for development and healthy cooperation with developing countries."
"Regrettably, without any controls we must acknowledge that aid from the European Union is frequently lost due to corruption, warmongering and inappropriate management of the resources which we provide to developing countries."
"Our cooperation has to be aimed at eradicating the hunger, poverty, misery and illness which are increasing at an alarming rate in most developing countries. This aid must not be used for more armoured cars, more weapons of destruction, more mines and more potential wars which simply decimate the defenceless civilian populations, thereby constantly attacking the human rights which we are trying to defend."
"Consequently, this premise must form a cornerstone of the EU's policy for cooperation and development with the developing countries."
"I must also underline that the reasons which led the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the European Parliament to table their amendments at first reading are still as relevant and topical."
"In these circumstances, I take the view that all the amendments not accepted by the Council should be retabled at second reading."
"I must also draw your attention to the importance of an amendment which I am tabling together with Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mrs van Bladel. This concerns the adoption by the Commission of measures needed to establish a code of conduct for partners involved in actions governed by this regulation."
"I must also make a final political point on the following issue. The Community action for promoting human rights and democratic principles must respect the principle of the universality and indivisibility of human rights as these form the key elements of the international system for protecting human rights and the basis of European construction."
"In this respect, the European Union cannot have different levels of action and different measures according to whether the context is Kosovo, Africa or East Timor."
"We must end the hypocrisy which is rife and the idea that the economic interests at stake must prevail."
"I would highlight and strongly protest at the position of the German Presidency which is heavily involved in the military action in Kosovo. When international public opinion is told about the Indonesian Government which is carrying out terrible massacres in East Timor and is continuing to attack the basic rights of the Timorese population, it should also be told that the German Presidency, which is fighting Milosevic in Kosovo, is in favour of President Habibie in Indonesia."
"The German Presidency is stressing and supporting what it calls good governance and the process of democratisation which is being implemented in Indonesia. It is this type of duplicitous position and these double standards which frequently discredit the Union and ensure that international public opinion does not always understand the value of our measures and policies."
"Mr President, today sees the culmination of a procedure which turned out to be longer and more complex than expected, due to the need to break down the Commission's initial proposal into two texts according to the various geographical areas where Community cooperation action regarding human rights and the development of the rule of law and democracy might be called for."
"Nevertheless, in our capacity as rapporteurs for the two reports we set ourselves the task of processing both texts in as coordinated a manner as possible. In this way, we hoped to achieve one of Parliament's key aims since the beginning: ensuring that when the two regulations were presented to the House, they would prove identical in content and would have the same aims and objectives, despite being officially divided into two separate regulatory texts."
"In this connection, it is important to mention that the texts we are considering today are the result of a broad consensus."
"Taken as a whole, the operations we are studying today already have obvious quantitative significance."
"Since 1991, Parliament has been attempting to make this more evident by grouping together all the articles of the Communities' budget referring to the promotion of human rights and democratic principles in a single budget line, B7-70."
"These operations are much more significant from a political point of view, however. They involve a genuine European philosophy of support for the development and consolidation of the rule of law, the defence of democratic values and respect for the rights and freedoms of all people."
"Our main aim has been to strengthen a range of principles and criteria that are considered to be of fundamental importance for the promotion of a coherent, systematic and effective policy in this area. In brief, we have sought to guarantee appropriate planning and programming of operations to establish the Community's priorities in these matters."
"We have also sought to strengthen the identity and visibility of Community actions, to establish well-regulated, clear and uniform procedures for all those involved, and to ensure that the actions have a real and sustainable impact on the societies in which they are undertaken. Further, we have worked to facilitate better monitoring, to guarantee that the best possible use is made of the resources devoted to this end, and to ensure that our actions are coordinated as closely as possible with the Member States' policies and initiatives in these areas."
"There is no need to dwell on the details of the significant procedural components of the regulation."
"It is suffice to say that every effort has been made to ensure that the procedures are as transparent and effective as possible and that they are adequately monitored."
"I do however think that special attention should be paid to the changes proposed in order to introduce coordination instruments at all levels. In particular, I believe that the suggestions included in the proposal concerning cooperation with the Member States of the Union are most relevant."
"Lastly, I would like to refer specifically to the various proposals contained in the reports that have been approved in committee and that relate to the European Parliaments's role in the development of programmes concerning human rights and democracy. In my view, Parliament's role as outlined in the initial version of the proposal is clearly inadequate."
"Of course, the proposal I am discussing today includes a range of significant amendments designed to ensure a valid role for Parliament in those procedures. To this end, specific measures have been introduced, including the plan to set deadlines for the Commission to complete its assessments and submit the results to Parliament."
"The Commission is to present an annual report to Parliament and this must include details of the implementation of the programmes for the previous financial year and of the programming and selection of the programmes for the current year. It must be submitted to Parliament in good time to allow Parliament to hold a full annual debate during the first half of the year and before it considers the relevant budget item in the general debate on the annual budget."
"If these measures are incorporated into the text, they will provide for a substantial increase in Parliament's control. Nevertheless, administration will not be affected and will remain the exclusive responsibility of the European Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I trust that all these proposals and suggestions enabled us to attain the objectives we set ourselves, not only in terms of studying and debating this particular regulation but also as regards the long-term aim of this House, which, for years, has been striving to enhance and regulate Community cooperation aimed at promoting human rights and political freedoms."
"I trust, too, that these arrangements, as presented to us today, will help us to establish new and more effective channels of cooperation with those who are engaged in a daily struggle to this end."
"Finally, I hope that all this will eventually result in the improvement of the Community's procedures for managing and making use of resources."
"Mr President, Mr Galeote Quecedo has produced an excellent report on the proposal for a Council regulation concerning strengthening the legal base for aid to promote democracy, the rule of law, and the reinforcement of human rights."
"The report relates to a Commission initiative which the Council divided into two some time ago."
"The other proposal for a regulation is on the agenda for second reading under the cooperation procedure and is the subject of a report by Mr Torres Couto."
"Mr Torres Couto's report mainly concerns developing countries, and this report by Mr Galeote Quecedo relates to other countries."
"The Committee on Budgets drafted similar opinions for both reports, with comments on funding frameworks, technical support and comitology."
"When the budget for 1998 was being debated, Parliament agreed that an advisory working party on human rights should be set up."
"Its purpose was to coordinate action annually, and it would comprise MEPs and representatives of the Commission and Council."
"We have had good results with a similar working party, inter alia within the framework of the MEDA programme."
"This working party would be treated in the same way as committees made up of Member States' representatives."
"The establishment of the working party was already proposed in Parliament's opinion as set out in Mr Torres Couto's report, but this was rejected by the Council, so the rapporteur is now proposing it again, and I support this."
"Unfortunately, the report we are now discussing by Mr Galeote Quecedo does not include these provisions concerning the working party, so Amendments 38 and 39 have been tabled on behalf of the Committee on Budgets."
"I support these amendments and I hope Parliament will adopt them, as they are consistent with the position Parliament has so often adopted in the past."
"Mr President, thanks to the generosity of your predecessor I had five and a half minutes to present my proposal for second reading on this subject. So that my time now is not wasted, I will reiterate some points which I aimed to stress in my draft opinion on this matter and which, in essence, Mr Galeote Quecedo has already highlighted extremely well in his speech."
"Due to the coordination between the two committees and between the two rapporteurs, with all the political groups participating extensively in the work of the two committees - I had personal experience of this in the Committee on Development and Cooperation - it was actually possible to determine a whole range of proposals. These aim to reinforce the coordination, efficiency, transparency, rigour and control of the implementation of an instrument which is fundamental to the future development of the countries with which the European Union is aiming to strengthen its links, namely the developing countries and third countries."
"This work therefore resulted in a combined effort and was carried out with a great sense of responsibility. We were even able to accept a range of very important proposals put forward by other political groups."
"For example, I must highlight the importance of the proposals put forward by Mr Telkämper on behalf of the Green Group involving measures to combat racism, xenophobia and sexism. I must also emphasise the proposals submitted by Members from the Group of the European People's Party supporting initiatives to abolish the death penalty."
"Mention should also be made of the important role assigned by both documents to reinforcing the participation of new partners who may be able to act constructively in this area. In particular this participation of new partners will not be subject to any discrimination and in fact, on the contrary, will respect full and total pluralism in political, religious and social terms."
"After a long process of negotiation on this subject, both in Council and in Parliament, I therefore believe that we have arrived at a final text which is highly encouraging for this House."
"Saying this, I must once again take the opportunity to congratulate Mr Galeote Quecedo on his excellent work. In particular he has made himself available so that we could work together constantly in order to combine our efforts and produce a document which would merit not only the widest approval of this House but also the acceptance of the Commission and Council."
"I must thank the political groups, in particular the Group of the European People's Party, the UPE Group and the Green Group, which have all contributed in a decisive manner to the vast improvement of these documents."
"Congratulations, Mr Galeote Quecedo."
"Mr President, I have here the text of the speech I made on this report by Mr Torres Couto in December of last year."
"It would not be very sensible of me to read out again what I said at the time, but believe me when I say that it would be highly relevant to what we are discussing today."
"This is actually a good example of how the heavy burden of procedures prevents our parliamentary work from being as versatile and flexible as we would like."
"I certainly hope that today's debate will be the last on this important matter. It is worth remembering that this is the fourth occasion on which we have debated the issue in scarcely four months, that is, since last December."
"Mr Torres Couto's report has been debated at first and second reading. Mr Galeote's report has been debated too."
"A further debate on my own report on the same issue took place in January. As was only to be expected, all the speakers tended to rehearse the same or similar arguments."
"I should point out that I did not discuss this previously prepared speech with Mr Galeote. However, in his own recent speech, Mr Galeote quite justifiably expressed his regret at the duplication of effort involved in a dual processing procedure for what ought really to be a single regulation for Community actions to finance cooperation and actions promoting human rights and democratic values in third countries and in developing countries."
"Mr Torres Couto has also said today how much he regrets having to table exactly the same amendments today. The Commission had already stated that it accepted and supported these amendments, but in the end it was not prepared to include them in the regulation."
"However, we are continuing to call for a new framework for the Union's relations with the countries we are cooperating with. We wish to facilitate more effective and transparent actions in support of the rule of law and human rights which aim to prevent corruption and to enable civil society to play a greater role in the countries benefiting from European funds allocated to development and cooperation."
"I am convinced that this is not a good example of how to carry out a task efficiently."
"My parliamentary group has been active within the Committee on Development and Cooperation and has tabled amendments."
"We supported Mr Torres Couto's report and I should like to reiterate my group's support for it today. Nevertheless, I am most unhappy with the procedural arrangements."
"I am particularly concerned because, in actual fact, this does nothing to enhance our reputation."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the opinion of the Liberal Group, Mr Torres Couto has without doubt taken great pains in his report to sum up relations between the EU and the developing countries in respect of human rights, consolidation of the rule of law and the close links which must exist between development cooperation on the one hand and, on the other, development which is not merely economic but also - and perhaps above all - human, cultural, ethical and civil."
"This is why the work done so far by Mr Torres Couto and the Committee on Development and Cooperation is so important."
"I should also like to speak in support of the amendments tabled, which restate the position of the European Parliament."
"Development cooperation must not only be geared to introducing that often general but important formula - the rule of law."
"Something more, something better is needed: a good administration, a fair legal order and proper judicial authorities - as referred to in the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, drawn up by the Council of Europe in whose building we are meeting - so that the general aim of assisting in the establishment of human rights does not amount to a rhetorical exercise."
"Europe's great merit is to have turned principles into reality."
"This must apply likewise to the developing countries."
"Mr President, I can return Mr Torres Couto's compliment."
"I think that a fine report has been produced here, thanks to some good cooperation in Parliament."
"For our group, in any event, it was very gratifying to see how well we worked together."
"This is an important report."
"It is about upholding or actually creating fundamental freedoms and democracy in order to promote respect for human rights."
"We can see how important this is in Europe at the moment: once again a war is being waged here."
"I think that a democratic state with the participation of the people is the only way in which peace can be created in the long term, as we have seen over the last 50 years in Europe."
"In the southern hemisphere, authoritarian regimes abound, as do aristocracies and regimes in which the people play no part."
"In this respect, it is right and necessary for us to support efforts to encourage a transition to democracy and respect for human rights there."
"That is why we can support this report more or less in full."
"We have not gone along with you on one point, Amendment No 1, the reason being that we did not want 'proper management of public affairs' to be included - not because we are against it, but because the funding for this whole programme is so minimal that we need to focus our efforts."
"We need to focus on respect for human rights and promoting fundamental freedoms."
"Three other amendments which you accepted were important to us, the first of which is to Article 2."
"Until now, the phrase on everyone's lips has been combating racism."
"Fifty per cent of the world's work is done by women."
"Women are particularly oppressed in these countries."
"The inclusion of the phrase on opposing a policy of sexism is important, and the Council really should accept it too, as it should accept this whole Parliament report."
"Finally, I have two further points: it is important to support smaller non-governmental organisations and smaller state-run bodies, because they are the ones which have a multiplier effect."
"My last point is that supplies and payments in kind from the countries to ..."
"The President cut the speaker off"
"Mr President, I believe that these reports are very important."
"We would be well-advised to ensure that they are adopted quickly, indeed very quickly, so that we finally have a regulation on the human rights policy."
"This policy is one of the most important conducted by the Union over the years but its bases have unfortunately been rather shaky. This, it should be said, has been due to the accumulated delays in regulating this issue, caused particularly by the Council."
"We must now seize this opportunity to reinitiate this policy on solid bases."
"We are currently well aware of the problems of many NGOs and of many people fighting for this cause and the EU would therefore be honoured to contribute to their financing."
"However, we can also see the difficulties posed in implementing these projects, particularly due to all the problems of which we are well aware."
"In this respect, I listened closely to Mr Virrankoski's speech. I have been assessing for some months and even years this idea of involving Parliament in administration or, in any case, in decision-making on projects."
"Thankfully, we are sparing ourselves this prospect."
"This House has a duty which it has fulfilled more than ever in recent months. In particular it has complained about all the structures, all the TAOs and all the artificial creations which could hinder the action of the Commission in order to ensure that one body implements, a parliament scrutinises and a court of auditors or another institution audits and so on."
"We must not mix these tasks up but should keep them as they are."
"I am against the two amendments."
"I hope that my colleagues will follow the rapporteur's opinion."
"I believe that what matters is being sensible and respecting the work of others."
"Mr President, the two very thorough - and fortunately also well coordinated - reports by Mr Galeote Quecedo and Mr Torres Couto are an attempt by the European Parliament to adopt a position on the measures which are so important to us and which are intended, within the framework of Community policy, to contribute to developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law and to respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"When this was first discussed, we said that we would have liked the measures on developing countries and third countries to be adopted on the same basis, so that the same article of the Treaty could be used as a legal base."
"But the Council insisted on different procedures: Article 130w for developing countries and Article 235 for third countries."
"Of course, this has more to do with the balance of power between the institutions than with a rational consideration of legal bases."
"This is comparable with the way in which portfolios are distributed in the Commission, which is illogical as far as human rights are concerned and is done instead on the basis of Commissioners' responsibilities."
"The cooperation which is urgently needed in these areas in both cases ultimately needs a solid foundation, however."
"That is why we also support this."
"This policy is becoming an increasingly significant part of Community policies - that has already been said here - and needs legal protection, as we know of course from the unfortunate experiences of recent months."
"However, promoting the rule of law, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms is a need which we have already made a prerequisite - or wish to do so in the future - in the democracy programmes under PHARE, TACIS and MEDA, and also when granting financial aid to developing countries."
"We have introduced this into many cooperation agreements in the form of so-called democracy and human rights clauses."
"Our definition of human rights has not been dictated by Europe, but is based on conventions and definitions as they appear in texts ranging from the UN Charter to European Conventions."
"It is therefore not something which we have invented."
"It has helped us to have a period of stability and peace in the European Union, and this is what we want other countries to have as well."
"We also wish to have a solid basis for cooperation with the NGOs."
"The many examples mentioned in the report are precisely what we want to support."
"We therefore very much support the proposal to set up an advisory committee."
"We have already requested this in Parliament on more than one occasion."
"Certainly, there must be a clear division of responsibilities, but of course advising does not necessarily mean deciding."
"The Council has rejected a whole series of amendments."
"The European Parliament should insist on these amendments if it wishes to strengthen its own role in the future."
"It is and remains the spokesperson for its own message and for the people who are hoping to see this become a dimension of their own countries' policies."
"I am pleased to note once again that our views are so similar where human rights, the principles of democracy and the rule of law are concerned."
"Mr President, the general principles in these two reports are broadly accepted by this House."
"They quite rightly encourage the Union to link these cooperation and development agreements with the improvement of respect for human rights, the consolidation of democracy and the proper management of public affairs by our partners."
"I must stress this last point. Furthermore, I agree with the rapporteurs who are again proposing amendments which extend the draft regulations to measures to promote the proper management of public affairs."
"These amendments, previously adopted at first reading by Parliament, were not incorporated into the Council's common position. This is to be regretted."
"Having said this, the Union must demonstrate humility and caution in these matters."
"Our partners may from time to time ask us for explanations about how judgments are passed on the internal situation of a particular country."
"The Union cannot give the impression that it preaches at everyone else but is not itself always irreproachable."
"The development in the right direction of the internal situation of certain countries is, in my opinion, more important than the excellence of a situation at a given moment."
"I therefore feel that, when passing judgment, we must take account of each country's history right from its beginnings, rather than simply noting the situation at the specific time when we make these judgments."
"After all, true democracy has only recently been achieved in some European countries."
"I can cite two examples in this respect."
"The first one relates to Togo."
"In my opinion, the intellectual and political development of this country must be assisted by the Union which should, in order to do this properly and appropriately, resume in full its cooperation with this country."
"You will remember that this cooperation was suspended some years ago."
"My second example is Cuba which we discussed a few weeks ago with Mr Galeote Quecedo. This country has been accepted within the ACP countries as an observer."
"The current developments in Cuba seem to me to be problematic and must be subject to the utmost rigour on our part."
"First of all, I should like to say that my colleague, Mr van den Broek, cannot be with us today."
"He is with the presidency on a troika mission to Kiev and he sends his regrets to the House."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its considerable efforts as regards both the time taken and the quality of its work in the process of adopting the future legal basis for the appropriations of the European initiative for democracy and human rights, an initiative launched in 1994 at your instigation."
"In particular I would like to thank the two committees and the rapporteurs."
"The amendments that were discussed in December are logically enough retained in the reports that are before us today."
"Please excuse me, therefore, for having to repeat some of the comments made at that time, even though the scope of the debate has broadened to include programmes for countries outside the developing world."
"The Commission is ready to accept most of the amendments as long as they do not call into question institutional roles."
"It supports proposals that are in harmony with its initial proposal dealing with the setting up of an advisory committee, doing away with the restrictions on the duration of the regulation's application and the abolition of the financial reference amount."
"The Commission also shares the rapporteur's concern about the need to make provision to keep Parliament informed of the work of the committee and about emergency operations."
"However the Commission is hesitant about the idea of publicising the committee's discussions as it does not take account of the need for confidentiality inherent in project selection."
"The Commission's position is also qualified when it comes to the series of amendments calling for clarifications or adjustments, especially on the subject of strengthening of programmes, annual evaluations and the relative importance accorded to recipients' experience."
"The Commission cannot support the references made to the interinstitutional working party."
"This would directly infringe on its management and implementation powers and could well render the regulations inoperable."
"Looking ahead, Parliament will have to decide on the committee structure by which it will take account of the human rights issues."
"I know there has been much heartsearching as to the best way to handle these issues."
"Whatever solution is adopted you can rest assured that the Commission will continue to look to Parliament as a key interlocutor, not only in its formal role as a Community institution, but also because of its wealth of experience in this field and the deep personal commitment that has been exemplified by so many of its Members."
"This cooperation will give ample opportunity for the representatives of civil society to be heard too, for the Commission appreciates that policy in this field cannot be made in the absence of a true dialogue with civil society as a whole."
"I should like to touch on two further issues specifically related to management of the European initiative for democracy and human rights."
"Firstly, in November, Commissioner van den Broek discussed with this Parliament the need for technical assistance to help in managing the budget headings covered by the European initiative for democracy and human rights."
"Since then the 1999 budget has been adopted with specific provision for the financing of such assistance from within these budget headings, unlike 1998 when it was not possible to conclude a contract."
"This will now be possible in 1999."
"The preparatory work for the conclusion of the contract has been finalised, though the Commission has yet to take a formal decision."
"It has been decided that there should be a contract to cover the services related to the budget headings managed by DG IA, including the needs of the RELEX common services and DG IA itself, and those related to the running of an enhanced programme of micro-projects led by the delegations."
"As soon as a Commission decision is taken a contract will be concluded, thus ending this gap in support for the initiative."
"Secondly, the initiative for democracy and human rights will operate this year through two main windows, apart from activities such as joint programmes with the Council of Europe which are concluded directly by the Commission."
"The first main window is the micro-projects programme which has been extended to cover each of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, former Yugoslavia, and the former Soviet Union and Mongolia."
"This window provides for extensive support to local NGOs and is to be managed at a local level without need to refer to Brussels for each financing decision."
"This scheme has already been praised in the past and its extension in 1999 is the cornerstone of a strategy of keeping NGOs closely involved in the democratisation programme despite the limitations on managerial programme support which have militated in favour of larger projects."
"The second window is a call for proposals to be issued any day now which will cover not only all the budget headings managed by DG IA but also those concerning ACP countries, including special programmes for Nigeria and for Southern Africa."
"The decision to run the budget headings together is part of an ongoing process of unifying the approach to human rights support right across the world."
"The call for proposals has already elicited the interest of NGOs which look to these budget headings as an important source of support for their activities."
"I should like to make one comment to the rapporteur, Mr Torres Couto, concerning a remark, which I may have misunderstood, as I cannot accept a criticism that you may have made. There is evidence, both from the Court of Auditors' reports and from the independent evaluation of PHARE and TACIS democracy, that there is no mismanagement and fraud in this programme."
"The funds made available by this budget sometimes have been spent more slowly that we would have wanted."
"That is your point as well."
"But they were, in fact, well spent."
"This is an important thing that, on behalf of the Commission, I should say to the House."
"To sum up, we are at the closing stages and soon we can look forward to the legal and financial framework that puts an end to the uncertainty that has surrounded this particular initiative."
"I should like to thank Parliament and the rapporteurs once again for their hard work in bringing about the adoption of these two very necessary regulations."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Pollution from large combustion plants"
"I would now propose, contrary to our usual practice, that we begin with the opinion drawn up by Mrs Estevan Bolea, to whom I now give the floor for two minutes, during which our rapporteur will no doubt join us."
"Mr President, this directive is very significant because there are so many large combustion plants in Europe, and particularly since hundreds of thousands of additional megawatts will be generated between now and the year 2010, according to the statistics compiled by the Commission and the electricity companies."
"The investment will therefore be substantial."
"We do agree in principle that we must continue to reduce emissions and improve air quality."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, we must also bear in mind the proportionality principle and the Batneec concept: the use of best available technology not entailing excessive cost."
"Commissioner, I do believe we should take measures which are genuinely necessary, but only those which are necessary at the moment. Others could perhaps be taken later."
"The gas and electricity markets have been liberalised."
"Great efforts are being made by all the companies involved."
"The directive now under review came into force ten years ago."
"Much good work has been done on desulphurisation and denitrification and improved technology has been introduced."
"The levels proposed by Parliament's Committee on the Environment are particularly demanding."
"It might be possible to attain them where natural gas is used, but it will be very difficult to do so in the case of coal and residual fuel."
"The point I would like to emphasise, however, is that it does not make sense to set these levels because there is no need to do so."
"The problem of acidification needs to be dealt with, but not all countries are affected."
"The Spanish delegation will therefore oppose most of these amendments, given that gradual progress will be made in the future."
"At present, these amendments do not make much sense."
"The wisest course of action might be for the Commission to issue a directive or a recommendation on negotiable permitted emission limits or to apply the 'bubble' concept used in the United States. The Commission could also introduce negotiated agreements which can work and not just insist on setting strict levels which are not met, as you must certainly be aware, Commissioner."
"Mr President, the purpose of revising the directive we are looking at today is to cut the level of emissions from large combustion plants."
"The measures proposed form part of a European strategy for combating acidification."
"It remains unclear as yet when work will begin on a directive on national emission limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds."
"The large combustion plants directive is directly relevant to the question of emission levels."
"The forthcoming emission limit values will be a policy package allowing Member States the freedom to decide for themselves how they achieve the required cuts in emission levels."
"I really agree with everyone else that things ought to have been done in a different order - first the limit values and then this directive."
"But in any event, given that there is still a good deal of wrangling going on over the other directive and because we set a period of ten years in the 1988 directive, we now have to do something."
"And I know a little about this directive on large combustion plants."
"In the mid-1980s, as a member of the Dutch Parliament, I asked our environment minister to take action in the Netherlands and in Europe in the light of the proposed rules on them."
"I have the feeling that if I were now to show this Commission proposal to Japanese and American industry, it would produce the reaction 'no wonder you will never manage to establish a proper industry for the environment.'"
"I would point out that the requirements for new plants, and indeed also for old plants, which can remain operational up to the year 2014, are considerably tighter in a number of Member States than those which the Commission is now proposing to us."
"As rapporteur, with the backing of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I therefore amended those requirements."
"When I was called this morning by a spokesman for Scottish industry, for example, asking if this directive had implications for Scotland, I told him yes, not only for Scotland but for the whole of the United Kingdom and Spain as well."
"I am confident that the United Kingdom will not wish to go on living in the stone age, but that there too something will have to be done for the environment, for the natural world and indeed for human health."
"I am confident that the British too will wish to act, and the transitional period I am proposing will be the best way of tackling the problem of existing combustion plants."
"When I look at what goes on in Germany with brown coal, for example, and knowing that mines producing brown coal are essentially far dirtier than ordinary coal mines, I have the feeling - and I say this for my Spanish colleague's benefit - that requirements for these could and should be far stricter than those now being proposed."
"I do not understand it."
"The Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy asked me if I had considered carefully the technical basis of my proposal."
"Yes, I did."
"As we were drafting this directive, I came across the Dutch Government's 1997 order which contains requirements for large combustion plants which are considerably stricter than the ones before us today."
"So I had a frame of reference, a yardstick."
"The new Dutch requirements, those in Germany, in some of the Scandinavian countries and in Austria too are far stricter."
"I wonder why we should not have the same."
"I would add one more element and that is liberalisation."
"I am all in favour of liberalising electricity supply markets."
"I always have been, but in that case you have to be confident, when setting the price per kilowatt hour, that differences in environmental quality will not be so great that pollution limits in one Member State and pollution tolerance in another Member State are ultimately a barrier to liberalisation."
"So from the point of view of liberalisation as well, I think we have to seek requirements which are as far as possible the same."
"I would urge my Spanish colleagues to think again."
"My colleagues from the Socialist Group have tabled amendments to the effect that the requirements which I propose to apply in respect of existing plants by the year 2005 should be postponed to the year 2010."
"I most strongly advise against that course."
"Why?"
"Because it would further weaken our negotiating position vis-à-vis the Council."
"I am familiar with David Bowe's argument, who urges the rapporteur and Parliament to be careful not to be too tough, because then the Council might attack us and might change the legal base."
"In response to these colleagues, I would say that if the Council wants to act and wants to change this result of codecision, it has to do that by unanimity, and unanimity means that Parliament and the European Court of Justice also have to have their say."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to welcome the work done by the rapporteur and her report."
"It is certainly a very impressive report and it is one which the Socialists will be happy to support for the most part."
"It will bring about substantial improvements in the emissions from very large combustion plants, usually burning coal or oil, which make such a substantial contribution to the amounts of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides that go into the air, which cause acid rain and which have health effects upon human beings, such as asthma."
"This is not just a question of controlling these plants by one particular means - there are other means to controls these plants as well."
"There is pollution control - and I was the rapporteur some years ago, on measures which are now being implemented to control emissions."
"There are also the negotiations on the national emissions ceilings limits which we are expecting the Commission to bring forward as quickly as possible."
"These two together will exert an effective and proper control."
"Parliament's report and the amendments tabled tend to extend the scope of the directive and make the limits with which both existing and future plants must comply more stringent."
"I do not think it is a particular problem for new plants to comply with these regulations though I recognise that there are problems for some of the older plants."
"It is therefore our suggestion that a little more time is given to them, a reasonable timescale in which the necessary investment can be made so that these plants can comply."
"As regards extensions to the scope elsewhere, I would draw the Commissioner's attention to the deletion of some of the exemptions, with regard to offshore plant and with regard to some of the large gas turbines used in mobile machinery etc. where, again, the emissions are significant and need to be addressed, recognising of course the particular circumstances that exist in those cases."
"I am very conscious of the issue already mentioned by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, that if we try too hard to set very tight limits, many Member States fear that we will be dictating their energy policy to them, which, of course, is not our right as a Parliament."
"For that reason we have to recognise that and recognise that we have to give a degree of flexibility within this proposal."
"Coupling this proposal with the national emissions ceilings limits and with IPPC we can do that."
"The whole thing has to be taken in that context."
"Finally, I believe that we will get a result, after second reading, where we have substantial improvements in emissions from these plants, where we have substantial improvements in the environment and in the air quality around these plants."
"I recommend this proposal to the House."
"One last comment."
"I have visited large combustion plants in two or three different states in the Union, particularly in my own, the UK."
"I have not seen anything that is stone-age and I would invite Mrs Oomen-Ruijten to visit, perhaps, the Drax power station in Yorkshire."
"She will see that it is her knowledge of the industry which is prehistoric and not the plant that is operating."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on an excellent report."
"Some time ago, Parliament approved another report concerning future strategies for dealing with the acidification of soil and water."
"One of its objectives was to resolve the problem of acidification by 2015, when emissions were to have reached a level that nature could accommodate."
"The Commission agreed with the line taken by Parliament."
"To achieve that objective, however, we have to tighten up the requirements, for example as regards combustion."
"This report, with the stricter measures proposed by Parliament, is a step in the right direction."
"Furthermore, the Commission has carried out extensive studies into the effects of combustion emissions."
"Of course, it is not just their effect on the environment that is a major cause for concern; people's health is also at risk."
"A comparative study of coal combustion with flue gas cleaning and nuclear power, carried out over a ten-year period, shows that 20 000 lives have been saved as a result of reduced emission levels achieved by using nuclear power in the EU."
"The proposal concerning the premature phasing-out of nuclear power therefore has some very serious implications for both the environment and people's health."
"I am also convinced that the use of economic instruments, for example taxes on sulphur and nitrogen emissions, could serve to improve developments and in practice tighten up our existing requirements."
"Taxes of this kind have been a great success in Sweden."
"Trading of emission rights might also be worth investigating, since this practice can have a beneficial effect on the environment at a low cost."
"The burning of fossil fuels also produces large amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the greenhouse effect - possibly the most serious problem."
"In any event, it is a sign that we should cut back on the burning of fossil fuels as much as possible."
"This is also an area in which the trading of emission rights provides a means of achieving some stability in our efforts to reach the requirements laid down in the Kyoto Protocol."
"Mr President, acidification still presents a serious threat to Europe's forests."
"In Germany, 67 % of the forests are exposed to acid emissions containing sulphur dioxide and nitrogen compounds which exceed the critical level."
"In France, 22 % of forest areas are affected."
"There are of course other countries whose forests are relatively unaffected, for example Spain, where the corresponding figure is only 1 %."
"But at the same time, emissions from Spain contribute to the acidification of an area five times the size of its own forest areas."
"Moreover, nine EU countries are net contributors to the acidification of areas outside their own borders, while five countries - Germany, France, Austria, Sweden and Finland - contaminate in this way an area smaller than that of their own forests."
"These figures show that emissions from large combustion plants create a problem which should be a priority for common, supranational regulation."
"It is therefore a good thing that the Commission has submitted this directive, even though it is not nearly strict enough."
"Parliament's proposal on the other hand, in the shape of the Oomen-Ruijten report, comes significantly closer to what is required from both an objective and an environmental point of view."
"For the most part, the Greens can therefore endorse the Oomen-Ruijten report."
"I really must take the floor because Mr Gahrton has made a number of unfounded statements in the short time he had available."
"The problem of emissions does not affect Spain, as one third of its energy is hydroelectric and another third nuclear."
"I would advise you to do some research, Mr Gahrton, and not to talk any more nonsense."
"Mr President, large combustion plants account in total for 63 % of sulphur dioxide and 21 % of nitrogen oxide emissions in the European Union."
"SO2 and NOx are the principal causes of acid rain and they are hazardous to health."
"So it is very important that emissions of these substances should be reduced as a result of this proposal."
"I am therefore pleased that the European Commission is also applying the directive to gas turbines."
"However, there must not be derogations for off-shore platforms."
"Given that existing technology allows SO2 emissions to be cut to 100 mg per cubic metre, a general emission limit value of 200 mg per cubic metre certainly warrants support from Parliament."
"Standards for NOx emissions can also be tightened up."
"An essential point made in the report is that existing large combustion plants too must ultimately comply with the emission limits, since these plants as a whole are responsible for much of the pollutant emissions."
"Otherwise, the measures will not have any substantially discernible effects in terms of cleaner and healthier air."
"Lastly, very dirty fuels must not be given an advantage in the form of higher emission limits."
"Rigorous standards apply to waste incinerators, but the emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels may also impair air quality, and consequently public health."
"This proposal represents a major advance, and I am grateful to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her hard work."
"Mr President, on the way here, most people presumably came along the corridor where an exhibition of pictures from my home region is on display."
"One can see images of nature with water, animals and snow."
"It looks clean and healthy."
"Unfortunately, most of what you see is pretty much dead as a result of acidification and pollution imported from afar - from countries and regions which shall be nameless, but which are certainly very much aware of the fact that within their borders they have large combustion plants which are making these beautiful images virtually lifeless, in spite of appearances."
"The Oomen-Ruijten report is therefore particularly relevant for my home region, for the survival of both animals and plants, as well as for the streams and everything else that is touched by acidification."
"I am therefore pleased to note that the majority in the Environment Committee has actually had the good sense to support the rapporteur's proposals to tighten up the requirements contained in the directive."
"I would refer in particular to the proposal that the directive should be extended to cover existing plants, an aspect which the Council obviously has not been able to tackle adequately."
"The existing plants are responsible for a considerable proportion of the emissions."
"Should the Oomen-Ruijten proposal be adopted, it would mean a reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions of 1 to 1.5 million tonnes a year."
"That is equivalent to between 10 and 15 times Sweden's total output of sulphur emissions."
"By comparison, the United Kingdom spews out 2 million tonnes every year."
"It would therefore be virtual madness to wait for a further five years until these combustion plants stop of their own accord."
"Of course there are objections: the proposal would cost money - but the technology is there."
"We know that it would be expensive for all of us, because we all have these plants."
"But the benefits would be incalculable."
"I only hope that more people in the House can be persuaded to think about saving more lives."
"Mr President, when we recommend new limit values for combustion plant emissions, we have to examine emissions as a whole, and pay special attention to the impact of regulations on the generation of greenhouse gases."
"There is a proposal in Amendment 19 for longer time limits when abatement equipment malfunctions or breaks down."
"The twenty-four hours proposed by the Commission is by no means enough for equipment to cool down, to discover what the problem is, for the repairs to be carried out, and for the equipment to be started up again."
"This is especially true if problems happen to arise at a time when the plant is being manned by fewer people than is normal, such as at night, on public holidays or at the weekend."
"If the time limit is not changed an efficient, modern power plant will have to be closed down temporarily virtually whenever there is a problem, and replaced with plant that cannot match it in terms of its ability to protect air quality."
"This cannot be in the spirit of the proposal for a directive."
"At Community level we want to promote both the increased use of biofuels and combined heat and power production, to minimise greenhouse emissions."
"To attain these goals higher emission limits should be permitted for biofuels, as the proposal prescribes, and the air protection requirements for small combustion plants must be technically and economically reasonable."
"Mr President, many speakers here have said that we still have a lot to do before our air quality objectives are achieved, although they are objectives we are committed to both as a Community and individually as Member States."
"We therefore have to do everything we possibly can, and one indication that we can do more than the Commission has been prepared to is this report on large combustion plants which has been produced by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I believe the most important aspect of the report is that it includes old plants - those which came into use before 1987 - in its provisions concerning harmonised legislation and limit values."
"Without this, this directive would be fairly hollow, as these plants have a long lifespan, and if we did not extend the directive to include old plants, the effects on emissions into the air would be nil."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the proposal that old plants should be included."
"But we also have to make sure that these rules are extended to the applicant countries, as we cannot allow any sort of freeloading in this area."
"Obviously, resources have to be allocated to achieve this goal."
"I also believe we must improve methods for exploiting biofuels and for combined heat and power production, but, as far as biofuels are concerned, I believe it is essential that they should be subject to the same limit values as apply to other fuels."
"Mr President, a technical directive being is amended and there are many aspects being addressed by different speakers."
"Problems concerning older plants obviously depend on which energy source is used by which Member State, and these vary enormously."
"We know that existing large combustion plants are responsible for about two-thirds of the EU sulphur dioxide pollution and nearly a quarter of nitrogen oxides, and these have very serious effects on health and the environment."
"Therefore this revision is urgently needed."
"I very much favour trying to move to more cogeneration, as other Members have mentioned."
"However, as rapporteur on air quality, I wish to concentrate on two main aspects."
"The first is covered in Amendment No 1 which links what has been done in this directive to the still-awaited long-term ozone strategy."
"The aim of this must be to bring harmful emissions from these plants in line and to below the level of critical loads."
"If we fail in this, we are doubly failing, both in protecting the environment and in protecting public health."
"Although we do not yet have the ozone strategy because of the paralysis in the Commission, we know that sooner or later the emissions limit values will have to come in line with it."
"We need to make it plain to the new Commission, when it is sworn in, that the ozone strategy and the national emissions ceiling, that Mr Bowe mentioned, are urgently needed."
"My second point relates to Amendment No 15, which argues for greater public information."
"This is the same approach we took in the daughter directives on air pollution."
"Some people do not seem to like public information very much but the people who live near these large combustion plants need to be fully aware of whether their health is at risk from increased air pollution."
"I commend them to the House and trust that they will have the support both of the Commission and, more importantly, of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur, and not least for the courage she has shown here to withstand conflict, because of course we do have conflicts on this question."
"It is certainly true that because of the liberalisation of the internal electricity market we also need to harmonise environmental legislation."
"That is an important step forward."
"Hopefully it will be the first of many!"
"Paradoxically, however, harmonisation in turn results in distortion of competition."
"I will explain this using the example of NOx emissions."
"Let us assume that NOx emissions are equal to 200 mg/m3 ."
"In the case of large plants, technological improvements can definitely be made."
"I understand that."
"But for coal, and in particular lignite, this means an increase in the price of electricity of between one and two German pfennigs."
"That is not a negligible amount."
"These producers might well be forced out of the market as a result."
"This will mean the end of the competitive advantage - or the fair terms of competition - which they have enjoyed hitherto."
"Incidentally, producers of nuclear energy will be pleased about this, since nuclear energy will not be affected and will thus be relatively cheaper."
"Anyone who advocates it will certainly be pleased."
"If we want to have fair terms of competition, however, we must at least bear this in mind."
"In Germany, the rule is 200 mg/m3 ."
"When it was introduced, it required considerable investment; it was fairly expensive."
"People can live with that. If we now want to bring it down to 100 - and from a technical point of view, this is no problem for gas - it will mean a corresponding increase in price."
"In terms of competition, this means being forced out of the market."
"What will happen then?"
"Then the regions concerned will receive regional aid from the European Union or the nation state."
"The taxpayer will pay for it in the form of regional aid."
"That cannot be the intention!"
"I believe, therefore, that we need to strike a balance here."
"I do not say this lightly, because of course I know that clean air is always better than dirtier air."
"But 200 mg/m3 is, I believe, a perfectly appropriate value, and we should stick to it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my particular thanks to the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, a member of my group, for presenting the report and for her careful work."
"For many Members, including some in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, the limit values put forward by the rapporteur for reducing emissions of certain pollutants from large combustion plants up to the year 2005 went too far."
"We are hearing similar arguments in the discussion on car exhaust gases."
"It is my impression that the technology is available to achieve these values."
"Of course, it requires a considerable financial effort."
"That is also why it is so important for us to promote, through the LIFE programme, the development of and scope for using modern technology which is able to achieve these aims and these limit values."
"Who else, if not the European Parliament, would already be fighting to push through ambitious targets to reduce air pollution?"
"Up to now, it has been thanks entirely to the European Parliament that values and aims have been achieved which were frequently presented as being unattainable in the time available."
"Mr Linkohr, you are familiar with the car debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please do not forget that the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force on 1 May 1999."
"Then we will also be consulted on this proposal under the codecision procedure, and will therefore have the possibility of pushing through not only what are admittedly quite ambitious demands for limit values for both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, but also demands to include old plants, which have hitherto been ignored and which present a particularly urgent problem."
"I would ask you to bear in mind that this is the first reading."
"We shall then see how the Council responds, and in the second reading we will have to discuss where we go from there."
"In my view, we should already be making proposals which are technically feasible, and then later we will have to calculate what goals we can achieve."
"There is one comment which I cannot leave hanging in the air, Mr President."
"I have to repudiate the caricature which Mr Linkohr made of my proposal concerning NOx , on the basis of solid information which he too might perhaps obtain from RWE in Germany, because RWE checked my NOx figures and what I wrote down are figures ..."
"I am sorry, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, but I have to cut you off."
"I interrupted Mrs Estevan Bolea just now for the same reason: these are neither points of order nor questions to the Commission."
"I can only allow Members to speak to make personal statements, and provided they are such, which I doubt to be the case."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking in particular the Committee on the Environment and the rapporteur, Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, for the very detailed consideration the proposal has received, in spite of the fact that we are discussing a very technical proposal."
"As many speakers have emphasised here this evening, large combustion plants account for a substantial proportion of the emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides in the EU."
"Precisely because of the extent of these emissions, and because they are transnational, it is necessary to have solutions at EU level, and it is also vital to ensure that EU legislation is brought up to date."
"That is why this proposal was one of the elements of the Community's pollution strategy, which several speakers have also referred to."
"In many areas, the Commission is able to support what are constructive amendments."
"The European Parliament is right to refer to the aim of the Community's pollution strategy, so the Commission is able to accept Amendment No 1."
"I share the view expressed by both Mr Bowe and Mrs Pollack that we need the two proposals which were ready to be presented and which will now have to wait until a new Commission has reached a decision on them."
"The Commission understands very well the European Parliament's interest in allowing economic instruments to be considered as a means of reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides, as expressed in Amendment No 3."
"We shall be able to consider the possible use of such instruments against the background of the development of the proposal for energy taxes, so I shall not say any more on that subject."
"We have discussed it several times."
"The Commission supports the European Parliament's wish that technological development should continue to have an impact on large combustion plants, and is able to accept Amendment No 5 in principle."
"How the committee's aims can best be met in this respect must be considered against the background of how the directive on integrated pollution prevention and control is implemented in this sector."
"The Commission also agrees that information about the environmental impact of large combustion plants should be readily available."
"From this point of view, the Commission is able to accept Amendment No 15, which Mrs Pollack in particular referred to, in so far as it can be achieved through the register of polluting emissions which is under development."
"The Commission is still working on a proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings, which I mentioned before."
"It is a vital part of the Commission's strategy for combating acidification and tropospheric ozone and for the protection of human health."
"This will set national limits for emissions of a number of pollutants."
"They will be cost-effective at EU level, and will be determined on the basis of the relationship between the emissions and their environmental impact."
"This will give Member States the opportunity to achieve the required reductions in emissions in the most cost-effective way, while at the same time the EU's environmental targets will be met."
"Consequently, the current proposal only covers new plants which receive operating licences after 1 January 2000."
"Against this background, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to extend the scope of the proposal to also cover existing plants. This affects a number of amendments, and I shall list the ones we cannot accept."
"The proposed emission limit values are intended as ambitious minimum requirements to be met throughout the Community, which is something Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and Mr Bowe touched on in their speeches."
"We have therefore chosen to set what are ambitious minimum requirements which must be met throughout the Community."
"They are approximately twice as tough as the requirements contained in existing EU legislation."
"Even tougher emission limit values can be used if they are justified by local circumstances or are necessary to meet national emission ceilings."
"Therefore, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to accept Amendments Nos 7, 9, 11 and 13, although it has noted the European Parliament's wish to see tougher minimum requirements at EU level."
"I am quite sure this is a question we will return to later in the procedure."
"Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 19, 22 and 23 cannot be accepted for technical and other reasons."
"In conclusion, I would like to express my satisfaction with the report."
"The European Parliament has shown a very constructive approach which can form a sound basis for discussions as the legislative procedure progresses."
"We are convinced that through its attitude, the European Parliament will help to bring us closer to the goals we are all aiming for, which are to combat acidification and tropospheric ozone and to improve public health."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Waste incineration"
"The next item is the report (A4-0183/99) by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Directive on the incineration of waste (COM(98)0558 - C4-0668/98-98/0289(SYN))."
"Mr President, the report now before us deals with the directive on waste incineration and is important for two reasons: firstly for the health of people living close to waste incinerators, electricity generating plants and cement kilns; and secondly for air quality in the European Union as a whole."
"The main culprits are the pollutant substances sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, small particulates, dioxins and furans."
"When fully implemented, the European Commission proposal will cut dioxin emissions from 2 400 g to 10 g per year."
"The new Commission proposal is a good one, but can be improved in one or two respects."
"The Commission's proposal for the incineration of municipal waste covers both hazardous and non-hazardous waste."
"Given that there is still a Commission proposal pending to amend the directive on the incineration of hazardous waste, it makes sense to combine the two directives."
"The clear advantage is consistent emission standards, because the distinction between hazardous and non-hazardous waste is based primarily on criteria applying to the collection, storage, transportation, management and processing of waste materials prior to incineration."
"During incineration, 'non-hazardous' waste may be transformed into hazardous substances which pollute the air."
"By and large, these are the same compounds as those generated during the incineration of hazardous waste, in other words what goes out of the plant is more important than what goes in."
"Clear rules are needed for what goes out, in the form of emission limits."
"Combining the two directives will not lead to a different regime for incineration from what we have at present."
"It will not be the case that hazardous waste previously incinerated only in specialist plants can suddenly be incinerated in just any plant."
"Certain hazardous wastes have to be incinerated at a temperature of 1 100ºC to prevent the formation of dioxins."
"Keeping these directives separate will be of no benefit at all to the environment."
"On the contrary, if we do not combine the directives, this may lead to less rigorous standards for hazardous wastes than for municipal waste."
"Amendments Nos 7, 9, 15, 18, 19, 56 and 61 are needed to make the new directive applicable to hazardous waste as well."
"These amendments are derived from Directive 94/67/EC on the incineration of hazardous waste."
"The Environment Committee urges the European Commission to do its utmost to persuade the Council to adopt the common position on a single directive in June."
"Care must also be taken over emissions where waste is co-incinerated."
"Ultimately, the same emission standards must apply to any plant which burns waste."
"The committee takes the view that electricity generating plants and cement kilns should be able to co-incinerate waste, provided they meet the relevant emission standards."
"The new Commission proposal lays down sound rules for the co-incineration of municipal waste in cement kilns."
"The same rules must apply to hazardous waste burned in them."
"This means that cement kilns will for a time be subject to standards which are less strict."
"The necessary investment for cement kiln fume cleaning can be funded by the large profit generated by taking in hazardous waste and savings on fuel costs."
"Given that NOx emissions must be kept as low as possible, many plants will need a NOx reduction unit."
"These units use ammonia to remove the NOx ."
"This process needs to be tightly controlled to prevent ammonia being released into the atmosphere."
"The Environment Committee is therefore proposing a standard for ammonia in Amendments Nos 24, 36, 38 and 41."
"Lastly, I hear reports that there are still a lot of incinerators which do not comply with the 1989 directives, particularly French combustion plants."
"These plants thus need to invest in order to meet the new requirements of this directive."
"One advantage is that these plants only need to make the investment once, in other words it can all be done at one fell swoop."
"I would urge the Commission and the European Environment Agency to be strict in monitoring compliance with the current and future directives."
"To sum up, Mr President, Commissioner, in order to ensure better health for people living close to incineration plants and also to ensure better air quality throughout the European Union, it is necessary to have one directive for the incineration of hazardous and municipal waste, which provides tighter rules on co-incineration and applies realistic standards to the emission of pollutant substances."
"Mr President, waste is not an aim of production, although the amount of waste produced might well give that impression."
"We dump waste and we incinerate it, neither of which is good for the environment."
"I would like to thank Mr Blokland for the excellent work he has done on the report and the firm stance he has taken for the good of the environment."
"It is clear that pollution has a great effect on human health."
"One example is dioxins, which are a typical emission from incineration."
"Many women in Europe have high concentrations of dioxins in their breast milk."
"There is also some concern that dioxins interfere with hormones."
"This proposal on incineration brings the hope of a higher level of protection through a fall in dioxin emissions."
"The report by the Committee on the Environment combines two directives - on incineration of municipal waste and incineration of hazardous waste."
"The idea of combining these directives is that the incineration of waste can create a pollution problem regardless of the type of waste being incinerated."
"In addition, there was a risk that Europe could have had tougher limit values for the incineration of municipal waste than for hazardous waste, if we had allowed the Commission's division of the areas to continue as presented to us."
"There could perhaps also be a risk of cheating in the classification of waste."
"The Commission's proposal on municipal waste mentions kinds of waste which to the best of my belief are hazardous, such as waste oil and hospital waste."
"Emissions from waste incineration, such as sulphur, nitrous oxides, dioxins and soot, should be treated in the same way, regardless of what is being incinerated."
"There has been a great deal of concern about co-incineration and the cement industry, and as a compromise we have chosen to maintain the three categories: dedicated incinerators, co-incineration and cement kilns."
"But the point is that they should all comply with tighter emission standards."
"We will not allow a loophole for a kind of waste tourism which could undermine the economy of the dedicated incinerators."
"So co-incineration, including in the cement industry, must comply with the requirements for tough emission values."
"Let me stress that we are still in favour of treating different kinds of waste differently."
"That is why critics who say that the combining of these two directives will lead to less protection for the environment are mistaken."
"You only have to read the text to see that different demands are made within the framework of the directive."
"The Commission should also follow up the waste strategy which has been adopted, where we stress the importance of recycling and reuse."
"If there was a requirement for the pre-sorting of waste through waste management plans, we could save raw materials and have less air pollution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wish to thank the rapporteur for his dedicated work."
"In 1994, I had the good fortune to be rapporteur for the directive on the incineration of hazardous waste."
"At that time, we proposed some extremely strict limit values, as I still believe we should be doing today."
"Results now show that of the 15 Member States of the European Union, 13 have not incorporated the strict values decided upon at that time into national law."
"Two countries have transposed them, with the result that these countries and these companies have invested a great deal of money and will probably have to do so once again if we reach different conclusions today."
"I therefore believe that it is absolutely right to set strict values, but that we have to do this seriously, and that obviously the concerns about health, which I fully share, must also be taken into account."
"I do not, however, consider it to be a particularly good thing that some countries and therefore some incineration plant operators abide by the rules and obey the laws in Europe and have spent a great deal of money, for example in France, but in my own country too - and I would be happy to show you this, Mr Blokland, after all you do not live so far away - while others have done nothing at all, and I do not see why, with these new values, some of which you want to halve, these others should now be able to save themselves the cost of the first investment."
"That is a competition policy which I cannot support."
"I therefore believe that we should adopt a cautious but strict approach here."
"That is why I am very much in favour of the best available technology being used."
"But Mr Blokland should please define the 'best available technology' in Europe for me."
"It will not do for some to define it in one way, and others in a different way."
"That is also why I have criticised the issue of measuring methods."
"If we prescribe figures here, then we must also prescribe how we measure, when we measure and where we measure."
"Here too, there are enormous differences in Europe."
"Co-incineration is a good thing, if it is carried out properly - I support it."
"But different values must apply here, because there are two combustion components: on the one hand the combustion of oil or waste, and on the other hand that of ores."
"There must be a rule for this."
"The old mixed formula was not too bad."
"The present Commission proposal is more stringent, and I support it because it makes sense."
"If we go along with Mr Blokland's proposals, I believe that in the long term the sensible process of co-incineration in cement kilns will be banned, and that does not make any sense at all, precisely from the point of view of environment policy, because they will still have to use gas or coal, and you want to ban that too."
"Proper co-incineration in accordance with strict standards is therefore the right way forward."
"In this context, I would like to see not only standards but also measuring procedures, because we do not have any of these in Europe."
"In this respect, we are back in a federalist system where everyone does what they want."
"That is precisely the point which I should like you to bear in mind, Mr Blokland, and which I would ask you to reconsider."
"Mr President, the prediction is that in the year 2000 we shall burn 50 million tonnes of waste."
"That is of course an enormous quantity."
"So we shall need a lot more incineration plants."
"Incineration must not be the ultimate aim."
"As we all know, the priorities are first to prevent waste and then reprocess or recycle it, and only then to incinerate it."
"But the bottom line is that we shall have 50 million tonnes of waste to deal with in the year 2000."
"I think the Commission proposal makes sense, but above all, we as Liberals welcome Mr Blokland's proposals to tighten things up."
"I have two comments to make."
"I agree with the rapporteur that the two incineration directives should be combined, that is to say non-hazardous waste and waste which may be hazardous must be combined, but only of course on condition that Amendments Nos 7, 15 and 18 are adopted, and I hope the European Commission will respond positively to those amendments."
"If they are adopted, existing legal loopholes will be closed once these two directives are combined."
"Lastly, I turn to the cement industry."
"Everyone has been talking about the cement industry."
"Everyone has been busy visiting cement kilns."
"At the moment, the cement industry processes a lot of waste, hazardous waste."
"It is highly profitable for cement kilns to co-incinerate waste."
"And I agree with Mr Blokland that this additional income and the savings on fuel costs can be put to good use to fund cleaner working methods."
"The cement industry too must comply with the strict emission standards."
"I do not think derogations are appropriate, especially in view of the fact which Mr Florenz mentioned just now, that this standard of 500 mg NOx per cubic metre is already met in the Netherlands, Austria and Germany."
"Why not encourage the other countries to emulate these three countries which have already met the standard?"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the incineration of waste has already been the subject of various European directives, the most recent of which is Directive 94/67/EC, which deals in particular with the incineration of hazardous waste."
"The proposal for a Council directive concerns the incineration of waste that is not covered by this directive, that is, non-hazardous waste, such as urban waste and certain other types of hazardous waste that are excluded from the scope of the previous directive."
"We shall not dwell at length on the numerous amendments that were tabled, but we would like to protest strongly against those tabled by the rapporteur which seek to merge the two directives on hazardous and non-hazardous waste into one."
"The rapporteur bases this proposal on two arguments."
"The first of these is the desire to ensure an administrative simplification of the texts, and therefore have one directive instead of two."
"As Mr Florenz said, the directive on hazardous waste has not yet actually been transposed into the legislation of all the Member States, and in amending it, by merging it to some extent, we would ensure more confusion rather than simplification."
"The second argument put forward is that the limit values, the quantities of emissions from residues, are very similar."
"In actual fact, it is not just the limit values that are important."
"The handling, management and treatment of both categories of waste - hazardous and non-hazardous waste - vary a great deal."
"A genuine waste treatment policy requires selective sorting and treatment, rather than an anachronistic and anarchic mixing of waste."
"If waste were to be mixed in this way, it would result in hazardous waste being incinerated in incinerators used for household refuse."
"This is all the more likely since some Member States have equipped themselves with oversized incinerators for household refuse, and they would be tempted to make use of this extra capacity by filling the incinerators with hazardous waste."
"Such a course of action would be unacceptable, because it would represent a serious risk to the health of the people living in the vicinity and to the area that surrounds the incinerators."
"The text presented by the rapporteur is quite vague about the need for and the specific nature of the controls for incoming waste, as well as the specific nature of its reception and storage, staff training, and so on. This is to say nothing of the difficulties for manufacturers of monitoring the treatment of their waste and clarifying their responsibilities."
"I should like to finish by saying that the proposal to merge the directives on hazardous and non-hazardous products contained in the rapporteur's text seems to be completely unreasonable and a source of grave danger."
"We should also like to point out that if we fail to distinguish between the specific nature of co-incineration plants, co-incineration would be banned, which would be catastrophic for the industries involved and the fossil fuels saved as a result of using this waste as fuel."
"Finally, we are against certain amendments that call for controls that are too stringent with regard to emission standards."
"These measures would require significant and costly investments but would not have any real benefits for the environment."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank the rapporteur who has produced an excellent piece of work."
"We have complete respect for the political line he is proposing with regard to both co-incineration and linking the two directives."
"However, we believe that some of our amendments that have been rejected by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection are essential and I should like to say a few words about them."
"Firstly, I would like to mention the problem of discharges into the aquatic environment."
"It is abnormal not to demand zero discharges into the aquatic environment."
"The European Commission already proposed such a measure in its draft directive on the incineration of hazardous waste in 1992."
"That being the case, we might wonder about the reasons for a backwards step in this area and the fact that the main political groups in this House have not supported our proposal."
"In fact, all the evidence points to the need for such a stringent measure."
"I would point out in particular that when Mr White's report on the framework directive on water was adopted a few months ago, we agreed to eventually - and by 2020 at the latest - make a zero rate the requirement for discharges of any dangerous substance into the aquatic environment."
"An initial step would consist of adopting a measure to that effect for plants which cause as much concern as incineration plants."
"The second aspect I should like to mention is the problem of dioxin."
"We know that dioxins represent the main problem posed by incinerators, whether they are used for hazardous waste or household waste."
"Less than a year ago, the WHO published new recommendations on the acceptable daily limit values of substances that can be ingested by human beings."
"This means that 10 picograms per kilo of body weight would be reduced to a minimum of 1 picogram - that is, ten times less - and a maximum of 4 picograms."
"I would point out that in many European countries, and particularly in my own country, Belgium, these limits have already been exceeded."
"We therefore take the view that for new plants we must aim from the outset for dioxin emission limits that are below the detection limit."
"Naturally, this requires some improvements to be made to the older plants, but we need to set ourselves a target of zero dioxin emissions."
"Mr President, it is clear that incineration capacity requirements are constantly increasing, but it is wrong to automatically present the burial of waste as an anti-ecological concept."
"In fact, there is no such thing as beneficial incineration and harmful discharges."
"Incineration which is not controlled properly is just as dangerous - and even more so - for our health and for the environment as the random dumping of waste."
"An example of this is PVC, which is completely inert when it is buried, but which releases highly toxic by-products of chlorine when it is burned."
"It also contains dioxins and a long list of molecules whose effects on the human body we are not even fully aware of."
"Finally, one thing is clear."
"By its very nature and for reasons of profitability, incineration conflicts with recycling."
"In order to function properly, whether it be technically or financially, it needs to burn more and more fuel."
"This is obviously not the way to combat the use of excess packaging or save raw materials."
"Conversely, technical burial is entirely in keeping with a genuine recycling policy, all the more so because there are not many possible sites and they can therefore only be used for a limited period of time."
"On the other hand, we do not look on energy recovered from incineration as recycled energy."
"It is a matter of making the end waste products viable, and nothing more than that."
"For example, the energy conserved when recycling a plastic bottle is ten times greater than the energy saved when incinerating the same plastic bottle."
"Mr Blokland's report is an excellent piece of work, and we shall be voting in favour of it, but incineration must remain first and foremost a method of processing final waste, once all the possible operations for sorting and recycling it have been carried out."
"We shall suspend the debate at this point."
"It will be resumed at 9 p.m."
"The sitting was suspended at 7 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Waste incineration (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0183/99) by Mr Blokland, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Directive on the incineration of waste (COM(98)0558 - C4-0668/98-98/0289(SYN))."
"Madam President, I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Blokland that the incineration of waste should be carried out in such a way that emission levels generally correspond to those we deem acceptable in the burning of biofuels and fossil fuels."
"If incineration can be carried out with strict emission requirements and the efficient use of energy, then the incineration of waste represents a satisfactory means of disposal."
"We are using a resource that is virtually comparable with a biofuel, and thereby helping to combat global warming."
"And compared with the dumping of waste, we can also help to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gas methane."
"As is pointed out in the report, it is obviously very much better to sort and recycle or reuse waste."
"However, it is important for there to be careful studies of what is best for the environment, since research of this kind often shows that, in spite of everything, incineration can be the best alternative."
"In Sweden, the manufacture of pulp has traditionally used wood residues for burning in the manufacturing process."
"In my opinion, this particular use should be exempted from the rules governing the incineration of waste."
"It forms part of an industrial process for which such rules are not really appropriate."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly my compliments to Mr Blokland on his excellent report."
"I have just one minute's speaking time, so I will confine myself to one specific point, namely the requirements which a new incineration plant has to meet."
"I think it is important that new incineration plants must be kept a minimum distance away from densely populated areas, and I have tabled an amendment suggesting a minimum of two kilometres."
"In my own country we face the proposed plant at Drogenbos near Brussels."
"The limits for particulates and cadmium have already been exceeded, and still the government has given the green light to construction of what will be a new source of pollution."
"The Commission has already brought an action against Belgium for infringement of the directive on environmental impact assessment."
"My country's policy on incineration plants is anything but exemplary."
"Proceedings are also under way on irregularities in the implementation of existing directives on incinerators."
"I would like to use this debate as an opportunity of asking the Commissioner firstly how these infringements are being dealt with, but above all how things stand with the complaints about Drogenbos."
"I should be grateful if the Commissioner could provide some answers to these questions today or, failing that, as swiftly as possible."
"Madam President, I do not support the integration of the two directives - namely on municipal waste, waste oil, solvents and clinical waste, as well as other non-hazardous waste - into one composite European piece of legislation."
"Agreeing to the integration of the two directives would amount to allowing hazardous waste to be burnt in plants intended for household waste, and vice versa."
"For more than 20 years European policy in respect of waste management has been based on the principle of treating hazardous industrial waste and household and similar waste in a different way."
"Each category of waste should be subject to treatment which is specific to it."
"From an Irish perspective, we generate over 42 million tonnes of waste each year."
"In the light of Ireland's strong economic growth, we must ensure that resources are invested in alternative waste-management schemes."
"The future of waste disposal must not and cannot lie in the continued search for more landfill up and down the length and breadth of our country."
"Investment in a clean environment in my country will in the medium to long term justify any additional expenditure incurred and the European Union will support any innovative measures in this regard."
"The Irish Government is presently putting together a national development plan outlining our economic and social investment priorities for the seven-year period post-1999."
"Included in this plan must be a comprehensive and integrated proposal that deals with the issue of eliminating the use of landfill sites in Ireland in the medium to long term."
"The facts speak for themselves in this regard: only 8 % of all municipal waste is recycled in my country."
"This figure is simply too low."
"The cost of disposal of this waste would drain the resources of our local authorities in terms of landfill sites, transport and manpower, and there is also the loss to the economy of the valuable materials which were dumped."
"For example, it is estimated that over 70 million polyester bottles are sold in Ireland each year and the improper disposal of even a very small proportion of these could make a significant contribution to environmental litter."
"Recycling rates for polyester bottles of up to 70 % have been achieved in Germany and the Netherlands to date."
"Recycling saves on energy, raw materials, waste-disposal costs, import bills and the need for landfill sites."
"As a people we need to develop a recycling mentality, which is now commonplace in all the European Union Member States."
"Madam President, the discussion about the incineration of waste and hazardous waste has shown once again how far our society still is from recognising the principle that the polluter should pay for environmental damage."
"On the one hand, we have endless discussions about the competitive disadvantages that result for industry, particularly for the disposal industry."
"On the other hand, it is exceptionally difficult to revise the limit values for highly toxic substances downwards."
"Yet some countries, including Austria, have proved that it can be done."
"Mr Blokland's excellent report is certainly a corrective to the Commission's draft."
"In future, however, we will have no choice but to get involved in the basic discussion on the design of all production processes from the manufacture of a product to its final disposal."
"The closest attention must be paid to ensuring that any products and resulting compounds whose disposal can have serious consequences, particularly illnesses, cannot be produced or put on the market in the first place."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am actually against waste incineration because I believe that it does not solve the problem, it merely shifts it elsewhere, and in the end the volume of waste may be reduced a little but does not disappear."
"I would nevertheless like to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report and particularly on the patience he has shown, given that both these reports were in committee for a long time. I also believe that we still need waste incineration plants because we are still a long way from a circulation economy in which everything that is produced can be recycled or buried underground."
"If we need such plants we must ensure that they affect our health as little as possible and that they protect the environment as much as possible."
"For this reason I also believe that it is necessary to have more stringent limit values for emissions and to bring the limit values for the various types of incineration closer into line with each other."
"I do not believe that we can expect someone living near a co-incineration plant to put up with different air quality than someone living near a municipal incineration plant or someone who does not live near an incineration plant."
"So we must look to improve the values here."
"I tried in committee to take a step in this direction by means of a number of amendments."
"I would also like to comment on the combining of the two directives, which I believe is right and for which I would like to express my support."
"In my view the fact that the same limit values apply for the incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is not a step backwards in environmental terms; on the contrary, I believe that it makes the values for municipal waste incineration plants more stringent."
"I also believe that it may make it possible to change the way in which hazardous waste is transported in small countries such as mine, where waste from Bregenz, which is closer to Paris than to Vienna, has to be brought to Vienna."
"I would welcome that."
"Madam President, the initiative now before us concerns a subject which raises particular passions in Portugal. We have with reason seen a very negative reaction in our country to the attempt by the Portuguese Government to allow two major national cement companies to co-incinerate toxic waste."
"No one can be unaware of the need to solve the current problem. However, this cannot be solved at any price as it is essential to have a process which is 100 % safe and correct, both technically and legally."
"To a certain extent which the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, is trying to determine, we must aim first of all to prevent, reuse and recycle waste, as other Members have said."
"The problem is that some waste still needs to be incinerated and the use of existing installations is only permitted if there is an absolute guarantee that human health is not at risk."
"This safeguard must be particularly borne in mind in the case of cement kilns. This is why we are fully supporting Amendment No 36 which rightly requires more than the Commission's proposal in Annex II.1.1."
"It is also not acceptable, as underlined by the rapporteur, that some countries have less stringent regulations and therefore attract waste from other countries."
"This is currently the situation with the cement works in Belgium which attract waste from Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany. This would have been the case with Portugal in relation to Spain if the Portuguese Government's initiative to encourage the national cement works to also burn the waste of their neighbouring country had gone ahead."
"The following amendments, for example, must also be applauded: Amendment No 25 which deletes the provision that continuous measuring may be authorised instead of periodic measurements, and Amendment No 30 which specifies a more stringent requirement in Article 12 on the provision of information to the public on possible damage."
"However, having said this, we must be particularly careful to ensure compliance with competition rules, perhaps by using rules with this specific aim, so that highly profitable contracts are not awarded without the necessary transparency, as has happened before."
"If there is any doubt about the danger of co-incineration - its effects are difficult to identify and only perhaps become apparent in the long term - we must ensure that the waste is incinerated in special incinerators, away from any population centres, as has just been said. Although these incinerators are expensive, their price is justified."
"They could be set up as joint ventures between neighbouring countries in order to share the costs."
"This must happen in the Iberian Peninsula, in view of the scope provided by Portugal and Spain."
"Madam President, the French Socialists are completely in favour of making standards more stringent and, in particular, of substantially improving the standards provided for in both directives to combat dioxin levels."
"But we are totally opposed to merging the directives on hazardous waste and household refuse."
"This is a matter of principle."
"The protection of the environment is based on the precautionary principle."
"However, mixing the two categories of waste creates great confusion, prevents hazardous waste from being traceable, and makes it very difficult to monitor and carry out controls, and we know that the processes for certain types of hazardous waste are highly specialised. In addition, it leads to serious risks for the quality of the environment and safety."
"Indeed, in Europe we have already witnessed the catastrophic effects of mixing hazardous waste and household refuse in this way."
"The second reason why we are against merging these two directives is that we do not believe that the protection of the environment has been the prevailing concern, but rather an economic interest."
"The overcapacity of the kilns for household refuse in some countries tends to encourage these countries to allow household refuse to be mixed with hazardous waste."
"We might therefore end up in a situation where hazardous waste will be processed as cheaply as possible, under conditions where it is not properly controlled, and where the transfer of waste within the European Union increases with all the risks that this entails."
"To sum up, it seems to me that this is a step backwards in relation to the precautionary principle and the Union's environmental practice."
"While we congratulate Mr Blokland on persevering in his efforts to convince Members, we cannot agree to the merger of the two directives."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we must thank Mr Blokland particularly for the enormous work he has done, as we have now been working on the issue of waste incineration for one and a half years in committee to ensure that it is dealt with carefully."
"I believe we all agree that there must be stringent guidelines for limit values for waste incineration."
"However, a number of amendments pursue very ambitious objectives that I cannot support, as we must realise that they involve huge costs."
"That would in turn create a new incentive - with record cases of avoidance and criminal offences - because waste disposal would then be extremely expensive."
"I would like to comment further on the issue of the different types of waste."
"In this area too we have witnessed significant abuse in the past because we did not have a uniform definition of waste, and because of the different definitions we were constantly faced with cases of avoidance."
"In this respect I must say that in my view the idea of combining the two directives into one is not bad because it is much easier to work with one law than to have to comply with two different laws, and because it different rules and different interpretations."
"In other words, I am in favour of a single directive but I am not in favour of all the strict guidelines that have been suggested, as these are not feasible."
"On the other hand, it is high time that we had a clear policy on waste disposal, and I believe that we have created a good basis for this."
"I am keen to see the outcome of tomorrow's vote, and I am also interested to know the Commissioner's views on the various amendments."
"Madam President, I strongly support Mr Blokland's report."
"I have just one observation to make."
"Parliament has, quite rightly, presented its own addition to the Commission's proposal, stating that the directive should seek to impact on the common aim and hierarchical structure for European policy on waste: waste prevention, recycling and reuse, and its exploitation as an energy source."
"However, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has approved the suggestion that untreated wood should not come within the scope of this directive, from which people might get the idea that it is only 'virgin' wood that is being referred to, but we would not even be able to burn or exploit sawdust or chips."
"In my opinion, however, this is good quality biofuel, and there should be no sort of restriction on its use."
"Madam President, let me be clear: I support new regulation on incinerators tonight, not simply to protect people living nearby from suffering from the cancers and the birth defects which British and Japanese research have demonstrated, but to shift the economic balance towards recycling and reuse."
"In Basildon, Braintree, Chelmsford, Colchester, Epping Forest and Rochford, our county council in Essex currently plans eight new major waste facilities, including incinerators, over-providing by some six times local waste generated, according to Friends of the Earth."
"This is lunacy!"
"It consigns Essex to remain the waste-tip for London, it underestimates the potential for recycling by half, it threatens areas of natural beauty close to people's homes and to schools and sites of historic interest."
"It is predicated on landfill at full capacity in ten years, whereas district councils project some thirty."
"Like every major incinerator proposal it sends up in smoke not just the waste but the prospect of small recycling centres and the jobs with which they are associated."
"In France the Ministry of Environment surveyed incinerator emissions last year and closed a number of its facilities."
"Denmark too is switching from incineration to recycling."
"America estimates that the greenhouse effect of a one per cent increase in recycling is equivalent to taking one million cars off the road."
"Europe can and should follow suit."
"Tonight's resolution, by regulating the incinerator, relegates it to the option of last resort, and gives hope to 10 000 individual people who have submitted objections in Essex."
"Madam President, I very much welcome the report and thank Mr Blokland for the work he has done."
"I have been quite amazed by the amount of time this Parliament has spent over the years on the issue of waste incineration."
"I go back to the times when we looked at this directive in the first place."
"But in the end we have come up with something which is equitable, sensible and just."
"We are going to impose tighter Commission limits on municipal waste because we recognise that when it is burned it is as dangerous as hazardous waste."
"We are going to continue to ensure that there are additional requirements upon dangerous or hazardous waste disposal because it poses risks over and above that posed by municipal waste in terms of handling and other controls."
"We must also take care to ensure that where co-incineration is proposed, it is used correctly and not abused or used covertly."
"We must accept that there are some forms of hazardous waste that can be well disposed of in cement kilns and that is where it should go, but under the strictest of controls."
"We must ensure that co-incineration does not undermine the economics of the industry and essentially stop the working, or close down the working, of dedicated hazardous waste incinerators whose use is absolutely essential for some forms of waste."
"I would again like to thank Mr Blokland for the work he has done."
"The Socialist Group will be supporting the vast majority of his amendments."
"The combination of the two texts make sense."
"We look forward to a successful second reading in Parliament after the elections."
"Madam President, as a Socialist and Frenchman, I should just like to mention the great interest we have taken in the study of waste incineration and in the need to improve the standards in this area."
"We also believe that it would be worthwhile if Europe provided more assistance to the countries or local authorities that have been making great efforts over the last few years to reduce the dangerous nature of incineration."
"For this reason, we cannot support the co-incineration of household and hazardous or industrial waste."
"We feel that there are still too many uncertainties and that we must continue to carry out studies in this area."
"Otherwise, some of our local authorities might end up with catastrophes if household and industrial waste are mixed in incinerators destined solely for household waste."
"Madam President, the Commission would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment and in particular its rapporteur, Mr Blokland, for the efforts they have made and for the attention to detail with which the committee, and especially the rapporteur, have dealt with this very technical proposal."
"The Commission has worked hard to be able to present a balanced proposal which can achieve a high level of protection for the environment and human health, while at the same time taking into account the special needs of incineration plants and co-incineration."
"The combining of the two directives on incineration has been a very important point in the debate here this evening, and the report also quite rightly focuses on that."
"From the Commission's point of view, the combining is a good thing because it satisfies the general demand for streamlined EU legislation."
"I can therefore also say that I do not agree with the comments made by Mr Cabrol and Mrs Lienemann here today."
"Neither the Commission's proposal nor Directive 94/67 contains any provision which prevents co-incineration of hazardous and non-hazardous waste."
"We are therefore able to accept the amendments which Mr Blokland and Mr Eisma in particular underlined as important for their positions."
"These are Amendments Nos 7, 9, 15, 18, 19, 24, 50, 56, 60 and 61, which we accept either in part, in principle or in full."
"In addition to what the report says about the combining of Directive 94/67 and the Commission's proposal, we consider it necessary to introduce a transition period for existing plants for the incineration of hazardous waste, in accordance with Article 14 of Directive 94/67."
"Parliament's Amendments Nos 8, 14, 23 and 55, which are aimed at including certain questions of waste management, are unacceptable on grounds of principle."
"The aim of the Commission's proposal is to set emission limit values and operating conditions for all waste which is incinerated or co-incinerated, and not to interfere with the rules on waste management."
"However, it is important that the recitals draw attention to the fact that incineration is only one of the ways in which waste can be treated."
"The same applies to some of the comments which have been made here this evening, in other words that the Community has both specific and general rules for waste treatment."
"We are therefore unable to accept Amendment No 1 for reasons of principle."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 16, 17, 21 and 22, which seek to introduce provisions on quality standards for air and water."
"For this we already have legislation either in existence or under preparation, such as the IPPC directive or the proposal for a framework directive on water."
"The proposed amendments would simply duplicate or encroach on these documents."
"Then there are Amendments Nos 36, 37 and 43, which are aimed at changing the emission limit values which the Commission has proposed for co-incineration."
"This is unacceptable, because the values the Commission has proposed are based on cost-benefit analyses and take into account the special characteristics of the various processes."
"The Commission believes that the Member States and the operators concerned should have a certain amount of flexibility with regard to the recovery of heat."
"It would not be realistic to demand that the heat produced by incineration should always be recovered."
"This would be impossible for incineration plants in remote areas, for example."
"Therefore we do not accept Amendments Nos 13 and 20."
"We can accept in part, in principle or in full Amendments Nos 4, 10, 19, 24, 28, 33, 35, 56, 59 and 64, which we think clarify the Commission's intentions and otherwise improve the quality of the document."
"For technical reasons, we have to reject a number of other amendments, including Amendments Nos 3, 6, 11, 25, 26, 30, 31, 32, 34, 38 to 41, 44 to 49, 51 to 54, 57, 58, 62, 63 and 65 to 71."
"I received a specific question from Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens about Drogenbos."
"I can say that three months ago we sent a letter of formal notice concerning the EIA directive. We have sought a reply to this letter and in the course of this week, during which the matter will be discussed in the Commission, we shall be proposing an additional letter of formal notice because the Flemish authorities issued planning permission after we had sent our letter."
"Let me therefore conclude by saying that the Commission thinks that the proposal being dealt with here today, strengthened by the inclusion of those of Parliament's amendments which I have said that we accept, forms an effective and balanced basis for the control of incineration plants and co-incineration."
"I am very pleased with the role which Parliament and the rapporteur, Mr Blokland, have played by taking the initiative to propose that certain existing legal requirements should be integrated into the Commission's proposal, thereby taking account of the general need for more streamlined legislation."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Financial instrument for the environment"
"The next item is the report (A4-0180/99) by Mrs Lienemann, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) concerning the financial instrument for the environment (LIFE) (COM(98)0720 - C4-0074/99-98/0336(SYN))."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the only financial instrument the European Union has to intervene directly in the field of the environment."
"LIFE has been extremely successful because it is one of the Community programmes which give rise to many projects. In fact, there are many more projects than can be supported by the payment appropriations, and 98 % - even 100 % - of the appropriations are used."
"This instrument is original in that it benefits the guiding principles of environmental policy."
"The programme comprises three main components: LIFE-Nature, LIFE-Environment, and LIFE-Third Countries."
"The breakdown of the appropriations is as follows: 47 % for LIFE-Nature, 47 % for LIFE-Environment, and 6 % for LIFE-Third Countries."
"LIFE-Nature mainly accompanies the Community policies that are connected with the protection of the biotope, the conservation of wild species, the implementation of European directives - particularly the directive which protects migratory birds - or the Natura 2000 directive, and the protection of the natural habitats of different species of fauna and flora."
"LIFE-Environment is geared more towards what could be termed urban ecology and industrial practices, particularly practices and technologies which are said to be 'clean'."
"The actions implemented within this framework cover a wide range of areas from water policy to air pollution control."
"LIFE-Third Countries provided an opportunity for applicant countries, enabling them to prepare to implement European environmental standards."
"This new programme encompasses various objectives."
"It is not a matter of radically changing its content; it is a matter of revising the corresponding regulation. The analysis of these programmes is very positive with regard to their impact and importance."
"Yet, along with the conclusions of the experts, it reveals that we need to give more consideration to the results, make greater use of the programme as an accompanying instrument when drawing up our rules and European policies, and, more generally, increase the total appropriations allocated to accompanying measures. These would include increasing awareness of the instrument and good practices, exchanging information and experience, and producing a summary report."
"That is why, generally speaking, the regulation states that the appropriations set aside for accompanying measures should be increased from 3 % to 5 %."
"The regulation itself seeks to redefine the priorities, bring them together and make them clearer for those involved."
"As a result, LIFE's broad guidelines in each of the sectors have been somewhat tightened up."
"However, it has been proposed that guidelines should be introduced to help the authors of the projects make the specific priorities in each of the areas clearer."
"LIFE is being implemented by the Commission's services with the help of a management committee made up of Council representatives and with the help of experts."
"Given the numerous debates Parliament has had on the implementation of the budget for European programmes, I would stress that no technical assistance office was invoked in connection with this programme."
"These are technical experts who support the Commission's services, and I think we all should be very pleased with the methodical and rigorous approach adopted by the Commission in this respect."
"In short, our report and the proposals by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection to some extent accompany the Commission's broad guidelines."
"I hope that our amendments will be supported by the Commissioner and I should perhaps emphasise two points."
"The first is the hope that a more explicit reference will be made to sustainable development, and not just environmental policy."
"This is clearly an important change of concept, since it introduces a social dimension, that of human development."
"Secondly, we would like to see special attention paid to the issue of job creation."
"We sincerely hope that the new environmental practices and technologies will help generate employment."
"We would like LIFE to give greater consideration to the social impact involved, and to employment in particular."
"Finally, as regards budget allocations, which is a sensitive issue and always leads to heated debate, Mrs Marinucci, the rapporteur for LIFE II, had proposed to the House a sum of ECU 800 million over a period of four years, and we supported her on this."
"I am more modest than she was, since I am suggesting a sum of ECU 850 million over five years, which is a little less than what she wanted for each year, but a little more than what the Council had granted the programme."
"I therefore hope that Parliament will support this proposal. Some people will think it is a little modest, since more is required for certain amendments, and others will perhaps think it is too ambitious in view of the Union's budgetary requirements."
"However, I feel that it is a happy medium which could earn the broad support of Parliament."
"Madam President, to start with I must compliment the Commission on the way in which it has drawn on the outside evaluation of the LIFE-II programme in drawing up this proposal for LIFE-III."
"The result is obvious: a high-quality proposal."
"As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, I have limited my opinion to the external effects of the LIFE programme."
"The committee would have liked to see a slight shift in favour of the non-Union countries taking part in this programme."
"Unfortunately, the rapporteur Mrs Lienemann was not prepared to agree to that in the Environment Committee."
"In any case, I hope that the budget for third countries will be spent in full."
"Our committee also asked for due account to be taken of cross-border aspects."
"I see that reflected in a variety of amendments, mainly by the rapporteur."
"I am in favour of guarantees to protect the natural environment, because I have seen the destructive effects of other cross-border projects."
"There is one such project in the Dutch province of Limburg."
"The cross-border consideration must not be an overriding criterion."
"LIFE must be first and foremost an instrument of funding for the environment."
"I would like to add a footnote to one or two amendments tabled by the rapporteur for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"I do not think that the resources will be used in the best way possible if all her amendments are adopted."
"I am surprised that the Environment Committee has agreed to some additions which seek to use this instrument to create jobs."
"I also have my doubts about the concept of sustainable development."
"At first sight this seems a very environmentally friendly concept, but it is being used here as a means of achieving economic advantage through LIFE on the sly."
"That is wrong."
"The purpose of LIFE is and continues to be the conservation of the environment and the natural world."
"If the economy and the environment are fighting for priority, nature and the environment have to come out on top."
"I would therefore urge the House to vote against the 'economic' amendments such as Amendments Nos 1, 4, 8, 15 and 25."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the environment programme 'LIFE' is the European Union's most important instrument for the financing of environmental projects."
"It is thanks only to the action of the European Parliament that we now have access to considerable funding from the European budget, at any rate ECU 613 million for the next five years."
"Important though the goals are that were proposed by the European Commission for LIFE-Environment, I feel that it is urgently necessary, in view of the problems that exist and the priorities repeatedly called for by the European Parliament, to mention the objectives of air and water pollution too."
"If these were not included the result would be that projects based on these objectives would receive practically no funding over the next five years."
"In the light of the discussion in the House on climatic disasters and water pollution, this must not be the case."
"There is a link here with a request which our group made as early as five years ago, that only those projects that are really new in terms of the current state of technological progress should be assisted, the problem being that currently, in certain regions of the Community, projects can be funded that are at a level of technological development already commonplace in other regions."
"This should not become common practice in future in view of the scarce resources available."
"My group considers all projects funded by LIFE to be extremely important, of course, but we also fully support the objectives proposed by the Commission, such as the 'starter' and 'co-op' measures."
"However, I also considered it important in this context to promote measures for the targeted conversion and development of areas and their land use, which are necessary to protect species and biotopes."
"These are the subject of another four amendments tabled by our group, and I would be grateful if they could be supported."
"Madam President, I did not agree with Mrs Lienemann's comments on the Blokland report, but I do entirely agree with what she says as rapporteur on LIFE-III."
"Shortly, in the year 2000, we shall have a LIFE-III."
"That will give Europe the chance to present itself with a new face as regards the environment and nature, but it will come at a price."
"Mrs Lienemann quoted a sum of EUR 850 million over five years."
"We are happy with that, but as a minimum."
"We shall certainly not be prepared to agree to anything less, because the current figure of EUR 450 m is decidedly inadequate."
"If you think about enlargement, we shall need a very great deal more money for LIFE-III if the new Member States are to take part as well."
"Just compare that sum with all the billions we spend on agriculture and structural policy."
"It makes this financial instrument for the environment look very meagre indeed."
"I also find it a great pity that my own country, the Netherlands, is quite progressive on environmental matters generally, but wants to cut the amount of money spent on LIFE-III."
"Certainly if we consider that Natura 2000 already needs three to five billion euros a year, this sum of EUR 50 or 60 million a year which is currently available would appear to be well below the sum required."
"If Europe truly wishes to look kindly on nature and the environment, it must be prepared to pay for it."
"I therefore appeal not only to the Dutch Government but also to the Council."
"Sadly the Council representative is not here with us."
"I nevertheless call on the Council to agree to an increase in the budget for LIFE-III."
"Madam President, the rapporteur and other speakers have reminded us that LIFE is the only instrument devoted exclusively to the environment."
"As stated in one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, it should contribute to sustainable development and to the inclusion of environmental policies in other Union policies. It should also facilitate the updating and implementation of environmental legislation."
"In addition, LIFE needs special funding."
"The Committee on Budgets welcomes the fact that no specific proposal has been put forward concerning the LIFE programme. Although it recognises that the programmes are effective, it is pleased that no specific proposal has been made."
"We have tabled and supported a number of amendments aimed at a specific financial proposal, bearing the Environment Agency's second report very much in mind. As the rapporteur has rightly pointed out, this report warns us of the recent reduction in biodiversity within Europe."
"We also agree wholeheartedly with the Committee on the Environment's view that priority should be given to cross-border projects, to innovative projects and to projects generating employment."
"We believe that the LIFE instrument can contribute to job creation in the field of the environment."
"Reports on the LIFE I, LIFE II and LIFE III projects should be presented in 2002 as this will give the necessary impetus to a future LIFE IV."
"Although the rapporteur does suggest changes, the distribution of funds across the three thematic components, LIFE-Nature, LIFE-Environment and LIFE-Third Countries is of secondary importance."
"What is crucial is to have an appropriate sum available to enable a start to be made."
"Madam President, in principle the LIFE programme is extremely welcome from an environmental point of view."
"The most important prerequisite for success is sufficient funding."
"But we have just seen from the case of Altener II that environmental programmes are the first to come under threat where cuts are made in funding."
"Almost every type of environmental initiative also creates jobs."
"The involvement of the applicant countries in the LIFE programme is of enormous importance."
"But we must not forget that these countries do not always have the necessary determination to improve the overall environmental situation."
"The European Union should therefore signal to these countries that their own efforts in the whole area of environmental protection are an essential condition for closer relations and, finally, accession to the European Union."
"In these countries there is the danger that environmental dumping is practised both in industry and in energy production."
"The improvement in the dissemination of information on LIFE projects and the associated increase in budget appropriations from 3 % to 5 % are also to be welcomed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the LIFE programme is the Union's main financial instrument for promoting action in the environmental sector."
"It was launched by the Commission in 1992 and will reach the end of its second implementation phase on 31 December of this year."
"The regulation under discussion will cover the administration of the third phase of the programme for the next five-year period 2000-2004, and funding of EUR 613 million has been made available."
"LIFE consists of three thematic components, as the rapporteur has reminded us: LIFE-Nature on the conservation of natural habitats, flora and fauna, helping to activate the Nature 2000 Network;"
"LIFE-Environment for the incorporation of environmental considerations into other policies and to implement and update environmental policy locally; and LIFE-Third Countries for technical assistance to the Mediterranean and Baltic countries, to create the necessary administrative structures and draw up environmental policies and action programmes."
"This new proposal for a Council regulation is important because it focuses on priorities such as: firstly, helping local authorities to integrate environmental considerations into land-use planning; secondly, promoting sustainable development and incorporating environmental aspects into industrial activities; and thirdly, distributing financial resources for the protection of nature, for other actions and for actions in regions bordering on the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas."
"As far as third countries are concerned, it is particularly important to pay greater attention to the means and funds at their disposal, given that - as we all know - programmes drawn up by us, here in Europe, cannot be put into practice unless other countries' governments are able to cofinance them."
"I nevertheless believe that the third phase of the LIFE programme should be extended from five to seven years, with a proportionate increase in funding."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to thank the Committee on the Environment and its rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann, for the attention they have given to the proposal concerning a third phase of the financial instrument for the environment, LIFE."
"The report and the comments which have been presented here this evening are in line with the Commission's primary objectives, and many of the amendments emphasise the most important features of LIFE."
"I should also like to express my thanks for the comments made on the administration of the scheme in DG XI, and I am grateful to Mr van Dam for what he said concerning the evaluation which lies behind the proposal we are discussing here this evening."
"Between 1992 and 1998, LIFE had considerable success in NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries."
"8 500 proposals were received, of which almost a third met the requirements."
"Around 1 300 projects have been cofinanced, with a total EC contribution of EUR 643 million."
"I would like to take this opportunity to stress that in budgetary terms, LIFE has proved to be an extremely effective tool."
"All the available resources have been used on valuable projects."
"As mentioned in the Commission's report pursuant to Article 7(3), LIFE could use more resources, up to and even above the reference amount which is indicated for LIFE II."
"It is therefore important for us to do everything possible to ensure adequate funding for the LIFE scheme."
"It is also important that LIFE is not penalised if financial restrictions should become necessary in future, as many of the speakers have mentioned here this evening."
"It is of course tempting to go into various details of the proposal, but I shall refrain from doing so and instead content myself with saying that I am pleased that the views of the Committee on the Environment and the proposed amendments are largely in line with the objectives."
"The Commission can therefore also accept 31 of the 47 amendments either in principle, in part or in full."
"I am interested to see that the Committee on the Environment is in favour of increasing the LIFE budget even beyond the amount the Commission has included in the financial statement for the proposed regulation."
"But as you know, the Commission does not accept the inclusion of reference budgets in the actual texts of regulations relating to financial programmes."
"Amendments Nos 33, 46 and 47 are therefore unacceptable."
"And the Commission is also unable to accept Amendment No 12 on a supplementary budget for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"As such, this question concerns all the Community instruments which are available to applicant countries, and can only be dealt with in the context of Association Agreements."
"As far as the committee procedure is concerned, for the time being the Commission is keeping to the 1987 decision."
"Changes can be made at a later stage, when a final decision has been reached about the new comitology proposal, and we are therefore rejecting Amendment No 37."
"Some of the amendments are aimed at extending the scope of LIFE-Nature and LIFE-Environment."
"This would run counter to the wish to concentrate the proposals on those areas where LIFE has the greatest added value."
"For this reason, we are rejecting Amendments Nos 39, 40 and 41."
"Amendment No 42 would entail a radical change in the purpose of preparatory projects, which is to develop new measures in the area of the environment, so we do not accept this amendment."
"Then there are a number of amendments requiring various reports to be submitted to Parliament."
"The Commission is prepared to give Parliament all the information necessary for the effective supervision of the programme, but this should not entail a large increase in the number of reports which have to be submitted to Parliament."
"That would in fact entail a further burden on the limited human resources."
"So we do not agree with Amendments Nos 31, 19 and 32."
"I would like to stress that the human resources for the administration of the LIFE scheme are limited."
"The administration of projects in third countries could become difficult in the coming years unless more resources are made available, and we would of course see it as an advantage if more resources were to be provided."
"We expect increasing participation by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in LIFE-Nature and LIFE-Environment."
"If we were to take on additional administrative tasks, it would mean that we would have to limit the resources that are needed for proper administration of the scheme, and the Commission cannot accept that, particularly not at this time when we have had so many discussions with Parliament about precisely this problem."
"For technical reasons, we therefore do not accept Amendments Nos 13, 14, 36 and 45."
"Finally, I would like to stress that I am pleased with Mrs Lienemann's report."
"Most of the amendments help to strengthen the LIFE strategy."
"I am convinced that the Community has benefited from the LIFE projects already carried out, and with the new regulation this potential will be able to be realised in full in the years from 2000 to 2004."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Community Eco-Management and audit scheme"
"The next item is the report (A4-0139/99) by Mr Valverde López, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Regulation allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (COM(98)0622 - C4-0683/98-98/0303(SYN))."
"Madam President, I must first congratulate the European Commission on its proposal for revision of the regulation governing the environmental audit, first approved in 1993. This reflects satisfactory progress in terms of the Commission's work."
"This new proposal has been made after five years of working with these arrangements and assessing their effectiveness in the various Member States. In my role as rapporteur, I support the broad principles of the proposal."
"I should like to take this opportunity of conveying to Mrs Graenitz, rapporteur for the Socialist Group, how much I appreciated her determination to work together and reach a joint position on many amendments."
"She has also tabled interesting amendments that I have been very pleased to support."
"The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment relate mainly to deepening and broadening the scope for implementation. This is certainly necessary and it was provided for in the previous regulation."
"Pilot projects undertaken in various Member States in non-industrial fields have proved very successful. Here, I could mention, for example, the pilot project carried out in the field of tourism in Spain, or to those carried out by certain public administrations in the field of transport, the universities and so on."
"Some amendments are aimed at making the reports on environmental audits more attractive to organisations, while others are intended to avoid overlap with ISO standards."
"Our regulation must be more advanced and far-reaching than international standards, despite being based along largely the same principles."
"An attempt has also been made to provide greater facilities for small organisations, along the lines of the European Commission's proposals. In addition, we propose greater decentralisation of the system at regional level and even at local level."
"In another context, we stress the need to standardise the public assessment report that organisations have to produce, and to ensure that its content and transparency are improved. This is something we already referred to in the 1993 report."
"In this connection, we have come up against a problem. It involves an issue of interpretation which has surprised us."
"We felt that according to the spirit and the letter of the regulation, environmental auditors had to be natural persons."
"This involves certain requirements as far as training and experience are concerned, and calls of course for professional people with the relevant qualifications who are accustomed to discharging the responsibilities associated with the liberal professions in relation to penal, civil, administrative and professional matters."
"To our great surprise, however, it appears that some Member States have a different interpretation of the concept of an auditor, applying it to legal entities."
"I believe that this would be to misinterpret the report."
"I further urge you to investigate the application of this report by the various Member States and ascertain if any departure from the spirit of the report has taken place."
"We should also be sending out two political messages, Madam President."
"According to the Commission's assessment report, certain countries have not yet managed to get their verification structure up and running. The countries in question may as well be named: they are Greece and Portugal."
"I feel that a direct approach to the authorities in these countries is called for, offering them support if necessary. The aim must be to ensure that the regulation concerning assessment of the environmental impact of organisations is applied in all Member States."
"In other countries, very few organisations have become involved. The most notable examples are Belgium, France and Italy."
"It is surprising that so few organisations have taken advantage of this regulation."
"In my view, actions aimed at promotion, cooperation, and encouragement are called for, and more information should perhaps be made available to organisations."
"I am sure you will agree with me, Commissioner, as to the nature of the second political message which needs to be sent out at the moment. In the course of the enlargement negotiations with the countries of Eastern Europe, we must bear in mind the transitional aid to be provided to those countries to enable them to take advantage of this opportunity and to carry out self assessment."
"Thank you for your patience, Madam President."
"Madam President, I would firstly like to reciprocate the thanks and praise expressed by the rapporteur."
"It was very pleasant working with him, and I hope that we can be very pleased with the result."
"I also hope, Commissioner, that you will be able to accept a number of amendments agreed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and that Parliament will also vote for these amendments tomorrow."
"The Treaty of Amsterdam requires that environmental policy should be incorporated into all areas and that sustainable development should genuinely be achieved in the European Union, and I believe that we need a lot of instruments to be able to implement this."
"The improved version of EMAS is one of those instruments which puts companies in particular in a 'win situation', allowing them to protect the environment and reduce costs."
"In my view we must publicise this opportunity much more."
"My small country has the highest percentage of EMAS-certified organisations."
"I have inspected some of these and was really able to see the enthusiasm with which the staff, the managers and the owners or shareholders support EMAS, as it is not only the environment that it benefits."
"The changes mentioned by Mr Valverde López will certainly make the programme more attractive."
"Member States will have to recognise the input already made by the companies which led the way in environmental legislation, and opportunities may have to be created in awarding public contracts."
"However, there was one point on which I did not agree with the rapporteur, but which my group considers to be very important along with worker participation, and that is the point about best available technology."
"This Parliament has defined best available technology very precisely for industry and has also - rightly, in my opinion - excluded SMEs from this."
"But if we want EMAS to become widespread and other sectors to become EMAS-certified as industrial companies or very large institutions, we must apply best available technology differently."
"Why do we always think only of industry?"
"A hotel business has best available technology for sewage."
"A transport company has best available technology for its logistics. In order to achieve the goals of sustainable development and the Kyoto objectives, I think we need to make further progress in this area."
"I very much hope that this amendment by my group - requesting that we include best available technology in this EMAS law - will be adopted."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I felt rather helpless as I had dropped my glasses."
"The aim of European environmental policy to guarantee sustainable development with a high level of environmental protection should be achieved not only with the conventional instruments of regulatory law."
"The statement in the fifth environmental action programme that industry is not just part of the environmental problem but must also be part of the solution to the problem, continues to be relevant today, and an alternative to environmental regulatory law is the environmental audit scheme that we are now discussing."
"The voluntary implementation - I emphasise this particularly - of eco-management and audit schemes allows companies to meet the requirements of environmental protection in a flexible way."
"As we have already heard several times today, the current regulation has proved itself, in particular in industrial firms, and we have also established - here I must contradict you slightly - that 75 % of companies participating in the environmental audit are from Germany."
"I too have visited the firms - a Commission list - and I can tell you that I too have seen the efforts that the people there have made, but under the simple conditions presently contained in the environmental audit scheme."
"If we now include services I find this very positive. But I think we must also recognise another problem, which is that we have to motivate small and medium-sized enterprises to agree to implement these requirements."
"In doing so we must ensure that the demands we make are not beyond the capabilities of small and medium-sized enterprises, otherwise there is the danger that - as SMEs have always told me - they will then not participate in the environmental audit programme, they will implement only ISO 14001, and they will not have an environmental audit."
"So once again we would have adopted an excellent decision here in Parliament but it would not actually be put into practice."
"I believe the debate in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection showed this too."
"I have seen how our desire to involve interested parties is put into practice, in a company that produces environmental technology."
"When we say that the available technology should apply, in my view this is a concept which has no place whatsoever in legislation, Mrs Graenitz, as it changes every week and would have to be constantly redefined."
"It cannot be defined once and for all."
"There is no end to technology."
"It continues to develop and it is not necessary the best thing."
"I appeal to you once again: let us try to change these proposals a little more, as we need widespread participation."
"We will not achieve this with the current version, I warn you!"
"Madam President, I would like to thank Mr López for an excellent report on a very complicated subject."
"I think it is important, as Mr Schnellhardt also emphasised, for us to ensure that EMAS is a useful tool for our businesses here in Europe."
"We should make sure that good environmental intentions do not make EMAS indigestible for small and medium-sized businesses."
"It must be understood that participation in the EMAS scheme is voluntary."
"It should not be misused in an attempt to impose tougher environmental legislation on businesses."
"It is important that this scheme is as flexible and unbureaucratic as possible."
"Otherwise we will not be able to persuade small and medium-sized businesses to participate in it under any circumstances."
"Now, if I may, I would like to comment on some amendments."
"To begin with, there are Amendments Nos 24, 28 and 29."
"I hope very much that my colleagues - and the Commission too - will welcome them."
"I would also like to draw attention to Amendment No 23."
"We in the Liberal Group are opposed to this proposal, because it would allow the use of the EMAS logo on products and packaging."
"I think that this would undermine the work we have done in the past and are in the process of doing in the area of labelling, and would be of no benefit to consumers or business."
"I heard my Austrian colleague talk about best available technology, or BAT."
"We in the Liberal Group have asked for split votes on the amendments dealing with this concept, because we cannot support the inclusion of BAT in EMAS."
"If BAT is included in this legislation, it will only make the scheme even more unacceptable for businesses."
"At the moment, the Commission is only preparing BAT advice for those businesses and sectors which will have statutory IPPC approval, and even this advice will not be ready before 2004, so we are opposed to this."
"Unfortunately, the scheme is not yet sufficiently widespread. We also support his proposal to broaden the objectives as regards using cleaner technology, avoiding environmental pollution by organisations, preventing environmental accidents and replacing substances, products or means of transport which cause pollution."
"As part of the process of drawing up an environmental declaration like this, we feel that information should be made available to everyone, and that worker participation should be facilitated."
"In our view, the proposal concerning the future participation of consumers and clients in the work of companies who adopt these measures is of fundamental importance. So, too, is the need to make the results of the assessments widely available together with information on the organisations participating in these projects."
"As the rapporteur suggests, it would also be helpful to introduce tax concessions for these organisations, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises for whom the use of the best technologies can be a problem. In addition, these small and medium-sized enterprises should have preferential access to finance."
"We feel very strongly that if we encourage small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in the scheme, we shall also be encouraging job creation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the present amendment aims to make the eco-audit, which is voluntary and will also remain voluntary in future, more attractive to businesses."
"I believe we all agree with this objective."
"After initially grave reservations, the eco-audit has now become a real hit with industry in those areas where it is used, and I can say on behalf of Germany that the figures speak for themselves: in absolute terms, Germany has the highest number of participating companies, even if it is only 1 % of all companies."
"Austria is in first place per capita of population, but then Austria is smaller, which is perhaps what has caused the misunderstanding referred to earlier."
"Denmark and Sweden are next, with considerably lower figures."
"However, there are a number of Member States in which the eco-audit is almost non-existent, as the rapporteur pointed out."
"It is therefore very important to provide incentives to encourage an increasing number of companies, particularly the many small and medium-sized firms, to introduce the eco-audit; I think we all agree on this."
"This is particularly important because, as Mr Schnellhardt already said, the international ISO standard 14001 means a certain level of competition which could be undermined as a result."
"A number of our amendments, also tabled by our group, were accepted by a majority in committee."
"I must say, however, that a number of amendments were also accepted in committee which in our view run counter to the objectives and are indeed at odds with the whole purpose of the exercise."
"If we now suddenly lay down standards it is no longer a voluntary system but one in which the companies are to be given incentives to achieve more in the relevant areas than the legislation requires."
"That is the incentive."
"But if I now lay down fixed standards, then it is no longer a voluntary eco-audit but one that is difficult for some companies to achieve."
"I must say quite honestly, on behalf of a number of colleagues and myself, that if the amendments that run counter to the objectives are adopted, we cannot vote for the report."
"We want the audit to remain voluntary and incentives to be increased; we also want the administration to be reduced, in other words no further conditions to be imposed but instead to improve management."
"I come from Bavaria and I can say that German companies have carried out most eco-audits because the incentives have really worked here."
"I wish this were also the case in other Member States too."
"Madam President, I should like to tell the Commissioner that the regulation has been greatly improved, as Mr Valverde has already said."
"This second version is very much better, particularly Annex VII which is new and which concerns the initial assessment."
"In the light of my considerable experience in this sector, I feel that the initial assessment is the key to setting up a management system successfully."
"I would say it stands for 80 %, yet it in the past it did not exist."
"Nevertheless, ladies and gentlemen, I think you have failed to take into account how industry actually operates."
"Hundreds of organisations have adopted ISO standard 14001, along with others the world over, and they have been registered."
"A few - a very few - are registered with the EMAS scheme."
"But why so few?"
"Even the 2 000 registered in Germany represent only a tiny percentage of the large organisations."
"This is because the system is terribly complex."
"In my opinion, Commissioner, the entire verification procedure should be simplified."
"Why are there many verifiers in Germany?"
"The reason is that they are natural persons. As Mr Valverde has said, what happens in a great many other countries is that the accrediting bodies will only accredit insurance companies or standardisation companies and that makes the complex procedure even more difficult."
"I trust the new version will help to improve this situation."
"Nevertheless, I suspect that most organisations will continue to be certificated under ISO 14001, and environmental audits under ISO 14010 and 14011, because it is so much more practical and useful to do so. In fact, it comes to the same, because ISO 14001 constitutes 80 % of the EMAS scheme."
"The remainder is made up by the verification the Commissioner is called upon to simplify."
"Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment and especially its rapporteur, Mr Valverde López, for the effort which has been made to ensure the rapid progress of this proposal revising the existing EMAS scheme."
"We are talking - as has been emphasised - about a voluntary market instrument aimed at improving the contribution which businesses make to the environment."
"But I shall not repeat the proposal."
"There have been many excellent speeches about it, so instead I will concentrate on the 65 amendments which have been tabled."
"The Commission finds 20 of these amendments acceptable in full or in part."
"We are able to accept Amendment No 1, the first part of No 4 and the second part of No 26, because we believe they help make the Commission's proposal more attractive to business."
"Then there is the second part of Amendments No 18 and Amendment No 51, which also strengthen the credibility of EMAS and can therefore be supported."
"The comparability and conformity of the scheme between Member States is also of great importance, and for that reason Amendments Nos 34 and 43, which demonstrate Parliament's support, can be accepted."
"Other key principles in the proposal are intelligibility, clarity, transparency and subsidiarity."
"The rapporteur, Mr Valverde López, touched on the problem of making the scheme sufficiently well known, and intelligibility, clarity, transparency and subsidiarity are all important in this respect."
"The Commission can therefore support Amendments Nos 5, 8, 11, 20, 21, 24, 27, 42, 45, 48 and 61 in principle, because in the main we think that they reinforce these aspects."
"We are unable to accept the other amendments."
"As far as the most important of these are concerned, I shall now discuss some of the reasons why the Commission cannot accept them."
"Because EMAS is a voluntary instrument, it is important for it to have a logical structure and to be intelligible. For this reason, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 7, 12, 13, 14, 36, 41, 44, 53, 54, 59, 64 and 65 because they repeat elements which are already covered by the text, especially in Annex I A. Support and incentives for organisations taking part in EMAS are included in the proposal and improved by the amendments we are accepting, as I have just mentioned."
"Amendments which lower the requirements for SMEs are not acceptable."
"The proposal has been framed in such a way that it can be applied by businesses of any size."
"The attitude of SMEs themselves is that they do not want a lower level scheme because they fear it would be of less value in the market-place."
"For this reason, we do not support Amendments Nos 2, 52 and 56."
"The added value for the environment of the EMAS scheme compared with ISO 14001 is an important aspect of the proposal, as has also been mentioned in the debate."
"The Commission therefore does not support Amendments Nos 16, 17, 52 and 63, because they weaken the transparency and control of information concerning environmental outcomes by reducing the validation frequency."
"An important element of the proposal is that it extends the scope of the EMAS scheme to cover all business sectors."
"The Commission is therefore unable to accept amendments relating only to a single sector, such as Amendments Nos 7, 12 and 25, which require organisations to apply best available technology, and I can understand why opinions have been divided on this in Parliament."
"As the directives on public tendering now stand, the first part of Amendment No 26 and Amendment No 30 are not acceptable."
"However, I personally have some sympathy for the thinking behind these amendments, and future developments in this area could lead us to take the matter up again."
"The Commission is convinced that in its improved version, with the addition of those amendments from Parliament which have been accepted today, this document provides an effective and balanced instrument for improving the environmental impact of economic activities throughout the Union, and with those comments, Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Valverde López, and the Committee on the Environment for their work."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m."
"Pollution-related illnesses"
"The next item is the report (A4-0167/99) by Mr Cabrol, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action on pollution-related diseases in the context of the framework for action in the field of public health (1999-2001) (3603/99 - C4-0125/99-97/0153(COD))."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin by briefly outlining the background to this matter."
"During its sitting of 11 March 1998, Parliament delivered its opinion at first reading on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action on pollution-related illnesses."
"I would point out that the purpose of this programme is not to take direct action to combat the emission of pollutants, but to review existing knowledge by collecting all available data on pollution-related diseases and to list the pollutants concerned with a view to planning preventive action."
"The programme is aimed at the Member States, which must collect the data, and at the people of the European Union so as to enable them to protect themselves as well as they can from pollution."
"At the end of first reading, Parliament tabled a number of amendments which the Council considered before presenting a common position."
"The President of Parliament announced that he had received this at the sitting of 18 June 1998 and, on the whole, the Council's common position seemed satisfactory."
"Nevertheless, Parliament adopted 14 amendments to that text."
"By letter of 18 December 1998, the Council announced that it could not approve all of Parliament's amendments."
"Therefore, the President of the Council, in agreement with the President of Parliament, convened a meeting of the Conciliation Committee to be held on 4 February 1999."
"The conciliation procedure was relatively difficult because the Council did not show any particular interest in the programme."
"Nevertheless, following three sets of tripartite talks with the Austrian and German Presidencies, Parliament's delegation was satisfied with many of its amendments, which we shall group together according to their objectives."
"As regards the three amendments on strengthening the follow-up of the programme, two were accepted, guaranteeing the programme's continual assessment, the drawing-up of a Commission report during the final year of the programme, along with actions being planned for the future."
"The extension of the scope of the programme through a policy of prevention and increasing awareness of the risks was also accepted, as was the issue of complementarity with other health programmes, and an annual report on this subject must be provided by the Commission."
"Moreover, the Council approved the principle of public information, admittedly by means of professionals, but it included some very important points, such as the risk of pollution on foodstuffs."
"The conduct of epidemiological studies was approved and, finally, certain parts of the Council's text which were incomprehensible were clarified."
"As regards comitology, a compromise made the recital more acceptable and easier to understand."
"Unfortunately, a number of amendments were not accepted, in particular, the amendment on the prevention programme for pollution-related allergies. More importantly, Parliament's delegation noted that the Council was unwilling to give way on the budget for the programme."
"We had asked for ECU 7 million instead of ECU 3.9 million."
"It became evident that, in view of the negotiations on Agenda 2000, several Council delegations had been instructed not to make any concessions on the budget."
"Whilst regretting this situation, Parliament's delegation accepted the amount specified in the common position, subject to a joint declaration by the three institutions relating to the Commission proposal for the adoption of a new framework programme in the field of public health after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"The declaration reads as follows: 'The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission declare that, among the priority issues to be addressed within the framework of the future programme on public health, they will pay particular attention to rare diseases and pollution-related diseases and will duly take account of the budgetary implications.'"
"In conclusion, our delegation welcomes the outcome of the conciliation procedure on this programme, which, along with that on rare diseases, is the latest in a series of public health programmes."
"As a result, we recommend that Parliament adopt the legislative decision in accordance with the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like, also on behalf of my group, to express my thanks and appreciation to the rapporteur, Mr Cabrol, for leading the negotiations."
"I believe this subject - the link between pollution and health - is an important one."
"It is also an issue which greatly concerns the people of Europe, and I do not believe that it is simply a question of exaggerated fears."
"Pollution has repercussions for health, and we must focus more closely on this."
"This programme can make only a modest contribution, however."
"It cannot solve the problem of pollution-related illnesses; it can merely develop strategies or help to develop strategies."
"For this reason, our group, unlike the Commission and the Group of the Party of European Socialists, agreed from the beginning that we immediately need an integrated programme that includes all aspects of public health and also this programme."
"At first reading we were therefore against a five-year period and in favour of a three-year period."
"However, we did not agree that funds should be cut in the way that was unfortunately proposed and ultimately implemented by the Council of Ministers, as with slightly greater resources we could have done more in the first three years, including preparing for a comprehensive health programme."
"I regret especially that the specific measures such as in the area of allergies were deleted from the annex, and my group and I regret in particular the fact that self-help groups were no longer expressly mentioned, as I believe that we would have genuine added value if the European Union supported self-help groups and exchanges between them, but this is unfortunately no longer referred to in the programme."
"However, I would call upon the Commission, within the scope offered by the programme, to support those self-help groups which are committed to pollution-related illnesses and to combating these illnesses."
"It is very important to me and to my group that this programme should not merely produce figures that are put to one side and forgotten, as it is all very well to collate data at European level but none of this is of any use if we do not take concrete action."
"The Commission and the Council of Ministers have in the past been too hesitant."
"For example, in terms of car exhaust emissions Parliament had to force through the introduction of strict standards and ensure that the ozone problem was really approached effectively in Europe."
"I believe that we must also take health aspects into account as part of the CO2 question, as illnesses that have to date existed only in the tropics will appear in Europe as a result of global warming, and there will also be other problems."
"We must also take concrete action in the area of consumer health protection if this programme is to serve any purpose."
"We must include the recommendations that are developed from this in our legislation in other areas too."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Rare diseases"
"The next item is the report (A4-0166/99) by Mr Viceconte, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action on rare diseases in the context of the framework for action in the field of public health (1999-2003) (3602/99 - C4-0124/99-97/0146(COD))."
"I give the floor to Mr Parodi, who is deputising for the rapporteur, Mr Viceconte."
"Mr President, in the Conciliation Committee on 4 February, Parliament and the Council reached an agreement on the programme of action relating to rare diseases, for which Mr Viceconte is rapporteur and which the European Parliament discussed at first reading on 11 March last year and at second reading on 8 October."
"It is a five-year Community programme, running from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2003, and its main aim is to improve information on rare diseases which affect fewer than five in 10 000 people in the EU but are all the more dangerous for this very reason."
"Parliament and the Council reached an agreement in the Conciliation Committee on 4 February, especially in respect of the establishment of a European database on rare diseases and access to it, encouragement and support for professionals with a view to improving the early diagnosis, identification and prevention of rare diseases, transnational cooperation among voluntary bodies, networking of groups of people directly or indirectly concerned and coordination at Community level, EU support for the monitoring of rare diseases in the Member States, training and refresher courses for professionals, and the promotion of networks of experts interested in a rapid response to the phenomenon of clusters."
"Allow me to stress certain key points."
"The first is that the action programme has to do with information, in particular the establishment of a coherent and complementary European information network on rare diseases and access to it through existing databases."
"The establishment of a European network is vital."
"Early diagnosis is of the essence, and there is currently no Europe-wide database; only France, with its Orphanet system, has a database on rare diseases."
"A second priority measure is training and refresher courses for professionals so as to improve early diagnosis, identification, intervention and prevention."
"Another element is the promotion of transnational cooperation and the networking of groups of people directly or indirectly affected by these rare diseases or groups of volunteers and health professionals, as well as coordination at Community level to ensure continuity and transnational cooperation."
"Another significant point concerns Community support for the monitoring of rare diseases in the Member States and early warning systems relating to clusters, as well as networking and training for experts involved in handling these diseases and in responding rapidly."
"This programme, along with the one on pollution-related diseases, for which Mr Cabrol is rapporteur and which is likewise to be put to the vote tomorrow, forms part of the Community's activities in the public health sector: a sector in need of expansion - as we have been stressing for some time - bearing in mind that we are not targeting major health scourges here but the few sufferers who are dying because no one pays them any attention."
"We therefore believe that it is only right to implement these measures."
"Unfortunately, the funding of EUR 6.5 million approved for the five-year period 1999-2003 is quite insufficient."
"One need only think that the National Organization for Rare Diseases, in the United States, has earmarked a substantial USD 3.2 million over the past three years, and that France alone has spent FRF 3 million on the primary operating system for the Orphanet database."
"Nevertheless, this is one step on the way to a more incisive and effective Community health policy, which the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty should help us to achieve."
"This report leads to a conclusion."
"Allow me to say, even if I am slightly overrunning my allotted time - but after 15 years, this might perhaps be the last time I speak in this House, which is of great significance to me - that health must not be included in other sectors."
"The European Parliament must have the courage of its convictions and discuss health as a sector in its own right, because it is not true that diseases are on the decline."
"I believe that we are facing a very difficult future; only if all 15 countries sing in harmony can we safeguard health, which is the prime asset of each and every one of us."
"Without health, we cannot even engage in politics."
"Mr President, I too think that to conclude the European Parliament's activities on health policy with two programmes - this one on rare diseases and the one on pollution-related diseases - demonstrates the importance we attach to health policy."
"We must highlight the problem of rare diseases in particular, because it is a typical issue which can only be tackled on an international and transnational scale."
"EU-wide cooperation is therefore crucial, and that is why we consider this programme so significant."
"We were therefore satisfied to note, at conciliation, that there was agreement on most of Parliament's amendments."
"We nevertheless regret the fact that the funding for the programme remains greatly inadequate, and we hope that the joint statement by Parliament, the Council and the Commission - indicating that this programme and the one on pollution-related diseases must be given more scope, including in budgetary terms - will be followed up properly by the next Parliament and the next Commission."
"First of all I should like to thank all those who have contributed: Professor Cabrol, Mr Parodi, Mr Liese and Mr Tamino."
"I thank them for their contributions and their continued support for the development of public health in the Union."
"I welcome the joint texts adopted by the Conciliation Committee on 4 February 1999 on the rare diseases and pollution-related diseases programmes."
"The points of difference between Parliament and the Council have now finally, as Professor Cabrol has indicated, been ironed out."
"I hope that the role played by my services and the action that I myself took in assisting with these compromise texts was useful and that we have finally brought matters to a conclusion."
"I know that Parliament has not been very happy that the budgetary resources for both programmes were so limited."
"In the context of the current budgetary perspectives it would, however, have been difficult to achieve much more in this respect."
"Nevertheless, on the basis of the proposed joint declaration of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, we are now in a position where it is possible to anticipate that these issues can be more fully addressed in the context of a new framework programme on public health."
"I hope that the joint texts and the common declaration will be confirmed here today."
"I can confirm the commitment of the Commission to the declarations agreed at conciliation."
"Let me emphasise from the Commission's side that we attach very great importance to both these programmes even if, in their duration and scope, they essentially constitute really just a first step in the right direction."
"I very much hope that the European Parliament can approve both programmes here today and that we can move quickly to put them into effect."
"Mr Liese made two points: one was concerning the self-help groups."
"I would like to assure him that it is our intention that in the future framework of understanding we hope to be in a better position and have a real capacity to do something to assist the self-help groups."
"I would also like to indicate that Article 152 of the Amsterdam Treaty puts an obligation on us to take account of other Community policies in the development of our health programmes."
"Finally, to you, Mr Parodi."
"It may be your last contribution to the development of our public health programmes, but you have made a significant contribution."
"The point you made about the United States being ahead of us in these matters is well taken."
"But I would like you to agree with me that perhaps we now have here the possibility of a first good step to try and catch up."
"When the new framework is put in place it will bring us on-line."
"I would hope that in your retirement you will recognise that you have made a considerable contribution to the development of these programmes."
"I would like to say a special word of thanks to Professor Cabrol for his continued dedication and commitment to these matters throughout my time here with the European Parliament."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The sitting was closed at 10.50 p.m."
"Agenda"
"Mr President, on a point of order under Rule 41 and Annex II of the Rules of Procedure."
"I received a letter yesterday saying that my Question No 41, concerning the plight of a Kosovan refugee, would not be taken at Question Time to the Council tonight as it is dealt with under Item 144 on the agenda."
"I think this is a genuine error."
"The question concerns the specific immigration status of a specific Kosovan refugee and the failure to provide visas for him from embassies in other EU states."
"Clearly this will not be dealt with in a general discussion about Kosovo."
"I would ask your services to look at this and ensure that this question at least receives a written answer so that this man does not have his job threatened and is not forced to go back to Kosovo where he would be in danger of losing his life."
"Mr Howitt, you know that paragraph 2 of Annex II (A) - Guidelines - says 'A question shall be inadmissible if the agenda already provides for the subject to be discussed with the participation of the institution concerned'."
"It is precisely not to have a general discussion disturbed by particular points by another channel."
"In any case, you can put that question next time or in any other form."
"I can admit it today when we have a general debate on Kosovo where any of the groups can take up your question."
"It is cannot be treated separately in Question Time."
"I am sorry, I cannot offer any other solution."
"Outcome of extraordinary European Council in Berlin of 24/25 March 1999"
"The next item is the report of the European Council and the statement by the Commission on the results of the extraordinary European Council meeting of 24 and 25 March 1999 in Berlin."
"I should like to welcome Chancellor Schröder, on what is his first visit to the House."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions to wind up this debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, three weeks ago today, at about this time, the European Council held its extraordinary meeting in Berlin."
"Even as we arrived in Berlin, there were growing fears that it would not prove possible to find a peaceful solution to the conflict in Kosovo."
"During the days before the Berlin Council, the attacks by the Serbian security forces ..."
"Mixed reactions"
"... against the Albanian ethnic majority had increased massively."
"President Milosevic used the weeks after Rambouillet and Paris to embark on the systematic expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo."
"The community of states could not just stand by and watch."
"Loud applause"
"The Kosovar Albanians quite rightly expect human rights, the rights to freedom, to their homeland and to inviolability, to apply unconditionally to them too."
"The European community of values would become an empty phrase if we Europeans allowed the principles on which the European Union is founded to be trampled underfoot in a place just one hour's flight away from here, that is to say, in the middle of our continent."
"Applause"
"These principles are democracy, justice and the rule of law, freedom and solidarity with the weaker members of society."
"Since the evening of 24 March, the allied air force has been attacking targets in Yugoslavia."
"That same evening the European Council in Berlin gave its unanimous support to the actions of the North Atlantic Alliance."
"To put it quite plainly: anyone who violates human rights as brutally as President Milosevic has done must expect a resolute response from us."
"Applause"
"Anyone who with cold-blooded calculation bases his rule on the misery, the persecution and the murder of part of an ethnic minority must know that the western community of values is prepared to take the ultimate step to prevent an even worse scenario and also to enforce the fundamental values that are its values."
"It was not with a light heart but only after real and careful consideration of all the arguments that we decided to use military force."
"I am firmly convinced that there was no alternative to this decision in view of the increasingly tense situation in Kosovo."
"The combination of the Kosovo crisis, the resignation of the Commission and Agenda 2000 probably represent the biggest challenges any European Council has ever had to tackle."
"Each of these tasks in itself would have taken up an entire European summit under normal circumstances."
"In Berlin we managed to tackle all three challenges at the same time."
"Berlin - and this must be emphasised - demonstrated more impressively perhaps than any European Council meeting before it that the European Union is capable of action."
"We are convinced that is the message of the Berlin summit."
"Europe is without any question living up to its responsibilities."
"The European Union will not be divided."
"The signal of the Berlin summit is this: we Europeans speak with one voice."
"We managed to adopt Agenda 2000 on the summit morning of 26 March."
"With the Berlin package we have found a compromise under which all parties concerned have to make concessions."
"It is a compromise that is sensible and that we can all live with. That is why it is, in my view, a good and fair agreement."
"In Berlin, we nominated Mr Romano Prodi for the office of President of the Commission."
"With your assent, ladies and gentlemen, by the summer we will again have a fully functioning Commission under undisputedly competent leadership."
"I am also happy to be able to confirm to you that Berlin has finally paved the way for a trade and cooperation agreement with South Africa."
"Applause"
"I know that many Members of this House are very committed in their support for the new South Africa."
"I personally was also very pleased that after all these years of negotiations we finally achieved this breakthrough towards the end of President Mandela's term of office."
"The Berlin package on Agenda 2000 creates a viable foundation for European Union action in the coming years and sends out a clear signal to the people of Europe, to the markets, and also to the applicant countries."
"It signals that the Member States of the European Union were prepared to put their common responsibility above their own national interests."
"I need not, at this point, discuss the Berlin agreement in detail once more."
"But let me emphasise that two principles did and still do take precedence: stability of expenditure on the one hand and solidarity with the weaker on the other."
"We agreed in Berlin that we would also exercise stringent budgetary discipline in Europe in future."
"At the same time we want to and will maintain cohesion between the Member States, as provided in the Treaty."
"You all know that the Member States' original positions on many aspects of Agenda 2000 still diverged very widely up to the time of the summit."
"I will remember that night in Berlin as one of the most difficult and lengthiest negotiations I have ever had to conduct."
"As German Chancellor, I left no doubt in Berlin that my country would be prepared to subordinate its rightful national interests to a reasonable overall solution."
"This approach based on European responsibility paved the way to an adequate solution."
"In the end all the partners were more interested in achieving European added value than in asserting their potential own interests in individual cases."
"This made it possible to reach a compromise that paves the European Union's way into the 21st century."
"The European Parliament - that is to say, you - were closely and constructively involved in the preliminary work on Agenda 2000 up to the summit, sometimes under great pressure of deadlines."
"I would like to express my very real gratitude to you for this commitment and the accompanying flexibility and willingness to seek joint solutions, and at the same time to ask you: please do all you can to bring the ongoing legislative procedures to a speedy conclusion as quickly as possible."
"The implementation of the Berlin package is not just the condition for further steps in the enlargement process."
"The uninterrupted continuation of structural aid after the end of the year would also be at risk if we did not cooperate rapidly."
"Against this background, I hope it will prove possible to adopt the necessary legal acts quickly."
"Our citizens, the people of Europe, want integration."
"Our common Europe has long since become a reality in terms of good neighbourliness, of countless cultural, economic and social links."
"At the same time the people of Europe are rightly urging us to make the European institutions capable of action now and in the future."
"They have no sympathy for any inefficiency in transposing Community policies and expect all concerned to show the highest personal integrity."
"Following the mass resignation of the Commission under Mr Jacques Santer, the European Union risked facing a serious institutional crisis."
"By rapidly nominating Mr Romano Prodi on the very first morning of the Berlin summit, the European Council made an important contribution to preventing the looming crisis."
"That too is a major and lasting success of the Berlin summit."
"While I was still in Berlin, I informed the President of the European Parliament of this nomination, in my capacity of President of the European Council."
"I also took that opportunity to point out that he must certainly be appointed under the procedure provided to that effect in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Today I would ask you to deliver your vote on the future President of the Commission in good time, so that the entire Commission can be appointed before the end of this summer following the selection of members of the college by the President-designate and the Member State governments."
"The European Parliament has clearly gained in stature over the past months."
"I am confident that the people of Europe will reward this by a high level of participation in the elections on 10-13 June."
"This afternoon, the EU Heads of State and Government will be holding an informal meeting in Brussels."
"It will begin with an in-depth discussion of current progress on the Kosovo issue."
"I will be returning to that at the end of my statement."
"During the second part of the meeting, we will start discussing the Commission's future working procedures with Mr Romano Prodi."
"We are firmly convinced that the European Union needs a strong Commission that really can live up to the requirements of efficiency, transparency and - quite crucially - closeness to the people."
"That is why we will ask Mr Prodi, the Commission President-designate, to draw up a programme, on the basis also of discussions with the European Parliament and the Member States, which clearly defines the Commission's changed working procedures."
"Some of the improvements here will require a revision of the Treaty."
"To that end we should use the opportunity of the intergovernmental conference that is in any case scheduled to resolve the institutional questions that remained outstanding in Amsterdam."
"I will suggest to my colleagues that they should adopt the timetable for this intergovernmental conference, which if possible should take place by next year, at the European Council in Cologne."
"Applause"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in retrospect the last few years will prove to have been good years for the European Union, for European policy."
"The introduction of the euro was a major step towards integration."
"Applause"
"The countries involved took a sovereign political decision to pass on a national responsibility for a central aspect of their economic policy to a European institution."
"Among other things, the Amsterdam Treaty laid the foundation stone for a common justice and home affairs policy and for a common and viable foreign and security policy for the Union."
"The European Parliament acquired much-improved codecision rights."
"The enlargement process was set in motion and we have opened accession negotiations with the best-prepared applicants, in the awareness also that European integration can succeed only if Europe does not stop at the borders of what used to be the iron curtain."
"All of this, as also the adoption of Agenda 2000 in Berlin, was also achieved thanks to the outgoing Commission under Mr Jacques Santer."
"Applause"
"Whatever criticism there has been, and however well-founded it may have been, I want to repeat my warm thanks to Mr Jacques Santer and the college at this point!"
"Applause"
"Once again we are facing major tasks."
"They can only be mastered by a strong Commission that is able to act."
"In the person of Mr Romano Prodi the Heads of State and Government have appointed a candidate for the office of President of the Commission who, I am firmly convinced, fulfils all the requirements for mastering these tasks together with us and with you."
"Even before the Kosovo situation began to worsen, we knew that the EU's common foreign and security policy needs to be further strengthened."
"The Amsterdam Treaty that will enter into force on 1 May brings definite improvements in that direction."
"At the European Council in Cologne we intend to appoint the future high representative for the common foreign and security policy."
"We need to definitely intensify cooperation in the field of security and defence policy."
"With the adoption of a cross-pillar common strategy on Russia, we want to send out an unmistakeable signal that the European Union wants to further expand its relations with Russia and will do so."
"Applause"
"We have achieved a quality of cooperation with Russia which we for our part will certainly not call in question again."
"We welcome the Russian endeavours, in the current crisis, to exert a positive influence on Belgrade."
"I am in close contact with President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov."
"Russia - I am convinced - is a central factor of stability in Europe and we must ensure that it is and remains in a position to advance along the road to reform on which it has embarked."
"Here the European Union remains prepared to cooperate."
"Indeed, where at all possible, it would like to intensify this cooperation."
"As I have learned from talks I have held, this is also recognised in Russia itself."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we need tangible improvements in EU cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs."
"Here too the Amsterdam Treaty opens up new opportunities and potential, which we want to grasp courageously."
"A first test of this will be whether we manage to treat the Kosovar refugees who come into the European Union generously and on a basis of solidarity."
"Applause"
"Combating mass unemployment has to be a central concern of the European Union."
"We must find ways of maintaining social cohesion and the European social model even under the conditions of the global competition of the 21st century."
"Important work was done in preparation for the launch of the euro in the field of economic policy."
"But we should not focus on a one-sided, purely doctrinal stability policy."
"In the long term we would not be able to convey it to our citizens in political terms."
"In Cologne we therefore want to supplement the stability and growth pact, which we continue to uphold, with a European employment pact."
"Applause"
"One important task for the future remains enlarging the European Union to the east and the south."
"Unless the Union is open to new Member States, in the long term European integration would remain a half-baked project and would fail for lack of a political rationale."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, there is also a lesson to be learnt from the Kosovo crisis in relation to the applicant countries."
"Some of them have now found stability in their external and security policy within NATO."
"But what they want and what they need is for this stability also to be backed up by economic stability."
"That is the reason they want to join the EU, and quite sensibly so."
"In relation to the existing Member States, it should be said that they too have a very real interest in enlargement."
"The lesson of Yugoslavia is that peace on this continent is only possible if economic and social development can and does advance throughout Europe."
"Applause"
"Under the German Presidency we have made headway with the ongoing accession negotiations."
"The European Council in Berlin sent out a message to the applicant countries once again confirming that the enlargement process will resolutely go ahead."
"With the adoption of Agenda 2000 we have created a further condition for achieving that."
"The aim of the intergovernmental conference on key institutional questions, to which I referred earlier, is to ensure that the European Union definitively removes the last possible barrier to the accession of new Member States."
"Then it will be up to the applicant states to fulfil the requirements of the acquis communautaire ."
"We will continue in future to support them in this with all our strength."
"I want to put it clearly on the record that the progress made so far by the applicant countries is impressive and really does give grounds for hope."
"To conclude what I have to say, let me come back again to the situation in Kosovo."
"You will be discussing the development of the conflict today, which I very much welcome."
"Europe must speak with a strong voice in times such as this and the words must be spoken not just by members of the governments and national parliaments."
"As an expression of the new Europe, Parliament too must take a definite position, in favour of peace, stability and respect for human rights in Yugoslavia."
"The dreadful developments in Kosovo are not an internal Yugoslav problem."
"They affect us all!"
"Good neighbourliness and justice do not end at national frontiers."
"We bear common responsibility for our continent."
"There cannot and must not be any excuse whatsoever for a cynical policy of driving out, indeed of deporting hundreds of thousands of people."
"Applause"
"One million people have had to leave their houses and homes or were driven out by Serbian security forces, 500 000 of them since March alone."
"There are more than 300 000 refugees from Kosovo in Albania."
"The small country of Macedonia is also in an extremely difficult position."
"That is why the EU Member States launched a large-scale aid operation jointly with other states."
"We want to alleviate the plight of the refugees and we want to show solidarity with the neighbouring states."
"That is why the Council decided last Thursday to earmark EUR 150 million for humanitarian aid to the refugees."
"We will support the main host countries, Albania and Macedonia, together with the Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro, with another EUR 100 million."
"Heckling: So will we!"
"Very good!"
"The Council has also requested the Commission to submit proposals on further tightening the European Union's relations with Macedonia, looking even to a potential association agreement."
"The extremist Belgrade leadership bears sole responsibility for the situation that has arisen."
"The decision to put a lasting and verifiable end to the operations of the military and security forces and to allow the refugees to return is in its hands."
"Mere cease-fire declarations, which are not meant seriously and which we know from the wars in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be lies, are not enough."
"Belgrade must immediately take verifiable steps to resolve the conflict."
"In addition to a genuine cease-fire, that means the withdrawal of all Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, including the infamous bands of paramilitaries, the return of the refugees and the deployment of international troops to protect the refugees and the population."
"Applause"
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who will be a guest at the informal meeting of Heads of State and Government this evening in Brussels, also supports this demand."
"It is now up to the Yugoslav side to accept the demands of the international community unconditionally and to implement them at once."
"That and that alone would open the way to a political settlement of the conflict."
"The western alliance is not just fighting in the Balkans to prevent suffering and to secure justice and the rule of law in the Balkans."
"The credibility and validity of the European model of civilisation are also at stake."
"The Belgrade regime is waging war against its own population."
"That is why the democratic and constitutional societies of Europe had to oppose the totalitarian regime in Belgrade."
"The 'European integration' model of the future is confronted with a hermetic concept of ethnic nationalism, which leaves no room for minorities and different opinions."
"You could say, if you like, that the 21st century is confronting the 19th century."
"Thinking further ahead, there can therefore only be one future for the states and peoples of the region."
"If we want to help democracy to become established there on a lasting basis and win over the people of the region - and here I definitely include the people of Yugoslavia - for the European model, we have to offer them a European prospect."
"Applause"
"By that I do not mean early accession to the European Union, which would in any case place too heavy a burden on these countries."
"I am thinking far more of a comprehensive regional strategy, of a kind of stability pact for the Balkan region."
"The aim of that kind of strategy is to pave the way to establishing links with the European Union, with the single market and with the European community of values."
"The German Presidency has submitted a proposal to that effect."
"It is our task to determine, through resolute action, under what auspices Europe will end this bloody century of national egoism and inflated ideology."
"It is our duty to bring about the definitive, irreversible advance of democracy, human rights and cross-frontier cooperation throughout Europe."
"Wherever the plight of the people in this region requires it, we will be generous and give real proof of our solidarity with the weak."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us tackle this task together, in the name of Europe, in the name of its people and in the name of its values!"
"Many thanks for your attention!"
"Sustained applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, on 14 July 1997, I presented Agenda 2000 to this House, one of the largest packages of reforms in the history of the Union."
"On that occasion, I stated that it represented an historic opportunity to strengthen the Union and prepare for enlargement."
"Today, I am extremely pleased that the Berlin European Council was able to successfully meet this challenge."
"This outcome would not have been possible without strong independent institutions that are capable of taking action."
"Of course, the negotiations on Agenda 2000 have been complex and difficult."
"We had to continue with the agricultural reforms launched in 1992 and maintain the essential elements of economic and social cohesion, whilst taking enlargement and the financial constraints into account."
"A year ago, negotiations began on the basis of legislative proposals put forward by the Commission, and these negotiations developed satisfactorily under the British and Austrian Presidencies. The negotiations were completed in Berlin thanks to the German Chancellor and I should like to pay tribute to him on behalf of the Commission."
"Of course, the work is not yet finished."
"There is still some legislative work to be completed before the end of your parliamentary term."
"We must also negotiate the interinstitutional agreement, to which you quite rightly attach so much importance."
"But the Berlin agreement has created the political bases needed to complete a package of measures that I would describe as 'ambitious'."
"I am well aware that there will be disappointment over some points here and there but, overall, there is every reason to welcome an agreement that falls within the guidelines followed by the Commission since 1997."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, we needed to preserve competitiveness and the exporting role of this increasingly multifunctional sector while developing rural areas."
"It is common knowledge that the Commission would have liked to have gone a little further down the path of reform. Nonetheless, I believe that Agenda 2000 was a real step forward."
"As regards the common organisation of markets, the idea of price reductions with partial compensation has been upheld."
"Our proposals for rural development have been adopted as they stand."
"The issue here is to adjust the scale of such development."
"These reforms will allow us to strengthen agriculture whilst remaining within a rigorous financial framework for the whole of the new period."
"They will also smooth the way for enlargement and for an agreement within the World Trade Organisation."
"As regards the second major category of expenditure, namely structural operations, our objective was to preserve economic and social cohesion whilst achieving greater concentration of available resources."
"The Commission felt it was crucial to maintain the levels of aid that were achieved in 1999 for the most affected regions and social groups."
"We succeeded in doing this."
"Secondly, we had to resolve certain specific problems."
"Rather than distorting the objective criteria for allocating resources, the European Council decided to set aside a small proportion of the budget within the overall budget to deal with such cases in the appropriate manner."
"The main principles behind the proposed reforms were therefore also maintained, although this has indeed led to a somewhat tedious listing of ad hoc solutions."
"Thirdly, the Agenda 2000 communication, proposed by the Commission, set out to provide the Union with the means it needed to create the appropriate conditions for lasting growth that generated employment."
"To this end, the Commission wished to strengthen heading 3 on internal policies."
"The amount decided on in Berlin is at the bottom end of the bracket proposed by the presidency."
"I have often drawn the Council's attention to the importance this House attaches to heading 3, and I am sure that you will succeed in raising our ambitions during the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement."
"The last element as far as expenditure is concerned is administrative expenditure."
"In Agenda 2000, the Commission had already begun to consider its own reform."
"In this context, the issue of balancing political objectives and administrative resources is of the utmost importance."
"As far as heading 5 is concerned, even though the amounts decided on in Berlin are at the top end of the bracket proposed by the presidency, they will barely allow staffing levels in the institutions to remain constant."
"This is unsatisfactory."
"Here, again, the negotiations on the interinstitutional agreement will allow Parliament to try to change this approach."
"Mr President, the Union will not continue to develop with the current 15 Member States alone."
"Intensive preparations are underway to enlarge the Union to include our friends and neighbours."
"In Agenda 2000, the Commission had suggested setting aside a considerable part of the financial package for the pre-accession process and future enlargement."
"I see that our proposals, the equivalent of a real Marshall Plan, have been adopted in their entirety in this package, and we are talking here of a sum of EUR 80 billion."
"We had to combine the two objectives of deepening and widening the Union within a strict, efficient and equitable financial framework."
"The Berlin agreement must now lead to an interinstitutional agreement that will help guarantee budgetary discipline within ceilings established by rigorous but realistic financial perspectives."
"As far as the Union is concerned, commitments will stabilise in 2006 at a level lower than that forecast for the year 2000, and this will involve considerable efforts to reduce expenditure."
"By stabilising the expenditure for 15 countries, we will create the necessary margins within the own resources ceilings that will allow us to welcome new members between 2000 and 2006."
"That, ladies and gentlemen, is also solidarity."
"We have finally been able to reach an agreement on own resources that will lead to a more equitable system."
"Partially replacing the VAT resource with the GNP-based resource will ensure that Member State's contributions are more in line with their ability to contribute."
"The change in the financing of the British rebate will remove some of the burden from the countries with the greatest budgetary imbalances, without introducing new corrective mechanisms."
"Before the end of the new financial perspective, the Commission will have the opportunity to once again examine the own resources system, including the effects of enlargement and the question of new autonomous own resources, something that is close to Parliament's heart."
"Mr President, the agreement reached in Berlin on Agenda 2000 is a success and it is a success for the Union."
"I am counting on Parliament to provide the few corrections needed."
"Once again, the Union has shown that it can find solutions to enable Europe to progress."
"I am not hiding my personal satisfaction at having been able to contribute, along with my colleagues in the Commission, to such a positive outcome."
"We have thus come to the end of the cycle of important deadlines that I presented to you on 17 January 1995."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office has just described the situation in Kosovo in detail so I will only add a few words."
"We are clearly very worried about the events in Kosovo."
"I will not go back over the origins of this situation except to point out that it is entirely the product of the Belgrade government's refusal to accept any negotiated settlement."
"The representatives of the international community, and of Europe in particular, stepped up their efforts to find a peaceful and just solution for Kosovo, a solution that was just for all, for those of Albanian origin and for the Serb nation."
"Those efforts failed and the current military action hopes to use force to ensure that the principles and values forming Europe's raison d'être are respected."
"To take no action would be to accept this situation and Europe and its partners will not accept murders, will not accept deportations and will not accept terror and hatred amongst peoples."
"Europe and its partners, allied in this difficult military action, have clearly laid down their demands."
"The international community is now taking action to make the leaders in Belgrade put an end to the suppression, allow the return of refugees and accept the presence of an international force."
"In time, stability in the Balkans will have to be the subject of a far-reaching initiative, which was already outlined by the presidency at the last General Affairs Council."
"The Commission will fully support such an initiative."
"For the time being, Europe is faced with a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions."
"The neighbouring regions of Montenegro, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania are affected most."
"We must also give consideration to the displaced persons within Kosovo."
"The Commission immediately attempted to make use of Community resources to respond to the most pressing needs."
"As always, we are working in close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees."
"Furthermore, you will be aware that, during a special meeting, the Commission adopted two far-reaching initiatives which it has forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council."
"The first requirement was to prepare to mobilise additional resources for humanitarian aid."
"A request has been passed on to the budgetary authority for EUR 150 million to be transferred from the emergency reserve in the ECHO budget line."
"With these EUR 150 million, the Community will have released EUR 180 million from the 1999 budget for humanitarian aid for the refugees in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro."
"In addition, the Commission believes that we should provide assistance to the neighbouring regions of Kosovo that are taking in refugees. These regions are, first and foremost, Albania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Montenegro, but other areas could also be eligible if they take in a high number of refugees."
"We are fully aware that massive flows of refugees into a country places heavy demands on its budget."
"The Commission therefore plans to allocate up to EUR 100 million to help finance costs directly involved in taking in refugees: providing security for them, administrative costs, additional transport costs, electricity, water supplies, and so on."
"I must point out that this aid will only be granted if the beneficiaries fulfil the international obligations incumbent upon them, particularly under the Geneva Convention."
"This specific aid to third countries is fully in line with the decision taken to provide particular assistance for the refugees entering Kosovo's neighbouring regions on a temporary basis."
"However, in this respect, I must mention that there is the possibility that the Member States may decide to take in refugees on a temporary basis, in response to appeals from the UNHCR."
"To enable the Community budget to support these Member States, the Commission has amended its proposal for a joint action to allow us to make use of the European Refugee Fund."
"This will allow us to draw on the European Refugee Fund, a fund which, I would remind you, holds EUR 15 million."
"This amendment takes account of the new situation created by the war in Kosovo."
"Parliament has supported it and we are now waiting for the Council to give its opinion."
"For all of these operations, we need Parliament's full cooperation."
"As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, there are no difficulties in using the emergency reserve."
"As regards the aid of EUR 100 million designed to finance the cost of taking in refugees in Kosovo's neighbouring regions, the situation has proved to be rather more complex."
"The Commission's main aim in this case is to rapidly mobilise these funds."
"I should also like to draw your attention to another important point that I must mention, namely, the additional staff the Commission will require for these new operations."
"I believe that Parliament is well aware that the Commission must have the necessary resources to perform its tasks under favourable conditions."
"We can no longer continue to say that the cavalry is coming."
"The Commission will need additional personnel in Brussels and in its delegations to deal with these new operations and with the subsequent restructuring needs."
"What is more, it will need technical and administrative assistance on site."
"As a result, in the very short term, the Commission will have to continue to redeploy its staff, but that will not be enough."
"We will need extra staff in the next financial year, for both this sector and others."
"The current situation once again highlights the fact that the Commission must have additional staff to perform the tasks required of it."
"The communication that was forwarded to you last week mentions this lack of financial and human resources, and I am counting on Parliament and on the Council to take these constraints into consideration."
"Each institution must contribute and help Europe respond to this crisis in an efficient and responsible manner."
"I believe that your debates on these two central issues - financial requirements and human resources - must reach the obvious conclusion."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin on a personal note. I am happy to be the first speaker for my group to welcome the German Chancellor as President-in-Office of the European Council to the European Parliament; everyone will understand that as a Social Democrat I am particularly glad to do so, especially following the statement you have just made, Mr President-in-Office of the Council!"
"Applause"
"Rarely has a presidency of the Council had to take such important decisions as you have in the first three months of this presidency's term of office, and whatever people may think of particular aspects of the decisions, one thing has become clear: our European Union has proved its ability to act, for which we thank you."
"Under your presidency the European Council nominated a candidate for the post of President of the Commission in the space of one hour, a process that dragged on over more than two summit conferences five years ago."
"That is certainly worth something in this Union."
"We will now ensure that we approve Mr Prodi's appointment during this electoral term of Parliament - i.e. in May - and that we vote on the entire Commission by early September at the latest."
"I think that tallies with your timetable."
"For the rest, the resignation of the Commission was not an institutional crisis, quite the contrary."
"I see it as a step towards European normality."
"Surely it is normal for Parliament to control and sanction, and surely it is and will remain normal in future too for the EU bodies to assume political responsibility for inadequacies and mistakes."
"Applause"
"The fact that this has now happened for the first time also deserves our respect."
"What we need now is a radical reform of the administrative structure and the administrative culture in Brussels, and that is not a task just for the new Commission but also for you in the Council and for us in Parliament."
"We want not a weaker but a stronger Commission."
"The new Commission must be able to become what it must become, namely a European government."
"It we transfer tasks to the Commission, we must also ensure that it is given the funds for the staff it needs in order to fulfil these tasks."
"Looking at the financial agreement reached in Berlin, I do not have the impression that the Council has fully realised that yet."
"In fact we here in Parliament have not fully realised yet either that the Commission has to be given the funds to enable it actually to assume the responsibilities we are transferring to it."
"Applause"
"The Berlin decisions on Agenda 2000 are a compromise, which is only normal, yet in some respects it is a difficult one to accept because some of the compromises that were and had to be reached between national interests will in fact be to the detriment and at the expense of Europe."
"Over the next few weeks Parliament will subject them to critical and detailed analysis and you may be sure that we will find quite a few things to quibble about in these compromises."
"I will not go into that in detail now."
"Let me just say this: the agricultural reform was watered down."
"You will have to improve on it in a very short time, not just because the reform does not go far enough to cope with enlargement but also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations."
"Secondly, a new financial perspective requires an interinstitutional agreement."
"We do not want to undo the Berlin financial package, but we want to organise some parts of it in such a way as to make them more consistent with our demands and priorities, e.g. the measures to combat long-term unemployment and support an active labour market."
"We want an interinstitutional agreement on the financial perspective, we really do want it, but not at any price."
"After all, this is an agreement, not a dictate."
"Nevertheless and overall, with Agenda 2000 you have set in motion the greatest reform of EU policies that the EU has ever undertaken."
"Mr President-in-Office of the European Council: we will do our utmost to obtain the necessary majorities for Agenda 2000 in Parliament and to adopt it before the end of this electoral term."
"We know that it makes up only a part of the reforms needed to make the EU fit for enlargement, which is why I welcome your announcement today that you will determine the timetable for the necessary institutional reforms in Cologne in June."
"We firmly support you in your intention to conclude this reform process before the first Eastern European country joins the European Union."
"There is something else we expect of your presidency of the Council."
"The European Union managed to conclude a pact on stabilising the common currency, which was a good thing."
"But now it must also manage to conclude a pact on employment, which is an equally good thing."
"That is why we support your intentions for the Cologne summit."
"Applause"
"Turning to Kosovo: this is a difficult subject for all of us, particularly in my group."
"We welcome the united support shown by the European Council in Berlin for NATO's military action."
"That was another test of the common foreign and security policy, for it showed that Europe is a community of values, not just an economic community."
"A large majority of my group supports the Member States' position on military action."
"We regard this action as inevitable, but over and above the limits and necessity of military action, I would like to highlight two or three points."
"It is true that we have to restrain the criminal Milosevic and his bands of soldiers and murderers."
"At the end of this bloody century, nationalism and racism must no longer be given a chance in Europe, not anywhere in Europe!"
"International law builds on national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
"These are important values, but no state in Europe may take national sovereignty and territorial integrity as a licence to oppress, displace or commit genocide."
"Applause"
"That is why, over and above the military action that has now become necessary, we need to develop international law further, and we invite you to play your part in doing so."
"The people of the Balkans will only find peace within a European perspective."
"We welcome your initiative in calling for a Balkan conference to discuss political, economic and social reconstruction in this stricken region."
"We firmly support the proposals you made here today."
"Let me also say here: we thank the troops from the Member States committed to NATO."
"We thank them for risking their lives to put an end to the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo."
"Applause"
"We also thank the men and women from non-governmental organisations who are endeavouring, again at the price of great sacrifices, to make the situation of the refugees and displaced persons in this region a little more bearable."
"They too deserve our thanks."
"Applause"
"Mr President-in-Office of the European Council, you took over the presidency during one of the most difficult times the European Union has ever had to go through."
"We wish you success, because that is also our success, the success of our European Union."
"In the difficult task still ahead of you, we, the European Parliament, and in particular my group, will always be a critical, sometimes perhaps even a highly critical, but always a reliable partner."
"Many thanks."
"Applause"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I am convinced that my group too supports you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in the pursuit of human rights and in the action to protect the people in Kosovo."
"We know what a heavy responsibility has to be shouldered at a time such as this."
"And here we certainly must be in a position really to define the aim of the war and to bring the operation to a conclusion."
"Mrs Doris Pack will be discussing that in more detail."
"But I believe this should also be a warning to us that we must at last embark on a viable European foreign, security and defence policy."
"Applause"
"During the remainder of your term of office until the end of June, it is your task, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to implement the appropriate provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam in relation to key issues."
"It should not be left to the technocrats."
"Instead, this potential should be put to real political use, so as to give us a greater ability to act and enable us in future to pursue the kind of foreign policy that will not allow a situation such as that in Kosovo to arise in the first place, that will not mean having to resort to armed force."
"Applause"
"On Berlin, I believe that a number of mistakes were made not in Berlin but before Berlin."
"I agree with you that the choice of Mr Romano Prodi was a good choice."
"But if the presidency of the Council had cooperated with Parliament on this matter earlier on, in January this year, then we might not have got into this situation at all."
"Applause"
"When I think back to some of the statements made in December last year I am tempted to measure the outcome of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 against what you yourself considered necessary at the time from a German perspective."
"However, I speak here not as a German representative but on behalf of my group."
"That is something else you had to learn as President-in-Office of the Council: that these are two different things!"
"Laughter"
"I agree that we should not undo the Agenda 2000 package."
"But the European Parliament attaches great value to obtaining margins of manoeuvre in relation to other policies, margins of manoeuvre in foreign and security policy, margins of manoeuvre that would, for instance, also relate to enlargement."
"After all, the uncertainty in relation to agricultural policy has given rise to new concerns among the applicant countries about time-scales."
"We should make it clear that these uncertainties inherent in Agenda 2000 will not mean any delays in enlargement."
"Kosovo teaches us that we should use every means available to push enlargement ahead as quickly as possible."
"I believe it is our political responsibility to do so."
"Applause"
"You will have to prepare the Cologne summit."
"This concerns the intergovernmental conference."
"We eagerly wait to see what kind of mandate is defined and in what way the European Parliament will be involved in that intergovernmental conference."
"We would like to be involved in the same way as the Commission."
"For the rest, it would have been a good step in that direction if the President of the European Parliament had also taken part in today's informal summit."
"He was not invited!"
"Applause"
"I also think it would be a good idea to make use of the possibilities offered by the Amsterdam Treaty in relation to justice and home affairs."
"In the light of Kosovo, we should move rapidly towards the possibility of majority decisions on questions of asylum and immigration policy."
"That could be achieved by a simple Council decision and it should be done in order to create a genuine ability to act in this area."
"I think it is right for the Cologne summit to attach great importance to employment policy."
"But we should ensure that the discussions are substantive."
"We should make it clear who really can actively pursue employment policy in Europe."
"If an employment pact is concluded that has no real substance but that gives the impression that Europe can resolve this problem, and if it then turns out that it cannot resolve the problem because it does not have the necessary instruments, that will damage Europe."
"European employment policy must not be used as an alibi for the failure of national employment policies!"
"We will put great emphasis on that when we evaluate the Cologne summit."
"Loud applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, today you will meet the newly nominated President, Mr Romano Prodi."
"We hope that you will confirm what you said earlier, that we need a strong European Commission."
"Of course there should be a new administrative and new political culture, but we need a strong Commission."
"I would like to thank President Santer, despite all the difficulties we have had, for what he has done in the past couple of years."
"The European Parliament also needs to be fully involved, in the coming period."
"We have certain queries about the intermediate period."
"It cannot be that the Council takes three months, while Parliament only has two or three days to play its part in the nomination of the President."
"The Agenda 2000 package has, as you have indicated, been agreed under extraordinarily difficult circumstances: bombardments by NATO as a result of the crisis in Kosovo, resignation of the Commission."
"We welcome the fact that you have kept the European Union together in a very difficult phase."
"The alternative would have been the hopelessness and helplessness of the European Union."
"That is not an acceptable alternative."
"But at the same time, we know that the price of the package which has been agreed has been very high."
"We have seen the presence of eleven individual Member States of the European Union rather than the presence of the European Union as a whole."
"That price has been an unacceptable reduction of the financial margins in areas which are essential for the innovation and renewal of the European Union."
"As Mr Prodi said here yesterday, we need a start in a new direction."
"The financial basis for the European Union to do so has been significantly eroded."
"As others have said, the European Parliament wants an interinstitutional agreement, but not at any price."
"In this respect I would like to underline that Parliament, in the last few years, has been a very efficient and useful partner."
"But you need to understand that it is essential that we achieve flexibility in the margins for the future."
"It is against that background that I make a personal appeal to you, Mr President, to seek some elements of innovation so that we have flexibility and some margins."
"Otherwise, Parliament will remain a rubber stamp, in budgetary terms, for the next seven years."
"Let me give you two examples."
"One is what you said about Kosovo."
"Yes, indeed, Parliament's Committee on Budgets agreed yesterday on the EUR 250m."
"At the same time it means that we have exhausted the total margin that you decided in Berlin for external affairs."
"This shows, therefore, that the financial structure of the Union is still not right."
"It is against that background that we would like to move in the direction of a draft budget which gives the Commission the opportunity to move towards more positive financial gains."
"I hope that you will find room for more flexibility than is the case at the present time."
"Mr President, the Berlin summit was held against the difficult backdrop of a profound institutional crisis in the European Union, with the Commission's resignation, and a serious crisis in the Balkans."
"As regards Agenda 2000, in spite of the agreement reached in the early hours of 26 March, the image portrayed by the Heads of State and Government was one of confrontation and a lack of vision for the future."
"In Berlin, each of them stubbornly defended their own interests, but no one furthered the common interest of the Union."
"The European Council has still not provided the resources needed."
"We cannot consider major objectives with a budget that, in the best case scenario, will only represent 1.27 % of the Community gross domestic product."
"If the budget is not increased, we cannot coordinate economic policies, stimulate job creation or strengthen solidarity."
"We are disappointed with some of the Berlin conclusions."
"The allocations for structural policies and for internal policies break with the upwards trend that began in 1988 and that was reinforced in 1993."
"In addition, the resources needed for the enlargement of the European Union are not guaranteed, and enlargement is now in danger of being postponed."
"In quantitative terms, the EUR 240 000 million proposed in Agenda 2000 for structural policies has been reduced to EUR 213 000. There is also a gradual decrease in the percentage of GDP set aside for cohesion policies, from 0.46 % at the moment to 0.42 % in 2006."
"As far as the common agricultural policy is concerned, the compromise reached in Berlin continues with the 1992 reform. One of the consequences of this reform was the disappearance of many farms and the subsequent loss of jobs."
"Corrective mechanisms should have been introduced in Berlin but this did not happen."
"We are especially concerned for small family farms, as the fall in prices, which is only partially compensated for by income aid, will mainly affect small and medium-sized farms."
"We are also very disappointed that a fair modulation system to provide greater benefits for small producers was not adopted. This could have helped rectify the current situation, where 80 % of aid goes to 20 % of the farmers."
"As regards the institutional crisis, we welcome the rapid nomination of Mr Romano Prodi as a candidate for President of the Commission, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty. However, we note that there was no dialogue or agreement with the European Parliament on establishing a timetable of investiture for the new Commission, which would allow us, as a matter of urgency, to resolve this temporary situation and, at the same time, strengthen the democratic legitimacy of this institution."
"As regards the war in the Balkans, which we will discuss later, I should like to point out, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, that the 15 Member States only approved the NATO military intervention in Yugoslavia once it had already begun. It is clear that the underlying reasons for NATO's intervention are the Milosevic Government's constant suppression of the Kosovar Albanian population, after having taken away Kosovo's autonomy, its disregard for human rights and its refusal to commit to an agreement in Rambouillet."
"But this harsh and sustained military intervention, which has no mandate from the United Nations, sets a disturbing precedent for the biased use of discretion in international law. Moreover, this military action is now having the opposite effect to its stated objectives: the Serb people are showing greater support for Milosevic as a reaction to the NATO bombings and to the innocent civilian victims it leaves in its wake."
"The bombings are destroying the country's infrastructures and, at the same time, having a negative effect on the situation of the Kosovar Albanians, who are being expelled from their country in an unprecedented example of ethnic cleansing. There is also the serious problem of relations with the Russian Federation becoming increasingly tense and the danger of widespread destabilisation in the Balkans."
"Mr President-in-Office, I regret that I have to end this speech, but I would like to conclude by stating that it is very unfortunate that the European Union and its institutions have become subordinate to the decisions of a military organisation and relinquished their political responsibility in Europe for so many years."
"If we do not wish to have to act this way in the future, we must try to prevent such situations."
"Mr President, I want to offer my warmest welcome to Chancellor Schroeder who is here on behalf of the German presidency."
"I thank him very sincerely for what I consider to be one of the finest statements I have heard in Parliament from a President-in-Office for a considerable period of time."
"I thank him for what he said in relation to the crisis in Kosovo."
"Parliament, by its applause, has shown its satisfaction with that statement."
"I would also sincerely thank him for the Berlin Resolution in this area."
"I know the President-in-Office is having a meeting this afternoon with Heads of State and Government and it is important that during this discussion he convey to his colleagues that it is of the utmost urgency that the relief effort to help Kosovar Albanians continues and that the European Union play a leading role in the humanitarian aid mission."
"Financial resources must be made available to ensure that the relief programmes continue and that appropriate medicinal and food supplies reach the refugees in need."
"We would have hoped that as this millennium ends we would have left the spectre of war in Europe behind us."
"Sadly, the totalitarian despot, Mr Milosevic, is fuelling the flames of genocide and compounding the misery of the Kosovar Albanians."
"I very much hold the view that there should be no escape for Mr Milosevic and that at some stage he must face the charges of war crimes in a court of law."
"I have one negative point to say to Chancellor Schroeder."
"I believe that you are genuine in your expression of appreciation of the role of the European Parliament. But your credibility is somewhat questioned by the fact that our President, Mr Gil-Robles, is not invited to the meeting this afternoon."
"I regret that."
"It is a mistake that has happened somewhere along the line and even at this late stage I feel you should reconsider it."
"It is a bad mistake and gives a wrong signal."
"I would like to say a special word of thanks and appreciation to Mr Santer for the magnificent work he has done for the European Union for the last four-and-a-half years."
"I thank him very sincerely for what he has contributed, and also his colleagues in the Commission."
"I very much regret that he is the victim of circumstances at this particular time."
"You have my full respect, President Santer, and my appreciation for what you have done for Europe during your term of office."
"The Berlin Summit of 25 March was a good summit."
"It achieved a lot in terms of finalising the overall financial parameters for spending within the EU for the seven-year period after 1999."
"Ever since the Agenda 2000 proposals for reform of the Union policies were first published in March 1998 it was always felt in some quarters that it would be difficult to find an agreement that was balanced and even-handed across all the territories of the European Union."
"The German presidency can take solace from the fact that the spending parameters for the budget for the Union for the period 2000-2006 commands the confidence and the good will of all the Member States of the European Union."
"The budget totals of £506bn will put in place various programmes to lay the foundation for the impending enlargement of the European Union itself."
"Equally, it will ensure that the common agricultural policy will be properly financed and that many social and regional aid schemes will continue for the poorer Member States of the Union after 1999."
"I should like to deal with some aspects of the common agricultural policy for the moment."
"It was suggested in a document entitled 'The future financing of the European Union', issued by the Commission before Christmas, that possibly 25 % of the CAP should be financed by the national exchequers of individual Member States."
"This would have been a regressive step for the European Union to have taken."
"It would have been a very divisive move because one of the successful aspects of the CAP is the fact that it is administered in a uniform manner across all the territories of the European Union."
"Renationalising part of the CAP could only have led to the ultimate disintegration and fragmentation of the common agricultural policy itself."
"Finally, I should like to say to Chancellor Schroeder: you got off to a reasonably weak start in your presidency; you have made tremendous progress in recent times."
"There are still a lot of important items on the agenda for completion by the end of your presidency."
"I congratulate you on the progress you are making to date."
"You are two-thirds of the way to the winning post."
"We want to see you put in greater effort between now and the end of June."
"Mr President, Mr President-in Office of the Council, the war in Kosovo puts everything that is happening in Europe, including the Berlin summit, in relative terms."
"Suddenly every peaceful compromise is worth more than was originally assumed."
"But every peaceful compromise is only worth what it brings us in terms of security in the next seven years of the reform and enlargement of the European Union."
"From that point of view, the Berlin summit with all its decisions was a total success."
"I would like to make three comments from a budgetary point of view."
"One: the financial package is to be welcomed because you managed to reserve the appropriations for the applicant countries on a definitive basis."
"My group was particularly concerned about that."
"The EU of 15 has cut back, especially in the structural field, which meant that Berlin sent out a clear and reliable signal to the applicants for accession."
"Two: I criticise the financial package because in my view it unfortunately failed to take the decisive step towards redirecting agricultural policy."
"This is a heavy burden and calls for a review earlier than planned."
"The Franco-German engine simply does not run on milk."
"We all know that."
"After the elections and under the new Commission, this subject must undoubtedly come back on the agenda."
"Three: from Parliament's point of view the financial package is not acceptable where it relates to internal and external policy, to administrative expenditure and to the flexibility we want to see."
"The terrible events in Kosovo show us that foreign policy tasks in particular will increase over the next few years, that we need more than fine words here if we are to organise a genuine common foreign and security policy initiative in Europe."
"But I am assuming that we will be able to use the margin for manoeuvre that is still available during the trilogue, and I ask you to support us here."
"At the same time I join Mr Collins in asking you to reconsider your decision, so that Mr Gil-Robles can after all take part in the special meeting this afternoon as representative of the European Parliament."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, the extraordinary summit in Berlin was, in fact, extraordinary in more than one respect."
"The summit took place with the dreadful tragedy of Kosovo as a backdrop."
"It followed on from the first political crisis in the European Union with the Commission's resignation. It also had to take decisions on Agenda 2000's major guidelines, particularly the budget guidelines, for the beginning of the new millennium."
"You succeeded, Chancellor, in obtaining results on all the points you had to address."
"What is more, Germany was able to look above and beyond its own interests and surpassed itself in playing its role as president of the whole Union."
"Being firm believers in Europe, we sincerely thank you for this."
"It is good for Germany's image and good for the whole of Europe."
"Of course, the final compromise is not completely satisfactory."
"As regards budgetary issues, we are still concerned about the capping of resources as, with enlargement and the aid to Kosovo, expenditure is bound to increase."
"We would at least have liked to have seen the introduction of an automatic review clause for the financial perspectives on the occasion of each enlargement."
"As regards the common agricultural policy, we fear that the timid compromise that was eventually adopted barely equips us to face the future WTO negotiations."
"As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, it would have been better if the Union's measures on economic and social cohesion had been more in line with the Commission's more generous proposals."
"However, despite these reservations, we are, in fact, pleased that the Berlin summit was able to make progress on the main issues."
"You acted very quickly in terms of nominating the President of the Commission."
"We hope that the rest of the process will be carried out in an efficient manner and without rushing; the main concern must be to rapidly provide the European Union with a new, reformed Commission that can play a true political role."
"This leaves Kosovo, the most important issue."
"The Berlin summit obviously could not resolve this tragedy, but what was said in Berlin, and what you have just said this morning, is along the right lines."
"I am thinking here, in particular, of the political role that Russia could, and should, play."
"I am thinking of the fact that you have called on our countries to immediately take in displaced people and refugees, albeit on a temporary basis."
"I am also thinking of the idea of some form of stability pact for the Balkans to help relieve the people of their misery and their isolation."
"Your idea is a good one."
"And when you tell us that Europe should speak with a louder voice and that Europe must respect the values that form the cornerstone of European integration, Mr President-in-Office, we can but approve your ideas and hope that everyone will listen to you."
"Mr President, Chancellor Schröder, Shakespeare said: 'To be, or not to be - that is the question'."
"The Council is now saying that the Commission can both be and not be at the same time."
"The Europe of Nations Group and the June Movement demand that the Commission should actually resign and be replaced by a clean-up team, which can carry out a clear-out and clean-up operation before a new Commission is selected."
"We urge the national parliaments themselves to select the person who is to represent their country in the European Commission."
"It should not be Prodi or a majority in this Chamber that decides who should be the Danish member within the Commission."
"The Danish member should not be the EU's agent with regard to the Danes, but the Danish electorate's representative in the EU, and besides: 1 000 committees, 10 000 different laws and 100 000 projects are far too much to be controlled from Brussels."
"Cut away the fat!"
"Put the EU on a diet, and give greater freedom to democracy in our countries!"
"Mr President-in-Office, the Italian democratic right, Alleanza Nazionale, hopes that the President of this House can attend the meeting you have convened for this afternoon and expresses its full support for NATO initiatives in the former Yugoslavia."
"May we just point out that had NATO strategists studied the odd history book over the last ten years they would have discovered that ethnic cleansing is habitual practice for some populations in the Balkans, to which 350 thousand Italians fell victim fifty-five years ago when they were expelled at gunpoint from the Adriatic coast where they had always lived."
"Agenda 2000 might have seemed a catalogue of pipe dreams when it made its appearance on the European stage, even though it was tough in tackling the thorniest problems facing the Community."
"Now that it has been rewritten by the heads of government in Berlin, it looks to us more like a catalogue of disappointments, as it is marked by so many uncertainties and contradictions, reflecting even more than before the uncertainties and contradictions of individual States, which, led for the most part by left-wing governments, have transferred into Agenda 2000 their now painfully obvious lack of ideas."
"Attempts to strike a balance on the agriculture front produced a series of settlements reminiscent of a collection for charity which, once again, penalise a massive sector of the agricultural economy in the south of Europe."
"Agenda 2000 lacks the courage to tackle the pressing problem of unemployment with decisive measures, given the continued failure to appreciate properly the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the acute problem of the entire European Union's technological backwardness compared to the United States."
"The fact that Agenda 2000 does not put forward an enlightened and strategically valid vision of enlargement is shown, a posteriori, by the failure of the European Union itself to come up with a foreign policy on the Balkans region, whose history and future are wholly European, leaving aside the madness of the Communist - I repeat, Communist - Milosevic."
"And the lack of ideas on the part of the mainly left-wing governments in Europe is proven by the fact that their leaders, meeting in Milan recently, decided to take up Clinton's proposals on jobs and the economy, thereby demonstrating a worrying degree of scientific, ideological and cultural subservience."
"If we continue down this road, the day will come when the news will arrive from the United States that a fellow called Christopher Columbus, having left the Hudson Bay with three caravels, has discovered Europe."
"Madam President, I should first like to congratulate the President-in-Office for the tremendous work carried out at the Berlin summit."
"In my previous speeches, I said to the President-in-Office that he had a difficult task, but the German Presidency has truly shown its mettle and demonstrated its ability to see this task through to the end."
"In doing so, however, it is natural that Parliament should have some reservations about the content of the budget agreements."
"There has been a considerable reduction in the resources available from the European Community."
"I realise that this was one of the objectives of the German Presidency, but it conflicts with the European Parliament's objectives. And as the President of the Commission pointed out, it is clear that a new interinstitutional agreement will be needed as the Berlin agreements are developed, an agreement that takes account of Parliament's opinions."
"These opinions refer to certain aspects that have been pointed out, for example, the flexibility we need."
"What will happen when a crisis develops that calls for additional budgetary resources, such as the crisis that has recently unfolded in Kosovo?"
"There is a significant reduction of the chapters that can be used in the fight against unemployment. There are also reductions in internal policies, external actions and the Community's own administration."
"If we work on the premise that there is currently a shortfall in the Community administration, precisely because the Commission was not given the resources it needed, we must ask ourselves if the resources now available for administration are sufficient to allow the Commission to function."
"But there are also other sectors; specifically, there is no provision for a review clause relating to enlargement."
"We are aware that the Central and Eastern European countries have enormous needs, and we must think about whether or not we can cover these needs with our current resources."
"Indeed, I believe that we will need additional resources for enlargement if we wish it to be completed before the end of the new financial perspective, that is to say, before 2006."
"In the agricultural field, we have not yet concluded a far-reaching reform that will help us to maintain the competitiveness of our agriculture and allow us to improve the quality of life in rural areas. Nor will it be possible to complete such a reform as it does not address the fact that those who live in the countryside are still ranked as second class citizens."
"But perhaps the area where the biggest cuts have been made is that of structural policies."
"The Commission - and Commissioner Wulf-Mathies is here now - had made very strict provision for structural policies. These policies have been reduced on the basis of criteria that can perhaps be explained but that will make it more difficult to pursue cohesion policies within the European Union."
"In other words, there are a range of regions and countries which have a lower level of development, which have to compete under very difficult conditions to meet the objectives of the stability pact and which will experience problems doing so."
"One amendment that could be very damaging is the plan to do away with the exemption for outermost regions from the 75 % requirement for Objective 1 status."
"If this exemption disappears, the outermost regions will presumably be treated in the same way as mainland regions, irrespective of the enormous difficulties they face."
"On a different matter, Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to thank the German Presidency, the Council, and the governments of the Member States for the decisive action they have taken on the Kosovo crisis."
"We are applying new international humanitarian law, international humanitarian law that was born in 1945 with the United Nations Charter and with the Nuremberg trials."
"We clearly cannot allow a Head of State and Government to inflict suffering on a population like the suffering Mr Milosevic is forcing upon a section of the Yugoslav population, the Kosovar Albanians."
"I believe that, at the moment, the Member States of the European Union are acting as representatives of the whole of humanity, within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation."
"And we in the European Parliament, or at least in the Socialist Group, support such measures and hope that they can bring about a prompt solution to the problem, perhaps by means of an initiative similar to the one recently taken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. This solution should mean the withdrawal of Milosevic's troops from Kosovo, the Kosovar population should be allowed to return to the area under international protection and, eventually, reconstruction and economic recovery should begin in the region."
"It is true that there is little time left for the German Presidency, but the European Parliament hopes that the presidency will continue to support NATO's peacemaking efforts and support the Kosovar Albanian population."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union that you are currently leading, Mr President-in-Office, had set itself the ambitious objective - that was too ambitious perhaps - of redefining the Community budget for the next six years. This had to be done with the prospect of an enlarged Europe on the horizon and in an extremely unsettled global context."
"The spirit of the European Union could have been broken by a barrier of national interests. Failure would have spelt political disaster only three months after the launch of the euro and two months before the European elections."
"But, above all, it would have spelt disaster had it occurred in the midst of the Kosovo tragedy. There will only be a positive outcome to this tragedy if there are no rifts in the solidarity uniting the 15 Member States."
"We now see that the Community's main interest won through."
"As you said, Europe was able to speak with a single voice."
"Europe demonstrated its ability to take action, the essential elements have been preserved and we must congratulate you on this."
"This is important as the strength of the Union resides in its ability to unite to manage the overall balances needed to make the market function, since the aims of the market are not purely economic ones but also social and even humanist ones."
"Since I chaired our negotiating delegation with the Council on the Structural Funds, I should like to speak on that specific point this morning."
"Throughout our meetings, we appreciated Minister Verheugen's frankness, warmth and ability to listen."
"Today, we feel that, on the whole, our opinions were listened to."
"The Berlin agreement incorporates part of the guidelines that Parliament held dear and we support the three main themes adopted by the Council in this field: concentration, simplification and effectiveness."
"However, there are a number of issues that have not been fully resolved."
"My colleagues, Mr Arias Cañete, our rapporteurs and, earlier on, Mr Medina Ortega, spoke on these issues. We must continue the dialogue with the Council so that together we can successfully resolve these issues before the end of the present parliamentary term."
"However, to achieve this, the negotiations on the financial perspective and on the new interinstitutional agreement must lead to compromises that Parliament can accept."
"Rest assured, Mr President-in-Office, that the European Parliament will be flexible, but it also expects the Council to fully recognise the democratic role played by our institution."
"That is why we are in favour of the plan to allow the President of the European Parliament to attend the informal Council meeting that will take place this afternoon."
"The Heads of State and Government were able to make a unanimous decision to nominate Mr Prodi as President of the new Commission and, I hope, are awaiting Parliament's approval. I have no doubt that this will be an important factor in the success of this reform, which is essential for the success of the Union, a Union that views enlargement as an absolute political necessity."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, my group and I applauded the statements of the Council President, Chancellor Schröder, because we wholeheartedly endorse his impassioned insistence that we should fight to overcome national egoism, resolutely preach and uphold the European model of culture and civilisation and reject all forms of ethnic nationalism."
"And we can appreciate that the Chancellor is very pleased with the outcome of the Berlin summit. Agreements were reached there on some difficult and sensitive issues."
"The substance of those agreements, regrettably, does not match up to the high-flown rhetoric which the Council President employs."
"Let me give you just one example. The Council President tells us that it has been decided to release a sum of EUR 150 million for the refugees from Kosovo."
"We welcome that. But how starkly that contrasts with conclusion 45 of the Berlin summit, which is that under the heading 'Particular situations (2000-2006)', EUR 5 200 million and more are to be dished out to the Member States themselves to cover events of this kind."
"More than EUR 5 200 million for the governments to distribute to their people, whilst a mere 150 million are available for the refugees, when the Council was unable last week to agree a unanimous position on how to accept refugees, and when in the financial perspective the amount of appropriations for the emergency aid reserve has been cut to virtually nothing for the whole of the period 2000-2006."
"The harsh reality of the mathematical exercises in Berlin gives the lie to the fine words spoken there."
"Discrepancies of this kind are likely to make Europe's people lose all faith in the Union."
"As regards the European Commission and its president-designate, my group likewise believes that the Council has not fully discharged its responsibilities."
"We welcome the agreement to designate Romano Prodi as president-in-waiting."
"But we also note that the Council, by not making any changes to the membership of the Commission, is placing Parliament before a major dilemma."
"We cannot agree to Mrs Cresson continuing to serve as a Commissioner."
"My group will not work with her, and we advise her not to show her face here again."
"We regard Romano Prodi - whom we respect and of whom we expect much - as the formateur of the new Commission, and Parliament will be required to give its views on that new Commission after the elections."
"Any other interpretation would, after all, lead to constitutional difficulties."
"I should be glad to know if the Council shares this view."
"Madam President, the people of Europe, who have suffered so much themselves as a result of war, are extremely worried about the events in Kosovo."
"As the air strikes are only making matters worse, we must pull out all the stops to find a political solution that, alone, is capable of bringing an end to the atrocities of the Milosevic regime and to the suffering of the Kosovar people, and that will also combat nationalism."
"As regards the Berlin conclusions, you mentioned, Chancellor, that the Berlin Council had reached a good compromise."
"My feelings are slightly more mixed."
"Even though it allowed us to make some progress, the agreement contains some shortfalls and presents risks for the future."
"Of course, the harshest options were rejected, but nothing has been settled for the future."
"Consequently, in agricultural matters, the price reductions were not as severe as the Commission had requested, but they are nonetheless significant and, more importantly, they are only partially compensated for."
"These cuts will have a negative impact on agricultural incomes, particularly for small and medium-sized farmers as the idea of putting a ceiling on assistance has been rejected."
"What is more, the agreement does not put us in the best position to resist American pressure in the next round of WTO negotiations."
"I am delighted that the principle of financial solidarity has been retained and that the idea of cofinancing has been rejected. I am also delighted that we are moving towards a fairer financing system."
"However, in spite of some options put forward, by the Commission in particular, the Council has avoided the issue of seeking new own resources."
"Why not introduce taxation on financial transactions?"
"This would guarantee greater justice since those who benefit most from the single market would also help finance European integration."
"Lastly, to conclude, I welcome the positive political signals from the Council on South Africa and Palestine."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office, Chancellor Schröder, has today explained his position to us. However, he has failed to understand that the entity he should be representing - Europe - unfortunately does not exist."
"In place of the Europe of our dreams, we now have a protectorate of the United States."
"This is the harsh, unpleasant and galling truth."
"He said that there were three main issues of concern."
"Firstly, as regards the crisis in the Commission, the selection of Mr Prodi as its President is a very positive step."
"However, Mr Prodi must understand that he cannot be President of the Commission and, at the same time, a party leader in Italy."
"Secondly, Chancellor, Agenda 2000 will sink without trace before it sets off on its maiden voyage if its budget remains frozen at 1.27 %."
"Thirdly, we cannot enlarge the European family, combat unemployment, and implement a policy for growth through words alone."
"I was surprised to hear you say, with reference to Kosovo, that European civilisation has made it necessary to bomb Yugoslavia."
"Do you really believe that you are bombing Mr Milosevic, at whose door lie so many mistakes?"
"Unfortunately, Mr Milosevic has gained strength because of the bombing."
"However, churches, cemeteries, civilian trains and hospitals are being bombed, and these attacks have absolutely nothing to do with European civilisation and history."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin summit is a text-book example of how dangerous it is for the Community when national interests take precedence and joint progress takes second place."
"But this time things still went well."
"The summit did not produce a reform but at least it produced a package which will allow the Union to get through the next few years."
"The summit did in fact produce one important signal for the future of Europe."
"It fixed a binding, early date for enlargement."
"That sent out a necessary signal to the applicant countries and their people."
"It spurred them on in their reform process."
"Peace is an expensive asset."
"That is why I can only repeat that Europe's future lies in overcoming attempts to draw new frontiers and the domination of national interests."
"But at the same time the Berlin summit drew up a timetable for institutional reform, so that the Union can become capable of enlargement in the first place."
"I hope the Council will then recognise that Parliament has equal rights and finally accord it more powers and the right of initiative."
"That is the precondition for overcoming the blockage of unanimous decisions."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, just imagine if you had to hand out 20 or 25 presents to ensure that everyone agreed."
"More rights for Parliament means closeness to the people and democracy for the European Union."
"That is the future: a Europe that is all of a piece, that is social, ecological and democratic."
"That is what we want and that is what we must achieve!"
"Madam President, if I had to sum up the Berlin agreement in one sentence as far as Agenda 2000 is concerned, I would say that the Berlin summit has been a victory for those who want less Europe as the outcome of the summit indeed means that we will have less Europe."
"The agreement reached by the European Council is the result of negotiations that concentrated on the defence of national interests rather than on the defence of the process of European integration."
"Our government advocated a speculative, short-term policy in Berlin and this House must now make all efforts to change this approach and return to a more pro-European one."
"The spirit of the Berlin summit will not help us meet the challenges we now have to face."
"Enlargement of the Union, reform of the institutions and cohesion and solidarity policies will remain mere ideas unless they are backed up by an appropriate budgetary policy and federalist spirit. This spirit is what has allowed the European Union to progress in the past but it was completely lacking in Berlin."
"Madam President, the Berlin European Council only appeared to reach an agreement on the Union's financial framework for the 2000-2006 period."
"In truth, this is a superficial compromise, which probably only hopes to survive the European elections without any hitches, and to wait until the real problems emerge in the future."
"As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, the plan to maintain the overall levels of allocations and cohesion expenditure will undoubtedly soon lead to a sharp drop in the share awarded to countries such as France. This will become apparent when the details of how this works in practice come to light."
"Similarly, maintaining the appropriations for agriculture is a purely aesthetic step, as this will only be achieved if the EAGGF-Guidance Section is transferred to the agricultural guideline. In reality, other expenditure will decrease sharply in the context of a reduction in the Community preference system."
"These guidelines have not yet been clearly understood by the public nor, indeed, by many French national elected representatives."
"Yet they are not even enough to guarantee a sustainable balance in terms of the financial perspective."
"Moreover, only earlier today, the President of the Commission was already calling for additional administrative appropriations."
"The Council is so aware of this that, in its conclusions, it calls on the Commission to undertake a general review of the own resources system and to include the question of creating new autonomous own resources. In other words, if we are being frank, the Council is talking of creating European taxes."
"It seems clear that the European Union is preparing to fill the holes by creating new compulsory levies."
"We would be most interested to know whether the French Liberals approve of the Berlin conclusions in this respect."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin summit took place under difficult institutional and international conditions, which meant that less time could be devoted to the Agenda 2000 reform package than would have been generally necessary."
"Against the background of the Kosovo conflict, every other policy area simply becomes relatively less urgent."
"On Agenda 2000: expenditure was stabilised in the structural field, although this meant fairly major shifts in the definition of financial priorities within the structural measures, such as the increase of cohesion resources by as much as EUR 3 billion."
"At any rate, for the new Objective 2, which is intended among other things to promote rural development, the support has been cut by 5 %."
"I cannot help thinking that the support could have been concentrated on the neediest regions, considering that more than EUR 4 bn of financial treats were distributed all over Europe."
"Yet the Berlin conclusions do represent a response to the further financing of the existing Community of 15 and of an enlarged Europe."
"On the one hand the Council calls on the Commission to take energetic action to create new, autonomous own resources."
"Elsewhere it equally clearly lays down that the financial perspective needs to be adjusted, incidentally by a qualified Council majority."
"That also explains the statements by your colleague Mr Wemheuer and by President Santer of the Commission, who both said that the current agreement would soon have be followed by another reform."
"So I do not share the view of some Members of this House that the adoption of Agenda 2000 really is a great success."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Members of the Commission, a war is going on in Kosovo and between NATO and Yugoslavia."
"Whatever our view of its legality, it is a fact."
"War is not normally the time for taking a nuanced view, for heightened sensibilities, for a sensible mixture of reason and emotion."
"Yet that is what we must do today, for even in times of war we must not only think of peace but also work to achieve it."
"In that sense I welcome what you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, said here, because you have expressed that same feeling."
"Military action became necessary."
"I am not happy about it, many of us are not happy about it, but we would be even less happy if we had to watch the massacres continue without trying to put a stop to them."
"Many of us would have preferred to see this action take place under the umbrella of the United Nations."
"But unfortunately the attitude of Russia and China prevented that."
"Yet I want to state clearly on behalf of my group: we still believe that on principle such actions must be carried out by the United Nations and we must do all we can to reform the United Nations in such a way as to make that possible in future."
"But that also means that as you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, sovereignty must give way to the principle of respect for human rights."
"We know that sovereignty has been an important objective over the course of history."
"But our experience in Europe has shown us that there are higher values than total and absolute respect for national sovereignty."
"We must get that message across."
"Applause"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the military action has clear humanitarian objectives and we very strongly urge you to adhere to those objectives."
"It is not a people that we want to defeat, it is the regime, it is Milosevic and his bands of soldiers, as Mr Hänsch called them."
"Unfortunately - and that is an inevitable consequence - at the moment the situation is that the Serbs have closed ranks even more."
"Even the opposition, the few who were opposed, and above all the intellectual opposition and the critics in Serbia, do not understand NATO's action and are actually rallying round Milosevic."
"We must do all in our power to make it clear that we are differentiating between a regime that has brought disaster upon its own people, and a people we want to have in Europe like all the other peoples of this continent and all the other peoples of the Balkans."
"We must do our utmost to ensure that there are as few civilian victims as possible in the wake of the military actions."
"That has to be our aim, and not just for reasons of humanity but precisely in order to differentiate between the regime and the people."
"Much has already been done for the refugees."
"Perhaps some of it was done rather too late, but there is no sense in lamenting that now."
"We will have to do all we can to help the refugees and to support the great, indeed the immense willingness of the people of Europe and of many non-governmental organisations to provide aid."
"We may say that people today are hard-hearted, but Kosovo and the reaction of the people in Europe show that many also have a very soft, humanitarian heart, and we have to turn that to good use."
"I am especially grateful to Mrs Bonino for her very vigorous support here."
"Let me say quite plainly that first and foremost we should provide assistance in situ ."
"We must not grant Milosevic the great victory of finally emptying Kosovo of all Albanians and preventing the Albanian inhabitants who are scattered throughout Europe from returning home again."
"We must prevent him from achieving that aim, but above all we must also help the neighbouring countries who are doing outstanding work in a situation that is not easy, for the situation is not easy for Albania, or for Macedonia or for Rome."
"We must help them to pursue a humanitarian refugee policy."
"One final point, Mr President-in-Office of the Council: you clearly pointed the way into the future, whether in the form of a Balkan conference or whatever we call it."
"We must begin with a kind of Marshall Plan or stability pact."
"That costs money."
"But the war and the crises and unrest cost more money and above all they also cost many human lives."
"You also said that we must contrast the 21st century with the 19th century."
"I agree with you."
"The 19th century was a century in which not only did the Balkan peoples come to grief over their nationalism, it was a century when the European powers exploited the Balkan peoples in order to assert their own interests."
"Now it is not a question of playing off one Balkan country, i.e. the people of one country, against another one."
"What we must do is bring the people closer together, laboriously bring them together and also show them that it is possible to coexist, as we do in western Europe despite the wars we have had."
"Even if many people say that the Kosovar Albanians will never be able to coexist with the Serbs - they must coexist, they must coexist on the same continent, in the same region, and it is up to Europe to learn from its own mistakes in the past, to make up for its own past mistakes and lead the people of the Balkans into a peaceful, a non-nationalistic Europe."
"Applause"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of my group I want to express our full support for the joint action by the EU and NATO states, whose sole purpose is to put a stop to the genocide in Kosovo."
"The plight of the Kosovar Albanians finally sunk in last year."
"Finally, every political means was applied, but they had no prospect of succeeding against the Belgrade butcher."
"Bosnia could have taught us that."
"I do understand, however, that democracies are finding it hard to use military force, since they were not constantly updated on Milosevic's reign of terror in Kosovo."
"Milosevic has no interest whatsoever in the people living in his own country."
"He has no respect for mankind!"
"That is shown by the mass graves in Croatia and Bosnia."
"It is shown by the deportations in Kosovo, by the countless acts of rape and the cruel murder of many Albanians."
"Over all the years of the apartheid regime, Milosevic's governors had already committed countless murders and acts of torture."
"I myself found evidence of many of these atrocities in Kosovo between 1991 and 1998 and repeatedly denounced them, at a time when all the western politicians were simply looking the other way."
"Milosevic does not care about the welfare of his Serbian citizens either, who have been the economic and psychological victims of his policy for many years."
"Unfortunately, however, the bomb attacks on Serbia have led a good number of Serbian citizens to mistakenly rally round Milosevic."
"Milosevic has always used nationalism as a means of maintaining himself in power."
"But nationalism dumbs people down and leads them astray, as we have seen on several occasions during this century."
"Milosevic did not in fact set in motion his devilish machinery to wipe out a whole people at the moment when NATO started bombing."
"Unfortunately these bombing raids were the only logical response to his atrocities."
"Continued inaction would have made the west more guilty before history than this targeted bombing which, we hope, has a definite political aim."
"But the political solution must on no account be the partition of Kosovo."
"If we accepted that we would ourselves be creating a potential flashpoint there for the next hundred years."
"Since 1990 I have been trying in vain here to make the Council and the Commission aware of Milosevic's planned strategy."
"The sanu memorandum of 1985 drawn up by the Serbian Academy of Sciences spells out that strategy."
"It also states that Kosovo will be partitioned if he cannot be contained, a partition into the wealthy north with its rich mineral resources, what is known as 'the cradle of the Serbians', and the poor south, whose existence would sooner or later destroy the state of Macedonia and thus create serious difficulties throughout the region."
"In my view, the only solution at this point is an autonomous Kosovo, in which the citizens are returned home under the protection of international troops."
"The further political future of Kosovo depends very much on a change in the Belgrade regime and the democratisation of Serbia."
"The leading figures round Milosevic and Milosevic himself must also be brought before the Hague tribunal."
"On behalf of my group I support all the diplomatic efforts made by the presidency of the Council."
"But there is one other thing I would ask of you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"I beseech you to make even greater efforts to enable Mr Ibrahim Rugova, our Sakharov prize-winner, and his family, to leave the country."
"Applause"
"After abandoning him for years by its pacifist tolerance of the apartheid regime, the west now owes it to him to at least ensure that he and his family receive exit visas."
"I cordially ask you to do this for humanitarian reasons!"
"Loud applause"
"Madam President, I agree with Mrs Pack."
"I would like to say something about the Commission and the problems there have been, and about the criticism that has been levelled."
"I would like to emphasise that the Council itself bears a huge responsibility for the fact that things went so wrong."
"It is the Council which, time after time, has approved accounts which should not have been approved."
"It was the Council which, only this March, disregarded Parliament and approved the accounts for 1997, on the very day when the report from the five experts made it clear that the accounts should not have been approved and that Parliament was right."
"It is incomprehensible that the Council was unwilling to learn from Parliament's persistent criticism, which was so often voiced here in this Chamber by my party colleague, Eva Kjer Hansen, amongst others."
"It is the Council which is now largely responsible for the profoundly obsolete and rigid Staff Regulations."
"It is the Council which failed to give its backing when Commissioner Liikanen's much-needed proposals on staff reforms were stopped by obdurate trade unions a year ago."
"It is the Council which now has the opportunity to insist that these proposals are carried out to the letter, together with the SEM 2000 and MAP 2000 reform plans, which are sorely needed."
"It is the Council which must now insist on flexibility, delegation, more fixed-term posts and easier ways to get rid of substandard employees."
"It is only the Council which can abolish the national and geographic quotas in the recruitment policy, so that in future we can recruit the best candidate in every situation."
"It is the Council which has buried the Commission in far too many large and small programmes with no way of controlling them."
"It is the Council which must ensure that the principle of subsidiarity becomes more than just idle talk."
"It is the Council which must implement cost-cutting and streamlining measures to facilitate enlargement to include Central and Eastern Europe, while keeping expenditure under the 1.25 % ceiling."
"Instead of this, unfortunately, the Council ended up diluting the sorely needed agricultural reforms, on which there had usually been a consensus at ministerial level."
"Mr President-in-Office, I hope that you take all this along with you to your - hopefully fruitful - meeting this afternoon with the new President of the Commission."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your resolute stance on the question of Kosovo."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the speech made yesterday in Berlin by the Commission President designate seemed to confirm that there is no intention of changing the neo-liberal course set for building Europe."
"It is a fact that the Berlin Council accepted the constraints imposed by the Stability Pact and did not alter them, and that the resources it approved were an inadequate response to Community policies and to the challenges of cohesion and of future enlargement."
"The Berlin Council maintained unacceptable exceptions to the own resources system, yet at the same time failed to agree on any penalty for speculative movements of capital."
"The rejection of agricultural cofinancing cannot blind us to the fact that imbalances and privileges for richer and more powerful countries have been preserved in the CAP."
"As for regional policy, the overall reduction in the Cohesion Fund will mean a cut of at least 18 billion escudos per annum for Portugal, which is incidentally one of the cohesion countries."
"And if this reduction leads to more restrictive conditions, structural resources could be even more limited."
"In contrast to the pompous declarations and triumphs announced in Berlin concerning internal consumption, the lack of solidarity and the indifference towards cohesion confirmed in Berlin will lead to greater stagnation, higher unemployment, and poorer jobs and social welfare in the European Union."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, may I say that in my view you made a respectable statement which was fine-tuned and showed great courteousness towards Parliament."
"Yet I am still not entirely satisfied with the Berlin conclusions."
"Agricultural policy is not necessarily your political field, but what you produced in this respect was not a huge success."
"You said in your statement that a clear signal must be sent out to the markets."
"That signal is being sent out in the wrong direction."
"Adherence to intervention signals to the Central and Eastern European states that they should abandon their markets and aim at intervention."
"That is the wrong direction to take."
"You also spoke, in a different connection, about solidarity with the weak. But there are weak groups in agriculture too, and the absence of a degressive system and the graduated system have done nothing for the smaller farmers; instead the smaller undertakings will now suffer from the price reduction and the fact that they are not fully compensated."
"I do not want to hear any more from you, the Chancellor, about how efficient the large undertakings are, for it is into the large, rationalised undertakings that EU funds are flowing, which makes it easy for them to operate."
"The smaller undertakings have adjusted to the market."
"That is where the real achievement lies, and they should have been supported."
"I admit that provision is made for this under the second pillar."
"That is the only glimmer of light in the agricultural field."
"Thirdly, on budgetary discipline: to save is not in itself a quality."
"I hope you agree with me there."
"There should have been a more definite restructuring here, the kind of modulation of agricultural funding proposed by the Commission."
"In fact I would like to praise Mr Fischler here."
"What the Commission proposed would also have sent out a signal to the smaller undertakings, who adjust to the market."
"That institution must now remain able to act."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please urge the intergovernmental conference to include agricultural policy in the codecision procedure."
"It is urgently necessary for Parliament to obtain the right to specific and substantive codecision powers in this area too."
"Madam President, recent events in Kosovo and concerning the Commission meant that the agenda for the Berlin summit was not as originally planned."
"But it did include the long-scheduled items on Agenda 2000."
"It is a good thing that decisions have been taken, at any rate, although it has to be said that the Council is storing up a good deal of trouble for itself."
"Hence it is a bad thing that reforms in the milk products sector are not to take effect until 2005."
"This means that the Union will certainly not be ready, in respect of this sector, to allow new Member States to join from Central and Eastern Europe."
"The Council did, however, manage to agree a thrifty budget covering several years for the immediate future."
"These financial perspectives offer hopes of an interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament."
"The speed with which the Council has chosen Mr Prodi as president-designate of the European Commission has our approval."
"But it is just the first step."
"I therefore repeat my insistence, for the benefit of the Council, that the new European Commission must be able to get down to work as quickly as possible and before the European elections."
"I cannot understand what was said about the Middle East."
"Mr Arafat's announced intention to declare a Palestinian state looked more like a means of political pressure than a realistic plan."
"European support for that Palestinian state could mean the wrong kind of pressure being exerted on the peace talks."
"What exactly is the intention here with this Palestinian state?"
"NATO intervention in Kosovo was and is inevitable."
"The Dutch Members in my group unreservedly support the EU position on Kosovo."
"Madam President, Chancellor, Mr Santer, I must say that we are delighted to see you once again, Mr Santer."
"We were harsh on you because, given the honesty we demanded of your Commission, none of the governments of the 15 Member States should remain in office. As regards the corruption you were accused of, it was probably the quiet Socialist corruption of the 1980s."
"We saw examples of this in Mr González's government, Mr Craxi's government and Mr Mitterrand's governments, with the exception, perhaps, of the government of our colleague Mr Rocard. We also saw examples of this in Belgium with Mr van den Broek, head of the Socialist Party, who will head the list in Flanders despite the Agusta affair."
"Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, Mrs Cresson's shoes did not cost EUR 2 000."
"Perhaps your biggest mistake was to take on the legacy of your predecessor, Mr Jacques Delors, in the BSE affair. Mr Delors is a democrat who, throughout his whole political career, has never stood as a candidate in a single election, except in a local election in Clichy."
"Chancellor, in Berlin, a symbolic town whose name nonetheless makes one shiver and brings to mind certain images, it was decided that for the first time Mr Cohn-Bendit's army would return to the scenes where there are still some survivors who remember previous wars."
"In Serbia, six streets in Belgrade carry the name of French generals from the First and Second World Wars, when the Serbs fought heroically against the Axis powers."
"This was at a time when there were real deportees and camps that, I believe, were called concentration camps."
"In Serbia, as in Iraq, Europe is missing its chance to establish an independent foreign policy."
"If we want to become a major power, with a single currency and a euro that must compete with the dollar, if we want our GDP to rocket, we should sort out the European family affairs in Serbia, in the bosom of the European family, without bringing in a sheriff from outside, and without creating, in particular, as a finishing touch, an Islamic crescent that encompasses Kosovo, Albania, and perhaps Bosnia."
"In Berlin, Mr Prodi was nominated: he is the leader of the Olive Tree Coalition and it is somewhat ironic to think of the olive tree at a time when we are starting a war."
"Mr Schröder, you combine German traits with British humour."
"Incidentally, we also discussed technical issues in Berlin. We first discussed the CAP and reached a modest little compromise, especially at France's expense."
"Expenditure is being frozen and prices cut by 20 % instead of 30 % for meat, and by 15 % instead of 20 % for cereals. These reductions are only compensated for in part and, above all, we are preparing to fall into line with the United States in the world trade negotiations, as we did in 1992."
"Europe is a continent for those who fall into line and it is only natural that we should bomb Yugoslavia, a country which symbolises non-alignment."
"Germany also lost out over the Structural Funds..."
"Exclamations from various quarters"
"There was also financial arbitration in Berlin."
"Mr Schröder, you are too well briefed not to know that we will be forced to create a European tax ..."
"The President urged the speaker to conclude"
"Madam President, I have been constantly interrupted."
"We will be forced to create a European income tax or corporation tax unless the Greens force us to adopt a tax on CO2 , due to all the pollution caused by bombing refineries."
"Madam President, in the appalling human catastrophe that is Kosovo, and especially with the refugee situation as desperate as it is, the European Union must be able to relieve the situation of the refugees, or rather those who have been driven out of their country."
"Furthermore, when other options fail relocation of the refugees outside the region and within the EU area must be an option on humanitarian grounds."
"The EU must adopt a position where it can actively encourage the start of talks for a just peace settlement, and we must also try to involve Russia in the negotiations."
"Everything that can be done must be done to alleviate this human suffering."
"The extraordinary European Council at Berlin was held, at least to some extent, in very special circumstances. The Community lacked clear leadership as a result of the resignation of the Commission the previous month."
"The Member States, and above all Germany as the holder of the presidency, are to be congratulated on getting decisions through at Berlin, despite the difficulties."
"This is because there was real effort to reach decisions: nothing was left to chance."
"However, many of us have problems in approving the substance of Agenda 2000, or at least we have comments to make."
"The agricultural solution that pleased many Member States has simply swept serious problems under the carpet."
"In any case, it has to be said, especially as far as agriculture is concerned, that new solutions still need to be found before enlargement takes place, and the WTO talks are not succeeding either, with the present brief."
"One thing we welcome in the agricultural solution is the better integration of issues relating to the environment, and in that regard the Commission was very successful in laying the groundwork for further action."
"Good too was the fact that at long last agricultural conditions in the Nordic countries were taken into account to a reasonable extent, and that at least some success was achieved in limiting the seemingly unstoppable flow of money spent on agriculture."
"However, we fared better, in broad terms, on regional and structural policy."
"What is most important is that the scheme should be simplified and made more efficient."
"Now Parliament has to ensure that the problems which are still on the table are discussed in cooperation so that Parliament can debate the whole of Agenda 2000 as one package in May."
"This will be a special challenge for the success of enlargement and for the European Union to be able to continue working effectively."
"If I had to pick out some of the problems with regional and structural policy, one disappointment is obviously the fact that Objective 3, the employment initiative, is lagging behind the others, while we here in Parliament have always maintained that solving the problems of employment is a priority task for the European Union."
"Now we must focus our attention on highlighting the issue of unemployment in Objectives 2 and 3 to a much greater and more significant extent than is the case now."
"The timetable for appointing the Commission must be established without delay, but at the same time we must ensure that we adhere to the objectives Parliament has for reforming it."
"I wish the German Presidency luck as it draws to an end."
"I hope that the developments launched so successfully in Berlin will manage to stay the course."
"Once more I would like to congratulate everyone on the fact that the Agenda 2000 package was approved at Berlin."
"This will offer plenty of scope for the future Finnish Presidency to succeed in the face of its immense challenges."
"The Finnish Government may have already been elected as I speak."
"Madam President, in the last ten years, Milosevic's regime has been guilty of large-scale repression and a series of wars."
"The latest and worst is the current crisis in Kosovo, but it does not end there."
"Attempts to destabilise Macedonia and Montenegro are already under way, and Albania has meantime come under fire."
"The expulsion of ethnic minorities and the mass killings in Kosovo show the contempt in which the Milosevic regime holds human values - a contempt which some are emphasising by provocatively toying with a target, something that merely illustrates their disdain for the humanitarian values of the NATO governments, which as we know are seeking to get as many civilian victims as possible out of harm's way."
"You cannot really talk to a regime like that any more."
"It does not share the values of which the Council President, the Federal Chancellor, spoke just now."
"This regime needs to be replaced, as a wise Serbian bishop of the orthodox church said here in this building a few months ago: there will never be a solution in Serbia and Kosovo unless Serbia becomes a state governed by the rule of law."
"If it does, you may be sure that minority rights and human rights will be upheld."
"Meanwhile, almost a million refugees are wandering around in Kosovo and the adjoining countries."
"Help is urgently needed, and we therefore agree with the Commission's policy of giving urgent assistance to Albania and Macedonia."
"The efforts being made by various Member States are of course laudable and vital, but Parliament would really prefer a policy for the European Union as a whole."
"Good European Union facilities for accepting refugees as close as possible to their original homes can make it easier to coordinate aid and avoid problems over how the cost should be shared."
"That will also protect the Union against the futile attitude of financial nitpicking shown by a number of governments in Berlin."
"The Commission certainly needs enough qualified personnel to do all this."
"We agree with Mr Santer's call for them."
"It is right and proper, and our belief, that extra resources should be found for Macedonia, a country of which we have already been asking too much for too long."
"Political support for Montenegro is also appropriate, since it is inhabited by Serbs who retain a policy of openness towards Europe."
"We should be mindful of that."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say to the President-in-Office that his success in Berlin relates mainly to Agenda 2000, as this is what was on your agenda."
"The success of the Berlin summit is the result of compromise between Member States that allowed us to reform the Union's common policies."
"We welcome this, even if, relatively speaking, we are far from achieving the ambitious objective originally declared by Mr Jacques Santer."
"We have put the Union back on its feet but we have not necessarily given it all the assets it needs to conclude the enlargement negotiations."
"And we are all aware that there will be other dates to set."
"Your success is due to the fact that you rejected non-Community measures that would have transformed the European Union into an à la carte free-for-all."
"You have avoided this by rejecting cofinancing. Cofinancing would have sent out a bad signal as it would mean dismantling the Union's only real integrated policy at the very moment when the enlargement negotiations are underway."
"Your success is also due to the fact that you rejected a system of levelling-down which would have been at odds with all the mechanisms aimed at ensuring Community solidarity."
"Perhaps more could have been done as regards the existing measures aimed at ensuring a fair return."
"I will only say one thing about agriculture, and that is that it is unfortunate that the phased reduction of aid was not as well accepted in the agreement. I feel that this would have contributed to more balanced, more equitable agriculture where we provide greater assistance to those in greatest need."
"Mr President-in-Office, you mentioned the issue of institutional reform."
"With the appointment of Mr Prodi, the reforming of the Commission is now under way, and we welcome that."
"This Commission must practise greater collective responsibility in performing its duties."
"It cannot operate using feudal systems, baronies and reserved domains."
"We must also coordinate the Union's external actions."
"How can we implement a common foreign and security policy when five separate Commissioners are responsible for these areas?"
"These are matters of great urgency."
"But the whole package of institutional reforms is also a matter of great urgency, because the Union is in need of such reforms and because it is a precondition to the next enlargements, as you quite rightly emphasised this morning."
"We support this."
"And then there is Kosovo."
"In this crisis, in this war, the Union's voice must be strong because it is vital in Europe."
"We all agree on our objective, namely the end of ethnic cleansing."
"Non-discrimination is enshrined in our Treaties and in our laws."
"We must ensure that it is respected within our borders, but also outside them."
"To put it simply, we know that peace will not be obtained at any cost."
"We have committed our troops. We had to do so."
"Now we must also work on involving the United Nations and Russia in the search for a solution."
"We need a protected humanitarian area, complete with intervention forces."
"We need a conference of the Balkans leading to a European Union of the Balkans and your stability pact must contribute to this."
"We also need to think about the consequences of a European defence identity and strong proposals to reform the United Nations."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, I believe that the majority of our colleagues feel that the European Council worked hard in Berlin."
"You had a busy agenda in front of you and you cleared the ground."
"First of all, you made a start on solving the institutional problem posed by the Commission's resignation by appointing Mr Prodi."
"You left the common agricultural policy intact, rather than reforming it."
"You took significant decisions on the Kosovo crisis and you began work on the financial perspective, outlining choices that, on the whole, we approve."
"I therefore believe that the European Council has done its job and we must thank you for this, Chancellor."
"I should like to say a few words on the financial perspective, as I believe it poses a problem."
"In Berlin, the European Council made two choices."
"It chose rigour, which we approve of, and it rejected flexibility, which worries us."
"You chose rigour and we understand why, even though such rigour may sometimes be deceptive."
"For example, as regards agriculture, the overall budget is less than the total specific commitments that were agreed on."
"Also, category 5 does not allow us to meet the requirements for further staff, which were becoming increasingly apparent, as the President of the Commission, Mr Santer, quite rightly highlighted."
"This House accepts that you have opted for budgetary rigour and we have always supported this approach, but above all, and in spite of everything, you rejected flexibility and that is important."
"Without flexibility, we cannot be rigorous, because if we look at category 4, we see that expenditure on Kosovo will far exceed the amount under this heading."
"Without wishing to take an aggressive stance, we must remember, Chancellor, that Parliament has the legal and institutional resources to re-establish the margin of flexibility we believe is necessary. And we will do so if, in the next few days, you do not take some steps towards giving us the flexibility that we believe is extremely valuable, as valuable as you believe rigour to be."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the German Presidency is taking place at a tragic time, as has already been said."
"Once again in Europe, we are seeing the terrible consequences which fanatical nationalism, racism and fascism can lead to."
"History is repeating itself."
"Mr President-in-Office, the German Presidency commands respect in this difficult period."
"However, you have to cope with the most important problem in the functioning of the European institutions, namely the unanimity required for making decisions in crucial areas."
"This applies not only to the common foreign and security policy; it applies also to the foreign ministers, who were actually unable, shamefully, to come up with a humanitarian response last week in the tragic circumstances we are witnessing today."
"As regards the Berlin summit itself, Mr President-in-Office, you deserve praise for unquestionably securing an overall agreement."
"In some respects, you secured a good agreement."
"In other respects, we believe it was a bad one."
"You secured a good agreement concerning Commission President Prodi, who already showed us in the House yesterday that he is made of the right stuff."
"You secured a bad agreement, in our view, on Europe's budget."
"On the one hand as regards revenues: the decision, the compromise on own resources to my mind means giving in to the Member States who have for years argued for the principle of the juste retour ."
"We have called in Parliament for greater transparency and fewer rebates."
"We have got less transparency and more rebates."
"That is most regrettable."
"Nor have we obtained any satisfaction on the interinstitutional agreement, either in qualitative or quantitative terms."
"Parliament's rapporteur, Mr Colom i Naval, is always a moderate man."
"He said very sharply last week that the proposals currently on the table for an interinstitutional agreement are a kind of provocation."
"So I think it will take a great deal of hard work to reach an agreement."
"Mr President-in-Office, I cannot deny that your statement this morning impressed me greatly."
"We fully support your resolute approach to the Cologne summit."
"We hope you will secure a clear timetable there for new institutional 'deepening', which is vital if Europe is to have credibility."
"We hope too that you will be successful in achieving a European Employment Pact with which we can persuade people to have renewed faith in the future of Europe."
"In other words, Cologne has to produce more of substance than Berlin."
"We are confident that you will work energetically to ensure that it does."
"Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, after analysing the conclusions of the Berlin European Council, and given the objective difficulties involved in concluding Agenda 2000, we must congratulate the German Presidency on having been able to reach an agreement that many felt was little short of impossible."
"But our congratulations must also be extended to the whole college of Commissioners for their excellent preparatory work on Agenda 2000 and for their sincere dedication throughout the whole procedure."
"From the point of view of regional policy, the European Parliament has stated quite clearly that the Union should set aside a minimum of 0.46 % of Community GDP for cohesion policies. It must be set at this level if we wish to have sufficient critical mass available to reduce regional disparities at a satisfactory pace, as highlighted in both the triannual report and the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union."
"The regrettable debate on net budget balances and excessive contributions to the Community budget has led to substantial financial reductions in the Commission's proposals for cohesion policies, which were already modest in themselves. This debate ignores the fact that the balanced development of the whole Community territory leads to extremely favourable trade balances for the wealthiest Member States."
"But it is fair to say that, although expenditure is being reduced, the principle of concentration was left intact. By allocating more than two thirds of the Structural Funds to Objective 1 regions, work on cohesion will remain at levels that are the same as or higher than those of the previous programming period."
"We must also welcome the fact that Objective 3 now has a horizontal character and the fact that the Cohesion Fund has been maintained, thereby ending a fruitless and meaningless debate."
"But in this respect, as Mr Bourlanges claimed, we are concerned that we have still to establish the financial perspectives needed to provide a multiannual financial framework for long-term policies such as regional polices."
"If the Council were to show a certain degree of flexibility, this would add the finishing touch to the Berlin agreement and would enable us to conclude the interinstitutional agreement. This agreement is vital if we are to guarantee the stability of Community finances in the coming century."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first, of course, thank you very much for your praise of our work."
"It is a pleasure not just to be criticised for hard work but occasionally - in this Parliament at least - also to hear words of praise."
"Naturally I shall begin by responding to the critical comments that have been made."
"And I am happy to do so."
"But let me say at the outset that I am pleased there has been agreement on the Kosovo issue here in Parliament, barring a very few critical voices."
"I have taken careful note of Parliament's strong reactions to the human rights violations in Kosovo and of its resolute support - or at least the support of a very large majority of Members - for the western position."
"In evaluating the situation, let me go back to what one Member of your Parliament, Mrs Pack, had to say."
"In my view she gave a very accurate analysis and accurate description of the risks that could arise if the international community does not continue to take resolute action with a view to reaching a political solution to the Kosovo crisis through a mixture of military measures and, of course, political activities."
"It must be clear to all that we must not confuse cause and effect."
"The cause of the conflict is Milosevic's criminal policy and the sole purpose of the effect we want to achieve by, for example, the military measures, is to protect the people in Kosovo and to reach a political solution."
"Let me emphatically underline what was said here."
"Our intention is not to punish anyone but to achieve the designated objective of bringing an end to a humanitarian disaster that is expanding and accelerating, so as to prevent even more people from dying."
"Applause"
"I am glad to be able to say that the Council and Parliament are entirely at one on this!"
"Secondly, regarding the critical comments on the Berlin results, I fully understand what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, for instance, said about agricultural policy and the fact that we did not manage to achieve all our objectives, not even those which, looked at in isolation, can be regarded as extremely sensible, such as stabilising smaller undertakings even more than proved possible."
"That is partly because the different Member States have different interests and want to assert them."
"Of course the agricultural part, like the part relating to the Structural and Cohesion Funds and like the financing part, is in fact a compromise, with all the strengths but also the weaknesses of any compromise."
"To reassure you, let me say to you, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, that if I had been able to act on my own, I would have responded more closely to your wishes!"
"But that was not possible, as everyone will easily understand - nor indeed was it at all desirable."
"Laughter"
"Secondly, regarding the Structural and Cohesion Funds, I noted that we did not match up to some of your expectations."
"Nor could we, for some Member States are mainly contributors to these funds - and I do not just mean Germany, do not misunderstand me here - while others profit from both funds."
"That quite naturally creates opposing interests, that can only be reconciled through compromise."
"I believe that in regard to the size and shape of the two funds, it has become clear that all in all we have found a sensible compromise."
"As far as Parliament's interests are concerned, there will after all still be negotiations about flexibility and other similar demands that have been made."
"I believe these negotiations will be conducted in an equally determined and purposeful manner."
"At any rate, that is what the Council wants, as in the case of the negotiations that have now been concluded on preparing for the necessary legal acts."
"Here I am optimistic that we will manage to achieve the sensible measure of flexibility that Parliament wants."
"Applause"
"I can only underline what has been said about further-reaching aims."
"Of course what we must now do is to get the institutional reform underway, and not least because besides the financial architecture, institutional reform is one of the real conditions for the success of the enlargement process."
"Only if we manage really to achieve the institutional reforms in parallel with the accession negotiations will we be able to keep to the scheduled timetable for accession."
"Without institutional reforms, the greater Europe, one that does not stop at the eastern border of Germany, would become ungovernable."
"I believe that the Members of this Parliament know that, but the Council knows it too. This is indeed one of the very major tasks, and although it cannot be achieved during our presidency we can at least get it underway."
"On the two other major objectives referred to in this debate, namely to draw up the common foreign and security policy, to safeguard it institutionally and to appoint a genuinely important and significant personality to represent and conduct this common foreign policy, in Cologne we want to decide on the person to be appointed and of course make progress in substantive terms."
"Here too we feel we are being held accountable to Parliament, and quite rightly so."
"We really do want to work on this."
"It must be equally clear - and here I am especially addressing the critics of European employment policy - that European employment policy, the employment pact we want to forge, must not be seen as a substitute for national employment policies."
"It would be quite wrong to perceive it as such; rather, it should be seen as usefully supplementing national policies."
"That is the aim we are pursuing."
"If we could manage to direct the Member States' considerable resources more towards this objective through coordinated national budgetary policies, and if, on top of that, we could also manage to direct European resources towards this objective, then I believe we really would be doing something to combat unemployment, especially youth unemployment, in Europe."
"We would also be making an immense contribution towards anchoring the idea of Europe more firmly in the minds of our young people than some of us may have managed in the past."
"That is what we want to discuss and set in motion in Cologne."
"On the question of relations with Parliament, let me offer a concluding remark. Like any head of government controlled and elected by Parliament, I naturally respect the Members of Parliament."
"But as a government we are self-assured enough to indeed accept and recognize the rights of the MEPs but also to point out that it is still up to us to legitimise policies, such as expenditure policy, so long as there are no radical changes."
"We have to explain to people why and how much they are to pay out and what for."
"That form of legitimation also gives us a certain self-assurance."
"I look forward to a constructive dialogue with Members of Parliament, with Parliament itself, in which no-one gives any special treatment to anyone else but both sides know that Europe can prosper only if the institutions are able and become even more able to work together."
"In this regard I have one more point to make. It is a question of the ceterum censeo that has been mentioned in many statements, the ceterum censeo about inviting the President to today's informal meeting."
"We have on occasion issued such an invitation, and we will do so again."
"The reason for our decision today is quite simple."
"Firstly, I will be seeing the President and talking to him very soon, and secondly we really convened this informal summit in order to talk with Mr Prodi."
"Parliament has already had talks with Mr Prodi, so an invitation did not seem necessary."
"Moreover, it was clear that against the background of developments, in this situation the Heads of State and Government cannot meet without discussing Kosovo."
"We have exactly an hour and a half for this."
"That is the reason why we did not invite the President of your Parliament, it is not because of any reservations about the President and even less about Parliament - and we will certainly not make a habit of this."
"Even if indeed you cannot agree, at least I would ask you to understand and to believe me when I say it was neither a question of disrespect nor of rudeness, but simply a question of time."
"I hope I have managed to answer some of the objections."
"I thank the Members of this Parliament and the President for giving me an opportunity to speak here. It was an honour."
"And I also thank you for letting me reply to your statements. I wish you much success in your work and much success for all of us who are in and for Europe."
"Applause"
"Thank you for what you have said today, Mr President-in-Office."
"I wish you success in the negotiations at the informal summit meeting this afternoon."
"Madam President, it is well known that before the Berlin agreement on Agenda 2000 was concluded, there was a great deal of indecision, indecison which has dogged the European Union since Maastricht."
"In my view, this is because euroscepticism has given way to europhobia among our political leaders."
"The result is that the European Union is not equipping itself with the necessary political and economic resources to achieve its aims, on paper at least."
"This indecision has been borne out by the crisis in Kosovo, where the ineffectual implementation of the common foreign and security policy has been unable to prevent the crisis from escalating and has once again allowed the United States to become the major force in our region."
"On issues relating to Agenda 2000, there were also discrepancies between our words and our actions."
"Of course, we are glad that some form of compromise was reached."
"However, that compromise led to an economic package that is substantially smaller than that proposed by the Commission and Parliament."
"As far as the Structural Funds are concerned, we welcome the fact that the solutions that were chosen - which relate to the partnership principle, the performance efficiency reserve, and so on - do not differ from the proposals put forward by Parliament."
"As regards the economic support given to the four poorest countries, it was decided that it would be best to maintain per capita expenditure at 1999 levels."
"This may satisfy Spain, Portugal and Ireland. However, I cannot understand why this solution satisfied my country, Greece, when it is well known that it is the poorest country and the only country which comes under Objective 1 in its entirety."
"Nor can I understand why it accepted the increase from 55 % to 62 % in Spain's share of the Cohesion Fund, and the reduction of its own share from 18 % to 17 %."
"But, as Kipling would say, that is another story."
"Madam President, Berlin was worth the journey, as we have heard here today several times."
"But it will take a lot more work before the objectives set out by the Berlin European Council have an impact on the ground."
"That applies in particular to the important issue for the future, 'enlargement', which has rightly been addressed repeatedly here today."
"The slogan here runs: rather than drawing away in fear we must move towards one another."
"In an exemplary joint effort, the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have made the Interreg Community initiative stand as a signal for cooperation beyond the existing external border of the EU."
"Many thanks, Commissioner!"
"Now we must ensure that European legal texts and European aid money lead to constructive cooperation between the people on either side of the EU border."
"In my own country, Austria, as also in other Member States bordering on the applicant countries, we have an opportunity to turn the idea of European cooperation into reality with concrete projects."
"Let us do so!"
"We also have this kind of very concrete cooperation between the European institutions and the European people in my own country at present, on a different European issue, the question of the refugees in and from Kosovo."
"In Austria the people themselves, vigorously supported by the media, by radio, TV and the press, have sent out their own very personal European signal in the form of an exemplary action called 'Neighbour in Need'."
"In the space of a few days the people - first and foremost it is the ordinary people, who find it hard enough to live on their incomes as it is - have already donated more than 100 million Austrian schillings."
"That is tangible proof of the European solidarity that we, the political office-holders in Europe, all too often call for in word alone."
"We, the Council and Parliament as the European budgetary authority, should take a leaf from their book."
"Applause"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the agreement reached in Berlin on Agenda 2000 guarantees that the European Union will function in the short term, but it does not secure its long- and medium-term future."
"The first reason for this is that the courage needed to alter the status quo of Community policies and their distributive effects was lacking."
"The second is that financing the enlargement of the Union means there will be no growth in structural and cohesion policies and there will be delay in financial and agricultural reforms."
"Thirdly, no provision has been made for any special mechanism to assist the adjustment of weaker and more vulnerable economies to enlargement - my own country, for example."
"Fourthly, the status quo has essentially been maintained for the CAP, which means that it will continue to treat the farmers of the European Union unequally. Furthermore, the CAP will not facilitate negotiations at the next WTO round in three years' time, at which we will come under enormous external pressure to make further reforms."
"Lastly, with respect to Portugal, I feel that the agreement on the Structural Funds would not have been a bad one were we not in the process of enlarging the European Union. As Portugal is the country which has most to lose from enlargement and we have been offered no compensation whatsoever, it was a bad agreement."
"And the reform of the CAP was even worse, as the most backward agricultural economy in the European Union has not even been granted the right to increase its area of irrigated land, not just to accommodate the major Alqueva project but also more generally. It is impossible to carry out any modernisation in a region like ours without increasing irrigation."
"Madam President, the basic agreement reached in Berlin about the agricultural part of Agenda 2000 contradicts the statement by the Commission that it wants to make European agriculture more competitive and therefore viable."
"The partial adoption by the Council of the Commission's price cutting proposals in the milk, cereals and beef and veal sector will bring these prices closer to the world market level, but the proposed compensatory payments go no way near to covering the income losses."
"Now we are told the milk market reform is only to begin in the year 2005, in three phases, and that the quota system is to expire in 2008."
"We welcome the idea of optional set-aside."
"That is something we called for."
"In the case of cereals too, the agreements will initially run only until the year 2002, when adjustments are to be made if necessary."
"Further price cuts of 5 % are under discussion, but on the basis that then the compensation could be raised again from EUR 63 to EUR 66 a tonne. But obviously nobody noticed that this hit the oilseed farmers particularly hard."
"After the compromise reached by the agriculture ministers, they were sure of obtaining EUR 66, but now it will only be 63."
"On the other hand we welcome the fact that set-aside is still fixed at 10 % until the year 2006."
"In regard to beef and veal, the Agenda decisions resolve neither the surplus nor the income problem."
"The mother-cow breeders have won, the traditional bull-fatteners have lost."
"That is the simple outcome of the Agenda, my dear President-in-Office of the Council!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this resolution and, on a general level, the strategy chosen by the Committee on Budgets is an irresponsible course of action that is in danger of leading to real budgetary conflict."
"The financial agreement concluded in Berlin is today an important success that could not be repeated under the present circumstances. For this reason, some of us fully support it despite the fact that, although it is a good agreement, it does not fully satisfy everyone."
"In order to fulfill a legitimate wish, some of us are also prepared to oppose an increase in the budgetary powers of this House if it means jeopardising the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"The political message in this resolution threatens rejection of the Berlin financial perspective. It also leads to a risky annual budgetary procedure that does not guarantee allocations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"In financial terms, our opinion differs from that of the Council by only 0.38 % of the total approved in Berlin for the next seven years."
"As President Santer pointed out, an agreement is around the corner and must be reached without any further delay and by June at the latest."
"The real problem is that there is a political trend in this House that favours an annual budgetary procedure without financial categories and, consequently, without fixed year on year amounts for structural policy."
"We can begin to understand this way of thinking even though we are against it, but we cannot understand how those who opt for this path are those who have a duty to defend a European model of economic and social cohesion."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."

"In successive votes, Parliament approved the various Commission proposals"
"We shall send an usher straight away if this gentleman does not hear what we are saying."
"I see that he has heard, and I can assure you that we shall check on his credentials."
"Madam President, may I draw attention to the fact that the photographer is still sitting up there."
"A hussier went to him but he has refused to move."
"I would ask that he be removed and identified and that consideration be given to withdrawing or at least doing something with the pass."
"It is not acceptable for telephoto-lens photographers to be sitting up there refusing to move."
"Applause"
"That had not escaped me, Mr Balfe."
"I was keeping an eye on the gallery, and I had the same concerns as you. I would ask this gentleman to leave."
"Madam President, I just wanted to propose that we should congratulate the President of the sitting for beating all the speed records for the votes."
"I think that along with Mr Martin you are in pole position, but the competition is open to anyone."
"Applause"
"Madam President, I voted against the resolution on the Berlin European Council due to the adoption of an amendment which bore absolutely no relation to the Berlin summit and its results, stating that Parliament would refuse to cooperate with a Commissioner, in this case Mrs Cresson."
"I think that we have had many opportunities in the House to discuss, comment on and vote on texts concerning issues such as the Committee of Independent Experts and the Commission's resignation."
"However, tabling an amendment at the last minute, whether on the Berlin European Council, agricultural prices or any other subject, discredits our institution; it does not reflect well on us and I feel it is an unjustified attitude that was badly thought out and was not called for."
"I repeat: I voted against the resolution, and I am proud of it."
"The Commission has resigned and we have given a political judgement on the issue, at all levels."
"I think that the approach that I have condemned is damaging to the image that Parliament had projected in the last few months."
"Madam President, all the implications of the Berlin European Council of 24 and 25 March have undoubtedly not yet been perceived by the people of the Union, who, as usual, will gradually discover the consequences of these agreements."
"Let us take the case of agricultural policy: Commissioner Fischler described the measures that were adopted as the most radical reform in the entire history of the CAP, one that is so major that it surpasses the in-depth changes that took place in 1992."
"This radical reform, that is to say integration into the global market and the reduction of farmer's incomes, is in reality a collection of specific technical measures, and for someone who is not an expert it is difficult to grasp its general thrust."
"We think that this lack of clarity is all the more serious given the fact that the decisions that were taken are going to be used in order to determine many subsequent policy guidelines."
"For example, the Council mentions in its conclusions that - and I quote - ' the decisions adopted regarding the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda 2000 will constitute essential elements in defining the Commission's negotiating mandate for the future multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO.'"
"Therefore, without realising it, we seem to have already decided on the European Union's negotiating position for future international negotiations."
"This procedure, which is certainly the norm in Brussels, is quite unbelievable compared with the usual methods adopted by democratic countries, to the extent that - and I would like to highlight this point - national parliaments have so far not been invited to ratify these agreements at all."
"The irony of history seems even greater when we know that a short time before the Berlin European Council, a public hearing organised by this House had concluded that there was a lack of debate and democratic control with regard to multilateral trade negotiations."
"This is exactly the situation that the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has been condemning for a long time, and which led to disastrous results at the Uruguay Round."
"It is essential that the same method is not used again in the future."
"This is why we demand that the Berlin conclusions should be rejected on this point, and that the Council's and the Commission's mandate for the next WTO negotiations should be the subject of an in-depth public debate and a formal vote in the national parliaments."
"Madam President, I can tell that the PPE is in the middle of a campaign, including when it comes to the interests of this House!"
"When Mr Martens said yesterday that the resignation of Edith Cresson alone would have solved the crisis, I think he was evidently campaigning."
"Parliament is making a legal mistake by adopting the amendment on the Berlin European Council resolution."
"We have accepted something which is absurd."
"The Commission has resigned, collectively, because it is collectively responsible."
"Politically, however, this is significant."
"Mr Martens prefers not to see what is happening or to read the report from the Committee of Independent Experts, according to which there was clearly collective responsibility for the errors that were made."
"I think that we ourselves have demonstrated the maturity of this Parliament and helped bring the truth to light, and that we have enabled the Commission to regain its credibility and allowed democracy to progress."
"I welcome this, but I deplore the way that Parliament has voted, which does not do it credit."
"Madam President, to add to the excellent reasons set out by my colleague Georges Berthu that encouraged us to vote against the Berlin summit resolution, I would like to put forward a few points regarding paragraph 2, that is the appointment of the new Commission."
"What a contradiction on the part of Parliament, which, once again, is openly surrendering before even giving battle."
"I remember those people who asked for the immediate replacement of the Commission that had resigned."
"These are the same people who are now satisfied with a Commission that would be put in place from January 2000, and on whose appointment the European Parliament may be consulted."
"In the same sitting, we voted for Amendment No 2, which is disgraceful and was tabled at the last minute by the PPE Group and the ELDR Group, objecting to Mrs Cresson retaining her post and declaring that we will not cooperate with her as long as she remains in office."
"Meanwhile, we rejected Amendments Nos 16 and 17, which demanded that the Commission be replaced and asked that the Commissioners should not be candidates at the European elections."
"Parliament did not take anything that was said in the report from the Committee of Independent Experts to implicate the Commission as a collegiate body."
"Unemployment in Europe cannot be brought down using the methods of the Swedish Labour Board at EU level."
"We therefore voted against paragraph 4 of the resolution."
"We would rather see deregulation of the labour market and lower taxes on labour; not more of the kind of active labour market policy that has failed to deliver results in Sweden."
"There is certainly no reason to centralise an expanded Swedish-style approach at supranational level."
"Circumstances vary from one Member State to another and, where there is a desire for a labour market policy approach, individual countries should ideally decide for themselves."
"Another reason for voting against paragraph 4 was that it violates the subsidiarity principle."
"We need to be seen to be exercising major restraint on the expenditure front; it is therefore to be welcomed that the agreements reached in the Council of Ministers are based on prudential management of taxpayers' money."
"Any additional resources that can be then be released should be mobilised to facilitate the EU's eastward enlargement."
"New growth markets are developing in the applicant countries; these will create new and worthwhile job opportunities for the Union's current members. Fostering such markets will contribute much more to the employment situation than could ever be achieved through an active labour market policy."
"I have voted in favour of the Berlin Summit resolution to give my support in particular to the German presidency's achievement in getting agreement for the structural fund package in Agenda 2000."
"I am pleased that the Council has taken on board several recommendations made in my report on the general framework regulation."
"A key achievement was the follow-up commitment to the Cardiff Summit to continue to support the Northern Ireland peace process with the Special Peace Initiative."
"One outstanding issue remains to be solved with the Council in conciliation before assent is given, namely Parliament's request for additional Community initiatives, URBAN and Crisis."
"Parliament is, of course, willing to seek a compromise in this area, but is must reflect Parliament's priorities in the Community initiative field."
"Let me again underline our intention to achieve our political priorities, to fulfil our responsibilities to communities in our regions."
"I regret that the European Council did not accede to Parliament's request to reinstate the URBAN initiative."
"This initiative has proved to be a useful weapon in tackling urban deprivation."
"The retention of LEADER for promoting rural development should be counterbalanced by the retention of URBAN."
"The retention of URBAN would be especially important for cities like my own - Dublin - which is likely to see a considerable reduction in the Structural Funds available because of its loss of Objective 1 status."
"I had been campaigning for retention of URBAN as it could provide the basic funding for my proposal that there be a fund specifically ringfenced for the development of deprived urban areas."
"These areas are both absolutely and relatively disadvantaged as they are side by side with areas of considerable affluence."
"I hope that tonight's conciliation results in URBAN being reinstated."
"I want to ensure that the general Structural Funds are used to a significant extent to address the problem of urban deprivation."
"I would ask that the rules governing ESF and ERDF be changed in order to direct more of these funds to areas of acute deprivation and I would also ask that the regional aid guidelines be amended to allow for state aids to be paid at a higher rate to those urban areas which are suffering acute disadvantages."
"I will be voting for the joint resolution on the Berlin Summit as I welcome the European Council's prompt nomination and recommendation for President-Designate of the European Commission."
"The result achieved in Berlin with regard to the structural funds has demonstrated the importance that the European Council has attached to both the continuation and reform of economic and social assistance within the Union."
"Most welcome is the 300 million euros in funding guaranteed for use within the Highlands and Islands of Scotland."
"The Highlands and Islands have made good use of the funds provided under the existing Objective 1 programme but continue to be disadvantaged by peripheral and sparsity of population."
"The continuation of funding will help the region overcome these disadvantages."
"The only disappointing aspect of the summit was the limited reform of the common agricultural policy."
"Far more radical reform is required."
"Madam President, I rise to speak on the Happart report."
"We agree with the price proposals in the report because for legal reasons they are vital to protecting farm incomes."
"But I want to point out that the package is not sufficient to protect farmers' ability to survive, as agricultural prices are staying the same, while the general price level is rising constantly as a result of inflation."
"That brings down farm incomes - in Austria it brought them down by 1.7 % in 1997 - while raising incomes in, for example, industry."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the report because I believe that we basically still need another discussion about agricultural policy in this House."
"I would like to see more market."
"When you think that according to OECD statistics, one third of all farm revenue in industrialised countries comes not from the market but from state support for agriculture and in the European Union as much as 40 % of farm revenue comes from the taxpayer's pocket, from state support, then in my view that means we must urgently review this sector."
"That also applies to price supports and subsidies, such as for sugar, where we pay twice if not three times the world market price and then regulate matters again with quotas for individual undertakings."
"I believe we need more market in farming."
"I would have liked to see that reflected here."
"We take it that the agreements reached by the Council of Ministers in Berlin on the common agricultural policy form the basis for the implementation work now being carried out by the Commission."
"There is consequently no need in our view for Parliament to complicate the situation further by coming forward with proposals for joint action."
"Under these circumstances, we decided to support our group's position, even though we still maintain our previous criticism of the CAP."
"The Danish Social Democrats have today voted against the Happart report because it paves the way for a rise in the prices of agricultural products."
"We cannot support price increases at a time when a reform package has only just been adopted which lowers the prices."
"This simply does not make sense."
"We should instead be reducing the prices, especially in the sugar and sugar beet sector, where there is no common organisation of the market."
"The artificially high prices of our agricultural goods must gradually be reduced so that they reach the same level as the world market prices."
"This is an essential prerequisite for the enlargement process."
"The text we are holding in our hands is the negative summation and dangerous outcome of what was forecast in Agenda 2000 and what is already being implemented through the specific regulations governing most agricultural products. These regulations establish strict prices and quotas, which cannot be changed if the regulations themselves are not changed."
"All the rest is just a veneer of negotiations and debates; what we are actually talking about is simply the timing of a death that has already been prophesied."
"The Commission proposals simply apply the term 'reduction' across the board for all agricultural products."
"The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development examined these proposals and rejected all the amendments that called for price increases. What we are left with are dangerous proposals, without any balance between the human factor, production and the land, and without any link between prices and products."
"These proposals aim to further reduce the agricultural population and to bring down prices and production costs in the interests of competition. Not only will they give rise to new imbalances in production; they will also directly threaten the quality of products, the environmental balance, agricultural employment, the social balance and social cohesion."
"As the rapporteur himself points out, the 1992 review of the common agricultural policy led to a decline in the markets and to a reduction in farmers' incomes. It even managed to wipe out small and medium-sized family farms, chiefly in the Mediterranean regions of the Community."
"This resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of farms and in the level of jobs in agriculture, thereby increasing unemployment in agricultural regions and dangerously accelerating the depopulation of the countryside. The average income resulting from agricultural activity throughout the EU fell by 3.9 % in relation to 1997."
"Your aim is to reduce it even further, hence the new proposals for agricultural prices, true to the spirit and letter of Agenda 2000. These proposals not only prolong the current situation by means of 'technical adjustments', and address the problem of farmers' incomes in a technocratic way; they also push ahead with the further decreases in incomes with the avowed ulterior objective of reducing the agricultural workforce and driving farmers out of the farming profession."
"The unconcealed injustice that is being perpetrated against small and medium-sized family producers is continuing and even increasing. Moreover, large farms, which absorb 80 % of Community support, are still being subsidised in a provocative and even more intensified manner."
"And finally, the policies being implemented serve the God of large-scale interests. These declarations of interest in the protecting and promoting the countryside are exactly on a par with those made on humanitarian aid and on the protection of the Kosovar Albanians under the hailstorm of murderous bombs."
"Step by step, a new feudalism is appearing with new tenant farmers. The feudal method is being revived through co-responsibility fines, so-called co-resourcing, and so on."
"This debate has the wrong title."
"It is not about establishing prices but about detailing disgraceful acts against small and medium-sized farmers, against producers in the south, against consumers and against the fabric of society and environmental stability."
"You say you are bombing Yugoslavia for 'humanitarian reasons'."
"Are you exterminating farmers for 'environmental reasons'?"
"It appears that their sweat and toil are polluting the 'healthy environment' of 'globalisation' and of 'competition', and that you want to return them to the purgatory of the 'new order of things'."
"But the farmers have demonstrated that they do not intend to accept, much less serve, such designs. They have proved this through their struggles, through their rallies, through the mass pan-European rally that was recently held in Brussels with the participation of the 15 Member States, and through the rallies in the enlargement countries, such as Poland."
"You will reap what you sow. You will be forced to defend yourselves at a people's Nuremberg on account of your anti-farming and peace-shattering policy."
"The report by our colleague Mr Happart is the last report on the agricultural prices of the current CAP."
"Once again, the majority of Parliament has voted against the amendments requesting that depreciation of the currency be taken into account when establishing price levels and compensatory aid."
"Farmers' income is penalised by this depreciation of the currency."
"What social group would accept a stabilisation of its income, meaning a decrease in real terms?"
"The launch of the euro on 1 January of this year also had negative effects on European farmers' incomes due to the pure and simple abolition of the green ecu."
"The combined effect of inflation and the abolition of the green ecu is going to give rise to a drop of around 4 % in institutional prices and compensatory aid in the next marketing year."
"When we are discussing agriculture in general we hear a great many calls for rural development, the traceability and health and safety of products, respect for the environment and animal welfare, etcetera. Now, when we are voting on the economic factors that enable us to fix farmers' income, all we do is regularly reduce it."
"Faced with the problem of the reduction in aid and prices, the only option available to our farmers is to turn to intensification, either by expanding their farms, or by setting up off-land production."
"How can we fail to see that it is contradictory to set high environmental, health or animal welfare standards, while at the same time regularly reducing the principle of Community preference?"
"In order to have European production costs and European constraints, we must have European prices."
"This should be the plan of action for professional and political leaders who want to safeguard European agriculture."
"We applaud this report on the proposal for a Council Directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community."
"Thanks to the directive, one of the most significant employee rights will be consolidated."
"This is vital both for strengthening the social dialogue and for increasing mutual trust within companies."
"As to the scope of the directive, we would have preferred not to see a requirement for 'at least 50 employees'."
"There are no grounds, in our view, for any such threshold; instead, emphasis should be placed on the right of all employees to be informed and consulted."
"As the directive does no more than set minimum standards, however, we feel that we can go along with the proposed threshold. Member States remain free to apply provisions that they believe would suit them better."
"The Danish Social Democrats have abstained from voting on the proposal for a directive on information and consultation."
"We cannot vote in favour of the proposal because there is a danger that, in its present form, it will interfere with Denmark's special bargaining model, whereby information and consultation are regulated in agreements on cooperation committees concluded between the social partners."
"We have not voted against, however, because the question of informing and consulting employees is part of the EU's social dimension, which must not be opposed in the interests of solidarity with those workers in the EU and the new Member States who do not yet have efficient systems for informing and consulting employees."
"We therefore hope that the Council will find a solution which satisfies both the need of workers for a high level of information and consultation throughout the EU and the need for Member States to be able to maintain systems which are already functioning efficiently."
"I voted against this report in the final vote because I believe that responsibility for the issues it covers lies with the Member States. It is the subsidiarity principle which should apply here."
"I must express my very great satisfaction with regard to the proposal for a Council directive and Mrs Ghilardotti's report."
"What is at the heart of this proposal are workers' legitimate rights to be informed and particularly to be consulted with regard to decisions on the management and organisation of the firm for which they are working."
"The discrepancy between this right and reality is actually very great, and workers are too often treated as mere pawns who can be used as the economic climate dictates."
"Nevertheless, in Europe there is a real will among workers to make their voice heard and to have a role to play in the running of their firm."
"This is a characteristic of our European social model, and we must protect it at all costs."
"Legislative measures must reflect workers' demands."
"The Commission proposal aims to do this."
"Its objective is to ensure minimum standards of consultation and information."
"Even if it is only the 'union minimum', as in the French expression, we need to see it as only a first stage in a more long-term strategy of strengthening the role of workers."
"Competitiveness and social dialogue are not in conflict with each other - quite the contrary!"
"I fully subscribe to the opinion that the necessary restructuring will be much better received, even if it involves job losses or retraining, if management have been able to explain their approach and to listen to comments from employees."
"These measures must be applied in as many firms as possible."
"The threshold of at least 50 employees is satisfactory."
"Nevertheless, this should not exempt small businesses from taking into account the opinions of their staff."
"We will have to work on defining incentive mechanisms in order to promote this type of dialogue."
"It is obvious that with this aim of extending the scope of these measures, we cannot accept the derogations proposed by the Commission for companies that pursue political, ideological or religious aims. We obviously need to define appropriate penalties so that these measures can be correctly applied."
"Along the same line of thinking, Mrs Ghilardotti rightly reaffirmed that we would no longer tolerate employee representatives being penalised as a result of their duties, and I will not disagree with her."
"If we want to prevent Europe from remaining simply an unidentified social object for workers, we must arm ourselves with the means of guaranteeing their basic rights."
"We are voting against the report on informing and consulting employees in national enterprises."
"The proposal is a striking example of lack of respect for the principle of subsidiarity."
"In the first place, there is no cross-border aspect to the proposal and, secondly, this matter has already been regulated in the majority of Member States, including Denmark, through cooperation agreements."
"This matter must be regulated nationally and between the social partners."
"Such an approach will take into account the subsidiarity principle and the national differences and traditions within the EU."
"The number of companies closing down operations or relocating has increased."
"Sweden has lost businesses because EU aid has been delivered in more advantageous ways in other countries."
"That is not how EU support was intended to function."
"Shutdowns and relocation have an impact on companies' workforces."
"It is important that individuals affected by such decisions can be informed at an early stage."
"Such matters are dealt with under collective agreements and legislation in the various Member States. In Sweden, we have the Co-determination at Work Act."
"The proposed directive seeks to introduce a consultation framework under which management can inform labour of major changes in company strategy."
"There are grounds for asking whether this is an area which the EU should be regulating."
"As the directive is designed to bring in minimum requirements, however, the Member States - or the two sides of industry - are free to maintain or introduce rules which call for more extensive provision of information."
"I voted against the report because the legal basis conflicts with it."
"Report as a whole: against."
"Any proposal or measure that strengthens the information, control and role of workers within a company will have our full support, despite the fact that we are aware of the limitations of such legislative interventions in the day-to-day reality of the system in which we live."
"From this standpoint, we agree that we need to establish an obligatory and effective legislative instrument that will provide for the swiftest and broadest possible information and consultation of employees on issues relating to the progress and prospects of the company, employment, labour relations and, more generally, all the issues and planned decisions that directly affect the interests of workers and, consequently, their lives and prosperity."
"However, we are categorically opposed to the direction these procedures are taking within the Commission. It regards information and consultation as tools to make it easier to ensure the compliance of workers, or, as mentioned in the explanatory statement of the proposal for a directive, as a prerequisite for the success of procedures to restructure companies and adapt them to the new conditions created by the globalisation of the economy, especially through the development of new ways of organising work."
"In our view, the process of informing, consulting and involving workers must be considered as one of the ways in which they can strengthen their role and influence, with a view to effectively promoting and supporting their interests. Naturally, they should not become merely participants in decisions that are taken in their absence."
"The way in which these mechanisms are developed will clearly depend on the workers themselves and, to a large extent, the orientation and quality of their representatives."
"Furthermore, employers are strongly opposed to the text proposed by the Commission - which is somewhat unambitious and limited - and also to the many amendments tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and here in the House with a view to rendering it devoid of content. This is proof that, if they function correctly, these mechanisms may contribute effectively to defending workers' interests."
"We do not believe that this directive will be effective if it only covers 3 % of companies, as the Commission itself admits."
"In our view, the implementation threshold for this directive must be lowered to five employees so that it will cover small SMEs, which form the overwhelming majority of companies."
"This is something that has already entered into force in some national legislations under pressure from the labour movement."
"The limitations that are being proposed in the name of the confidential character of information and the protection of privacy are unacceptable."
"If enforced, such limitations will lead to a substantial infringement of the right to be informed and consulted."
"The provisions for the timing and extent of the information and consultation process must be especially stringent. This process must take place in good time, before a decision is taken, so that there is sufficient time for workers to act, and it must include any changes that may affect their labour and security rights."
"We are referring, in particular, to plans for reorganisation, amalgamation and cooperation, investments, relocation, closures of all or part of a company or establishment, and changes in labour relations, as well as more general issues, such as the strategy, position and development of the company."
"It is constructive that the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs attempts to make significant improvements to the Commission text."
"These improvements hope to extend the scope of the directive, the content of information and the degree of consultation. They also hope to prevent Member States from restricting the scope of the directive to large companies, that is, those employing more than 100 workers, and to increase the protection of workers' representatives."
"However, above and beyond this, it is extremely important to retain the provision in the Commission proposal that relates to the lack of legal consequences of the decisions taken by an employer in violation of the obligation to inform and consult. Therefore, we must not adopt the amendments which seek to do away with this provision."
"Otherwise, the directive would become devoid of content. Nonetheless, this matter of the lack of legal consequences must relate to the entire decision that is taken where the obligation to inform and consult is not met, and not just to the section involving labour relations and agreements."
"This would help us to prevent any violations of the directive."
"The principal merit of these reports, presented by our colleagues Mr Chanterie and Mr McMahon, is that they bring the issue of reducing working hours back into our field of discussion, even though we are not concerned today with debating the benefits of this approach in the battle against unemployment."
"This being the case, the proposals presented to us are entirely aimed at considerably improving the situation for those professions that have so far been excluded from the various measures that already exist."
"From this point of view, I agree with Raphaël Chanterie's proposal that the period necessary for the Member States to conform to the new provisions of the directive should be limited to four years."
"Also, like Hugh McMahon, I must support the idea of including self-employed drivers in the directive on working time for road transport."
"Too many examples demonstrate that excessive periods at the wheel dramatically increase the risk of road accidents."
"I also note with satisfaction that the report takes into account the considerable growth in subcontracting, which allows too much freedom with regard to the legislation in force."
"Finally, I dare to hope that the demands made concerning the monitoring of working and driving hours will be effectively implemented by the Member States, but I have some concerns in this respect."
"I have regularly questioned the Commissioners on working time in the road transport sector and on the employment conditions of certain shipping companies."
"So in future I will see to it that these new directives are effectively applied."
"The economic Europe is on the way to becoming a reality."
"While our fellow citizens have understood that there are certain obligations linked to this stage, the time has now come to build a citizens' Europe in which social matters must have an important place."
"Without this, the very idea of Europe will be questioned!"
"Everyone is aware that road transport is one of the sectors in which the social Europe does not exist."
"In the absence of an agreement between employers and workers, it is therefore positive for that social Europe that the Commission has taken on its responsibilities and proposed the directive that we are discussing today."
"Along with workers' unions, the rapporteur and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have approved the main principles of the Commission text and improved it with regard to certain social aspects:"
"the 48-hour week will be the minimum standard for all drivers in the EU, - working time can be up to 60 hours as long as the average of 48 hours remains the reference period, - the directive will also cover self-employed drivers and working time will be the same for employees and for self-employed drivers.Other provisions clarify and categorise road transport work, for example by giving a more restrictive definition of night work."
"In general, we should hope that the Transport Council will reach an agreement so that road safety and the social welfare of drivers will be guaranteed and social dumping will finally be fought effectively in a sector in which the social Europe has been only too slow in arriving."
"This report sets out to extend the 1993 working time directive to include further groups of employees."
"The principles behind the 1993 directive and the present proposal are the same."
"The 1993 directive has caused many problems for the Danish trade union movement."
"In the first place, the EU directive does not, in general terms, contain any improvement in the legal position of Danish workers compared with the agreements that exist at present."
"Moreover, the Danish authorities have required that the directive should be implemented by incorporating it into the agreements."
"In our opinion, this is absurd and this kind of thing - coupled with other (increasing) instances of EU interference in Danish agreements - has the effect of undermining free negotiations."
"We fully appreciate that the proposal can, in some respects, be regarded as progress in those EU countries whose trade unions lack the strength to demand improvements through agreements."
"But based on our experiences in Denmark - and because the EU must respect free negotiations - we cannot vote in favour of this proposal to extend the EU's regulatory power."
"We voted against Hugh McMahon's report on working time in the transport industry, as we cannot accept the notion that self-employed drivers should be included in the proposal for the regulation of working time."
"This would mean an immensely awkward reworking of arrangements in the case of Finland, and would seriously affect the feasibility of small business transport systems."
"For the same reason we cannot accept the restrictions contained in the report on night work."
"Madam President, we voted for the report because the integration of the two directives on incinerating hazardous and non-hazardous waste is to be welcomed."
"However, we very much regretted that Parliament did not adopt the Greens' amendment aimed at a zero-emission limit value for dioxin in water."
"We know that dioxin is the most dangerous chemical mankind has ever produced."
"Following new scientific findings, the WHO has also drawn attention to this problem of the maximum permissible level for humans and reduced its limit values."
"So I cannot understand why Parliament has not followed an early Commission proposal."
"I regard this high level of dioxin pollution as a kind of Waterloo in health terms."
"I think it is totally irresponsible for Parliament not to accept these proposals, for this in fact means it has bowed to the pressure from industry."
"In the case of a substance as dangerous as the Seveso poison dioxin, I find that difficult to understand."
"It would have been important for Parliament, which accepted the reduction of dioxin emissions into the air and the reduction of the values, to also agree to the values for water."
"It is quite incomprehensible why the values accepted for dioxin in water are five times as high as those for the air."
"After all, water is the most essential means of survival and it is not impossible for drainage water to enter the ground water and for the emissions in the air to precipitate into the water."
"That is why I very much regret that Parliament did not agree to halve the emissions of hazardous substances into the water or even opt for a zero emission level."
"We had suggested a late date, namely the year 2020."
"This would have been feasible in technical terms."
"Unfortunately we did not manage to give priority to consumer protection."
"I must express my surprise concerning the strategy defended by Mr Blokland and by the European Commission, which aims to fuse the Commission's proposal for a directive on the incineration of non-hazardous waste and Directive 94/67/EC on the incineration of so-called hazardous waste."
"This plan to integrate the directives is worrying from several points of view."
"First and foremost, Directive 94/67/EC, in accordance with Articles 13 and 18 of this directive, will be applied to existing incineration facilities for hazardous waste from 1 July 2000."
"This means that those sites have planned investments with the aim of fully complying with the standards set out in the text by that date at the latest."
"Those standards now have to be considered as obsolete, just when they are about to be applied throughout the Community."
"Let us be serious: economic operators need a minimum degree of consistency and legal security."
"Secondly, this fusion, on the legitimate pretext of simplifying Community legislation and making it clearer, actually ends up reducing the level of environmental protection by encouraging the mixing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in the same facility."
"This would undoubtedly mean that the incinerators that are currently under-supplied in some Member States could be used to their full capacity."
"However, investment errors should not be corrected at the cost of reducing the security standards on hazardous waste."
"It is essential that we maintain a very clear distinction between these two types of waste, as the fact that they are so different in nature and in their level of toxicity means that we need to define their specific technical characteristics."
"This should be taken into account at each stage of waste management: when it is being collected, received, handled in the facilities and treated, and when disposing of residues and so on."
"However, we must support the idea of reducing the economic distortions that result from the differences between the standards for emissions into the atmosphere and discharges into water, but that should not be done to the detriment of the progress that had been made as a result of Directive 94/67/EC on hazardous waste."
"Parliament adopted the integration of the directives, and I therefore voted against the modified proposal."
"We voted against all the amendments that involved merging Directive 94/67/EC on hazardous waste and the proposal for a directive on non-hazardous waste."
"The approach proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection presents several risks."
"There is a danger that the rules that apply to the incineration of hazardous waste will be relaxed by implicitly allowing it to be incinerated in facilities intended for non-hazardous waste."
"With regard to the application of the directive on non-hazardous waste, merging these two texts runs the risk of causing a delay in the adoption of new emission limit values as defined in Directive 94/67/EC."
"With regard to monitoring, there may be a fear that the preliminary monitoring procedures specific to the incineration or co-incineration of hazardous waste will be removed."
"Even if fully applied by producers of special waste, these monitoring procedures cannot be incorporated into the procedures that are carried out when receiving non-hazardous waste at non-hazardous waste incineration facilities."
"With regard to the balance of incineration lines, this integration of the two directives threatens to favour certain incineration lines to the detriment of others, through ill-adapted limit values, whereas we need to pursue all four incineration lines: the specialised incineration of non-hazardous waste, the specialised incineration of hazardous waste, co-incineration (incineration in a cement kiln) and incineration by adapted combustion plants."
"We must take care not to give priority to one incineration line over another, given that the environmental and energy balance responds to recognised needs."
"Last but by no means least, there is a risk of an excessive rise in treatment costs, bringing no significant environmental benefit, with limit values being fixed for pollutants that are not specific to the waste being incinerated (sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxide for example), which should be adapted both according to the type of facility and to its capacity."
"In order to be coherent and effective, any environmental strategy must be carried out by means of a legislative approach combined with economic and fiscal instruments, and must be supported by adequate financial instruments."
"LIFE is the only Community financial instrument aimed entirely at supporting an environmental policy covering the whole of the European Union and including environmental cooperation with neighbouring countries."
"Due to the type of projects that it funds, LIFE is distinguished from the other instruments for research and development and support of structural investments that also contribute to protecting the environment."
"The proposal for a regulation that we are to vote on today presents the third phase of LIFE, incorporating three thematic components:"
"LIFE-Nature, which is based on the cofinancing of nature protection projects that can contribute to preserving and regenerating natural habitats and species (budget heading B4-3200)."
"LIFE-Environment, which is based on the cofinancing of new environmental measures, demonstration projects and preparatory projects aimed at integrating an environmental dimension into land-use development and planning projects and industrial production activities, with a view to improving waste management and reducing the effects that products have on the environment (budget heading B4-3201)."
"LIFE-Third Countries, which is based on the cofinancing of technical assistance programmes focused on creating capacity for the administrative structures that are required in the environmental sector and that are necessary for developing an environmental policy, and action programmes in neighbouring third countries other than countries that are candidates for accession (budget heading B7-810)."
"The members of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted for the amendments that favour the setting up and application of the LIFE programme."
"However, we wish to stress that measures undertaken with the support of LIFE must take account of Community environment policy."
"We therefore voted against the amendment which made the development of this policy conditional on the results of the LIFE programme."
"If this was the case, the financial resources that are envisaged in the programme would be entirely insufficient, particularly with regard to the enlargement of the European Union to include the CEECs."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.50 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Situation in Kosovo"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Kosovo."
"Mr President, since Kosovo is daily and nightly on our minds, I do not mind being taken by surprise in having to make some introductory remarks, bearing in mind that this morning the German presidency and the President of the Commission also devoted time to this very important issue."
"I am sure it goes for both the Council and the Commission when I say that we are very much aware of the seriousness of the situation, of the human tragedy that is developing, and that nothing must hinder us from examining and thinking continuously how to bring this appalling situation to a politically satisfactory solution."
"Obviously that is not an easy thing to do."
"We should be pleased that the Western Alliance, including the European Union - and Russia to a large extent - have managed to maintain a common attitude towards what is seen as a barbarism which should no longer belong on our continent."
"It is therefore of the utmost importance that this Union is preserved."
"The Commission, for its part, has supported the presidency in every effort and initiative, trying to show that while it is not our opinion that military solutions should be used to resolve this tragedy, they are at least preventing President Milosevic from imposing a military solution and exploiting his military might against the Albanians in Kosovo."
"That will not be accepted."
"In the past weeks the German presidency has been working very hard with the other European, American and Russian partners to try to see how the military track on the one hand could be accompanied by political initiatives on the other."
"The House will be aware that there was an important meeting in Oslo yesterday between Secretary-of-State Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov, in an attempt to reach an agreement on a plan that is also being discussed today by our Heads of Government with the Secretary-General of the United Nations."
"This provides for an attempt to achieve unity on a Security Council resolution which would make clear to Mr Milosevic that what is expected from him in the first place is to take measures to allow the safe return of refugees - we should perhaps speak of deportees - to Kosovo."
"This would be achieved by him withdrawing his troops and paramilitary services, to give the necessary guarantees for the security of these people, based on his acceptance of an international military presence on the ground."
"Mrs Bonino and I have been trying to give active support to those countries which neighbour Kosovo and which are the most heavily affected by the massive influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees."
"Therefore, we were very pleased to note the concerted support from the Council of Foreign Ministers who on Monday pledged EUR 250m to those countries."
"EUR 150m would come from ECHO, to be spent mostly as usual through non-governmental organisations where obviously UNHCR plays an important role."
"The other EUR 100m would enable the governments which are mainly dealing with the refugee problem to take certain measures to prevent destabilisation in their countries as a result of this unexpected massive influx."
"We are thinking of Albania in the first place but also of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and we are also trying to reach those in Montenegro who are dealing with the massive influx of tens of thousands of displaced persons."
"I hope we will be able to present final proposals to Parliament soon."
"I have already been in touch with the chairman of the Committee on Budgets to try to arrange for the allocation of 100 million, which has to be found in the budget without damaging other important on-going programmes that, in fact, often benefit the same countries that we want to help with the additional EUR 100m."
"This will not be the last time that we discuss this issue: it is an on-going process."
"I can only conclude my introductory remarks by saying that we all hope very much that Milosevic will come to his senses."
"It is not the outside world that is imposing a military solution on him, it is the outside world that is heavily and, we feel convincingly, protesting against the atrocities, the ethnic cleansing and the deportations that are taking place against the people of Kosovo."
"Where we can alleviate their plight, we will spare no effort."
"As Mrs Bonino is here, I take it that she will comment more particularly on the humanitarian efforts."
"These are my introductory remarks."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to what Chancellor Schröder has already said today as President-in-Office of the European Council, I would like to stress that in the current serious crisis in and around Kosovo the European Union has demonstrated a high level of solidarity and ability to act."
"It has shown solidarity in terms of its political evaluation of what is happening there - which, as you all know, has not always been the case - and an ability to act in relation to the aid that has to be provided for the people concerned, to the stabilisation measures that must be taken for the countries in the region and to consolidating the principle of the primacy of politics over war."
"After all, when weapons speak we must not simply put politics to one side; instead we must always continue to pursue the road of politics."
"We must be clear that political initiatives can contribute to putting an end to the use of arms."
"Mrs Bonino and I were in Tirana and in Skopje exactly two weeks ago."
"Mrs Bonino will no doubt be reporting on that later."
"I just want to say that for both of us this journey was something totally outside the normal political routine."
"I for my part - and I am quite sure this goes for Mrs Bonino too - was shaken to the core by what I witnessed there, and I have seen many such things in the past - the victims of torture in South Africa, the victims of famine in Somalia, the victims of expulsion in Africa - but I have never seen such a massive, such a brutal, such a systematic violation of human rights as there, and this is happening in the middle of Europe, on our doorstep!"
"So I believe it is essential that we adhere to the aim of putting a stop to this inhuman action."
"It can no longer be tolerated in Europe at the end of this century!"
"Applause"
"At the same time, we have to exercise our political imagination to seek a solution to the problem."
"The German Presidency is putting all its energy into endeavouring to do so at this time."
"I am very happy to be able to tell you that broad international agreement is emerging on a process that looks something like this: the Yugoslav Government will be offered a 24-hour ceasefire as soon as it begins to withdraw its troops and paramilitary units."
"That ceasefire will be extended if this withdrawal continues; and once the withdrawal is complete and the other conditions have been met, we can begin to implement a peace settlement, one that is still on the basis of what was negotiated in Rambouillet."
"But that only answers the immediate question of what we will do when the shooting stops."
"The longer-term question is this: how can we develop a policy that guarantees stability and peace for the entire region in the long term?"
"Here we have put forward for discussion the idea of a stability pact for the entire region."
"This must certainly be looked at as a medium and long-term process, at the end of which we do not envisage a new order in the sense of re-drawing borders or even persuading people to leave their home; at the end of it we want to see a political strategy that enables the peoples of the region to cooperate and to co-exist peacefully."
"In the present situation it is crucial that the European Union and the international community leave no doubt about their resolve."
"That is why we must adhere to the conditions we set for ending the military action."
"These conditions are such that Milosevic can quite easily fulfil them."
"It is up to him and him alone to ensure that his country is not destroyed even further and that the lives of the people of his country are not put at risk."
"Let me also state again quite firmly: the international community is not at war with Serbia or with the Serbian people."
"It is not a question of gaining territory, ruling over people, obtaining spheres of influence."
"Nor is it a question of raw materials or oil or anything of the kind; it is a matter of fundamental human rights and nothing else!"
"It is a matter of ensuring that the declaration of human rights is not a hollow phrase in Europe but that ..."
"Heckling"
"There is no point in you interrupting because I do not understand you."
"I do not understand your language. There is no point."
"I do not understand it!"
"It is a matter of making it clear that we are also prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of our common convictions and to most resolutely oppose the activities of those who are trying by criminal means to destroy all the progress we have achieved in European civilisation!"
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office."
"Mr President, yesterday was Holocaust Day in Israel."
"That anniversary is a stark reminder of our commitment to the principle of 'never again!', which was the founding principle of the European Union."
"We must never again turn a blind eye to genocide, we must never again tolerate ethnic cleansing, we must never again appease a brutal dictatorship."
"The message has to go from this Chamber and from the international community that the Milosevic campaign of ethnic hatred, which began ten years ago, must end where it began - in Kosovo!"
"We must say to him that on the verge of the next millennium he cannot use events which took place in 1389 to justify mass murder today."
"We will not let him drag us back to the barbarity of the Middle Ages."
"Heckling"
"I congratulate the German presidency on the firmness of its resolve and leadership in this conflict."
"We all know the immense difficulties this has presented for Germany, and I recognise and pay tribute to the courage of the German Chancellor and Foreign Minister in particular."
"I also congratulate the Commission on the speed of its response to the humanitarian crisis, despite the difficulties it is having to face at the moment."
"The Socialist Group has consistently argued that military action was a last resort because of the very dangers of military action which we are seeing at the moment."
"However, once every possible opportunity for negotiation was exhausted - and every possible opportunity was exhausted - then military action was inevitable and should be supported by this House."
"That military action must continue until Kosovar Albanians are able to return to their homes in peace."
"We must not give Milosevic any sort of victory or allow him to play any more games with the international community."
"We must increase our resolve to deal with the displaced people."
"They are not refugees: they have been driven from their homes."
"We must also learn our lessons from these events."
"It is quite clear that we need to have a European defence identity and, therefore, the St Malo initiative must be followed up rapidly."
"It is equally clear that Europe does not have the resources for a European defence identity: we cannot mount a campaign without American and NATO support."
"So if we really believe in peace-making and peace-keeping, Member States must be prepared to have a defence budget commensurate with our ambitions."
"It is not enough to talk!"
"We have to put our money where our mouths are!"
"The final lesson we must learn: a lot of attention is focused on the importance of Russia and America."
"This whole tragedy has underlined the importance of one other country in Europe, and that is Turkey."
"Turkey is clearly crucial to the peace and stability of this continent."
"It is beholden on the European Union to take seriously its responsibilities for Turkey and ensure that Turkey feels part of the European family."
"Mr President, it will take a long time to correctly assess the position taken by Europe in the tragedy of Kosovo, and it will not be done before the deafening bombing and the lamentations of the refugees have stopped ringing in our ears."
"The warmongers will continue to shadow-box to ensure the effectiveness of aerial attacks, which have been going on with catastrophic ferocity for three weeks."
"Ordinary people, however, are questioning the major role once again given to the Americans by Europe through NATO."
"We must not forget that entire decades passed before Mr McNamara acknowledged that the massive intervention in Vietnam was a criminal error."
"Nor should we forget that, more recently, just as Mr Milosevic is now being called 'the butcher of Kosovo', Saddam Hussein was called 'the butcher of Baghdad'. Despite the massive operation in the Gulf, he is still alive and continues to rule, whilst children in Iraq are dying of hunger and disease."
"Now that the standoffs and dramas have reached a climax, there is no room for dispassionate responses."
"There is, however, grave concern about the disastrous dangerous consequences that the failure to come up with a political solution might have."
"There is concern that the whole of the Balkans risks becoming destabilised if ground operations are initiated, and unless the inviolability of existing borders is guaranteed. There is concern about a resurgence of cold war tensions and about the fact that the role of the United Nations as the guardian of peace and international legitimacy is in danger of being undermined."
"Mr President, let us hope that this afternoon the Brussels Council will assume its real responsibilities, albeit belatedly, and that it will safeguard not the credibility of NATO, but peace in Europe and cooperation among all its peoples."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that I respect Mr Lambrias's opinion."
"But he did not express the opinion of the Group of the European People's Party."
"I expressed it this morning in the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Applause"
"I want to make that clear."
"And it must be recorded in the Minutes!"
"I already guessed what you were going to say, Mrs Pack, but this is a problem which should have been resolved earlier, within the group."
"Mr Lambrias asked to speak on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party."
"This is not the President's problem; this particular case is an issue for the political group."
"Mr President, during this year many of us have met Mr Ibrahim Rugova."
"On his frequent visits to European capitals and to Brussels, Mr Rugova told us several times, and with growing anguish, that a tragedy was unfolding in Kosovo and that Milosevic's violence would push the Kosovar population, and especially its young people, to armed struggle."
"Unfortunately we did not take heed of those dire warnings."
"Perhaps we wanted to, but we did not succeed."
"The time required to reach intergovernmental agreements - the UN is a case in point but so are European mechanisms - is very long, which means that our decisions are dictated by procedures instead of by the true necessities of history and by the facts."
"NATO's intervention was long overdue and I congratulate our colleagues from the EPP Group for clearly rejecting this statement, which I cannot imagine represents the opinion of our colleagues."
"NATO's intervention did not cause ethnic cleansing."
"It simply revealed its extent."
"It did not provoke Mr Milosevic."
"It has simply shown that Milosevic is a war criminal."
"We respect the voices of those who would honestly not like to see weapons used."
"We respect the voice of Catholic leaders such as the Pope; but if we do not use force against Milosevic, violence will continue and spread."
"We need a union of minds and determination."
"This is the reason why the ELDR Group would have preferred the European Parliament to have considered the utilisation of ground troops if needed."
"For the rest, we fully agree with the joint statement and with what Chancellor Schroeder said this morning."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis in Kosovo, which is completely dominating European current affairs, to the extent that it makes the other subjects being debated seem absurd, should be looked at from three points of view: the military aspect, the humanitarian aspect and the political and diplomatic aspect."
"The political and diplomatic failure of the Rambouillet Conference, which did not succeed in obtaining the agreement of all the parties in the conflict, unfortunately reversed the order of priorities, and it is now the outcome of the military phase that will dictate what will happen next."
"This outcome obviously depends solely on the behaviour of Slobodan Milosevic, who should not for one moment be in any doubt as to the determination of the NATO allies; they will only put an end to military action when the safety of all the inhabitants of Kosovo is guaranteed within the borders of the Federation of Yugoslavia, and when all the refugees, who are victims of ethnic cleansing, can return to their country."
"This non-negotiable demand has just been pointed out in a most timely manner by the United Nations Secretary-General, Kofi Annan."
"It is supported by the large majority of public opinion in Europe."
"By blindly refusing to face this reality, the dictator, a former Yugoslav communist, is adopting a suicidal attitude with regard to both himself and the entire Serbian population, whose sincere patriotism, which commands respect, is being abused."
"While continuing their military pressure, NATO and the allies have to deal with an unprecedented humanitarian crisis."
"The flood of refugees is overwhelming the capacity of Kosovo's neighbouring countries to accept them, and threatens to politically destabilise them."
"The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is entangled in its own bureaucracy and perhaps paralysed by its inability to quickly mobilise the necessary resources, has proved to be inadequate, but the mobilisation of NGOs and the International Red Cross has been entirely remarkable."
"In the face of the immense scale and the urgency of need, it is essential that humanitarian intervention is coordinated."
"It seems that the issue of accepting the most vulnerable refugees - women, children and the sick - in Europe and across the Atlantic, is being dealt with in a much calmer manner than was initially the case."
"This should not of course be interpreted as a de facto acceptance of the ethnic cleansing that Slobodan Milosevic has planned for Kosovo, but it is undoubtedly necessary in order to relieve the pressure on Albania, as it is obvious that the completely safe return of those who have been expelled from Kosovo cannot take place immediately."
"The definitive end to the crisis has to come through a political and diplomatic solution."
"Russia appears to be an essential partner in seeking this lasting solution to the crisis in Kosovo."
"It has already made considerable diplomatic efforts to make the Yugoslav dictator listen to reason, and will have an essential role to play in negotiating and guaranteeing peace, particularly by participating in a peace-keeping force which will act under a United Nations mandate."
"Within Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, to whom the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize a few months ago, has an essential role to play."
"In order to ensure that he is not used as a tool by the Yugoslav dictator - who is currently holding him hostage - we must demand that he regain his freedom of movement so that he can meet with the authorities directly affected by the conflict, and Parliament should take the initiative to invite him to come and speak to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"It is essential that the European Union, which has been unable to prevent conflict, either in Kosovo or in Bosnia - despite the fact that these conflicts were clearly predictable - should draw all the lessons that it can from these failures, and should finally provide itself with a truly credible common foreign and security policy."
"While the European Union has enabled the enemies of the past to be reconciled, in the future it should serve as a model for the Balkans and we should affirm loud and clear that there is plenty of room for a democratic and peaceful Serbia, which includes Kosovo, in a united Europe."
"This is the message of hope that we must convey to our Serbian friends, who are currently being abused by a shameless dictator who is leading their nation towards a collective suicide, and not towards the glorious destiny with which he has dazzled them in order to serve his personal criminal ambitions."
"Mr President, in my view it is right and also encouraging that Europeans are mobilising in their millions in response to the humanitarian tragedy that has been forced on the Kosovars."
"Europe must bring aid to the refugees, offer asylum to those who request it, affirm their right to return, work to reestablish them and ensure their safety by means of a European peace-keeping force."
"We must also demand substantial autonomy for Kosovo and convene a European conference for peace, security and reconstruction in the Balkans."
"These are our proposals, some of which date back a long time."
"I would like to express here today my complete condemnation of Milosevic's policy."
"I think that the ethnic cleansing and the forced exodus of the people is an abomination and a crime."
"Whether the Serbs are the perpetrators, as in Bosnia in the past and now in Kosovo, or whether they are the victims, as in the recent case of the people of Krajina in Croatia, I am among those who believe that sovereignty is a very important element in international relations, but that it does not mean that a power can do absolutely anything to its people or to a minority."
"That is not what we disagree on."
"The source of our disagreement lies in making war the habitual means of resolving problems, with no regard for the severe humanitarian, material and political consequences."
"It lies in the refusal to see that the bombing has entirely the opposite effect to the objectives that were officially laid down for it."
"It lies in the acceptance of the dubious and irresponsible game that some western countries are playing with the KLA."
"It lies in the rejection of the UN and the cavalier exclusion of partners such as Russia, all of which we can now see are essential for ending this crisis."
"All these strategical errors bear a mark, the mark of NATO and the American leaders, on the eve of the Washington summit that is aimed at fixing their hegemony over Europe in the post cold war period."
"This is why I am convinced that Europe has allowed itself to be caught up in this affair, and that it is in its interests to do everything possible to free itself from this tragic deadlock."
"In this respect, I am following the current European diplomatic initiatives with a great deal of interest and attention."
"That is the way forward."
"We should be aware that all of the organisations in Yugoslavian civil society that are fighting courageously for human rights, for autonomy for Kosovo and against the power of Milosevic, have recently launched a joint appeal which says that NATO's military intervention has undermined all the results that they had achieved and has endangered the very survival of civil society in their country."
"We should also be capable of listening to the voices that are being raised, from the Christian Democrat vice-president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE to Monsignor Botazzi, from Helmut Schmidt to Mario Soares, from top political leaders in Sweden, Austria, Germany, Italy and France, to many figures from European progressive movements, calling for the bombing to be stopped and for a full-scale political battle to be undertaken in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace at the heart of our continent."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, in times of war, the dominant reality is one of fronts, organised and maintained as coherent blocs."
"Any dissonant noises are treachery and have to be silenced."
"The room for debate contracts, and in wartime too, the absence of debate is very dangerous."
"We should not delude ourselves that all the valid and humane arguments are contained in a single analysis and a single approach."
"Who can claim here that the NATO raids, without a mandate from the UN, do not give rise to problems as far as international law and international relations are concerned?"
"Who can say that shutting out the UN here does not create a vacuum, because the UN has not given the green light to action but nor has it condemned the raids?"
"Often in a vacuum of this kind, nothing happens for a long time or another factor intervenes, in this case NATO, with both humanitarian and military strategy objectives."
"I recommend that everyone should read Mr Brzezinski in today's Süddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung , who sets out these ideas very clearly."
"Who can be sure that the criminal treatment meted out to the Kosovo population, which started long before the NATO bombings of course, will suddenly and miraculously stop?"
"But who can deny that the raids have dramatically increased the persecution and deportation of the Kosovars?"
"Above all, who can forget that the scale of this mass exodus and expulsion has been totally underestimated and that the measures to cope with the refugees have been badly organised?"
"Who can fail to see that if the destructive bombing continues, this will in the long term affect not only the regime but also and primarily the population and their day-to-day living conditions?"
"But most important of all is what we should do now, namely concentrate on political initiatives."
"We must move away from military targets and look to political objectives."
"The Greens are therefore happy that the German Presidency and Joschka Fischer are working so hard to secure a peace plan."
"It is our firm conviction that a lasting political solution cannot be found without involving the UN and Russia."
"We believe that the Council must create the conditions in which a limited halt to the bombing can open the way to preparation of a cease-fire, naturally with conditions attached, conditions which Kofi Annan has indicated."
"I am eternally grateful to Europe's citizens for their generous readiness to take in Kosovar refugees."
"Their decision, born of high moral standards, is a clear signal to their government leaders that the EU governments should emulate those same standards, rather than falling woefully short of them."
"Mr President, I think that in the past few days we can finally say that the spirit of Munich is not quite so heavy in the air in this House."
"That was not the case a month ago."
"Finally, following developments that have taken place, we are facing up to the situation and we are not, as Mrs Alvoet said, pretending not to see that the problem with the UN was not created by Kosovo and that it existed before that situation arose."
"We are aware of the power of veto within the Security Council, and we know that some countries are constantly using it in order to block any initiative on the part of the international community."
"There was no alternative, Mrs Alvoet, to NATO intervention."
"I agree that it is unfortunate, but that is how it is."
"I would like to say to Mr Pasty that I find him very optimistic."
"To say that Mr Milosevic is suicidal is to give him too much credit and it is a refusal to understand that his policy is a scientific one, which he is continuing to carry out and for which is entirely responsible."
"I have a lot of doubts and am very sceptical about the German plan."
"It will be used by Mr Milosevic to gradually withdraw his troops as far as he pleases, resulting in a situation that we have been rejecting since August: the partitioning of Kosovo."
"It will be a partitioning in which he will be the winner, and which will enable him to annex 40 % or 50 % of Kosovan territory, where there happen to be a few monasteries, but more importantly where there are much richer areas, such as mines."
"He will annex this section, and from that moment on he will refuse to withdraw, and the international community, tired from long weeks of intervention, will sign up to Milosevic's victory, as it did at Dayton."
"Just as he was given 50 % of Bosnian territory at Dayton, this will give him 50 % of Kosovan territory, obviously completely cleared of any Kosovar presence."
"This is the danger that we are facing."
"I think that it should be very much on our minds."
"We are aware of Mr Milosevic's intellectual and criminal resources."
"We know that he is capable of anything."
"He has proved this once again."
"There was no need for him to prove it again for me, but I think that it was necessary for some of my colleagues in order to make them finally open their eyes."
"I think that we should continue to keep our eyes wide open and, while we are waiting, work to ensure that he is found guilty before the Tribunal in The Hague, because he has long ceased to be a person with whom political negotiations are possible."
"It is high time that the international community realised that."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, NATO has launched, on its own authority and bypassing the United Nations, military action aimed at putting an end to an unacceptable policy of ethnic cleansing."
"What we are now seeing is that this action has undoubtedly contributed to accelerating and magnifying the ethnic cleansing."
"We are seeing that the initial strikes, which according to Mr Vedrine and Mr Cook were only to last a few days, have rapidly become a full-scale war against a European nation whose economic infrastructure we are systematically seeking to destroy, and whose civilian population is inevitably being bombed."
"Meanwhile, we have no idea where this escalating situation should lead if the Yugoslav authorities do not give in to force."
"The initial objective that was given for the bombing was to obtain by force what we had felt we were unable to achieve through negotiation: the implementation of the Rambouillet plan, a substantial degree of autonomy for Kosovo, with respect for Yugoslav sovereignty and monitored by a substantial NATO force."
"The antagonism between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians has now reached a level where it is almost beyond remedy, which means that the future coexistence of these people within the framework set out in the Rambouillet plan no longer seems to be a realistic prospect."
"In the face of these shifts and this deadlock, we all now feel that there is no solution to the escalating military situation and that we should not listen to the irresponsible warmongers who are calling for a ground operation and/or the arming of KLA militias."
"We all feel that bypassing the UN and excluding Russia were mistakes and that we urgently need to bring them both back into play."
"We are all aware of the need to take each and every opportunity to reopen dialogue with a view to finding a political solution."
"We now need to give priority to everything that will enable us to move from the process of war to that of peace, everything that will enable the refugees to return to their land in safety as soon as possible."
"We will have to rebuild what has been destroyed."
"The peace plan drawn up by the current presidency, which you have just presented to us, Mr President, finally and happily breaks away from the mounting military action."
"It shows us a course that will not under any circumstances be that of increasing military action, which is something we should make every effort to resist."
"Mr President, before resentment builds up which could create a deep divide in Europe, we now need to put as much of our energy into seeking peace as we did into starting the war."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 1991, here in this House and in front of Mr Delors and Mr Mitterrand, who were supporters of Milosevic's Communist Yugoslavia, I defended the Croatians' and the Slovenians' right to independence."
"At the time, Milosevic's red army was shelling Dubrovnic and massacring at Vukovar, while this House remained indifferent."
"For five years, with the Chrétienté-Solidarité movement I helped more than 300 Croatian children in Bosnia to be kept alive."
"I am even more ready to express my total and equal solidarity with the Serbian children who have been subjected to the ultimate in technological barbarity."
"Kosovo is not Croatia."
"For the Serbs, it is not only a province, but the birthplace of their nation."
"NATO is not bombing Milosevic's regime, but the entire land, all the people, the entire future of an ancient European and Christian nation."
"One day historians will have to explain why, up until now, NATO has only engaged in this war."
"NATO, which was formed in 1949 to protect Europe from Soviet imperialism, did not intervene on behalf of the people of Berlin in 1953, the Hungarians in 1956 or the Czechs in 1968."
"NATO is in fact solely the tool of the United States, which did not mobilise against the genocide in Tibet or Cambodia, or against the massacres in Lebanon."
"Today the genocide of Christians in Timor and Sudan is continuing with complete impunity."
"And NATO cares little about the situation of the Kurds in Turkey or the Kabyles in Algeria, where the habitual slaughter of women and children by the National Liberation Front is continuing."
"So why this war against Serbia?"
"For the Kosovars?"
"Come on!"
"They are also the victims of Clinton's folly in supporting the KLA, which, we should not forget, is a Communist and terrorist organisation like the Kurdish PKK."
"NATO intervention is not a cure that is worse than the disease, it is a disease that is much worse than the disease."
"By bombing Serbia, in contempt of its sovereignty and of the rules of the UN, NATO is establishing the law of the jungle."
"By using the most obscene tricks of misinforming and brainwashing our people, it is also violating the rules of war."
"We are waging war against the Serbs, but we are denying them the moral right to defend themselves, and to take prisoners."
"It has even been said that, in the interests of democracy, they should have to put their television and radio at the disposal of their aggressors."
"Such claims and such contempt for the enemy have never before been seen throughout history."
"That does not give credit to our era."
"The Serbs are the baddies."
"The Serbs have the audacity not to recognise that the bombing is good for them, as the strikes are only a form of surgery."
"We want to cure them, and the swines are protesting!"
"The Serbs are wicked, all of them."
"NATO has the enamelled whiteness of the teeth and clear conscience of Clinton the humanist."
"However, enough of the sarcasm: Clinton, the cold-blooded murderer of hundreds of thousands of children in Iraq, is once again a criminal."
"His crimes are crimes against humanity."
"Let us hope that his war, which you are slavishly supporting, will not lead, through a tragic chain of events, to the third world war and the end of mankind."
"Applause"
"Mrs Müller, can you tell under which Rule you are asking for the floor?"
"I refer to the Rule in the Rules of Procedure under which you must call to order a Member of this House who calls the President of the United States a murderer."
"Ladies and gentlemen, you will not achieve your aims by shouting while another Member is speaking."
"When some colleagues were speaking a short time ago, Mr Le Pen made some comments on what was said by the President-in-Office and Commissioner van den Broek."
"I reprimanded him, but I think that it was wrong to do this, just as it is wrong for others to raise their voices while Mr Antony takes the floor."
"There is no point whatsoever in doing this."
"We know what kind of ideas are expressed in this House."
"Let us respect them, even if we do not agree with them at all."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to a Serbian democrat, the journalist Slavko Curuvija, who paid for the defence of democracy with his life last Sunday. He was assassinated after having stated publicly that Milosevic could not guarantee peace but could only generate a crisis."
"We also have a duty to pay tribute to the Serbs who are fighting for peace and freedom in their own country and who are risking their lives to do so."
"Having said this, Mr President, I am only going to say two things at this stage."
"Firstly, this morning, Chancellor Schröder quite rightly said that the European Union must be a community of values and not simply an economic community and market."
"And the values that we are defending now are the values of respect for human rights and respect for life - the most fundamental value - that are being systematically violated in Kosovo as we speak. This is something that we have seen repeatedly in the tragic process of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, for years in Slavonia and Bosnia and now in Kosovo."
"This is indeed something that Europeans cannot tolerate."
"We must therefore strongly support our Commission - particularly at the moment - as it is doing a good job."
"We must also emphasise that not only is military action underway but we are also seriously suggesting that a global solution for the Balkan problem be drawn up, as Chancellor Schröder mentioned again today. This would allow us to incorporate the process that has enabled Western Europeans to overcome so many centuries of barbarity and confrontation."
"As a result, Mr President, it is vital that we support this plan, and that we give it our full support so that those who have been expelled can return home."
"This cannot be achieved through resolutions alone; it requires intervention forces."
"I should also like to point out that, at a time when the Amsterdam Treaty is about to enter into force, these missions are defined as Union missions under the so-called 'Petersberg missions'."
"We must put them into practice."
"Just this once I thank you, Mrs Bonino and Mr van den Broek, for your prompt intervention."
"I would just like to point out that four months ago, a man wearing a funny scarf was here among us receiving the Sakharov Prize for freedom of spirit."
"We owe protection to this man, because otherwise there will be no point in awarding this prize, which is a sort of Nobel Prize for spirit, each December."
"I must highlight here today the peculiar situation that this man is in."
"He is considered to be a pacifist."
"He has fired no shots."
"He has not mounted an uprising, something for which some of his compatriots might even resent him."
"Mr Milosevic, who has protested his sincerity through some of our colleagues present here today, and is unable to accuse him of anything, says that he is now protecting him in Pristina from Serbs that may make attempts on his life."
"The European Parliament must intervene."
"First of all, as I proposed in the resolution, we must invite Mr Rugova to come back to speak to us in Brussels or Strasbourg and tell us what has been happening to him, mainly because he feels bitter."
"As Mrs Renata Flottau said, he is having trouble understanding the silence of all those who have paid court to him over the years, awarded him their prizes, been photographed with him in order to attract media attention, and are now powerlessly watching as the Serb dictator humiliates him."
"I am afraid that he will be thinking of us, and I would like to make a proposal. It is true that our regulations are strict."
"The European Parliament has not declared war."
"It is free, and Members are free to speak."
"A few days ago I wrote to the Serbian chargé d'affaires in Brussels to tell him that in my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, but for the moment without authorisation, I am prepared, along with other colleagues, to go to Belgrade or Pristina."
"The European Parliament must consider sending a delegation - which can be quickly arranged - to go and meet Mr Rugova in Pristina and to bring him back here."
"I would like to say the following to Mr Milosevic: 'As you can accuse him of nothing, here is the symbolic opportunity to show that you are preparing to return to peace."
"Hand Rugova over to us.'"
"Mr President, I agree with what Mr Soulier has just said."
"But I rise on a different point of order, to ask if you can tell us what has happened to the German presidency."
"I would have thought that in a continent at war the least courtesy the presidency could have shown us would be to stay here until the end of the debate."
"I am unable to answer your question, Mr Spencer."
"According to my information, the Council presidency was going to attend the debate until the end."
"Mr President, I agree with what the Council President has said today about Kosovo, and also with what the Commissioner said."
"But let us be honest."
"The West is now paying for its half-hearted attitude in the early 1990s over the need for a military response to the atrocities in the Balkans."
"Recognising the independent states, with the exception of Bosnia, was in itself to some extent an acceptance of the ethnic discrimination which at the same time we find so repugnant."
"In Kosovo, it is about to happen all over again."
"Little has been learned from the disintegration of Yugoslavia."
"Little has been done for the Serbian opposition, and little has been done for Mr Rugova."
"We awarded Rugova the Sakharov Prize, but part of Parliament was busy giving encouragement to the KLA."
"I am a fervent supporter of NATO."
"But the cynically technological NATO briefings hide the fact that we have become locked into a process whose consequences we cannot fully predict."
"Hence these questions of mine."
"How can we stop Milosevic from dragging down Montenegro, Macedonia and Albania to destruction with him?"
"How can NATO extricate itself without using ground forces?"
"The genie of an independent Kosovo has escaped from the bottle."
"The unilateral agreements reached at Rambouillet have been overtaken by events."
"How is the Council going to prevent the formation of a greater Albania?"
"These questions are important."
"In the meantime, our duty is to take in the refugees and to be generous in making good the damage, including damage to Serbia once Milosevic has gone."
"Lastly, I totally agree with Mr Soulier."
"I hope that Russian diplomacy will help us to resolve the difficulties and bring Rugova here, so that we can discuss his strategy with him face to face and incorporate it into the stability pact which the Council has drawn up."
"Mr President, it both saddens and angers me to have to say that, as of today, the European Parliament has become just as guilty as all those inhuman and hypocritical leaders in the United States and Europe who are using war in an attempt to salvage their lost credibility."
"The joint resolution we have before us brings shame on the European Parliament simply by having been tabled."
"If we vote in favour of it, it will be a disgrace for years to come."
"If the European Parliament wants to play its part, it should simply cry out in agony on behalf of the people of Europe: stop the war now!"
"Respect peace!"
"Leave the leaders of Yugoslavia and the legitimate leaders of the Kosovar Albanians to solve their own problems."
"They have demonstrated that they can."
"Get out of their way!"
"Otherwise, why not call on the Turkish army, as Mr Titley suggested, to interrupt its 'charitable' work slaughtering Kurds in Kurdistan to go to Kosovo and salvage the human rights that you are defending."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when someone says that he does not want war, I believe everyone applauds him."
"When someone says that he hates war, everyone applauds him."
"But when someone does not say that he hates ethnic cleansing, that he rejects ethnic cleansing, then there is a problem."
"Some people say that the Serbs and the Kosovars should sort out their own problems; well, Milosevic has been dealing with the Kosovars' problems for ten years, and has been saying what he wants to do for ten years."
"In his speech in 1989 at the Field of Blackbirds, he explained everything."
"When I was young I was taught that I should read books."
"We have read what Hitler wrote, and he did what he had written."
"We have read and heard what Milosevic wrote at the Field of Blackbirds: he did what he had said and what he had written."
"He wanted to purify Kosovo so that the Serbs could regain it, and that is the current situation."
"In that situation, there have been attempts at negotiation, and there have been mistakes."
"Everyone has made mistakes."
"Rugova has led a peaceful resistance, and we awarded him a prize. That did not work."
"It is an awful situation, and the bombing has not heightened the ethnic cleansing: it was going on before the bombing started."
"I am now proud of the German Government."
"I am proud of the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, who is currently trying to find a diplomatic and political solution to this conflict."
"However, a political and diplomatic solution and an end to the war must never mean the continuation of ethnic cleansing."
"We did not build Europe on the ashes of the Second World War to experience the tragedy of war now - and it is an unbelievable tragedy;"
"I would never have thought that my son would see another war in Europe."
"We do not have the right to sit back and allow ethnic cleansing out of cowardice."
"Selection and deportation were Hitler's weapons."
"We want the Serbs and Serbia to join Europe and stay in it, but not with ethnic cleansing."
"Mr Spencer, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to inform you that the President-in-Office is engaged in an informal trilogue with our Vice-President Mrs Fontaine on the subject of the Structural Funds, and will be back here at 5.30 p.m. to answer questions."
"Mr President, so far the NATO bombing has unfortunately not stopped the ethnic cleansing, quite the contrary."
"Kosovars have been driven out of their country in dramatic circumstances or are actually refugees within it."
"They are the victims of a totalitarian, ethnocentric nationalism which we deplore."
"But at the same time, I cannot condemn the NATO action, because I am aware that Europe stood by impotently for ten years, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has just said, whilst the former Yugoslavia fell apart, and when Milosevic revoked Kosovo's status as an autonomous region ten years ago, those familiar with the area predicted what would happen in the next few years."
"We did nothing at that time."
"But we must go back to a political framework, an acceptable international legal framework, which therefore has to involve the United Nations, the OSCE and the Russians too."
"We want the Kosovars to be able to return to Kosovo quickly, but without a political solution this will have to be done under military protection, as advocated in our joint resolution."
"But we should be sorry if this were to be military protection under NATO rules alone."
"We agree with those who advocate a European perspective for the peoples of Eastern and Southern Europe, so that respect for human rights and international law can stand together in peace and development."
"Mr President, we hope that the next Commission and the next Parliament, working more closely together, will remind the Council, whose absence today is justified, that it is just one of three Community institutions and not the most important one either."
"The Members of this House are not, I believe, right-wingers or left-wingers, warmongers or pacifists; we are, I very much hope, just men and women seeking to point out that international law does not exist if human rights are not respected first."
"And therefore we cannot but be divided into two categories: those who are in good faith and those who are in bad faith, with those who fight for principles realising that force sometimes needs to be used to defend them, since force or war are not good or evil in themselves but necessary attitudes and decisions when it comes to fighting for human lives and dignity."
"In any case we should note how Rambouillet has once again demonstrated the lack of European political union."
"If political union had been achieved a few years back, perhaps we would not have ended up with the tragedy we are witnessing today."
"If Europe had not just been represented at Rambouillet by four powerful nations but had been present as a political union, and if, prior to Rambouillet and at least since '92, Europe as a political union had sent a strong message - a strong and clear message - to Milosevic, maybe we would not have experienced all the wars, destruction and tragedy that we have seen."
"But things carried on as they did because of the choices made by certain governments and political forces: European union does not exist and all we can do is wait for NATO to represent what we ourselves are not in a position to represent."
"Let us hope that in the future Europe is able to achieve a political content and work towards a stability pact for the Balkans, that it is able to provide the deportees with the certainty they require in order to return home, in other words hope for the future, and that it is able to show solidarity with those who are hard at work - for example in neighbouring regions such as Puglia - in practical terms as well as in words."
"We should give a vote of thanks to Commissioner Bonino and the Arcobaleno organisation, together with a clear message from ancient Rome: 'Parcere victis, debellare superbos '."
"And Milosevic must be defeated, otherwise the warmongers and the arrogant will continue to trample on the rights of those acting in good faith and defenceless citizens."
"Could I conclude with a request, Mr President: if this Parliament were to convene an extraordinary sitting so that we could all meet at the border between Albania and Kosovo, this might be a good signal to send out at the end of a parliamentary term which has not brought political union but at least has established, between ourselves as Members of Parliament, a common will to be close to the people."
"Thank you for your suggestion, but I would like to add that we should go there unarmed, otherwise we would run the risk of becoming involved in the conflict ourselves."
"Mr President, what we have been witnessing in Kosovo over the past few weeks is the greatest tragedy to cast a bloody shadow over Europe since the end of the Second World War."
"In this desperate and devastating situation for the Balkans it is more vital than ever before for politics to start playing its full role once again, or at least to try to do so."
"In the meeting of the European Council taking place over the next few hours it may be confirmed that both the European Union and the United Nations are to return to the political arena."
"The fact that the heads of government of the Member States are meeting with the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, seems to be a prelude to a European initiative - as was moreover announced here by the Council - which might, if there are positive signs from the Yugoslav side, enable a return to be made to the negotiating table."
"However, there is no doubt that the fundamental condition for any suspension of the Allied bombing of Serbia is an immediate cessation of all military activity in Kosovo by the Yugoslav side, the withdrawal of Serb forces from the region and an end to the repression and expulsion of the Kosovar population."
"And on these issues and principles all European countries must maintain the strongest and firmest possible unity."
"In the hours to come we shall see the details of the proposals put forward by Europe and by the United Nations."
"Everything will depend, quite clearly, on the Yugoslav response."
"It is important to stress that whilst a strong and united front among the European countries and NATO is vital, the option of a political solution should remain open."
"The NATO military initiatives in themselves are not a solution to the problem: they have been and still are the only way to try and stop activities which to all intents and purposes are now genocide as far as the Albanian-speaking population of Kosovo is concerned."
"It is clear from the events of the past few days that the process of creating an effective European common foreign and security policy needs to move much more swiftly and that the Union should avail itself of all the political and practical instruments it needs to defend peace, security and respect for human rights, both on its own borders and in other parts of the world."
"In order to outline a solution to the complex problem of the Balkans it is furthermore vital for the Union to work out a strategy, a plan, to build up a long-term political and economic stabilisation process for the region, including through stronger relations with the Union itself."
"Perhaps today we are all paying the price for not having held out prospects of European integration for the region of the Balkans as well."
"At the same time there is an even clearer and more pressing need for the whole of Europe, including Russia, to work together across the board, as it were, in order to build a future of peace, progress and stability throughout the continent"
"Alongside the political and diplomatic initiatives, humanitarian assistance for the refugees and the victims of Yugoslav repression needs to be coordinated and reinforced."
"There is a considerable awareness of this need throughout Europe."
"The Arcobaleno mission launched by the Italian Government has met with the approval and active support of most of the public and civil society in our country, which is springing into action in a remarkable way."
"We believe that - above and beyond what has been done up until now, and this is already a great deal - the Council, the Commission, the Member States' governments and the whole of the international community should step up and fine-tune their efforts to help the people of the region."
"Today this is the acid test for the present and future construction of Europe."
"Mr President, there is no question here of our determination in the struggle against Milosevic, which of course must remain undiminished - since we know that any weakness may be exploited by the Serbian dictator - but the problem facing us is how to deal with a situation of military intervention which seems to have no way out, as the bombing cannot go on for ever, nor can it be the last word in an action that is intended to lead to peace."
"The reasons for the intervention, to defeat the madness of a dictator who has come up with a barbarous and inhuman plan, are justifiable, but if the bombs do not resolve the matter, I feel that - unless Mr Dupuis is suggesting sending in ground forces, which up to now has been ruled out - political logic calls for negotiations, since we want to avoid the option of a war which is won or lost."
"As Mr Verheugen said, we did not intend to wage war on Serbia, all we have in mind is to return people to the land from which they have been expelled."
"We must therefore make every effort to ensure that Kofi Annan and the UN are successful in their endeavours, that Russia is involved and that Rugova can become a partner in the discussions."
"May I now make one final point, Mr President."
"We are defending those who run the risk of becoming a wandering and dispossessed people."
"There are urgent needs, and while we should be grateful to Commissioner Bonino and Commissioner van den Broek for the work they have done, this is just a drop in the ocean and the situation is explosive."
"In Italy, as Mr Vecchi told us, LIT 30 billion have been collected from the public and EUR 150 million is available: we would like to know what is the precise extent of the existing needs."
"What also interests us, and this was accepted by the Council, by the current presidency in fact, is the request made in the other Assembly for a stability pact."
"This is the objective to follow, because rather than winning a war, we want to make peace win the day."
"Mr President, as Members of Parliament, we have a duty to promote and defend international law as the best means of defending human rights."
"As a result, I am wondering why no cases against Milosevic were brought before the Criminal Court in The Hague prior to 24 March."
"The United Left brought a case against Pinochet, which is currently being examined, and if we had documents and witnesses, we would also bring one against Milosevic."
"According to Articles 1, 3, and 5 of UN Resolution 3314/29 of 14 December 1974, NATO's attacks and Solana's decision can be considered a war crime."
"The best humanitarian aid we can provide for the Kosovar Albanians we are defending is to finally bring peace."
"The European Union must raise the voice of dialogue, of negotiation and of politics in the face of American violence. Consequently, we must promote peace alongside the UN and the OSCE."
"Mr President, war has returned to our continent for the first time in fifty years and we do not know how long it will last or how it will end, but wars always come to an end."
"Given the time that I have, I will not talk about the causes, aims or responsibilities of war."
"I would simply like to take a look into the future, beyond the war, at the European landscape that will be the framework for the peace that is built, and at the aims of peace."
"That part of the continent in which the war is taking place has fallen prey to demons that we thought no longer existed."
"The Pandora's box from which they come reveals some terrible contents."
"First of all there is the suffering of all those affected by the war: the Albanians who have been driven from their homes, but also the Serbs, who we should be careful not to confuse with Milosevic; they tremble at the bombs and watch in terror as their country's economy is destroyed."
"Another demon is that of the division of Europe. It is back."
"Hopes for a united continent are dying. They have given way to the old situation, with on the one side a strong and united Europe - our Europe - which is capable of deciding its own fate, and on the other side another Europe that has to suffer a fate that it is not yet able to choose."
"There are many signs of this division."
"The Ukraine has decided to become a nuclear power once again."
"The plan for a union between Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia, even though it is a plan that has no future, sends a clear message."
"In the face of the Europe of the Fifteen, Slavonic Europe is seeking to organise itself."
"What a defeat for us all!"
"Yet another demon is nationalism, which is never really dead, but which is gaining new impetus and spreading."
"Let us not forget that not long ago, the majority of Serbs saw Milosevic as a dictator."
"Now those same Serbs are rallying around him, purely as a result of a nationalist reflex."
"The resurgence of nationalism is also reflected in a new attachment to ethnic and religious differences."
"What a regression!"
"However, after the war, the Serbs and the Albanians will have to learn to live together again and, with time, forget their hatred."
"No peace-keeping force will achieve this result."
"The people will be the ones to decide."
"In the East, a very serious consequence of this war is that those who were part of the totalitarian system have regained their prestige, to the detriment of those who wanted democracy and reform."
"Courage will be needed now in Russia, to curb this tendency, and in Belarus, to continue to oppose Lukashenko."
"There are other examples too."
"Ultimately, it is not only Serbia which has been destabilised, but the entire Balkan region, where there is increasing doubt amongst public opinion about the legitimacy of the borders and the possibility of living in peace with different peoples."
"There needs to be an immediate response to this unstable situation in Europe, which is the framework for future peace."
"First of all, we urgently need to move back towards political solutions."
"War is never an end in itself."
"It is a tool used in exceptional circumstances for political relations between states."
"Secondly, we must not delay in bringing back into the debate two entities that have been wrongly excluded: the United Nations, a symbol of law, and Russia, which still has a great deal of influence in the Balkans and indeed in other countries in the region that could be useful in providing troops for a peace-keeping force that Milosevic would find harder to reject than he does NATO."
"Have we tried that?"
"Finally, the Europe of the Fifteen must take the initiative, on its continent, to find a channel for negotiation and to curb the general destabilisation of the Balkans."
"The future of our Europe, that of the continent and of the people who live in it, depends on it."
"Time is marching on: we must hurry!"
"Mr President, some parties to this debate are claiming that the peace movement, in calling for a cessation of the bombing, is effectively playing Milosevic's game; we are allegedly advocating Munich-style appeasement and are bereft of alternative strategies. That is quite incorrect."
"We totally condemn the criminal policy of ethnic cleansing being pursued by the Yugoslav regime and believe that Milosevic should stand trial before the courts."
"The world community has a duty to intervene in defence of human rights."
"The solution to this situation should be based on the right of the Kosovo Albanians to return home to an undivided and autonomous Kosovo under UN or OSCE protection, as part of a stability pact for southern Europe."
"Our view is that the NATO bombardments are wrong and have visibly failed."
"Room must therefore be made for non-violent alternatives."
"Finding these will take time and demand patience."
"Nelson Mandela negotiated for years."
"The Dalai Lama - after 40 years in exile - calls not for aerial bombing, but for the possibility to negotiate with a regime which this Parliament has condemned for its breaches of human rights."
"Why did we abandon the pacifist Rugova in order to support a guerrilla movement about which we know precious little?"
"I fully agree with Mr Soulier on this."
"Let us look at what NATO has on offer. Three weeks into the bombing, it is proposing to deploy 300 new warplanes, mobilise reservists and persist with the military campaign."
"That is what NATO has on offer. According to the International Peace Bureau, NATO 'has so far done nothing but accelerate the repression, unite the Serbian nation around Milosevic and alienate the Russians'."
"What is more, the UN has been made to look foolish."
"I quote from The Guardian of 2 April, in which Sweden's former prime minister, Ingvar Carlsson - in an article written jointly with his co-chairman on the UN's Commission on Global Governance, Shridath Ramphal - asked: 'What if in a virtuous rage China invades Taiwan?'"
"Dangerous precedents have been set and it behoves us all to be aware."
"But let us imagine for one moment that NATO is serious in its intent; that all the allegations of cynicism are misguided; and that people mean what they say when they wax lyrical about peace."
"Surely it would still make sense to acknowledge that the outcome in the field demonstrates that thebombing has failed and must be stopped - unless the idea is to prove that the operation was a success, even though the patient died."
"Mr President, 'war', it says today in a German daily, 'is always the result of a policy that has not achieved its aim'."
"That is why the generals should only intervene after the politicians have failed."
"But what does a military leadership do if it has been instructed to win a war without waging a war?"
"At present the necessary military action by NATO has been taken on the responsibility of a group of politicians who once upon a time loudly proclaimed themselves pacifists and opponents of war in the peace movements and are now ordering a war without wanting to dirty their hands."
"There is clearly a wide gap between instructions and means here."
"If peace is to be achieved by political means then the military have to withdraw."
"If it is to be achieved by military means the politicians must withdraw."
"At present the two areas of responsibility are being confused in an unprofessional manner and two half-measures certainly do not make a whole."
"In addition to the aggressor, those who are incapable of intervening at the right moment with the right methods also bear responsibility for the plight of the people."
"Mr President, I speak on behalf of my group and I will begin with what is most important."
"We endorse the NATO action on Kosovo."
"Military action was sadly unavoidable in the light of Milosevic's response."
"That action is necessary if the Albanians are to have any future in Kosovo."
"The European Parliament must leave no room at all for doubt today about where it stands on this."
"Of course, the starting-point remains the search for a political solution, but it has to be on the basis of Rambouillet, with an international military presence on the ground and the refugees able to return to an autonomous and democratic Kosovo."
"Given all that has happened since Rambouillet, that looks very much like an international protectorate."
"So be it, then."
"But that means troops."
"To my mind, these should as far as possible be European, including the Russians."
"The conflict is after all a European one."
"Essential requirements will be a robust mandate and an effective command structure."
"The EU is not NATO."
"As far as military operations go, the EU is a minor player, and a degree of modesty is appropriate."
"All efforts to forge a European security policy have so far remained wishful thinking."
"For the second time, the European Union is playing a subordinate role, despite the Amsterdam Treaty."
"But that is not to say that the EU has no role."
"The EU is politically behind the NATO action, as the German Chancellor has reaffirmed this morning."
"The EU must give a lead in accepting refugees, in the region to begin with and later outside it."
"Albania and Macedonia need help."
"The EU must take on the responsibility for rebuilding Kosovo, as it did in Bosnia."
"The EU must be forward-looking and not allow a third Balkan conflict to happen, because there is still a good deal of material for conflict, even after Kosovo."
"Stability in the region must not be seen purely as a military concern."
"Investment in cooperation, socio-economic development and the quality of democratic society are equally important."
"This, ideally, is the substance of a stability pact for the southern Balkans, in which the European Union, under the Amsterdam Treaty, should give a lead, for example by the pursuit of a common strategy."
"An approach or stability pact of this kind must also hold out the prospect of increasing close cooperation with the EU, because that kind of cooperation, of integration, is and remains the best instrument for peace which Europe has to offer."
"Mr President, I have listened very carefully indeed to this discussion."
"People keep saying things that no longer bear any relation to reality."
"They say we must return to the negotiating table."
"Think how long we went on negotiating, without any result except that the situation became ever worse."
"We must finally look at the situation realistically and realise that if we want to be credible we have to take a credible democratic stance."
"That means realising that people are not there for countries, but countries for people."
"So if we expect the Kosovars to return under the rule of those who drove them out of their homes and murdered their families, we are asking something humanly impossible."
"We should finally be totally realistic and pragmatic."
"People keep saying that ground troops could perhaps be deployed."
"I think that is a big mistake because European ground troops have often failed in their aims in this region."
"But the Kosovars are in their home country."
"I myself saw in Croatia - and I was often in Croatia during the time of the war - that the Croats were successful when they had more or less the same weapons as the Serbs."
"They chased them out, for people who are defending their own territory are far stronger than the aggressors who always come with a bad conscience."
"Finally, let me say something encouraging. People keeping asking what will then become of the Serbs."
"First of all, Milosevic is not Serbia."
"The Serbs are not Milosevic, just as the Germans were not Hitler."
"But we must finally realise that we cannot make peace with Milosevic because he will only start to commit his crimes all over again."
"Secondly, we must do our utmost to ensure that the policy pursued here is based on realism and not on illusion."
"Mr President, I would like to devote a minute of my speaking time to a minute's silence for the 10 victims from the train that was bombed by NATO planes."
"Some of them were children and all of them were innocent Serbs, killed during the Orthodox Easter."
"The House observed a minute's silence"
"Mr President, if the Germany presidency were present I would say to it that horror in this situation is not enough."
"We need to learn the lessons of the last few months."
"Some four months ago in this Chamber I said that Europe would fight and that Europe would be right and that the key thing was to persuade Mr Milosevic of our intentions that we would fight."
"And fight not just in the air."
"That is the cosmetic dishonesty of limited involvement."
"That is the arrogant assumption that you can have victory without risk, or power without bodybags."
"By telling Mr Milosevic that we would not fight on the ground, we invited the vicious and predicted Serbian response on the killing ground of Kosovo."
"One million people are this week paying the price for the hard lesson which has to be learnt by all of us and primarily by Third Way governments - whether in this continent or in America - who have to learn the lesson that in the case of peace and war there is no Third Way."
"It is no good Mr Bianco saying this is not a war to the Serbs."
"It certainly feels like a war to the Serbs."
"So I say to the Council that if you want Mr Milosevic to negotiate the peaceful admission of international troops; you will first have to persuade him that, in the last analysis, we are prepared to use troops to enter Kosovo aggressively."
"You cannot have one without the other when you are dealing with Mr Milosevic."
"Rambouillet is dead."
"In the long term we will have to look at an independent Kosovo, but that will have to be an independent Kosovo, in a new Balkans, in a new Europe that incorporates a democratic Serbia."
"That is the thinking you have only just begun to take on board at the Council."
"I beg you to accelerate that process."
"It has been claimed, Mr President, that the war in Kosovo is a just war, and the principle of humanitarian intervention has been invoked."
"To ensure that this principle, which is still somewhat hazy today, does not lead to an arbitrary and selective act of force, it should be incorporated into international law and should depend upon one institution: the United Nations."
"However, the principle has been used by a military alliance, an expression of brute force."
"After three weeks of war, the humanitarian situation has deteriorated appallingly in Kosovo, where apart from the ethnic cleansing pursued by Milosevic, there has been a constant hail of NATO's depleted uranium missiles, DUs."
"When they return, the Kosovar people will have to protect themselves from the land's radioactivity for centuries."
"So much for setting a civilised example, Chancellor Schröder!"
"Ethical war is born of the ethical State."
"Europe should stop and think!"
"Europe has been the cradle of law throughout history, and it should jettison the military option, an aberration which flouts international law and its governing principle of national sovereignty, before all this leads to a backlash against our own states."
"Mr President, there can be no equivocation: ethnic cleansing and enormous injustice against the Albanian population are totally unacceptable."
"Nor should there be any doubt as to the EU's desire to take responsibility in both humanitarian and economic terms for the huge outpouring of refugees."
"And it goes without saying that the standards the world has set for human rights must hold sway over the claims of nation states to sovereignty."
"The demands of international law cannot, however, be put aside."
"If such laws are wrong, they need to be changed, not broken."
"What is so worrying is that Europe has stumbled into a war which has produced a million refugees, yet there is no evidence of any policy to extricate ourselves from the crisis."
"A colonel who has been witnessing the collapse of Yugoslavia over many years made the following point: 'Either people were plain stupid when they decided to launch this war, or they were extraodinarily cynical in believing that the flood of refugees and the attendant human tragedy were a price worth paying.'"
"The prime task for the EU now is to work for a political solution; to put a end to ethnic cleansing; to support the refugees; to stop the bloodbath; and to create real opportunities for the refugees to return."
"It is not enough for the EU to be welcoming Kofi Annan's offer to mediate and bring an end to this conflict; it should be giving him its active support."
"The EU has a duty to establish the UN as the paramount body for overseeing the rule of law in the international community."
"The EU must now call for a peace-keeping force under UN auspices, involving Russian peace-keeping troops, so that ethnic Albanians can return to their homeland."
"The EU must see to it that the UN special tribunal on Yugoslavia swiftly undertakes investigations into war crimes that have been committed. Equally, countries need to be encouraged to ratify the agreement setting up the International Criminal Court, so that we have an instrument to deal with war crimes in the future."
"It cannot be the EU's task to sanction NATO's military initiative."
"The Union's task is to devise constructive solutions - politically, diplomatically and economically - to this and other conflicts."
"Mr President, of course the main responsibility for this conflict lies with the Serbian Government."
"There is no excuse for the campaign of terror being waged against the Albanian population of Kosovo, Milosevic has led his country from catastrophe to catastrophe."
"However, this does not mean that NATO's bombardments are a solution, or are likely to herald a positive outcome."
"NATO has manifestly succeeded in starting a war which it does not know how to end."
"What more graphic illustration could we have than the hesitation over sending in ground troops?"
"Existing levels of ethnic cleansing were, moreover, stepped up when NATO began to bomb, not to mention the fact that NATO's bombardments play into the hands of the most insalubrious political forces - not only in Serbia, but to some extent in Russia too."
"If we want a solution, there is one option only."
"The UN must be brought in, and there must be a cease-fire, followed by negotiations and a political solution."
"Mr President, I should like to use these two minutes to talk about an issue linked exclusively to the crisis in Kosovo: the humanitarian crisis suffered by hundreds of refugees in the area today."
"Firstly, I should like to express my gratitude to the Commission, to Mrs Bonino, to the NGOs and to the humanitarian aid associations, and I would like to acknowledge the important work they are doing."
"But at the same time, I ask myself one question: how long will the European Union continue to see this type of situation as an emergency, as something that has just happened without us knowing why, as if there had been an earthquake?"
"Nothing was more predictable than the humanitarian crisis in the Balkans, yet we continue to act and react as if a hurricane had lashed the area or as if an earthquake had destroyed the heart of one of our countries."
"I believe that this is a very serious problem"
"Yesterday, the House held a debate on new reports on justice and home affairs; one of them involved the integration of refugees and another related to the strategic paper on the European Union's migration and asylum policy."
"I remember past debates, much older debates, on a Commission proposal for a joint action concerning the temporary protection of displaced persons."
"It dates back to 1997 and was presented by Mrs Gradin."
"It was not adopted and this instrument is not available to us, an instrument that would today allow us to deal with this situation in a very different way."
"Why have we not ratified the Amsterdam Treaty?"
"We have a very solid argument to put to our people: ladies and gentlemen, we do not have a legal instrument and we do not have the budgetary instruments we need to handle this situation because the Amsterdam Treaty will not be adopted until May."
"I hope that this will make us think, I hope that these measures will be implemented and I hope that the next time we realise that we will have to face a situation such as this, we will be in better shape to deal with it than we are now."
"Mr President, like everyone else I am very concerned about the media reports today in particular that General Mladic and various other people have now been given free rein to impose further terror on Kosovo."
"For many years these people have moved freely in Bosnia, despite the presence of SFOR troops and have remained free, despite the serious allegations made against them."
"What must also concern us is the escalation of the conflict beyond Kosovo and into Albania."
"The Serbs must stop their incursions into Albania now."
"I was particularly struck by the sincerity of the presentation made to us by the German presidency, and indeed by Commissioner van den Broek."
"I welcome the three-phase peace plan proposed here."
"The involvement of the United Nations in the conflict would be a welcome step forward."
"I look forward to further details of this plan and hope that it can form the basis for meaningful negotiations."
"We are all very concerned by media reports coming from Kosovo, especially of rape being used as a weapon of war."
"It is a despicable repeat of the most heinous crimes committed during previous conflicts this decade in Yugoslavia."
"President Milosevic has a ten-year record of terror and manipulation."
"He has shown repeatedly that he can play on ethnic fears and has presided over an expansionary regime based on terror."
"The solution to this horrific 20-day bombing campaign will obviously involve negotiation."
"We cannot ignore the reports of great human rights abuses."
"We want peace - yes, but not at any cost."
"I will give the rest of my time to silence, as indeed did my colleague beside me."
"Mr President, the appalling treatment meted out to the Albanian population of Kosovo must be totally denounced and implacably opposed, but withdrawal of the peace monitors and the launching of the NATO bombing offensive was not the way to do this."
"Bombing has not stopped the killing, but increased it."
"It has not put an end to the catastrophic humanitarian situation, but intensified it."
"It has not advanced a political solution, but retarded it."
"It has consolidated Serb opinion behind Milosevic and weakened the opposition."
"The idea that NATO bombing was justified outside the United Nations because two permanent members of the Security Council would have blocked it is a body blow to the UN and a most dangerous precedent."
"The bombing needs to be stopped."
"The proposals put forward for a settlement on the basis of the United Nations Security Council resolutions including a United Nations peacekeeping force with Russians should be wholeheartedly supported."
"Above all, an immediate cease-fire is required, to concentrate on the terrible plight of those displaced and their return home."
"Mr President, the abiding images of the systematic ethnic cleansing in Kosovo are yet more sad proof of the fact that we are living in the bloodiest century in world history."
"During the peace talks in Rambouillet on the outskirts of Paris, it gradually became absolutely clear that the people representing Yugoslavia's President Milosevic at the negotiating table were only there for show."
"At the same time they were able, under cover of the peace talks, to continue with the cleansing of the Kosovar Albanians."
"The cleansing continued during the negotiations in Rambouillet."
"At that time 60 000 Kosovar Albanians were in flight, and over the past year several hundred thousand have already been forced to flee."
"NATO therefore answered Milosevic by employing the means that we had said would be used if the talks did not produce a result, namely military force."
"Milosevic was not unaware that this could be the consequence."
"He simply did not believe that the West would use the means that we are now using to tell him that talks have taken place - and plenty of talks have taken place, but Milosevic would not negotiate."
"Now he should negotiate, but the bombing will continue until he comes to the negotiating table."
"Mr President, the example of Bosnia has shown that there is no peace- keeping without peace enforcement."
"This is a simple fact of life."
"This means, in concrete terms, that we must have military personnel, guns, artillery and other equipment in Kosovo - and for a long time - as in Bosnia."
"No SFOR military personnel have been killed in Bosnia in combat, only in traffic accidents: the threat of using arms has been sufficient."
"The whole concept of peace-keeping has to be changed and reformulated."
"This is the lesson learnt from an operation that was ill-conceived from the beginning but which eventually will end in giving Kosovo freedom under the threat of arms."
"No other action is possible in these sad circumstances."
"Mr President, in this most serious of debates about the war in Kosovo, I thank you for having exceptionally allowed me to speak out in favour of one single refugee, resident in my constituency in Essex, who fears he will be forced to return home to the midst of the conflict."
"This man has legal immigration status in Britain but has helped himself by attaining a job, one which itself involves foreign travel in other EU States."
"Yet the delays in issuing the necessary visas from the Member State embassies in London currently threaten his employment on which, in turn, his immigration status depends."
"When the whole of Europe is turning its eyes to the hundreds of thousands of refugees on the borders of Kosovo, it may seem strange to raise this one case."
"But our humanitarian concern must extend to each and every individual refugee as long as their safety is threatened, wherever they may be."
"Given that my parliamentary question is referred to this debate, will Mrs Bonino in her reply, and the representative from the Council taking note, commit themselves to investigate this individual case and the anomalies in European immigration procedures between Member States which threaten his status."
"Do not send this man back to a war or to possible death."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that this debate has shown that with the exception of one political group, this House is unanimous in condemning the method of mass deportation used - and not just recently either - by Milosevic."
"I also feel that views have differed slightly about what should be done."
"We all want peace, except perhaps Milosevic."
"And this is something we should keep in mind: if there is anyone who has pursued an ultra-nationalistic plan for ten years, which history shows to be a losing battle but which is bloody and cruel and has cost the lives of millions of Croats and Bosnians, that person is Milosevic, who has pursued, caused and used war for ten years."
"So, we want peace but he does not, and it is important to say so."
"The problem is how to force this man to accept a solution, a reasonable solution, after ten years have gone by."
"I believe that after ten years the use of force was the only option."
"And I say this as a person who believes in non-violence as well as in my capacity as a Member of the Commission."
"But there is more to it than that."
"For ten years now - I repeat, ten years - there have been negotiations with Milosevic, plus conferences, counter-conferences, partial agreements and full agreements, but they have never led anywhere; each agreement has just prepared us for the next massacre."
"I believe that we are seeing a sort of collective amnesia in our countries."
"Is it possible that names such as Osiev, Vukovar, Srebrenica, Bihac or Sarajevo no longer mean anything to anyone?"
"Applause"
"Could it be that all this never happened?"
"Or that we have forgotten all about it?"
"Am I mistaken or were you not the very people who wanted to face up to the disgrace of Sarajevo, saying, 'Never again should we witness the cowardice and shameful behaviour which allowed the events of Sarajevo to happen'?"
"For once, ladies and gentlemen, what is at stake is not oil, or diamonds, or even territorial conquests, for once what is at stake is the right of an entire people to live in their homes, in peace and dignity, and for once when force is used we discover all of a sudden that this is not acceptable."
"What is the point?"
"Yet another Rambouillet?"
"This is the question I think we should ask, and above all the answer that should be given."
"I hope that we can end up with a serious conference, a situation in which commitments entered into will not just be taken seriously but be verified and verifiable as well."
"I do not want us to fall into the umpteenth trap of a half-way agreement, which might even prepare the ground for a massacre in Montenegro."
"Applause"
"There is one point I wish to stress during this debate, and that is that today we are witnessing the break-up and annihilation of Kosovo and of an entire people."
"And all this did not start on 24 March, ladies and gentlemen; back in August - perhaps we were all on holiday, or had our minds on other things at the time - there were already 400 000 displaced persons in Kosovo, forced to wander across the mountains. It was these people who were then being kept inside the country and whom in the last few weeks Milosevic has fired off like human bombs at Albania and Macedonia."
"I would also like to stress that, even from a humanitarian angle, there is no aid organisation with the remit, the resources and sufficient preparation to deal with a human bomb of 500 000 people in a few days."
"I should like particularly to emphasise that the Commission may have resigned, it may be corrupt or whatever else you care to say about it, but perhaps you should try to understand the unusual institutional situation in which we have had to work, and I think we have nonetheless faced up to this situation and done what it was in our power to do."
"Let me repeat that at present there is no aid agency which could deal with 500 000 people in just a few days."
"There are two further concerns of a humanitarian nature that I should like to voice."
"First of all, what in happening inside Kosovo, where the Kosovar population is without assistance, without protection and without witnesses either?"
"The second concern relates to Montenegro."
"If a hundred thousand deportees are forced into Montenegro, this will clearly lead to disastrous instability there as well."
"Could I very briefly mention three points on the humanitarian front."
"In the first place, this crisis shows us that in complex situations such as Hurricane Mitch in Central America it is sometimes impossible for aid workers to cope without the assistance of military structures."
"Of course, it would have been more appropriate to use the WEU."
"Fair enough, but for the moment it seems to me that the WEU is more of a virtual organisation than anything else, so I understand why Mrs Ogata wrote to NATO asking for technical resources at least to help with transport and setting up the camps and so on. We should bear this point in mind because, as in the case of Hurricane Mitch, in this situation there are times when it is absolutely vital to use military structures for civilian purposes, even if just for logistical reasons."
"Secondly, my colleague Mr van den Broek has already spoken of the need to give support to the countries receiving this enormous influx of refugees."
"We will of course ask Mrs Gradin to monitor the individual case that was mentioned."
"Finally, could I make one last exhortation: I do hope that all the efforts to show solidarity, including activities involving the general public, are made in a disciplined and coordinated way."
"There is a risk of bottlenecks developing and of the limited port and airport facilities getting clogged up."
"Furthermore, it is better to purchase supplies on the spot, hence money is better than food parcels."
"This is a very important message which we hope you will pass on."
"Lastly, I would like to thank the Member States, starting with Italy which reacted swiftly and immediately, but not forgetting the other Member States which are making absolutely tremendous efforts to help."
"As you know, the part of the budget containing the available reserves amounts to EUR 150 million; bilateral cooperation and donations from Member States now amount to EUR 170 million."
"We should make sure that these sums are used in a coordinated and complementary manner."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I hope above all else that this institution is able to stand firm, to withstand the test of time and to get across a sense of leadership to the public, so that a distinction is made between the attackers and the attacked, the aggressors and the innocent victims, including Serbs."
"I would like to point out that humanitarian assistance is also being provided to the Serbs, via the Red Cross; there is no discrimination as far as we are concerned."
"I trust that together we will be able to face this tough and complex battle, fought so that national sovereignty should not mean ownership and so that the rights of the individual may be advanced."
"Mr President, we have heard that depleted uranium weapons munitions are being used in the conflict."
"Depleted uranium is radioactive and highly toxic. Of course, it knows no frontiers when the wind decides to blow."
"Could we have a report from the Commission rather urgently, as well as from the Council of Ministers, of an investigation into whether or not we are using depleted uranium bombs."
"At the end of the day there is no time limit on the contamination of the environment."
"Thank you, Mrs Bonino."
"I have received eight motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Second bi-annual BSE follow-up report"
"The next item is the report (A4-0083/99) by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions 'Second bi-annual BSE follow-up report' (COM(98)0598 - C4-0686/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are talking about BSE, three letters which in the past, before the European Parliament reappraised the matter, stood for a bizarre mixture of mismanagement, misjudgement and sloppiness both in the Commission and in several Member States."
"In the light of new and disturbing figures in some Member States, we could almost regard this as a never-ending story."
"But let us not panic!"
"Many of the problems we have still not dealt with today are in fact a burden from the past, from the time before 1996."
"With all that we are discussing today, we must not forget that we have achieved a great deal in recent years thanks to the work done in the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and in the Follow-up Committee, in that a large number of the European Parliament's recommendations put forward by the Committee of Inquiry into BSE were implemented."
"I firmly believe that the course we embarked on jointly with the Commission and its departments was successful."
"On the one hand, it restored confidence in the ability of the European institutions to cooperate internally; on the other hand, it gave the European consumer new confidence in the European institutions' ability to act."
"In this connection I would like to give warm thanks to the Commissioner, Mrs Bonino, as also to Mr Reichenbach, Director-General, and to the Deputy Director-General from DG VI, Mr Heine, for what they managed to achieve, building on a situation that had arisen as a result of past mistakes."
"I believe they have all made a major contribution to creating new confidence in this area of European activity."
"In the final analysis we have achieved positive results for the future and improved the quality of preventive consumer protection, over and above the BSE issue."
"We now have a new quality to the case-law of the European Court of Justice."
"I believe that the restructuring of the Commission services, the new legislative initiatives and also the discussion concerning the transparency of the scientific debate are important measures that need to be put into effect in future not only in the European Union but also at international level."
"I am thinking here of the hormone or BST debate."
"One of our headaches remains that some Member States are not always willing and able to transpose Community law."
"Further-reaching initiatives are needed here from the next intergovernmental conference, to ensure that if Member States delay and infringe the Treaties the Commission can take more rapid action, can initiate infringement proceedings more rapidly and can also impose sanctions more rapidly where there is a danger of this happening."
"That is of the utmost importance!"
"Let me also say a few final words in regard to the discussion about the tests. I believe that the current evaluation of the tests under discussion today is such that as things stand at present they can offer no absolute guarantee of the certain presence or absence of BSE."
"So we must take a considered approach here too and must not be tempted to overreact."
"In short I believe we have pointed the way to firmly establishing preventive consumer protection in the European Union."
"The Commission has done its homework very well."
"Let us all take the BSE crisis as a warning for the future!"
"Thank you, Mr Böge."
"Mr President, we have been discussing this subject here in Parliament for roughly two and a half years."
"We are now nearing the completion of the work."
"Of course some questions and problems remain unresolved, but I do not want to go into that in my statement today at the close of the debate."
"I think it is important to ask what lessons should be drawn from the BSE crisis and what lessons should be drawn for the European Union's future policy."
"How can we prevent this kind of thing from ever happening again?"
"I would be interested to know: can this kind of disaster happen again, yes or no?"
"That is what we really need to know today."
"Has our perception - by which I mean the perception of Parliament, of this Commission and of a new Commission - and has the style of our policy now changed radically in relation to what they were three, five or even 15 years ago?"
"Of course absolute transparency is important here."
"For instance, scientific advice, scientific checks, tests, inspections and controls must be carried out and accepted as a matter of course, even if the results may be inconvenient."
"It is also important, as Mr Böge just said, to make preventive consumer protection and the precautionary principle the first principle in all other policy areas."
"That may often be inconvenient, as indeed it was in the past."
"It may be inconvenient for agricultural policy."
"It may also be inconvenient for economic policy or foreign trade; it creates an enormous disturbance in these policy areas!"
"But only if the Commission and the European Parliament uphold and opt for the precautionary principle in cases of doubt will we prevent something like BSE from happening again."
"In relation to the negotiations with the World Trade Organisation that logically means giving precedence to the precautionary principle over the smooth running of world trade."
"We will very soon be facing the acid test here, with the question of whether we will in future allow growth hormones in meat from the United States in the European Union."
"Will the Commission go on taking a tough line here, be hard as nails?"
"It remains to be seen!"
"During the work on BSE Mrs Bonino took a very steadfast and positive approach."
"We appreciated that, and Mr Böge has just acknowledged it too."
"For me as also for my group, the criterion for a new Commission must be whether consumer protection and preventive health protection are given precedence over the smooth running of trade policy."
"I am convinced that only then can we give a vote of confidence to a new Commission for only then can we hope never to experience another disaster like BSE."
"We will find out in the next few months whether that will be the case."
"We will see what names are put forward for the new Commission and what approach the president-designate of the Commission takes."
"In his statement to the European Parliament yesterday Mr Prodi never once used the words consumer protection, precautionary principle or anything of that kind."
"We hope they are on his mind if not on his lips!"
"But we do not know."
"We will find out in the future."
"But I am convinced that we ourselves here in the European Parliament would all be making a mistake if we supported him or a new Commission that did not say very plainly whether in a situation where there is reason for doubt it will decide in favour of trade or in favour of agriculture."
"We too must carry out our tasks, which is why we have always questioned the Commission."
"Our task in future will be carefully to examine and question this new Commission which - whoever its members are - will not yet be in office."
"We must ask it how it will decide in a given situation."
"If we are being serious here, we must only give this Commission a vote of confidence if the answers are satisfactory."
"Then perhaps we will have some slight hope that preventive consumer protection will really play an important part in the Commission's discussions, to ensure that nothing like BSE ever happens again."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the joint rapporteurs, commend this report and incidentally say that I believe it is a justification for the contact committee which we maintained for a period of time, as well as the two main committees which endorse what has been said by the rapporteurs."
"BSE was a tragedy for Britain and also for Europe."
"It remains so."
"After suffering as we have, in our country, we are alarmed to see the disease still rampant in some other European countries."
"We have had 2.5 million cattle slaughtered in Britain; we have had to submit about 2 000 pages of documentation on how the disease has been combated, although not yet eradicated, in our country."
"We live daily with the problem of the victims of new variant CJD, to which the rapporteurs refer."
"And yet we now have a situation in which, as they say, 13 Member States are facing infringement procedures by the Commission."
"This is a scandalous state of affairs."
"It is incumbent upon Parliament to make certain that the safety precautions which we have been forced to take are now common practice throughout the European Union as a whole."
"Parliament needs to be backing the Commission in putting pressure on the Council in this regard."
"The attitude of the Council over the last two years has not been satisfactory."
"Danger for one is danger for all."
"Safety for all depends on danger for none."
"When we look at the situation in Europe at the moment it is simply not satisfactory."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt said that the precautionary principle has to be the right approach."
"I agree."
"The precautionary principle is no frivolous luxury; it is an absolute necessity."
"Parliament should say so, loud and clear, to the Council of Ministers."
"Mr President, this report is a continuation of Parliament's attempt to implement its recommendations in the wake of BSE."
"Our work also involves monitoring the situation that is unfolding in the European Union as a result of public health protection policy."
"We recognise, of course, that a certain amount of progress has been made in implementing measures to restructure and staff the Commission services, and to separate the legislative work from the operation of the advisory, scientific and supervisory committees and services."
"In this way, the independence of the scientific committees has been strengthened, a better assessment of the facts has been achieved, and the transparency of the work on BSE has been maximised."
"Many Member States have been slow to carry out checks and inspections, and we believe that these checks must be stepped up."
"At the same time, cooperation and the exchange of information between the Commission and the Member States must be strengthened."
"It is absolutely crucial that a legislative framework be set up to control animal feed and to combat epizootic diseases. We also need a more rational analysis of the use of antibiotics and growth promoters in animal feedingstuffs."
"We must point out that there has been considerable delay in terms of the incorporation of Community provisions into the Member States' legislation. Moreover, in addition to specific responsibilities and acts of negligence, this matter of epizootics has revealed institutional gaps in the functioning of the European institutions, particularly the fact that Parliament cannot have complete control."
"This is why we are asking for the codecision procedure to be introduced throughout the entire agricultural policy."
"Through the Amsterdam Treaty, animal and plant health measures have already been put in place, and we are asking for them to be extended to the agricultural policy as a whole."
"Mr President, I believe that health is one of the greatest gifts of human life. Protecting the health of the European public is one of the highest priorities of the European Union, and it must therefore play a vital role in the development of Europe."
"I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, for the excellent work they have done."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank the two rapporteurs, who have produced a well-balanced report which provides an excellent description of the situation. They say that 'it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good', and this also applies here, because BSE was in fact the reason why we had the clear-out in the Commission."
"BSE was the reason why we managed to expose some major shortcomings within the Commission and became aware that the Commission was not fulfilling its obligations."
"I feel that we have achieved remarkable results, and I would like to thank the Commission for having followed the committee's recommendations."
"The allocation of responsibility within the Commission was not satisfactory, but it has improved."
"We have also succeeded in reaching a consensus about the need to keep the Scientific Committee separate from other bodies."
"This, I feel, is extremely important."
"We have succeeded in making the Scientific Committee more independent, even of parliamentary control."
"A scientific committee must be detached, so that the scientists are not exposed to political pressure when they are asked to deliver opinions."
"It is extremely important that the scientific basis should be in order, so that the right decisions can be reached."
"Finally, I would like to say that BSE is, fortunately, on the way out."
"We are fairly clear about when it will disappear completely."
"There will continue to be a few cases."
"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is also on the way out, I believe."
"So what can we learn from all this?"
"The steps that have been taken appear to be effective, and I therefore believe that we can avoid getting into such a situation again."
"We now have an apparatus which works."
"We can, in my opinion, be reasonably satisfied."
"We cannot give consumers a 100 per cent guarantee."
"But we are now better equipped to deal with such problems than we have been in the past."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you know, the BSE situation in Portugal has resulted in a decision to block exports of Portuguese beef."
"Factors that have contributed to this decision include irresponsible behaviour in the more distant past and, more recently, incompetence on the part of people in positions of responsibility."
"Nevertheless, the European Parliament must agree to political proposals that will help to resolve the situation in each and every Member State."
"We are therefore tabling an amendment calling for still closer cooperation between the Portuguese Government and the Commission, which will make it possible to eradicate the disease and lift the embargo within the timetable envisaged."
"To this end, we have also tabled a further amendment calling for the creation of mechanisms to limit the damage suffered by Portuguese producers."
"BSE must be wiped out and the European Parliament and the public throughout the European Union must be armed with all the facts."
"This is exactly what a third amendment we have drafted aims to achieve."
"I would like to compliment Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt on their work and to express the hope that all these amendments can be accepted. The report will then be more politically balanced and fair."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the draftsmen of this report as well as the Commission and in particular Commissioner Bonino for the excellent cooperation we have managed to establish in this area, since thanks to Parliament's action and the constructive rather than destructive response to it we have identified the problem and tried over the years to resolve it in the best possible way."
"We have separated out the sectors and made major progress."
"Today we acknowledge - and we are right to make a point of this - that the action the Commission is taking has not yet managed to overcome the resistance of the Member States."
"The fact that 13 out of 15 countries are not fully implementing the recommendations which they should implement goes to show that we need to carry on working with the Commission to achieve this objective, so that respecting and safeguarding consumers really does become Union policy."
"Mr President, if we consider the negligence of some people, this was a difficult task, as the eradication that everyone wanted is far from being achieved in certain Member States, and consumers and breeders are concerned, even if they do not say so explicitly."
"For this reason I wish to congratulate my colleagues Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mr Böge on the quality of their recommendation and to explain to them the content of the main amendments that I have tabled."
"With regard to paragraph 24, we think that it is important that we specify that the precautionary principle should also be applied to dealing with carcasses, animals and health-related seizures in abattoirs."
"The European Parliament needs to make a statement on this point in order to guarantee health and safety, both for cattle and also, in short, for the consumer."
"Concerning paragraph 26 on the Green Paper 'The General Principles of Food Law in the European Union', this problem needs to be dealt with on a general level, particularly by taking an interest in other fields such as animal and human food and also plant protection."
"All decisions should be made on the basis of scientific evidence, but also following risk assessment, at Community level."
"The principle of health and safety for the European consumer is a general one and is not restricted to particular sectors. We should not forget this."
"Finally, with regard to paragraph 29 on the use of antibiotics in meat production, it is true that this can lead to increased resistance to antibiotics in consumers."
"Resistance to antibiotics is not solely linked to their use in meat production."
"We welcome the withdrawal of authorisation for four antibiotics as animal feed additives, but I hope that in order to effectively protect public health, additional measures will be taken in the light of the results of the studies."
"Mr President, I too want to join in the thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt, and to Mrs Bonino and her staff."
"Thanks to the work of the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and the restructuring and changes made by the Commission, we have now anticipated what will soon enter into force under the Treaty of Amsterdam, namely preventive health and consumer protection. That is a very important foundation on which to build sustainable development of the Union."
"I believe that we must continue to follow up the question of the precautionary principle which we have now anchored in our legislation and that we will also have to incorporate the principles of transparency and of separation of powers, which we now have in the Union, in international treaties and agreements too. In that way we can achieve preventive health and consumer protection not only for the people in our Union but also in relation to products from other countries that end up in the Union."
"I think Parliament must call on the Commission to show this same transparency in the preparations for the negotiations on these international treaties."
"So we need more information: what is the nature of these preparations, who is making them, what are the ultimate objectives, how can they be achieved or have they already been realised?"
"There is a further point I find most regrettable. As rapporteur for the Green Paper on the future of food legislation I had also expected a stronger thrust in that direction."
"I hope we will still manage to achieve modern food legislation prior to enlargement of the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today I want to give very special thanks to Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for their truly thorough work in the Committee of Inquiry into BSE and afterwards too."
"The BSE scandal plunged the entire European Union into a deep crisis."
"It was demonstrated to us quite plainly that even for the people of today, there are limits that have to be respected."
"Nature has its laws and it is only within that framework that we can and may proceed if we want to make progress for the benefit of mankind."
"Unfortunately we have still not come to the end of the crisis into which that irresponsible behaviour plunged us, and it will probably take decades before we know its true scale."
"Today I will not fail to express my respect for the Commission under President Jacques Santer for having the courage and the staying-power to uncover, in the face of resistance in the Member States, the scandalous abuses whose origins after all reach back to the mid-1980s."
"Even though the scandal has long since been exposed and has now almost disappeared from the media, I would nevertheless point out that we must not forget the BSE tragedy."
"So it will be most important to ensure that the next Commission constantly presents its activities before Parliament."
"Especially when public health is at issue, we must not take any risks."
"As elected representatives it is our duty to stand up for the people."
"Let me say very frankly, Commissioner, that I am deeply disturbed because I believe that we can still not gauge today how many new cases of BSE and also of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease we will encounter in the coming years."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs."
"From the beginning of the BSE crisis they have both been extremely constructive in the way they have brought forward their reports and in their analysis of the problem."
"BSE, unfortunately, is still with us and we must recognise this."
"We must also recognise that grave damage has been done to consumer confidence and that must be restored."
"We are well on the way to doing so but we must continue to work at it."
"Throughout the whole Union we must face up to the reality that if we had been feeding our animals in the right and proper way the BSE crisis would never have occurred in the first place."
"In my own constituency of Northern Ireland we have now imposed extremely strict controls."
"These are expensive and have had to be paid for by the hard-pressed beef farmers in my constituency and, to be perfectly honest, they question some of these controls."
"However, at the end of the day, they are prepared to live with them because they know they are restoring confidence."
"While we have strict controls within the European Union, these controls do not apply to the food that is entering the European Union from other countries whether from the United States or anywhere else."
"Until we tackle that problem and meet it head on, I have to say to the Commissioner that the farmers of Europe will not have confidence in the European Union to meet the challenge that is facing us now."
"It is the next challenge we have to face up to and we must do it."
"An inspection is taking place in the United Kingdom at the moment and I hope it will result in a data-based scheme."
"In winding up, Mr Böge said that we had been given a warning for the future."
"Let all of us in this House today remember what we have come through in the last few years with regard to BSE and let us take his warning on board and act on it."
"Mr President, the debate here in Parliament on the BSE crisis, which is still troubling Europe, has been a good example of how Parliament has been unquestionably capable of tackling an issue that is worrying the citizens of Europe."
"The rapporteur deserves thanks for a lively report, as has been mentioned several times."
"As soon as Parliament became aware of the crisis, a temporary committee of enquiry was set up, and as a result of its findings, the Commission was obliged to thoroughly re-examine Community policy on food production with reference to food safety and consumer protection."
"It is important that the European Parliament continues to take an active part in monitoring the effects of decisions taken, as well as ensuring that Member States are implementing them correctly."
"I believe, however, we should distinguish between those Member States in which there is no apparent risk with regard to the disease, and those in which there is."
"Measures in countries in which there is no risk should be less drastic than in those countries where the risk exists."
"Mr President, in its agricultural policy, the European Union emphasises the importance of environmentally friendly production methods and better quality of produce."
"The Agenda 2000 package, however, does not give sufficient weight to environmental considerations."
"The BSE crisis, cases of swine fever, and resistant strains of salmonella indicate all too alarmingly that the basis for a Union agricultural policy is breaking up."
"We have to pay far more attention to matters of agricultural production and food production."
"Consumers must have greater certainty that products are safe."
"We cannot afford to be arrogant here."
"There is still precious little scientific knowledge about BSE."
"Research into its long-term effects has been arduous and slow."
"We cannot jump to hasty conclusions one way or the other."
"Mad cow disease was in the headlines about five years ago."
"One wonders whether more could have been achieved in the area of research at that time."
"Have the resources set aside for the control of BSE been used in the best possible way?"
"Ignorance as to what causes BSE and its effects on humans is costing the EU dear."
"Overall, the BSE crisis has cost the Union many billions of euros."
"It is still not clear what action it is wise and necessary to take, and the extent to which that action should be targeted."
"We must be able to impose different measures in different countries relating to high risk items such as cattle and sheep brains and meat on the bone."
"The BSE crisis has not yet been beaten, and we need to ensure there is consumer confidence in European agricultural produce."
"The Commission has implemented many of the recommendations made with regard to BSE in order to promote consumer health and protection."
"The present situation is hardly satisfactory, however."
"Too many new cases have once again emerged this spring."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as I am speaking on this issue probably for the last time during the term of this Parliament, I shall not hide from you that I have a vague feeling of disquiet."
"I feel almost as if I am abandoning a child who has not yet fully recovered from an illness in the middle of the street and wondering who will take care of him from now on."
"Will the next Parliament, as I very much hope, contain two real heavyweights like Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt to replace the two of them?"
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt is not here, but I trust the term 'heavyweight' does not offend her."
"They are two heavyweights who have stood firm even when the issue in question was no longer quite so topical and it would have been easier to let it drop rather than carry on attending countless meetings."
"I am wondering about this because even though the two committees, the Committee of Inquiry and the Follow-up Committee, have provided answers to many of the queries we raised, there are still further questions which remain."
"For example, I wonder who will from now on bring the required pressure to bear on researchers and on the world of science, which still has to provide many answers to our queries."
"Furthermore, will controls and inspections continue in the United Kingdom, both on the epidemiological front and in the ports where some not entirely healthy foodstuffs may still be found?"
"Even though the guide for consumers has been corrected and revised in the latest edition, I am wondering whether it will be adequate to help the target readership to understand what they should be doing."
"I would like to put one further question to the House and to the spectres who will fill it during the next parliamentary term."
"Who will still protect the consumers?"
"Will others be as resolute as ourselves in defending their rights?"
"The families affected by new variant Creutzfeld-Jacob's disease have received some compensation, but we should not forget the dire prediction of one professor, who said, 'Take care, the incubation period lasts for 15 years!'"
"So we should not let the matter drop in this respect either."
"Finally, the second bi-annual report states that almost everything has been done."
"Among the points missing is the follow-up to the Green Paper on food law."
"One more question, who will take the lead here?"
"I wish them the best of luck!"
"Mr President, I also thank the rapporteurs."
"I must declare an interest in this debate as I am a beef and sheep farmer in Scotland."
"As most of my income used to come from exporting live pedigree cattle, I have a financial interest in the lifting of the export ban on beef from the United Kingdom."
"As a farmer I have watched the devastation BSE has caused, not just to British farmers but also to all the ancillary industries, such as transport, auction marts, abattoirs and downstream industries."
"British agriculture is now experiencing a crisis in all sectors."
"While I welcome the report in that it gives us a chance to review the situation, there are a number of points I wish to comment on."
"Firstly, it is a great tragedy that BSE was treated as a British, and not a European, problem from the start."
"As tens of thousands of tonnes of contaminated feed were exported to mainland Europe, there was bound to be a European-wide problem."
"I am delighted the Commission is taking such a tough line on food safety throughout the beef industry in Europe as a whole, as this is the only way to protect public confidence."
"It is a pity that some nation states do not feel as strongly."
"Being closely involved in the industry, I can assure Members that a huge effort has been made to make British beef safe."
"While we still have a few cases of BSE in some herds - mostly dairy - due to consumption of contaminated feed, most beef herds have never had any cases - and that includes my own - yet we all suffer."
"The paperwork and record-keeping is now in place to give complete traceability from birth to the finished cut of meat in the shops."
"It is a huge burden of extra work for farmers, but well worth it to get the market opened up."
"The market and abattoirs are weighed down with inspectors at every level and the cost of inspections is now about 75 % of total costs to ensure that the rules are followed."
"The British ban on meat on the bone is stupid and unnecessary and should be lifted."
"However, I welcome this report."
"On behalf of the President, I would like to thank Mrs Roth-Behrendt for giving up her speaking time to allow us more time to finish the debate."
"Commissioner Bonino now has the floor."
"Mr President, I will give a very short and rather more political answer."
"First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, and then I would point out that this is sort of our last debate, the last debate for this Parliament and perhaps also for this Commission, and in a way I shall miss it."
"I shall miss it because above and beyond what we have achieved together - and the report sets this out clearly - I believe we have developed a working method (although this has not been easy for you, I imagine, nor for me either, I am sure you will grant me that) which makes each side's responsibility clear, thereby avoiding institutional confusion and seeking cooperation despite our differences."
"Leaving aside specific points, I think this is the most important thing that we have learned together."
"And I believe that the future Parliament and the future Commission should safeguard this method they have inherited in relations between the two institutions, with regard both to transparency and to scientific excellence."
"Some dossiers - apart from BSE where problems remain to be resolved as Mr Santini and Mr Imbeni pointed out - deal with complex subjects such as hormones for example, which Mrs Roth-Behrendt mentioned, or genetically modified products: in short, on the food safety front there are complex dossiers for whoever comes along."
"The last point I should like to stress is the precautionary principle."
"I believe that first and foremost it is important to get this established at European level and then to promote it later at international level."
"We hope to get a consensus on 19 April for the precautionary principle to be included in the procedural manual for the Codex Alimentarius."
"If we succeed I think this will not just be an important milestone for the Union but will help in asserting this principle at international level."
"This is the legacy, one might say, that you are leaving for the future Parliament and that we are leaving for the future Commission."
"I do sincerely hope that whatever specific problems there may be, this working method becomes a shared resource."
"Perhaps just for once I may do something I never do and thank the Commission departments and my own office which, with you, have shown great patience and also, I believe, considerable tenacity."
"Many thanks, Mrs Bonino."
"I would also like to say, on behalf of the President, that we have always followed what you have said at the rostrum with great interest."
"We would like to reciprocate your kind words about the European Parliament and to offer you our best wishes in your personal political career and to wish you every happiness in the future."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is questions to the Council (B4-0157/99)."
"Let me welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verheugen, and I should also like to point out from the start that Mr Verheugen has to leave the House at 6.50 p.m. to make his journey back."
"It would therefore be a good idea if we were to focus our questions so that we can ask as many as possible and so that Mr Verheugen can answer them."
"In any event, we have already agreed that at the next part-session there will be ten extra minutes to make up for the ten minutes we shall miss today because he has to leave at 6.50 p.m. for reasons outside his control."
"I have now informed the House of this fact."
"Question No 1 by Patricia McKenna (H-0222/99)"
"Subject: European central banking and monetary system Can the Council indicate how it is proposed that new 'Euro' currency will be regularly issued after the Member State currencies are replaced, and whether it will be by 'Euro' bond issues to the commercial banks only, in effect incurring new debt in the system, or as free issue 'Euro' currency, incurring no debt, or some combination of both, especially as a major declared intent of the system and associated convergence criteria and Stability Pact is debt reduction?"
"Can the Council inform Parliament as to which EU Member State central banks are fully privately owned, which ones are partly so, and which are fully publicly owned?"
"Can it say if it regards it as proper that either party or fully privately owned central banks should be constituent parts of the European System of Central Banks, and even part owners of the European Central Bank, both established by the European Union Treaties, giving private financial interests some measure of control over the European monetary system, something potentially not conducive to the declared aim of monetary stability?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs McKenna's question."
"Mr President, according to the recommendations of the Madrid European Council in December 1995, as from 1 January 1999 the participant states issue new, negotiable public debts in euros."
"At the same time they convert the major part of their outstanding public debts into euros, pursuant to Council Regulation No 974/98 of 3 May 1998."
"During the transitional period from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001, private issuers can convert outstanding bonds into euros in accordance with that Council regulation."
"They can issue new bonds in euros."
"At the end of the transitional period, all new bonds issued by public and private issuers will be issued in euros or in foreign currencies."
"All outstanding debts issued in national currencies that then no longer exist can only be serviced and paid in euros from the year 2002."
"Pursuant to Council Decision 317/98 of 3 May 1998, the central bank legislations of those Member States participating in European monetary union must comply with the EU Treaty provisions and ensure that the central banks of those Member States that take part in European monetary union are totally independent."
"When we talk about the whole question of issuing currency without debt, the argument that has been given is basically that it causes inflation."
"Commercial banks multiply the money supply issued by at least 10 to 15 times, and this is the reason that states get into debt, i.e. so that banks can make these huge profits."
"Considering that this whole project was supposed to ensure a reduction or elimination of debt, I do not think that is going to do it - do you agree?"
"I have a supplementary question."
"As you know, I come from Sweden."
"The Council is probably aware of the current debate as to whether we should join the single currency."
"I frequently find myself at all kinds of meetings where this issue is discussed."
"One question keeps on coming up - and it is one I cannot answer."
"Perhaps you can assist."
"There is always someone who wants to know what happens if a country wishes to abandon the single currency."
"If a feeling develops that the social and economic impact is proving negative, is there any legal possibility of leaving the single currency and reinstating a country's national currency and central bank?"
"Mr Sjöstedt, that is an interesting question."
"I will answer it in political rather than legal terms."
"What you suggest in your question is not possible."
"There is no provision for it in the Treaty."
"Anyone who has joined the common currency cannot get out."
"Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos (H-0224/99)"
"Subject: Implementation of the Philoxenia programme Parliament, the Commission and the Economic and Social Committee have already approved the adoption of the multiannual programme to promote European tourism entitled 'Philoxenia'."
"Given the importance of tourism for job creation and the dissemination of European culture and in view of the fact that the Council of Ministers for Tourism is constantly deferring adoption of the programme, will the Council say when the final adoption of the programme can be expected?"
"Can it assure Parliament and the Commission that it will be possible to implement the programme as soon as possible and will it say whether there are any problems within the Council in connection with its final adoption?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Alavanos's question."
"Unfortunately I have to tell you that this subject has been discussed on a number of occasions within the Council and that unfortunately the fundamental differences of opinion could not be resolved, although the Austrian Presidency went to great trouble to do so."
"Some delegations expressed reservations even though the presidency had proposed reducing the programme's long-term budget."
"Regrettably, I cannot even foresee at this moment whether or when the Council can adopt the Commission proposal."
"The President-in-Office has disappointed me with his answer, since he said in his reply that he could not think when the debate on the report would take place. I would like to ask him the following questions."
"Firstly, is there still a possibility that this endorsement will be given during the German Presidency?"
"Secondly, with regard to the topical issue of tourism, has the Council considered the impact the Yugoslavian crisis in Kosovo will have on tourism in many regions of the Balkans, possibly including Northern Greece, if this crisis is not resolved soon?"
"Has the Council considered the possibility of introducing measures to support the tourist industry?"
"Mr Alavanos, I understand your disappointment, but all the presidency can tell you is what the Member States are prepared to do and in this case the situation is that a number of Member States have very fundamental reservations about this programme to promote European tourism; they do not want it at all."
"There are other Member States which do not want it in this form."
"No consensus is emerging on this issue in the Council, which is why I am very sorry indeed to have to tell you that I do not see the slightest chance of this matter being concluded during the German Presidency, at least not with a positive outcome."
"Question No 3 by Nikitas Kaklamanis (H-0227/99)"
"Subject: Statements by Ecevit following the arrest of Öcalan The Turkish Prime Minister, Mr B. Ecevit (who in 1974 gave the order to attack the Republic of Cyprus, a UN Member State currently applying for membership of the EU) announced to Turkish and foreign journalists immediately after the arrest of the PKK leader, Abdullah Öcalan, that Turkey would not accept advice from any European country in connection with the trial of Öcalan."
"What is the EU Presidency's position on this statement by the Prime Minister of a country which continues to ban the Kurdish Democratic Party from taking part in elections and is responsible for unprecedented crimes against the peoples living on its territory?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Kaklamanis's question."
"Mr Kaklamanis, in its statement of 22 February this year, the European Union took note of the Turkish Government's assurance that Abdullah Öcalan would be given a fair trial."
"The European Union expects that to mean fair and correct treatment and also a public and constitutional trial before an independent court, access to the legal adviser of his choice and admission of international observers to the trial."
"The European Union once again emphasises its firm rejection of the death penalty."
"At the same time the European Union reaffirms its condemnation of all forms of terrorism."
"The legitimate fight against terrorism must be conducted on a basis of full respect for human rights, the rule of law and democratic standards."
"Regarding the exclusion of the Kurdish Democratic Party from the elections, I am sure the honourable Member is aware that on 8 March 1999 the Turkish Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the public prosecutor's application for a temporary injunction to ban this party from participating."
"Mr President-in-Office, this morning I heard Chancellor Schröder say that NATO's attacks were being carried out in the name of human rights and on behalf of the Albanian minority in Yugoslavia. You cannot allow human rights to be served up on an ad hoc basis or 'à la carte '."
"Yesterday, the Turkish newspapers wrote that international observers have not been allowed, and will not be allowed, to attend the trial of Mr Öcalan. I would therefore like you to answer the following questions."
"If this is in fact the case, what will the Council do in relation to Turkey, which is linked by an association agreement with the European Union? Secondly, I am surprised that you are not aware that there is a more recent decision which forbids the ADEP Party from taking part in the elections, thereby depriving 20 million Kurds of their human right to express themselves politically in the elections."
"Mr Kaklamanis, the Council is employing every political and diplomatic means to make it clear to the Turkish Government what European human rights standards mean and that it expects Turkey to observe European human rights standards in every individual case and in every situation."
"I would like to put a couple of questions to the President-in-Office."
"Firstly, with the experience both he and Parliament have, does he seriously believe that the current regime in Turkey will hold a fair trial based on the principles of the rule of law?"
"If so, on what does he base this confidence?"
"Secondly, why does he immediately 'latch on' to the terrorist issue, regardless of whether this exists or not?"
"Perhaps this is a way out for Turkey, a pretext for Turkey to treat Mr Öcalan as it wishes, or whoever else it arrests?"
"Is he setting himself up as the counsel for the defence of the Turkish authorities and providing it with just such an alibi?"
"Mr Kaklamanis, it is not a question of what I believe."
"Nor is it a question of what the Council believes the Turkish Government will do. It is a question of us using our powers of influence to attain our common goal, in this case a fair and constitutional trial."
"I have already told you that we are using these powers of influence, almost on a daily basis."
"Question No 4 by Maj Theorin (H-0228/99)"
"Subject: Western Sahara Like other colonised nations, the people of Western Sahara are entitled to self-determination and independence, but Morocco, which for nearly 24 years has occupied Western Sahara in breach of the UN Charter and international law, stands in the way."
"It has hampered, delayed and blocked the UN peace plan."
"Nevertheless, the EU is giving Morocco substantial economic aid."
"How does the Council reconcile EU aid to Morocco with the latter's occupation of Western Sahara?"
"How does the Council intend to further the implementation of the UN peace plan?"
"I give the floor to the President-in-Office to answer Mrs Theorin's question."
"Mrs Theorin, the Council is already closely involved in the United Nations' ongoing activities relating to the referendum on self-determination for the region of Western Sahara in the years 1999 and 2000."
"Developments have been followed closely by the Member States and through the activities in the United Nations."
"In the framework of the common foreign and security policy, the initiatives of the UN Secretary-General have been considered repeatedly and on a regular basis, in particular in the CFSP working group responsible."
"On 29 December 1998 the presidency made a statement on behalf of the European Union, unreservedly supporting the United Nations' efforts to find a fair and lasting solution."
"That is why the European Union noted with great interest the following decisions by the Moroccan Government."
"Firstly, it decided to formalise the status of the UNHCR in the region concerned."
"That should now make it possible to resume the pre-registration activities in the Tindouf camps."
"We hope discussions will now begin with the UNHCR on the draft protocol on the return of the refugees."
"Secondly, the agreement on the status of the MINURSO troops is to be signed."
"This decision will permit the orderly and prompt deployment of the forces needed to implement the planned solution while at the same time simplifying the everyday implementation of MINURSO operations."
"From the European Union's point of view there is therefore no reason to reconsider the EU aid to Morocco because of developments in Western Sahara."
"Thank you very much for that answer."
"Negotiations between the UN and Morocco actually began yesterday, I believe."
"It would be interesting to hear whether the Council has any information on what has been happening on that front."
"The fundamental point to bear in mind is the length of time we have all been waiting for this referendum to get off the ground; the pressure on Morocco has been kept up for a long time now."
"Even though we are providing financial assistance, it would be interesting to hear whether the EU Council of Ministers is ready to lean on the Moroccan Government in an effort to prevent it from once again taking a decision on a referendum, only to postpone implementation."
"Around 160 000 people are living in various refugee camps, with almost as many soldiers to guard them."
"It therefore makes sense to ensure that this process is initiated in a right and proper way."
"I am keen to hear what the Council is willing to undertake."
"Mrs González Álvarez, you are certainly not being a nuisance."
"Believe me, I take this problem just as seriously as you do."
"But you now want to hold a political debate with me."
"I cannot hold a political debate with you because I can only present the Council's current position."
"I have already done so."
"Let me repeat: we agree on the objectives to be achieved, the operational implementation comes under the United Nations."
"The European Union is supporting these objectives by the means available to it and if developments show that the political instruments employed to date are inadequate, we will have to discuss other instruments."
"But at the moment the Council sees no need for this."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions Nos 5 to 8 will be taken together."
"Question No 5 by Francisca Bennasar Tous (H-0235/99)"
"Subject: Island regions in the new context of the Amsterdam Treaty Article 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty sets out the Community's aim of reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands, and Declaration 30 annexed to the said Treaty recognises that 'island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their island status, the permanence of which impairs their economic and social development'."
"Bearing in mind that the additional costs involved in transporting people, goods and energy constitute one of the basic reasons for which island regions are unable to compete on the single market on an equal footing, and that Article 154 (ex Article 129B) refers explicitly to the need to link island regions with the central regions of the Community, what specific measures does the Council intend to take in order to ensure that island regions are properly integrated into the internal market on an equal footing?"
"Question No 6 by Roy Perry (H-0241/99)"
"Subject: Interreg for islandsDoes the Council intend to support calls for a specific strand on inter-island cooperation being included in the Interreg programme as requested by Parliament amendments at first reading to the Varela Suanzes-Carpegna report on the European Regional Development Fund?"
"Question No 7 by Vincenzo Viola (H-0246/99)"
"Subject: Integrated programme for EU island regionsIn the light of Articles 154 and 158 of the EC Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam, and Declaration 30 annexed to the latter Treaty, Commission DG XVII has drawn up a communication on the use of renewable energy in the EU's island regions."
"At an earlier stage, DG XII commissioned a study on research and technological development in island regions, and DG XI drafted a code of practice for island waste management."
"To date, and in spite of the explicit call by the EP, the plans concerned have not found practical expression in an integrated programme to aid the EU's island regions, home to 14 million citizens of 12 Member States, to enable them to compete on equal terms with mainland regions, which do not start out with the same intrinsic geographical handicap."
"What measures will the Council take, not least in connection with Structural Fund reform and the Interreg Community initiative, with a view to giving effect to the provisions which it has itself laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam?"
"Question No 8 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (H-0260/99)"
"Subject: Measures in support of the island regions of the UnionArticle 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty states that one of the Union's commitments is to take measures to reduce the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands."
"Furthermore, Declaration No. 30 annexed to the Amsterdam Treaty recognises that the islands suffer from structural handicaps arising from their particular status as islands and calls on the Union to take account of those handicaps and, where necessary, to take specific measures in order to integrate those regions better into the internal market on fair conditions."
"Will the Council, therefore, say what preparatory measures it has taken to translate the provisions of Article 158 and Declaration No. 30 into practical projects and programmes once the Amsterdam Treaty has entered into force?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer these four questions."
"Let me tell the honourable Members that the Council is aware of the particular problems facing the islands and has always attached special importance to political strategies to promote the integration of the islands into the common market."
"One of the main aims of the reform of the Structural and Cohesion Funds in the framework of Agenda 2000 is to concentrate aid on the particularly needy and the poorest regions."
"In this regard the Council recognises that the task of regional policy is to develop all the existing potential in order to make up for structural imbalances and backwardness and to speed up economic and social change in the disadvantaged regions, including the islands."
"So we will continue to support the island regions in the next aid programme period too."
"Negotiations are currently still underway with the European Parliament on the exact formulation of the regulation on the European Regional Fund, which is especially important here, in the framework of the informal conciliation and legislative procedure."
"I have just come from a conciliation procedure on the subject and can describe the situation as it evolved just three-quarters of an hour ago."
"It looks as though agreement could be reached relatively quickly between Parliament and the Council on the outstanding questions."
"Let me also point out that the Commission recently stated that special attention must also be given to including the island regions in the measures under the Interreg C Community initiative."
"Without prejudice to the further procedure, I think that too seems useful."
"This is the first time that we have been able to discuss island regions with the Council."
"Article 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty, which forms the basis of the cohesion policy, was wrongly translated in some of the Union's official languages."
"The only logical meaning of this article, thanks to the addenda introduced by the Amsterdam Council, is to consider all island regions of the Union as least favoured regions due to their geographical handicap, which is the reason for additional costs in the transport or energy sectors, for example."
"However, the Council has interpreted this article restrictively in its regulation on the ERDF by talking of least favoured islands."
"This definition is unclear."
"Is it based on criteria linked to economics, geography and remoteness?"
"And, first and foremost, I should like to say that it is an erroneous definition as it is at odds with Declaration 30 that is annexed to the Treaty and also goes against common sense itself."
"Why should a reference to least favoured islands have been included in the Amsterdam Treaty when, in fact, they were already included among the least favoured regions in the former article?"
"Would it perhaps be because the Council wishes to add a new category of regions, namely all the island regions, to the least-favoured regions of the European Union?"
"In the new regulations for the Structural Funds, why does the Council now not wish to adopt the position it held in Amsterdam in defence of the island regions?"
"Mrs Bennasar Tous, the Council firmly rejects your interpretation of the Amsterdam Treaty."
"It takes a different view, and it will adhere to that view."
"Its policy is that the criterion of need must of course be applied in evaluating whether island regions are eligible for aid."
"I should like to press the President-in-Office on that point."
"The Commission guidelines for Interreg definitely state that particular attention needs to be paid to ultra-peripheral and insular regions."
"I represent the Isle of Wight, off the south coast of England, undoubtedly a border region, and it has a GDP of 64 % of the European average."
"Can I go back to the Isle of Wight and tell the people that the new Interreg proposals will help islands like theirs?"
"Mr Perry, I am grateful for that information and will pass it on to the Commission."
"It is not my job nor is it the Council's job to decide what regions of Europe receive aid under what criteria."
"That is up to the Commission."
"But let me point out to you that a region that attains less than 75 % of the average level of prosperity in Europe is eligible for aid from the Structural Funds, indeed under Objective 1."
"Please discuss that with the Commission as it is not in the Council's remit."
"Mr President-in-Office, we were discussing this a short while ago in private, but now we must say the same, or similar, things in public."
"As you are not an islander, I feel I must point out that islands are not just places for holidays, with sunshine and the sea."
"They are regions which, especially in winter, face special problems of isolation."
"This is a constant disadvantage for islands and affects them in many ways."
"The point I want to make is that there are many Members in this Parliament who are concerned about these issues. You previously heard the debate in the advisory committee where I expressed the views of the European Parliament."
"Particular attention must be paid to islands, and what was decided in Amsterdam must be translated into practical action."
"Interreg is the first opportunity we have had to promote the interests of ultra-peripheral and insular regions, and we would therefore like a commitment on the part of the Council."
"Mr President, I would like to finish by asking the President-in-Office if a specific strategy for islands is being prepared in the Council."
"I imagine that the answer will be a negative one but I hope that something will be done in the future."
"Mr Hatzidakis, what the Berlin Council decided in relation to Agenda 2000 applies."
"Agenda 2000 takes account - excellently, in my view - of the interests and needs of the island regions."
"Indeed, at the moment we are jointly involved in transposing the Berlin decisions into regulations and it is the Council's view that this takes full account of the needs arising for the island regions."
"Mr President-in-Office, my question refers to a special type of island, that is, those included amongst the outermost regions covered by paragraph 2 of Article 299 of the new Amsterdam Treaty, which have been granted special status."
"However, it is a question that Mr Verheugen will probably not even have to consult his notes to answer as I believe that he was present at the evening session of the Berlin European Council."
"In Agenda 2000, the Commission of the European Communities stated that these outermost regions were to remain exempt from the condition that the per capita GDP must be less than 75 % of the Community average to warrant Objective 1 status."
"On the same night, the President of the Spanish Government confirmed that this objective had been achieved, but then, on checking the text, we see that this is not the case."
"I would like to know if the President-in-Office remembers what agreement was actually reached that night and what the situation of the outermost regions is following the agreement by the Berlin European Council, in other words, if they are included as Objective 1 regions."
"Mr Medina Ortega, you overestimate my powers of recall."
"I do not want to tell you anything that is untrue."
"I will have to take a look at the Berlin Protocol, for I have no recollection at all of the discussion to which you have just referred."
"All I can tell you is that what I said also applies to the ultra-peripheral regions, as these are all islands of course."
"If they fulfil the criterion of need, they will receive aid."
"Question No 9 by Roberto Speciale (H-0236/99)"
"Subject: Trade in human beings in Sudan Recent reports in an Italian national daily newspaper have highlighted the existence of trade in human beings in Sudan, especially in the south of the country, including minors from the Dinka and Nuba tribes in particular."
"Is the Council aware of this situation?"
"If so, has it contacted the Sudanese authorities to verify these reports and express the European Union's total opposition to such practices?"
"What reprisals mights the European Community take in order to end this trade (beginning with the suspension of all aid and cooperation programmes)?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Speciale's question."
"Mr President, the Council is aware that abductions, cases of slavery, slave trading and other serious human rights violations of the kind take place in Sudan."
"As early as 14 April 1998, the European Council made a statement on the human rights situation in Sudan, pointing out that serious human rights violations are still being committed there."
"The EU calls for unconditional respect for human rights in all parts of Sudan and urges that human rights observers be stationed in Sudan."
"Moreover, the EU calls for international observers to be given unrestricted access to regions in which abductions, cases of slavery, slave trading or similar human rights violations are reported."
"The European Union submitted a draft resolution to the 55th Human Rights Commission in Geneva which specifically refers to the problem of slavery."
"The EU will continue in future to raise human rights questions with the Sudanese Government with the aim of changing the Sudanese Government's attitude to slavery too."
"The European Union has already suspended its economic cooperation with Sudan, with the exception of humanitarian aid."
"The suspension of humanitarian aid would only harm the civilian population and is therefore not being considered as a possible means of exerting pressure on the Sudanese Government."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Verheugen for his reply, with which I am satisfied. I am very glad that the Council is aware of the situation and wants to intervene."
"I hope that there will be definite results and a change of attitude on the part of Sudan's government, but I do of course understand that this is not in our hands, though to some extent it may depend on our determination."
"I know that peace negotiations on the internal situation in Sudan should be getting under way in Nairobi in the next few days, and I am wondering, Mr President- in-Office, if this issue could not be raised at these negotiations as well, so that Sudan feels the pressure brought to bear by the international community."
"In any case I would like to thank you for your answer."
"Mr Speciale, I note that we agree entirely on the political objective."
"As to your specific question whether human rights issues can be included in the discussions due to begin in Nairobi, I cannot answer it off the cuff."
"Please understand that first I will have to find out about the substance of these negotiations, and then I will be happy to give you a written answer."
"Question No 10 by Jonas Sjöstedt (H-0238/99)"
"Subject: Amsterdam Treaty In the Council's estimation, when will it be possible for the Amsterdam Treaty to enter into force?"
"What are the remaining obstacles?"
"In what way will the association of Norway and Iceland with the Schengen agreement be affected by the Amsterdam Treaty?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Sjöstedt's question."
"The final instrument of ratification was deposited on 30 March 1999 and the Amsterdam Treaty will therefore enter into force on 1 May 1999 pursuant to Article 14."
"Pursuant to Article 6 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway shall be associated with the implementation of the Schengen acquis and its further development on the basis of the agreement signed in Luxembourg on 19 December 1996."
"Appropriate procedures shall be agreed to that effect in an agreement to be concluded with Norway and Sweden by the Council, acting by the unanimity of the 13 members mentioned in Article 1 of the Schengen Protocol."
"Together with the Commission, the Presidency-in-Office of the Council conducted negotiations with Norway and Iceland on the basis of the guidelines adopted by the Council."
"The Council was informed of the outcome of the negotiations; the association agreement is to be concluded as soon as possible after the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force."
"Subject to checking the matter, because of course there is no way I can have this information, let me tell you that the work is far from completion."
"The problem is that, as you perhaps know, one Member State has strong reservations on principle about this whole question. We are currently making very serious efforts to persuade this Member State to withdraw its reservations."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office. As you know, this morning Chancellor Schröder announced a new intergovernmental conference, which is to end again next year."
"I just want to ask whether this intergovernmental conference is to be given a mandate even before the Amsterdam Treaty enters into force and which specific parts of the Amsterdam Treaty will be renegotiable there."
"No, the mandate will be given at the meeting in Cologne in the first week of June and no parts of the Amsterdam Treaty are open to renegotiation. One of the topics that will be discussed there is the famous left-overs of Amsterdam, but this is only one of the subjects, as others are also on the agenda."
"I simply have a question on the agreement due to be reached with Norway and Iceland in the run-up to Schengen's incorporation into the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Will Parliament be consulted on this agreement?"
"The rules of the Amsterdam Treaty apply here."
"Question No 11 by Peter Truscott (H-0242/99)"
"Subject: The situation in Jammu and Kashmir Can the Council comment on future prospects for peace in Jammu and Kashmir?"
"Does the Council have any plans to offer its good offices to act as an intermediary between India and Pakistan to help resolve the Jammu and Kashmir issue?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to reply to Mr Truscott."
"For some time now the European Union has been concerned about the tense situation in Kashmir, which is a threat to peace and stability in the region."
"For this reason it is observing developments there with particular attention."
"The EU takes the view that the dialogue between India and Pakistan is the key to resolving the Kashmir conflict that is so seriously affecting relations between the two countries."
"The Union has therefore repeatedly appealed to both parties to do their utmost to seek a negotiated settlement of all outstanding issues between the two countries, and in particular the Jammu and Kashmir issues."
"The summit meeting that was recently held in Lahore between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan gives reason to hope that both sides are seriously endeavouring to establish good-neighbourly relations, which could also improve the prospects for peace in Jammu and Kashmir."
"The Council will be aware that on 11 April India test-fired a medium- range ballistic missile, the Agni 2, which has a range of 2, 000 km and is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead."
"In view of this serious development and the possibility of creating further instability in the region, will the Council redouble its diplomatic efforts to bring about a settlement in Jammu and Kashmir?"
"I can answer this question in the affirmative."
"The Council is extremely concerned about the arms build-up in the region and the question you have just addressed will be discussed in the Political Committee in the very near future."
"As the author is not present, Question No 12 lapses."
"Question No 13 by Ulla Sandbæk (H-0243/99)"
"Subject: The euro and Mr Joschka Fischer's remarks of 12 January 1999 The President of the Council told Parliament that the introduction of the euro entailed great opportunities and equally great risks."
"The risk would arise if this bold step were not followed up by the EU, as a logical consequence, with further equally bold steps towards complete integration."
"Will the President of the Council give details of the further steps towards integration he considers to be necessary, and why?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Sandbæk's question."
"The conclusions reached by the European Council in its meeting in Vienna in December 1998 emphasise, inter alia , that the euro will strengthen Europe's ability to promote employment, growth and stability and that the introduction of the single currency will increase the need for economic coordination."
"The European Council stressed in particular that economic policy coordination needs to be deepened and strengthened in order to ensure the success of economic and monetary union and to support sustainable, employment-promoting growth."
"It took the view that the existing economic challenges demand an effective and coordinated response that encompasses budgetary, monetary and structural policy."
"Finally, the European Council requested the ECOFIN Council to report to it in Helsinki on the functioning of economic policy coordination in the third stage of economic and monetary union."
"The basic principles of the economic policy of the Member States and the Community for 1998/99 underline in a similar manner that the Member States' economic policies, especially their financial and their monetary policy which now comes under the sole responsibility of the Community, together with the structural reforms, should be consistent with each other and mutually supportive. The aim here is to achieve low inflation, accompanied by sustainable and employment-promoting growth."
"You have explained that it is the financial policy and the monetary policy that must be coordinated, but can you specify the particular areas of economic policy in which it is planned to promote integration in connection with EMU?"
"The Council believes in the need for closer coordination in all macroeconomic fields, which means financial, budgetary and fiscal policy, together with economic policy in the narrower sense."
"I am sure the President-in-Office is correct in saying that a single currency requires the deepening of our economic cooperation."
"However, would he agree with me that the United States is clearly a single market and has a single currency but it has not found it necessary to harmonise taxes?"
"So, to make a success of the euro, it is not necessary to harmonise direct or indirect taxation."
"I take note of that and would point out that I did not refer to 'harmonisation' of taxes but to 'coordination'."
"Thank you for that semantic clarification, Mr Verheugen."
"Question No 14 by José Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra (H-0245/99)"
"Subject: Rio Summit Taking advantage of its institutional position, Parliament has been encouraging relations between the Union and the countries of Latin America."
"Bearing the above points in mind, what arrangements has the Council Presidency-in-Office made to enable Parliament to take part in the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State or Government of the European Union and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, due to be held in Rio de Janeiro in June of this year?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Salafranca's question."
"This question came up at the trilogue today."
"It is a question that is discussed at almost every trilogue between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, and the result is always the same."
"The decision on the possible participation of Members of the European Parliament in the Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, due to be held in Rio de Janeiro at the end of June 1999, will be guided by the procedure the Council decided on 30 October 1998."
"The Austrian Presidency explained this procedure to the European Parliament in the trilogue on 16 December 1998 and, as I said, it was also discussed at today's trilogue."
"This procedure dates back to the discussion of the question during the Strasbourg trilogue on 17 July 1998 between representatives of Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"Accordingly, the Council will examine the request addressed to it by the President of the European Parliament on 11 March 1999, in other words it will consider whether Members of the European Parliament can participate on an individual basis."
"Clearly, when I drew up this written question, I could not have known that it was to be discussed in this morning's tripartite dialogue."
"However, I should like to know if the German Presidency supports the idea of Parliament attending the summit since its feelings on the role Parliament should play in the process of European integration appear to differ from those expressed by Chancellor Schröder this morning. Parliament has already attended the Rio and San José Group Conferences and I should like to know if the Council believes that Parliament should have an active role, as is only natural."
"This is an important matter; we cannot be sure that no budget decisions that affect, or may affect, Parliament's responsibilities will be taken during the forthcoming summit."
"What does the presidency think? Would it support Parliament's active presence at the summit?"
"As I said, the question of the European Parliament's participation in the Rio Conference will be considered on the basis of the principles decided by the Council."
"The presidency cannot do otherwise; it has to adhere to the principles decided by the Council."
"It cannot give any undertakings beyond that."
"It does not have the power to do so."
"If anyone wants to go beyond that, then this question will have to be addressed during the process of institutional reform that is about to get underway."
"But let me say on behalf of the presidency that as a matter of principle we should be very careful not to confuse the different tasks, responsibilities and levels within the European Union."
"It must always remain clear which European Union institution is acting on the basis of which responsibility, so as to ensure the necessary transparency vis--vis the people."
"The Council is against anything that would tend to confuse or blur the different responsibilities."
"Question No 15 by Robin Teverson (H-0248/99)"
"Subject: Voting rights in Gibraltar The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that residents of Gibraltar must have the right to vote in the European elections."
"In order to bring this about, there will have to be a unanimous agreement in Council, and ratification by Member States, to amend the current law under which United Kingdom residents, but not Gibraltarians, have the right to vote in European elections."
"Given this ruling, what plans does the Council have to amend the Treaty to allow the people of Gibraltar to vote?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Teverson's question."
"This a very sensitive issue."
"The Council would be very pleased if both states finally managed to reach agreement on it."
"The Council has not yet considered the possible consequences of that ruling."
"It attaches the utmost importance to the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament and, in this respect, to the implementation of the principle of elections by direct universal suffrage laid down in Article 138 of the EC Treaty."
"Any change to the act introducing the election by direct universal suffrage of the Members of the European Parliament would mean that the Council had to decide the appropriate provisions unanimously, with the assent of the European Parliament, and recommend to the Member States that they adopt them in line with their constitutional rules."
"The Council would be most interested to hear the European Parliament's position on the subject."
"Mr President, I would not disagree at all that this is a sensitive issue."
"But it is also one of principle, not just of theoretical principle but of one that has been tested in the European Court of Human Rights, as my question points out."
"It was a judgment made, not by a small majority of judges in that body, but by a vote of 15 to 2, a very large majority, in favour of the principle that in terms of human rights, citizens of Gibraltar should be able to vote in European elections."
"So although I am disappointed that the President-in-Office of the Council looks for agreement between the two Member States, surely this is an area where the Council, out of concern for human rights and following the ruling of an institution not in the EU, but one which it respects and is included in part of the Amsterdam Treaty, should take positive steps?"
"Will the Council take those positive steps to correct this lack of human rights?"
"Mr Teverson, in view of the problems connected with all questions relating to Gibraltar, I am not in a position to give you the Council's position in response to supplementary questions."
"Each individual case and the subject of each supplementary question has to be discussed with the Member States."
"I will have to answer this question in writing."
"The same applies to any other supplementaries, because I am not authorised simply to express opinions here."
"I will have to answer any further questions in writing because they call for intensive consultations with the countries concerned."
"Mr President-in-Office, this is not the first time this question is being discussed here in the European Parliament either."
"It has often come up during Question Time."
"Questions of this kind have been put very often and I must tell you quite honestly that your reply, namely that you could not provide any further information in response to further supplementaries, is very unsatisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned."
"Let me perhaps point out the following and ask you to take it further or even to provide some information if possible."
"We must always look at Gibraltar in terms of two different legal systems, because after all we know that Gibraltar's existing borders do not correspond to its historical borders. That is to say, there is a part of Gibraltar that is undoubtedly part of Great Britain and another part, the northern part, which is, if you like, Spanish territory under British administration."
"So would it not be possible, for example, at least to grant the right to vote to those people who live in the Spanish territory that comes under British administration?"
"Surely at least that should be possible!"
"Mr Habsburg-Lothringen, this is the first time the question about this ruling has been raised and it is also the first time it has been considered."
"If you were asking whether you can draw my attention to a certain situation, then my answer is yes, you may."
"We are not going to give the problem of Gibraltar all the in-depth attention it deserves here and now. Gibraltar is a colony belonging to a Member State but is within the boundaries of another fellow Member State of the European Union."
"But I should like to ask a very specific question that does not refer to a philosophical idea but simply to whether or not the presidency considers the European Community to be a Community of law. Are the legal rules, in this case the Treaties, only seen as valid rules because we are forced to abide by them?"
"And if the Treaties state that progress on this subject must be on the basis of a unanimous decision, the Council will have to uphold the legal rules we have drawn up for ourselves and which the Council has set out in the Amsterdam Treaty."
"Does the Council believe that the legal rules in the Treaties are only valid because we must abide by them?"
"Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, you have raised such a major question of principle that I really must answer it."
"Of course the Council takes the view that the European Union is a community based on law and that it must adhere strictly to its own standards and values."
"As the author is not present, Question No 16 lapses."
"Question No 17 by Vassilis Ephremidis (H-0254/99)"
"Subject: Subject-matter of informal Council meeting of EU Internal Affairs Ministers According to journalist sources, immediately after the secret service abduction of Öcalan, an informal extraordinary meeting of EU Internal Affairs Ministers was held in unprecedented secrecy close to the German capital, with the participation of the Swiss Internal Affairs Minister, the aim of which was to coordinate action to break up the PKK's logistical set-up, to establish codes for cooperation and the reciprocal provision of information between the secret services and to 'combat' the Kurds' communications network in Europe, mainly through the MED-TV television channel and the newspaper 'Özgür Politika'."
"What were the reasons for convening this extraordinary informal meeting?"
"Why the secrecy, what were the conclusions and what decisions were taken?"
"What role is Europol to play and what other national, international or European enforcement agencies are involved in implementing those decisions?"
"Do those decisions concern Kurdish organisations only or other organisations and movements operating in EU Member States?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mr Ephremidis's question."
"Because of the incidents following the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan, the German Minister for the Interior convened a conference on 23 February 1999 in which the internal affairs ministers of several Member States of the European Union and of Switzerland as well as representatives from the Commission and the Council Secretariat took part."
"The purpose of that meeting, of which the media were informed, was to evaluate these incidents in the participating states."
"In particular, the exchange of information covered the nature of the rallies organised by the PKK and the number of people who took part in the demonstrations in the various countries."
"No decisions were taken, since this was not a meeting of the Council of the European Union."
"It was simply agreed to improve the exchange of information with a view to any future such incidents."
"Why all the secrecy?"
"Why was this meeting of the Ministers for the Interior kept secret?"
"Where is the transparency that is supposed to be pervading the European Union 'grazing'?"
"Why must this be hidden from the people of the European Union, from the people it wants to get close to?"
"Mr President, there is no answer to this."
"What did they decide? What did they discuss?"
"Were the discussions only about the PKK?"
"Did they put it on trial, did they pass sentence on it and did they place it under special supervision?"
"Or were the discussions about other organisations that are active within the European Union?"
"Are we perhaps at the beginning of, or already witnessing, the same measures that Hitler and the Gestapo implemented against the Communists, the Jews, followed by the Social Democrats and finally all Democrats?"
"Is the European Union perhaps being submerged by a wave of McCarthyism?"
"Is that why you are hiding all this from us, so that you can take decisions in secret, and so that you can outlaw demonstrations against the war and other demonstrations, just as the Belgian Government did in Brussels recently?"
"Mr President, I should like an answer."
"Perhaps the President-in-Office is once again demonstrating his powerlessness. If that is the case, we are extremely dissatisfied that a President-in-Office who is incapable of giving an answer is appearing before us."
"I must say that I am more than a little astonished at this statement - for it was not a question - by the honourable Member."
"It is the case in all Member States of the European Union and in all constitutional states that those responsible for internal security naturally do not hold sensitive talks, relating for instance to intelligence gathering, in public."
"There would be no point at all in this kind of meeting if the details were made public."
"I do not believe the situation is any different in any Member State of the European Union."
"But I am happy to respond to your call for transparency and mention at least one point that was discussed and where there is no particular need for confidentiality."
"It is that the conference expressed regret that Greece did not immediately inform its European Union partners when Öcalan was arrested by Kenyan security forces and taken to Turkey."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, indeed we know that the MED-TV channel and the newspaper Özgür Politika provide very in-depth information."
"And we know the subject matter."
"Does the Council in fact plan also to use these channels to provide information to the Kurds who live in our countries?"
"My second question is this: what means are currently being applied to integrate the Kurds in Europe?"
"Mr Rübig, I cannot see the connection between your question and the original question so I will have to answer your question in writing."
"Thank you very much, Mr Verheugen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this will be our last question."
"I have already informed you that, because of his travelling arrangements, Mr Verheugen has to leave us at 6.50 p.m."
"We have two minutes left."
"I therefore hope that we can deal with this question in these two minutes, with Mr Verheugen's customary brevity and Mrs Eriksson's help. Mrs Eriksson has taken this question over from Mr Seppänen, in accordance with the Rules."
"Question No 18 by Esko Seppänen, which has been taken over by Mrs Eriksson (H-0256/99)"
"Subject: EU Staff Regulations What is the Council's view on the question whether the same person may legally receive both a salary and a pension from an EU institution?"
"If this should prove to be illegal, what does the Council propose to do pursuant to Article 232 of the Treaty in the event of such a case arising?"
"I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Question No 18."
"Mr President, the Council is not aware of any such case of receiving two types of income, nor has the Commission presented any proposal to the Council with a view to changing the ban on cumulating benefits as laid down in the Staff Regulations."
"This is a matter Mr Seppänen has raised with the Council before."
"We are talking here about a senior figure in the Central Bank being allowed to retire on a hefty pension while still being paid a salary. From the point of view of ordinary Finns, the person in question would be in receipt of an unacceptably large amount of money."
"Hence our curiosity as to whether the intention is to go along with the situation and authorise such an exception to the rules in the case of this particular individual."
"Mrs Eriksson, I thought I knew what this was about; in a sense this subject is like an old acquaintance. May I point out that this question was dealt with in depth during a recent Question Time and that I answered in detail in relation to the particular case you have in mind."
"My assessment at that time of the situation and the legal position remains unchanged."
"Thank you, Mr Verheugen."
"Since we have now come to the end of the time set aside for questions to the Council, Questions Nos 19 to 44 will receive written answers."
"Our thanks again to Mr Verheugen for attending."
"That concludes questions to the Council."
"Mr Ephremidis has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr Ephremidis, let us see if we understand one another."
"We have reached the end of Question Time and I have said goodbye to Mr Verheugen. Now, as you have asked for the floor on a point of order, you must address the President, since it the President who deals with such matters."
"You have the floor for a point of order."
"As a send-off to the departing representative of the Council, I would like to say that he has committed an act of parliamentary cowardice. He has accused my country of being responsible for the capture of Mr Öcalan."
"He can discuss this issue in the Council with representatives of the Greek Government. However, he cannot come here and level such a despicable accusation."
"I repeat: it is an act of parliamentary and political cowardice, and I doubt whether Parliament can accept such heinous acts from representatives of the Council."
"That is why I asked you to let me speak, and not so that I could speak for a second time on the same issue."
"I am very well aware of the Rules of Procedure and I also learned from you just now that I cannot table a second supplementary question."
"Let the President-in-Office take up with the competent ministers the issue of Mr Öcalan and the role his country played in delivering him into the hands of the Turkish executioners."
"Thank you, Mr Ephremidis."
"Your words are on record and have therefore already been noted."
"Mr Papayannakis, is this on a point of order?"
"Well then, go ahead, let us have it!"
"Mr President, as you are aware, Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure makes provision for priority questions, which must be answered within three weeks."
"I know the Rule by heart and you know it better than I do."
"I am holding in my hands a written priority question which I tabled on 7 January 1999."
"It was tabled properly and in accordance with all the Rules, but I have not received an answer."
"I want to lodge a complaint. It is a question to the Council - naturally the Council, which is here, is not listening to us - but I should have received an answer."
"Who must I go to in order to get justice, as we say in Greece?"
"I would like an answer, Mr President, because if I do not get one I will also complain in writing to the President."
"Mr Papayannakis, if you have not received an answer, you should do what you have done and ask here in the House why your question was not answered."
"Following your request, I will immediately look into the reasons why you did not receive an answer within the time specified in the Rules."
"You have therefore taken the steps you need to take and asked the President in the House why your question was not answered. In turn, the President must give you an answer on what has happened to your question."
"Consequently, I should be grateful if you would remind me exactly which question it was, what it was about and the date on which it was submitted, so that I can investigate accordingly."
"Mr Rübig has the floor on a point of order."
"Mr President, I just want to warmly welcome to the European Parliament the Upper Austrian visitors from the union of private sector employees."
"Thank you for your understanding."
"You have done that, and it will be noted in the Minutes."
"The sitting was suspended at 6.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m."
"Functioning of institutions"
"The next item is the report (A4-0158/99) by Mr Herman, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, on improvements in the functioning of the institutions without modification of the Treaty."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last report I will be presenting to Parliament no doubt comes at a very unfortunate time of day, but at a very good time of the year."
"Why?"
"Because it was just yesterday that Mr Prodi who - on this point at least - seems to have the backing of just about everyone, said that the European institutions must be thoroughly reformed."
"Well, so that Mr Prodi will not be alone in proposing these reforms, we have decided to help him and to submit to him a few ideas and guidelines which, thanks to the broad consensus within our committee, we have been able to propose to you."
"It is not always necessary to amend the Treaties in order to improve the operation of the institutions."
"Experience shows that in the past we succeeded in perfecting and improving the operation of our institutions by means of institutional agreements or internal reforms."
"But as a rule each institution looks to its own affairs."
"We have rather broken this taboo by agreeing on this occasion to look at other institutions than our own."
"As we know, there is scope for Parliament to improve its operation too, and in fact it has a lot of work to do in this respect. However, in the light of recent developments we must look particularly closely at the workings of the Commission."
"Mr Bourlanges has already produced a report on the Council, adopted by the House not very long ago, which includes a series of suggestions designed to improve its functioning."
"So we will not come back to this, but will concern ourselves solely with the Commission and Parliament."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, there is nothing new about the malfunctionings which have recently come to light."
"Their causes are both long-standing and deep-rooted."
"In particular, anything to do with staff recruitment, promotion and motivation has been affected by a growing renationalisation and politicisation which have produced an adverse effect on the functioning of a civil service that must be impartial and neutral."
"This phenomenon is well-attested and has given rise to the present difficulties."
"As we know, the Commission was initially conceived primarily in order to set up a legislative framework with a view to achieving harmonisation and not to manage programmes."
"The Commission's culture, structure and tradition were therefore somewhat ill-suited to the tasks with which it was subsequently charged and for which it was not granted the necessary resources, either by the Council or - if I may say so - by Parliament."
"I also believe the Commission made the mistake of accepting these missions."
"This is one of the reasons for the malfunctionings."
"The other is of course the role of the cabinets, which has become important."
"The increasing role of the cabinets no doubt explains why, as the wise men confirmed, certain Commissioners - I am not saying all of them - lost control over their administrations."
"As regards the Commission's internal structure, the number of directorates-general has been increased in order to give employment to a growing number of Commissioners. If we continue in this direction, as the number of Commissioners is to increase from 20 to 30, we will again be creating the same number of directorates-general."
"This increase is not in the interests of internal coherence or homogeneous responsibilities and will produce disastrous results. We have already seen this with external relations, which are the responsibility of four directorates-general."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, our proposals are clearly rather more delicate, as they are competing with those of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure and require a consensus within this House, which is not always easy to obtain."
"But most of our proposals concern the Commission and take into account the diagnosis I have just offered, which I believe to be widely shared."
"Mr President, I am speaking here as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We limited ourselves to just one subject about which we feel very strongly, namely the agencies."
"I must first extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur for the way in which he also looked at these agencies in his report."
"They are a subject that is sometimes overlooked, but both the committees of experts dealing with them and the Committee on Budgets have often expressed their amazement at what goes on."
"What is happening with these agencies?"
"As the rapporteur says, they fulfil an important role."
"They are neatly shared out among the various states."
"As the rapporteur rightly says, there are no current Member States which do not have agencies and we are convinced that new agencies will be found for the new Member States."
"A second problem with the agencies is, I believe, that they are always able to obtain more staff than the Commission itself."
"What is the reason for this?"
"The Committee on Budgets, Parliament the Council and the Commission itself like to give the impression that the agencies are not taking on extra staff."
"But the host countries want their agencies to be rather more extensive than was initially planned, so they want them to have extra staff."
"This means that the agencies can take on certain tasks that the Commission is no longer able deal with."
"How can this be solved?"
"By as much uniformity as possible - not total uniformity, as we stated in our report and as the rapporteur accepted, but in any event enough uniformity to meet the same criteria."
"These agencies must be closely monitored because if present trends continue we will reach the point where more people paid by the Union are employed by the agencies than by the Commission itself."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur has sought to act on our report in this way."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, never before in the history of European integration have so many important decisions been made and so many dramatic events taken place in such a short time as since 1 January."
"They range from the successful launch of the single currency and the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the resignation of the Commission and the ongoing accession process for 10 countries."
"All this has now been overshadowed by the armed conflict in Kosovo, in which the European Union and its Member States are involved."
"Never before has the EU been faced with greater challenges to its capacity for action and enlargement."
"That is why the Herman report contains both criticisms of the Commission's structures and self-criticism of our own procedures."
"The most important points are these: within the Commission there need to be clear portfolios and Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners, similar to Ministers and Ministers of State in national governments."
"We need to strike a balance in this way between the principle of collective responsibility and the particular responsibilities of individual members of the Commission."
"After all, transparency is of paramount importance."
"The new Commission headed by Romano Prodi as its President will take a giant step towards European government, and it is vital that it should."
"Second, the European Parliament must concentrate on its prime tasks, which are legislation, legislation, and legislation again, together with the selection and scrutiny of the Commission and decision-making on the budget."
"It should be possible to present and explain all these activities to the public."
"Today, we are learning from our past mistakes and preparing ourselves for new activities."
"That is the yardstick the public will apply, and public opinion should be our own yardstick."
"At this point, because this is Mr Herman's last report, I would like to thank him on behalf of the Socialist Group for his twenty years of work, and in particular for his commitment, for his creativity and for everything he has achieved in the institutional field."
"The House is today considering the last report of - if I may take the liberty - a great European."
"We do not belong to the same political family, but we essentially have the same aims and the same principles, and I believe that we also have many of the same dreams."
"On behalf of my group, I would to express my esteem for Fernand Herman's life's work."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Mr Herman, I should first of all like to congratulate you on your excellent report and on the way you have been receptive to suggestions from your colleagues."
"Your experience as a rapporteur and your very remarkable contribution to the European Union's progress mean that this report will be an essential discussion document for the next Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"As Mr Schäfer has just pointed out, throughout your career you have indeed made a genuine contribution to the progress of the European Union."
"The ELDR Group's first amendment is designed to strengthen paragraph 32 of the text by allowing the European Parliament to exercise its supervisory role to the full."
"As a result - and this is perhaps one of the things on which we were not in agreement, Mr Herman - it would no longer be necessary to refer to committees of wise men, one of the members of which has in any case shown little wisdom by making political statements which are scarcely in keeping with his position."
"The second amendment, tabled in committee by Mr Corbett but not accepted by either the PSE or the PPE and subsequently rejected in committee, is designed to give the Commission President the power to replace a Commissioner when circumstances justify it."
"We believe this proposal to be in keeping with Declaration No 32, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that the President would be granted this responsibility in circumstances such as the present, thereby avoiding a great deal of trouble."
"For the rest, Mr Herman - and as you yourself pointed out - your conclusions are fortunately very much in line with what Mr Prodi said yesterday about his plans for the Commission when he talked about strengthening the role of the President, efficiency, transparency and individual and collective responsibility."
"I too would urge the European Parliament to take a long hard look at itself and to get down as soon as possible to the task of studying how it can become a more transparent organisation with, for example, fewer hegemonic pacts between the two major groups to the detriment of the openness we all advocate."
"Applause"
"Mr President, there is a wonderful saying in Dutch that the road to hell is paved with good intentions."
"I hope that this will be borne in mind by all those who believe the democratic deficit, the lack of supervision, the careless management and, last but not least, the rumoured profiteering at European level can be reduced by pumping in more powers and more resources."
"I believe the opposite must be the case."
"Experience teaches us that political administrations can only be effectively controlled and, more importantly, can only exercise effective self-control when they are as close as possible to the people."
"In my opinion this must be the first application of the principle of subsidiarity which everyone here supports, or at least pays lip service to."
"If we really want to improve the workings of the European Union and of all the European institutions we must apply the principle of subsidiarity in all areas both actively and consistently."
"In short, we can improve Europe through less Eurocratic powers and meddling, less Eurocratic red tape and less bureaucracy."
"That, at least in my opinion, is the basic way to cure institutions which are all, without exception - and it would be laughable for Parliament now to point the finger solely at the Commission - tainted with the image of being interfering, money guzzling and unproductive institutions, and I fear to a large extent justifiably so."
"The report we now have before us contains many interesting proposals, but is nevertheless a typical example of the most blind Eurofederalist thinking, since it is concerned solely with treating the symptoms."
"To end with another saying, the proposed measures amount to no more than putting sticking plaster over the wounds."
"Mr President, please allow me to first congratulate, if he is listening, my colleague and friend Mr Herman on all his work and, in particular, on what I believe to be a very important report, most of whose proposals I endorse."
"Mr President, this report demonstrates that it is possible, if the political will exists, and without modifying the existing Treaty, to reform the way the Commission functions so as to make it a genuine vehicle for political impetus in building Europe and an institution independent of governments and vested interests. We can also change the way the European Parliament operates so as to make it the centre of political life in the European Union, in its role as a body directly elected by the public."
"I believe that this is the general and positive thrust of all these proposals."
"However, I have some reservations about certain particular aspects."
"I believe it is necessary to identify real portfolios for Commissioners, but I cannot understand why they should be reduced just when the Commission's powers are being widened."
"Above all, I cannot accept the notion of creating two categories, that is senior and junior Commissioners on the model of full Ministers and Ministers of State, just when people are saying that the distribution of portfolios between Commissioners should not be a way of drawing a hierarchical distinction between small and large states. I am delighted that the rapporteur has accepted my proposal on that latter point, as this is an aspect I disagree with."
"On the other hand, I feel that Mr Herman, perhaps because he is Belgian, is too centralist, or rather that he wants to concentrate the departments in Brussels and seems to rather distrust the EU agencies."
"I take the opposite view and believe that the agencies, which should be rationalised, are an effective way of bringing the public and the European Union closer together."
"Lastly, let me say this: the European Parliament will only reform itself - and I am at liberty to say this because I am not standing for re-election either - if it does away with the absurd practice of voting in the plenary instead of discussing policy, which is what people expect from their elected representatives."
"It is my belief that Mr Herman's proposals go in the right direction, as long as our successors have the political will to put a stop to this paralysing rotation between the two main groups and are capable of holding a political debate, or in other words to give a voice to the citizens of the European Union."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to pay tribute to our colleague Fernand Herman, because this is the last report he will be presenting and it is one which reflects his commitment to European thinking and the European ideal."
"He has given the very best of himself to the European Union and I should like to expressly thank him for this."
"Mr President, the resolution on improving the functioning of the institutions without amending the Treaty is one of the building blocks which the European Parliament is putting into place in order to equip the European Union for the future."
"As has been said, it relates to the Commission, the agencies and Parliament itself."
"Both Mr Prodi, the candidate for Commission President, and the Council presidency will be able to put it to good use in preparing for the next intergovernmental conference which was announced this morning."
"I hope that the Commission's Secretariat-General and directors-general will act on the recommendations, but I am not so sure that this will be the case, as their decision not to reappoint Mr Van Buitenen to his former position makes us fear the worst."
"For its part, Parliament has responded to Mr Herman's requests by approving the changes to the rules on voting and amendments. It will also be deciding on reducing the number of committees during this part-session."
"If in future Parliament is more careful about assigning more and more tasks to the Commission, then it will be functioning in the spirit of Mr Herman's proposal, to whom I should like to once again pay tribute."
"Mr President, this brilliant report by Mr Herman has been drawn up with great rigour, clarity and courage; it responds to our aim to improve the functioning of the institutions."
"I believe that this report should form the foundation on which any subsequent work is based."
"The timetable ahead of us is unavoidable and it does not help the situation as the crisis in the Commission is still revealing serious problems and deficiencies requiring solutions."
"The new Treaty will enter into force in the next few weeks and the second report by the Group of Experts will not be completed for some months."
"Therefore, this report clearly cannot include every last detail of the improvements that will be required."
"But it has certainly tackled one issue: the serious problem facing the Commission in terms of the imbalance between, on the one hand, its responsibilities, its duties and the management of the programmes it is entrusted with, and on the other hand the resources it has available."
"This very serious problem had not been highlighted in any parliamentary report."
"But Mr Herman has tackled it very well and has put forward possible solutions."
"He may not have included all of the solutions required, but the ones he has mentioned will undoubtedly be necessary and they represent a very effective basis for the future."
"In my view, Mr Herman, the paragraphs relating to the need to simplify Parliament's voting procedures are extremely important."
"I hope that they will be taken into account for everyone's benefit."
"Thank you very much, and congratulations to Mr Herman."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I too have a minute this evening to tell our friend and colleague Fernand Herman, as is so often the case when he makes proposals about the European institutions, that I very largely agree with him and his ideas."
"We do indeed need more transparency, democracy and rigour for all our European institutions."
"For the Commission, first of all, about which a great deal is being said and a great many promises being made."
"All I will say is that I will wait until I see the merchandise before I pass judgement."
"But also for Parliament, which needs to concentrate more on getting to the heart of problems and stop trying to be all things to all men, which can sometimes look like pretend democracy."
"Finally and most importantly, we need transparency, democracy and rigour for the Council if one day it hopes to become a real government. But here I am perhaps straying beyond the Herman report and even the Bourlanges report and entering the realms of the future intergovernmental conference which I believe I heard announced this morning by the President-in-Office."
"If that is the case and it is confirmed, I very much welcome it."
"Once again, congratulations to Mr Herman, and our best wishes go with you."
"Mr President, may I for my part congratulate Mr Herman on behalf of the Commission on his detailed and very creative report on what has most certainly become a crucial problem, namely the functioning of the institutions."
"Evidently the Commission need not comment further on this report and indeed may not comment on it as this is the task of the new President of a new Commission who will undoubtedly be very pleased to draw on the wealth of experience on which it is based. I am referring here to the experience of Mr Herman, who I believe is bidding farewell to the European Parliament with this report and this political testament."
"May I take this opportunity to thank him very sincerely on behalf of the Commission for his exceptionally energetic and creative work, including in cooperation with the Commission."
"We have always been very pleased with the way we have been able to cooperate closely and constructively with him."
"I believe that, as a rule, it is always a good thing to keep a keen eye on the functioning of the institutions, and especially when there are changes to the Treaty, as is now the case with Amsterdam."
"In these exceptional circumstances, following the crisis which the institutions in general and the Commission in particular have experienced, it is of the utmost importance for the Commission's management function to be once again thoroughly scrutinised."
"I am speaking here from my own experience, but I am also very pleased to be able to refer to what this Commission - my colleagues and President Santer in particular - have set in train in order to improve that very area of the Commission's functioning."
"I should also like to express the hope that the reforms within the Commission will strengthen rather than change, let alone upset, the existing institutional balance."
"I also hope that in future the Commission will continue to be the driving force it has traditionally sought to be, particularly for promoting further integration within the European Union."
"Mr Herman will also approve when I take this opportunity today to wish the incoming president and his new team every success in reinvigorating the European Commission and restoring it to the sort of role that the people of the European Union also expect it to have."
"I would also add that even the present Commission clearly realises that the current crisis may also have its positive side in terms of strengthening the quality and substance of democracy in our institutions."
"So in this sense we can also accept the positive side to this crisis."
"I should like to end here, Mr President, as, I repeat, in the present exceptional political circumstances it is unrealistic for the Commission to comment on this report."
"But I can say to Mr Herman that I have read the report and recognise in it a great deal which we at the Commission have also been getting to grips with in recent years."
"I am convinced that the new Commission will benefit from many of these recommendations."
"Mr President, I really must take this opportunity to express my thanks for the tributes and compliments I have received."
"We in this House are the most fervent defenders of the Commission's role and it is because we want to defend this role that we are critical in some respects when it appears to stray from the right path."
"I should like to say to all my colleagues how much I have been moved by their expressions of esteem and appreciation for my report. I would also immediately add that the report is the result of a joint effort and does not just reflect my concerns alone."
"I have been fortunate, in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, in having many people who have supported me and made it possible for me to do this work."
"I should like now to return their expressions of thanks and say how deeply moved I have been by them."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr Herman, for the valuable report which you have presented to us which I am sure will be appreciated by all your colleagues."
"I would also like to say a word of thanks and appreciation to Commissioner van den Broek and express a personal view that if there were more people like him in the Commission we would have a far better Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Applications for EU membership"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0149/99 by Mr Donner, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the regular report from the Commission on Estonia's progress towards accession (COM(98)0705 - C4-0110/99); -A4-0154/99 by Mr von Habsburg, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the regular report from the Commission on Hungary's progress towards accession (COM(98)0700 - C4-0113/99); -A4-0151/99 by Mr Speciale, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the regular report from the Commission on Slovenia's progress towards accession (COM(98)0709 - C4-0112/99); -A4-0157/99 by Mr Carnero González, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the regular report from the Commission on the Czech Republic's progress towards accession (COM(98)0708 - C4-0111/99); -A4-0148/99 by Mrs Hoff, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the regular report from the Commission on Poland's progress towards accession (COM(98)0701 - C4-0109/99); -A4-0159/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the regular report from the Commission on Cyprus's progress towards accession (COM(98)0710 - C4-0108/99); -A4-0165/99 by Mrs Malone, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the report updating the Commission's opinion on Malta's application for membership (COM(99)0069 - C4-0163/99); -A4-0123/99 by Mrs Myller, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Candidate Countries in Central and Eastern Europe on Accession Strategies for Environment: Meeting the Challenge of Englargement with the Candidate Countries in Central and Eastern Europe (COM(98)0294 - C4-0380/98)."
"Mr President, as this is probably the last time that I will address Parliament, I will use my mother tongue, which is Swedish."
"Mr President, Estonia has progressed well along the road to membership."
"No precise date or even year can be established for accession, since several countries - among them Latvia and Lithuania - will most probably be included in the process this year. In practice, this will mean a new intergovernmental conference."
"My own guess is that we are looking at 2004 or 2005."
"The problem is that an unduly long negotiating process could have a negative impact on public opinion in the applicant countries, and hence in Estonia."
"The undoubted progress made by Estonia must not be allowed to obscure the lingering legacy, so difficult to overcome, of war and Soviet occupation."
"Sooner or later - sooner better than later - the country should be capable of solving its minority problems and creating a society where all people, regardless of the language they speak, subscribe loyally to the principles of democracy and the rule of law."
"Loyalty is not built on citizenship alone, but also on common values."
"The majority of foreign citizens and stateless individuals in Estonia were born there and, more likely than not, have no intention to leave."
"Despite legislative improvements, particularly with regard to children born in and after 1992, Estonia's political 'establishment' appears to be maintaining what in my view is a conservative stance on citizenship."
"But Estonia is destined to become - and to remain - a multicultural and multilingual society."
"Last year, foreign investment in Estonia reached higher levels, particularly in the banking sector."
"Nonetheless the balance of trade is still negative, although the economy in the capital, Tallinn, is largely based on tourists from Finland."
"Subsidised food imports from the EU have increased the difficulties faced by Estonian farmers."
"There is a very big economic gap between rich and poor, and between Tallinn and the provinces."
"Social transfers - to the unemployed, for example - are minimal."
"Once there are open borders and an open labour market, a number of Estonians will seek work in nearby EU countries."
"However, this whole process is necessary if there is to be any reduction in the gap between rich and poor people, and between rich and poor countries."
"Let me now comment briefly on the security problems faced by Estonia as a neighbour of Russia."
"People in my country, Finland, felt in 1995 that membership of the European Union would - by definition - tie us in to a community capable of providing and guaranteeing security."
"NATO's role and military capacity were not underestimated, but there was no express call for membership. Estonia has followed a different path in seeking also to join NATO."
"The country is in the grip of an illusion, in my view."
"Given the current situation in the Balkans, would Estonia or Finland - both sharing land borders with Russia - have gained from being members of NATO, a NATO which thus far has failed to come forward with any kind of convincing policy on the Kosovo tragedy?"
"As part of the EU debate on the Northern Dimension, it is perfectly feasible to devise a comprehensive and realistic programme encompassing the applicant Baltic countries, as well as parts of Russia, Scandinavia and the Arctic region."
"Apart from EU membership, the best guarantee for Estonia's future is peaceful cooperation with Russia. One day, Russia will perhaps overcome its enormous economic difficulties and appreciate that good neighbourly relations benefit all sides."
"Interpreted in this way, Estonia's considerable progress since it regained its freedom is to Russia's advantage too."
"And an enlarged Union, taking in the Baltic countries, will be a source of strength, as the German Presidency has understood."
"Mr President, again and again, discussions on enlargement involve references to all manner of things which quite simply do not reflect the real world."
"Over the last few years I have travelled a great deal around Central and Eastern Europe, virtually once a month."
"So I know that one thing is fundamentally important: progress can only be achieved if peace is guaranteed."
"In other words, guaranteed peace and political stability are essential for progress."
"Economic progress will then follow automatically."
"In these countries it is evident that priority has to be given to political affairs and to security, and only then can progress in other fields be tackled."
"This point is particularly important at a time when the countries lined up for enlargement are having to contend with a conflagration at their borders - the war in Kosovo."
"So we should always remember that in politics we must always be prepared for the worst."
"If it does not happen, we can offer up thanks."
"But at least we are prepared, whereas things are bound to go amiss if we are taken by surprise."
"So in these dangerous times enlargement is one of our best guarantees of peace, if not to say the only guarantee of peace which in the long run will give these peoples what they want."
"Above all, if you travel through these countries - and I do not think that Mr Donner will contradict me here - and if you learn to understand their peoples, you cannot fail to see that peace is their first priority."
"But peace cannot be achieved by simply praying for it; it requires decisions and a clear policy."
"Of course, people here have various reservations."
"For example, people sometimes tell us that the cost of enlargement is too high."
"The fact is that the only person who really understands the finances of the European Union, the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Friedmann, recently attended a meeting of our pan-European working party here in the European Parliament, and during his presentation he told us that the cost of enlargement is greatly overestimated, because no one ever takes account of the cost of non-enlargement."
"But that is enormous too."
"People also tell us - and there are enough demagogues around, including some present in this House - that millions of job-seekers would flood in after enlargement."
"These people have no experience."
"The advantage in being 85 years old - excuse me, 86 - is that you can say that you have seen everything and the opposite of everything!"
"I remember very well how much whingeing there was at the time Spain was granted membership."
"The Spanish were going to come pouring in."
"And then two years later someone said to me: 'For heaven's sake, what has happened to all our Spanish workers?'."
"We should never lose sight of this experience."
"An important point is that we should not tar everyone with the same brush."
"We have to judge each of these states according to its own particular characteristics and its own developments."
"It is also fair to assume that whoever takes the lead will carry the others along it its wake."
"But if we always set our sights according to the slowest, we will not make much progress."
"That applies to every country these days."
"As the rapporteur for Hungary, I shall take the liberty of saying that Hungary is one of the really important countries."
"It is the leading country today because it has always made progress on two fronts: first, the wonderful thing about the Hungarian Parliament is that when it comes to making a decision about the country itself, there are no party politicians - just patriots."
"They put on a united front."
"Second, they understand that when they are abroad they have to represent their country."
"They can squabble afterwards - and we can be grateful that in Hungary we have a language that no one else understands, so no one knows what is being said there anyway!"
"The same applies to the other countries on the list."
"I would particularly like to say something about the Baltic states in this context: it is wonderful that Estonia is to be granted membership, but we should not forget about Latvia and Lithuania in the process."
"They form a whole."
"I would especially like to stress that we should not forget that at the time of the Second World War, because of one country - Germany, of course - Europe abandoned these Baltic peoples to their fate."
"So we have a moral obligation to accept the Baltic states as soon as possible."
"The same also applies to the other applicant countries at the front of the pack, and it also applies to those straggling behind, who are vital for our security."
"I have in mind Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and last but not least Croatia, as Croatia is one of the countries that has developed most quickly."
"It is working the hardest, even though it receives practically no help at all from us, and so we must support it."
"All the peoples of Europe have a right to join Europe, even the Serbs, who we have talked so much about."
"I am firmly in favour of the Serbs being granted membership once they have got rid of Milosevic and have a democratic government."
"In any case, we should be acting in the interests of all these peoples for one good reason: European integration is the only concrete idea for achieving peace and prosperity."
"This has to be at the heart of our future policy."
"Therefore, Mr President, I have one last request: we need to make haste!"
"We should not delay because historic opportunities can pass by all too quickly."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I should like to talk about the subject of my report, which is Slovenia."
"Slovenia, as is well known, is a country with a sound economy and fulfils the political and democratic criteria laid down."
"Perhaps, out of all the countries which have asked to join, it is starting off on the best footing, even when its size is taken into account."
"The European Commission, however, has expressed a critical view of this first stage, considering that progress, particularly in transposing Community legislation, has been slower and more uncertain than it should have been."
"The Slovene authorities have accepted this critical assessment and have indicated that they intend to react positively to it."
"To this end, over the last few weeks, the government has submitted a national programme for the adoption of the acquis communautaire and a raft of very important legislation on VAT, excise duties and the right to purchase property."
"The entry into force of the Europe Agreement may now provide a solid basis for the ongoing negotiations."
"This new commitment on the part of the Slovene authorities requires continuity and momentum - I think this is the crucial factor - so that a more positive stage can begin and negotiations proceed more swiftly."
"There are of course many issues which are as yet unresolved, in this country as in the others, starting with changes to the administrative and judicial structures and the reforms required to put commitments into practice."
"The Commission and the European Parliament should encourage and assist Slovenia in its efforts in a spirit of friendship and therefore with a critical and attentive eye."
"This is the role we should play, rather than acting as lawyers."
"Although the vast majority of the political movements in Slovenia still claim to be in favour of joining the European Union, this does not always mean that any joint momentum is achieved: the people do not seem to be fully involved in working towards this aim, as is shown by the information campaign, which gives the impression - rather significantly, I feel - that it has just got off the ground and is a touch feeble."
"We were absolutely stunned when the head of the campaign told us that its aim was not actually to convince people that joining the European Union was basically a positive development for Slovenia."
"One does wonder in that case what aim the campaign is pursuing and what the point of it is."
"We should therefore not be surprised to see that in the opinion polls the percentage of those in favour of accession to the European Union is declining, though still a majority."
"In a situation like this, misgivings, distrust and isolationist tendencies may increase rather than diminish, and may also have a bearing on conflicts between parties and political representatives, creating a sense of detachment and a degree of insecurity."
"This situation has been reflected recently by a number of events which have led to a certain amount of concern even in the Slovenian press."
"In what I feel to be an anomalous and controversial legal case, the Constitutional Court decided to suspend local elections in the municipality of Koper, that is Capodistria."
"The mayor of the city appealed to the Court of Human Rights, thus highlighting a very sensitive issue."
"I only recently found out from the newspapers that for criticising this decision in the EU-Slovenia Joint Parliamentary Committee a sitting MP has been the subject of a procedure which is wholly incompatible with parliamentary and democratic traditions."
"In short, I am not voicing these concerns in order to stress them unduly."
"I think that these episodes are merely temporary aberrations which can be put right by the political forces and the authorities in Slovenia."
"I believe that Slovenia enjoys all the right conditions and has the capacity to do very well."
"I think that the positive facts continue to outweigh the negative ones, and it is precisely because of this that we should ask a lot of the government and the parliament."
"In Slovenia there are major political forces, a civil society, and human, cultural and economic resources which are more than sufficient to turn this country into an example for many."
"I have tried to do my job as your rapporteur with all this in mind and to this end the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy has been very useful to me, as have the amendments which were tabled."
"In conclusion, Mr President, although Slovenia is a small country, it occupies a very important and sensitive geographical position, between the north and south and the east and west of Europe."
"In cultural and political terms Slovenia can enrich the European Union and be enriched by it as well."
"If this is what it wants, it has to be determined about it."
"Throughout the region of the Balkans there is a need for stability, development and processes of integration which transcend national identity, and Slovenia can make a significant contribution here."
"I think that the next Parliament should continue to consider accession and enlargement of the European Union as priority objectives and if possible not just have evening debates on the subject."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that the people of the Czech Republic support their country's application for membership of the European Union almost unanimously."
"Indeed, despite the recent political and institutional changes in the Czech Republic, there has never been any discussion between the politicians there about this key objective."
"Moreover, the authorities in Prague have demonstrated great tenacity and conviction in their efforts to become a member of the Atlantic Alliance and this is further proof, if any were needed, of the country's political determination to form part of the different continental structures, whatever they may be."
"It is also extremely important to stress that the values that form the basis of the community of Europe have been clearly and perfectly assimilated by the Czech Republic."
"This community of Europe clearly does not only represent an economic process; it also hopes to become a political area where the interests of all the different people of Europe can develop in harmony."
"It is important to emphasise the fact that Prague has accepted the principles on which the common foreign and security policy is based. In fact, it was the Czech Government that took the initiative of strengthening political cooperation between all the applicant countries."
"There is no doubt that the process of accession is a long and gradual process of adapting to the acquis communautaire ."
"And, as is the case with many of the applicant countries, the Czech Republic still has a great deal to do, as the Commission's regular report rightly points out."
"This 'screening' document cannot be looked upon as a set of grades and marks; instead, it should be seen as an incentive to ensure that the correct measures are taken to benefit the Czech Republic and its application for membership of the European Union."
"I would like to mention one concern I have had since the beginning of my work as rapporteur, which is the situation of the Roma minority in the Czech Republic."
"It is true that the Prague Government has restructured the Interministerial Commission on the Affairs of the Roma Community and appointed Mr Petr Uhl as the government representative for human rights issues."
"However, the problem of the social and cultural integration of the Roma ethnic minority has yet to be resolved."
"This is undoubtedly an issue that will require a global solution and it is therefore vital to improve cultural relations throughout Czech society. But it is up to the Prague Government to take the necessary legislative measures to promote this integration."
"The authorities cannot renounce their responsibility and society will naturally expect the authorities to face up to it."
"Another important element is the rise in unemployment in the Czech Republic. According to the Commission this is due, for the most part, to a slowdown in economic activity and the effects of the process of industrial and economic restructuring in the country."
"The European Commission must continue to help the Czech Government to minimise the social impact of adapting to the acquis communautaire , if possible."
"I fully support the German Presidency's initiative to extend the PHARE programme to include support for the social dimension of the applicant countries' economies."
"I do not want to end without making two remarks."
"We all share the aim of enabling the applicant countries to join the European Union, but to do this properly we must also be consistent ourselves."
"To that end, I would point out once again that institutional reform is essential to prepare the Union for enlargement and, secondly, that it is vital for the Union to have the resources required to face the challenge of enlargement."
"I believe that, on this last issue, the Berlin summit did not exactly set the best example as regards the decisions that should have been taken. Nonetheless, we do, in fact, still have some time left to remedy the situation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this afternoon's debate on the conflict in Serbia and the expulsions in Kosovo has made it even clearer why enlarging the European Union to include the Central and Eastern European countries is, apart from any other considerations, the most important means of guaranteeing peace and must remain so in future."
"We Europeans can only ensure lasting peace in Europe and in the world by working together with our neighbours to the east."
"I say this in the knowledge that Poland has been a member of NATO since mid-March."
"As the largest central European applicant country, Poland is making good progress with the accession process at a technical level, and we can therefore reasonably assume that by the end of this year a complete overview of the entire accession process situation will be available."
"As I see it, that would probably then be the right time to discuss and perhaps reach agreement on a possible timetable for the rest of the run-up to accession."
"The Polish Government - the Sejm and the Senate - are anxious to achieve this, and we should not close our minds to this possibility, indeed we should call on the Commission to prepare an appropriate draft with the Polish authorities."
"In the Commission's progress report published in November 1998, Poland is described as a country that is enjoying stable social and political conditions and making progress in developing an efficient market economy."
"According to the economic data, and if you accept the economic forecasts, Poland is still one of the strongest economies amongst the central European countries, with growth rates over 5 %, unemployment and inflation below 10 % and income increasing by 4.5 %."
"Government debt is 48 % and the budget deficit in 1997 was 2.7 %."
"These are in line with the Maastricht criteria."
"As only 6.4 % of foreign trade is carried on with the Russian Federation, as opposed to 64 % with the European Union, Poland has remained relatively untouched by the latest Russian crisis."
"Nevertheless, despite this positive economic development there will be problems in the sectors in need of restructuring, that is the coal and steel industry; about 210 000 employees are affected by this restructuring."
"The environmental pollution associated with these industries will also give rise to problems."
"Although the extent of environmental pollution would be reduced by the restructuring of the coal and steel industry and reductions in capacity, substantial investment will still be required."
"At present Poland is channelling about 1.7 % of its gross domestic product into improving the quality of its natural resources."
"The environment currently accounts for 10 % of all corporate investment."
"Another area in which great efforts are needed is agriculture."
"As you know, one wage-earner in four works in this sector, which nevertheless generates just 6 % of gross domestic product."
"However, most farms produce for their own needs rather than for the market."
"The agricultural sector, comprising over two million farms, each covering an average area of no more than eight hectares, will therefore represent a serious social and regional problem."
"Coal, steel and farming are therefore areas in which great efforts will have to be made in the future."
"But there are also areas where there have already been successful reforms: the reform of central, regional and local government, in which the number of voivodeships has been reduced, health care reform to introduce medical insurance, and reform of the pension system."
"The reform of the educational system is due to take effect in September of this year."
"Overall, this is a positive Commission report, which shows that Poland is developing well."
"Allow me to return briefly to the point I made at the beginning."
"Ten years after the historical changes of 1989 we must do everything in our power to make this crucial progress with the accession process."
"This applies to both sides: the European Union and the applicant countries in Central and Eastern Europe."
"We must build on Agenda 2000 to make enlargement feasible, and the applicants must become fit for accession."
"We cannot risk the enthusiasm for membership in the CEECs being allowed to wane."
"The fifth direct elections to the European Parliament in mid-June and an information campaign planned by the Polish Government provide a good opportunity to enlighten the public about the significance and the aims of the forthcoming EU enlargement and of membership."
"In addition to the major social and economic impact, we need more than ever to highlight the overarching factor of securing peace throughout Europe."
"This will enable the existing and future EU Member States to make a significant contribution to the goals of political union."
"Applause"
"Mr President, Commissioner, last week Cyprus was in the news in connection with the violence in Kosovo in a rather peculiar way."
"Mr Denktash, the leader of Northern Cyprus, offered Muslim refugees 100 000 homes in the ghost town of Magusta."
"Nicosia reacted by sending Mr Kyprianou to Milosevic in order to try, as he said, to obtain the release of three US soldiers by invoking centuries-old relations."
"The reason I am saying this is so that people can see how Cyprus could move just as easily in the direction of chaos as order."
"We know that the lingering conflict began a quarter of a century ago, and that it has certain things in common with what is now taking place in the Balkans."
"We see reminders every day of where this can lead."
"After all the diplomatic efforts by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union, I honestly have to say that it seems unlikely to me that we will see the stability and security on the island of Cyprus which Mr Habsburg predicts."
"Membership of the European Union may perhaps lead to a solution to the division of Cyprus, or its occupation as I prefer to describe it."
"Unfortunately, accession negotiations between Cyprus and the Union have so far not exactly proved successful."
"The latest condition laid down by Mr Denktash is that his republic must be recognised while, rather more strangely, Nicosia must immediately abandon its European aspirations."
"Mr President, the negotiations between the two communities are going wrong."
"For a while I thought that something was actually going right, when the President of Cyprus, Mr Clerides, said that he would not be deploying S 300 missiles, which I understand had come second-hand from Russia."
"The security situation on Cyprus might well have justified their deployment, but it would also have had the effect of jeopardising security still further."
"I have not seen any gesture at all from Northern Cyprus of course, nor from Turkey either."
"A solution is not made any more likely by a number of Member States including my own country, the Netherlands, coming out with statements more or less opposing membership for Cyprus as long as partition remains."
"This removes the catalyst effect of the accession process and gives Turkey what amounts to a veto on the Union's decision to include Cyprus as a member."
"This is certainly not going to encourage Turkey to withdraw from Cyprus after a quarter of a century, especially as now, according to the Commission's progress report, Cyprus is doing well."
"Telecommunications and information technology are the only areas in which Cyprus is requesting transition periods."
"There are scarcely any problems with the other main areas which have been screened to date."
"The figures for the Republic of Cyprus are 50 % higher than the economic and financial indicators for Northern Cyprus."
"Relations between Cyprus and the European Union are drawing closer and within a few years the 1973 association agreement will become a customs union."
"Yet the process still needs to be speeded up, and we might consider some kind of PHARE fund action for Cyprus."
"Mr President, as a final point I should like to ask the Commission to allocate the remaining EUR 17 million under the present protocol to the pre-accession strategy."
"A financial injection may bring accession nearer and, as I have endeavoured to explain, accession will increase stability in the region."
"I will end, Mr President, on a very simple domestic point."
"In the Dutch text there is a very unfortunate mistake or printing error."
"The last reference in paragraph 2 on the substantial progress achieved in adopting the acquis communautaire is 'justitie en buitenlandse zaken '."
"I have seen in the English and French texts that the reference is clearly to 'internal affairs'."
"The Dutch text should therefore read 'binnenlandse zaken '."
"Mr President, I am really delighted, in this plenary part- session of Parliament, to again be addressing you on the subject of Malta's accession to the European Union."
"Everyone here will be familiar with the history of this particular application."
"When it last came before us, in my report in 1995, Parliament gave a very favourable recommendation."
"Since then there has been a change of government in 1996 and the decision was taken to suspend the application and to look instead for a strengthened association agreement."
"The situation changed again in September 1998 with the elections and change of government, so the application has been reactivated and is before us again this evening."
"Although the application remained frozen for those two years, Malta remains in a very strong position."
"It has stable democratic structures and the economic indicators are quite close to our Community average."
"Although the Maltese authorities have introduced VAT, much new legislation is still required to bring Maltese law into line with the EU situation."
"These reservations aside, I am very glad to be able to say that on this occasion also I recommend a very positive assessment of the Maltese application."
"In particular I welcome the fact that the Commission has recommended that the screening of Maltese legislation should begin as soon as possible, with a view to starting negotiations at the end of this year."
"I do, however, regret that the Council and the Commission were quite slow in making progress here."
"Especially, I found, there was reticence on the part of the Council, in that it asked the Commission for a new opinion, an update of the 1993 opinion."
"It said it wanted to measure this again against the Copenhagen criteria."
"So there was much delay there but we did eventually receive that opinion from the Commission, in February of this year, at the stage when the negotiations were well under way with the first wave countries."
"I regret that delay."
"With regard to the various amendments that we have received, on Amendment No 1 I will be looking tomorrow for a split vote."
"I can certainly recommend to the House that the application must take Maltese opinion fully into account."
"Indeed anybody who follows the Maltese media will know that it is the intention of the Maltese Government to hold a referendum on the issue."
"So I would agree with that particular section of Amendment No 1."
"However, I could not take on board the second part because to me it would be an undue interference in the internal affairs of the Maltese people."
"I can certainly recommend Amendment No 2 and I will leave it to the judgment of the House as to how we should vote on Amendment No 3."
"I feel, however, that we should be consistent here with other accession reports."
"Finally, I call on the Cologne European Council to take the decision to begin negotiations on Malta's accession by the end of this year."
"The Commission should draw up an accession partnership and provide for a programme of financial assistance for the pre-accession period to help the Maltese authorities to bridge the economic gap that remains between Malta and the European Union."
"Mr President, I am delighted that my report on the environmental effects of enlargement was included in this Parliamentary debate dealing with the subject of applications for EU membership."
"It confirms the importance of one of the main themes of my report, namely that environmental issues must be a priority in negotiations for membership and that environmental questions must, in accordance with the principle of transparency, be an integral part of the whole negotiations process."
"The forthcoming round of negotiations on accession will be very different from the previous one in terms of the emphasis given to environmental matters."
"The last countries to join the European Union were Austria, Sweden and Finland, at the beginning of 1995."
"Environmental legislation in these countries was in many ways even further developed than the legislation in the EU."
"The situation is now quite different, and the lack of environmental legislation in the applicant countries is one of the biggest barriers to accession."
"Under the Treaty of Amsterdam we all now have obligations, furthermore, to integrate environmental policy into all areas of EU decision-making, and Member States' compliance with these obligations is to be examined at future EU summits."
"As the accession talks proceed we must take stock of what progress the applicant countries are also making in this area."
"There are enormous environmental problems in the ten applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe, and there are only meagre resources available to deal with them."
"However, the condition of the environment has been steadily improving since 1989, and there are large areas, for example, of unspoiled nature in these countries."
"As far as the diversity of the natural environment is concerned, too, the situation in these countries is either first-rate or at least a considerable improvement on that in many of the current Member States."
"Accelerated economic growth on the one hand creates scope for improving the environment, but, on the other, will pollute the environment at an ever greater rate unless environmental legislation is tightened up at the same time."
"Furthermore, new investment in production must take account of the latest technology and should be undertaken now while these countries are negotiating their membership."
"In fact the greatest efforts to improve the environment must be made prior to accession."
"At the same time we must ensure that the resources made available for the applicant countries, inter alia under Agenda 2000, are put to best use in these countries."
"However, the responsibility for the EU budget is not equally shared: the greatest financial responsibility lies with the applicant countries themselves."
"EU funding through ISPA and PHARE can at best only act as a catalyst."
"The aim must be for these schemes to generate two to four times the funding set aside for investment in the environment."
"The environmental problems in the applicant countries arise from long-standing shortcomings and neglect, particularly in the areas of water and waste management as well as emissions into the atmosphere from industry, energy production, and the present rapid growth in traffic."
"They also all face major problems in the areas of nuclear safety and the storage of nuclear waste."
"Solving this problem will also require a huge financial input, and the international investment banks also need to be involved here."
"On the whole, however, it has to be said that eastward enlargement will have a positive impact on the environment of Europe, when accession results in the tightening up of environmental standards in the applicant countries, economic growth is placed on a sustainable footing, and the countries concerned are able to comply with international agreements on environmental issues."
"In order for this to be achieved, we must negotiate with each applicant country a realistic timetable based on the individual situation of the country in question, and the focal point of that timetable should be prior to accession."
"Transitional periods in respect of environmental legislation may be permitted only in exceptional circumstances and if the applicant countries themselves request it and also commit to a timetable for implementation."
"Nevertheless, transitional periods must not be allowed to exceed five years."
"Mr President, if you were to look down from space at our continent you would not see the European Union, applicant states and non-applicant states."
"All you would see is one crowded, complex, interdependent Cape of Eurasia."
"That is a salutary thought for all of us as we contemplate the challenges of enlargement."
"Our pollution is a common heritage which we all have."
"I am particularly struck if you look at Europe in terms of its river systems rather than its political structures."
"I recall vividly the impact on myself of learning, during a floating symposium on the Black Sea last year, that a very high percentage of the pollution which is killing the Black Sea stems not from the riparian states but from run-off from Austria and Germany of nitrogen and agricultural chemicals, pushed on to the land in the heart of Europe as a consequence of some of our malfunctioning environmental policies in the common agricultural policy and having a consequence hundreds and hundreds of miles away across the continent."
"As we examine the environmental consequences and challenges of enlargement, we will not seek to enforce on those states which seek to join us in the applicant process the same kind of environmentally disastrous projects which we have often adopted in our own ignorance inside the Union over the last 40 years."
"I would like to make just one other point."
"Despite my concern about the environment, I am an optimist and along with the author of the report I believe that much can be achieved in the environment in the process of enlargement."
"I am suspicious of those who would use the challenges of environment as an argument for delay in enlargement."
"In my view there is much that can be done."
"This is a solvable problem but we have to do it conscious that we do it as one continent linked environmentally and ecologically."
"Mr President, enlargement is of course a huge challenge for the European Union."
"A major and pressing task lies ahead of us."
"Enlargement requires comprehensive change; this applies to the applicant countries - in this case Hungary - and to the European Union."
"Among other measures, we need a fundamental overhaul of the EU's agricultural policy, which currently absorbs half its budget."
"The applicant countries too will have to make adjustments in order to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria."
"Democracy and human rights must be consolidated, for example. In the case of a country such as Hungary, attention to its minorities - and their protection - will be important."
"The quicker the process unfolds the better, of course, but we can hardly set a date for the conclusion of negotiations."
"All applicant countries, including Hungary, need to strengthen their anti-corruption strategies."
"It is vital that both the Commission and the Hungarian Government take account of the social costs of the economic and financial restructuring process."
"The price of getting fit for EU accession should not be paid by the least advantaged, with increased unemployment, a growing divide between people or the marginalisation of various ethnic groups."
"The negotiating process leading to EU accession needs to embrace the whole of society."
"It is therefore essential for the Hungarian Government to maintain an ongoing dialogue with both the opposition and the two sides of industry."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party and also very much on my own behalf I would like to express the very sincere respect, esteem and gratitude that we owe to Otto von Habsburg."
"His speech here today is typical of the speeches he has made in the European Parliament over the last 20 years, since 1979."
"I remember very clearly when he talked of the former Soviet Union as being the last colonial empire on earth, with its annexation of the three Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania."
"Mr von Habsburg, many people smiled when you said that, but I was always convinced that you were right."
"You had a vision that these states should be liberated, and today that vision is becoming a reality."
"They are now free to join the European Union, and you are an example of the fact that is visionaries who are the true realists."
"We are discussing Estonia, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Cyprus and Malta."
"But, as Otto von Habsburg has said, we should cast our net wider, towards Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia, and also towards Bulgaria and Romania."
"We in the PPE Group see the accession and negotiation as a single process, and we are convinced that we have to prove ourselves, and that the accession of all these countries associated with us by Europe agreements must soon become a reality."
"Of course, certain requirements have to be met."
"These countries need to speed up their reforms and actively pursue them."
"We are delighted to see that they are making great progress."
"We need to encourage these countries and should not give them any discouraging signals."
"Because if we did discourage them, the reform process and the momentum in these countries would founder, which would be bad both for these countries and for the European Union."
"That is why we are telling these countries that they are welcome, that the people of these countries are welcome in the European Union, because they want to join our community and adopt its set of values."
"That is why we are calling for the Helsinki Council at the end of this year to start accession negotiations with Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and of course also, as we are requesting, with Malta."
"The Baltic states have suffered a great deal of pain in the course of this century, as Otto von Habsburg has already mentioned."
"As they have not been admitted to NATO yet, they are seeking security within the European Union."
"If we look at Kosovo today, we cannot fail to recognise that it is our duty to admit in particular the Baltic states into the European Union as quickly as possible."
"We need to make headway with the internal reform of the European Union."
"There is clearly a need for institutional reform if we want to remain effective."
"We also need to take certain practical steps."
"We have proposed for example that MPs from the applicant countries could attend meetings of our parliamentary committees as observers when accession issues are on the agenda."
"But in turn, we also have our own requirements."
"For example, we are calling on the Czech Republic to repeal laws and decrees still in force from 1945 and 1946 in cases where they refer to the expulsion of individual ethnic groups from the former Czechoslovakia."
"We are faced with a great challenge."
"Back in 1989, we would not have dared to dream that we could be discussing such problems in 1999."
"But we are discussing them, and that is why we must now do whatever is necessary to ensure that this vision, which is edging closer to fulfilment, actually does become a reality in the foreseeable future, so that we can welcome the people of central Europe into the European Union and the European Parliament."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to support Otto von Habsburg, who said that we should make haste if we are not to miss a historic opportunity."
"And I believe that this is very important."
"When I visit the applicant counties, I am struck by their failure to understand our hesitation."
"For example, they cannot grasp why we are not full of enthusiasm once a date has been set for possible accession, 2002 in the case of Hungary."
"Of course, it is evident that meeting the criteria is essential for accession."
"And it is clear that they are making good progress in many areas, the economy for example, and also with the democratic and political criteria."
"Amazingly enough, the same cannot be said of other areas, such as administrative reform and above all legal reform."
"Sometimes it is not easy to explain to them that to have an effective legal culture prevailing within the judicial system and in the courts is simply essential for a properly functioning internal market, just as democracy is of course a requirement for political union."
"We must use great powers of persuasion here."
"On the other hand, we need to be extraordinarily careful about the kind of criticisms we make, so that they do not have the opposite of the desired effect."
"As it is, we often have the impression that not only do they not want to hear such criticism at all - and who does? - but that it even wounds their national pride and is counterproductive."
"However, there is no doubt at all about one point: we have to make it perfectly clear that we have every interest in these accessions taking place as quickly as possible once the criteria have been met."
"We should not transfer our difficulties to them and behave as if we were afraid of their economy and their people."
"That is the heart of the matter, and that is why we must make sure that these accessions happen as soon as possible once the criteria have been fulfilled. We need to make that crystal clear in all our discussions."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I rise to make some general comments on enlarging the Union to include new countries with which we are conducting membership negotiations."
"However, I am afraid that given the financial outlook and the fact that these countries are less wealthy than the existing members of the Union, there is a danger that certain regions, such as Galicia and Portugal, will become even more peripheral and marginalised because of reductions in the Structural Funds. This will make it difficult to achieve the economic and social cohesion Europe needs."
"During the last parliamentary term I voted in favour of EU enlargement to include three rich countries - Austria, Finland and Sweden."
"The less wealthy countries now knocking at our door certainly deserve to belong to our community of economic and social interests."
"We should therefore cooperate in their development so that we can continue along the path of eastward enlargement, extending the route to Santiago de Compostela onward to Moscow and the Urals, a dream that could come true in 20 or 30 years' time."
"I am also sure that these countries will be a perfect bridge for developing our relations with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus."
"Generally speaking, the various rapporteurs from the Committee on Foreign Affairs have emphasised the difficulties that have to be overcome, have expressed their pleasure at the progress already made, and have insisted that reforms should be supported by accompanying measures designed to mitigate their consequences."
"It is for this reason that in countries like Poland there will be a particular need for thoroughgoing social, administrative and health reforms. Reforms of this kind will certainly have a special impact on more vulnerable people, especially pensioners."
"With particular reference to Malta, I am pleased at the Commission's recommendation that a critical examination of Maltese legislation should start immediately, so that negotiations with this country can begin before the end of this year."
"Mr President, I should like to use these two minutes to underline the importance of the Myller report, which deals with the environment and the kind of environmental strategy required in the context of enlargement."
"Mrs Myller's report is excellent; her commitment to the issues is visible in every line."
"The environmental dimension is one of the main challenges of enlargement."
"Perhaps I might draw particular attention to two elements."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe seeking to join the Union are a true learning resource from our point of view."
"They certainly have an ecological head start in the agricultural sector. Their economic situation has meant that they have adopted farming practices somewhat different from those that we are used to in the EU."
"And I feel that we should be doing our utmost to support the most environmentally friendly forms of agriculture possible."
"Secondly, rather than promoting the private car, we should be backing the well-established and extensive public transport systems which exist in many of the CEECs."
"We should also remember that it is not simply a matter of legislating from on high; local organisations need to be involved in what is going on. I am thinking of both the voluntary sector and bodies such as Urban Forum."
"The latter is active within the Union and needs to extend its outreach into Central and Eastern Europe."
"Thank you, Mrs Hulthén."
"You had been allocated speaking time of a minute and a half, but I signalled to you that you could continue with your speech."
"Mr President, after the excellent introductory remarks on the problem of enlargement by our colleague Otto von Habsburg, I should simply like to make a few points in connection with Slovenia further to the excellent report by Mr Speciale."
"We can all too easily forget that Slovenia used to belong to the Yugoslav Federation."
"Like Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, it broke free and now would like very much to join the European Union."
"It has become a sovereign state and is, to use a Dutch expression, small but tough."
"Psychologically the country would not appear to have any difficulty in becoming a part of the European landscape."
"Of all the applicant countries, Slovenia comes closest to fulfilling the conditions for full European Union membership."
"It will therefore be of great symbolic value if an agreement can be reached on this quite quickly."
"It could also serve as an example for the other candidates."
"What more must they do?"
"Yet this report already refers to the next annual report."
"So it looks as if it will be some time yet before we can talk of positive results."
"If I remember correctly, the conditions for entry were the acquis communautaire , Maastricht and the desire to promote the further development of Europe, a market economy and human rights."
"My question is this: In the negotiations, what are we asking applicants to do about the common foreign and security policy?"
"I believe that we now have an excellent opportunity for the Fifteen to decide a number of basic principles on this subject which consequently must also be accepted by newcomers."
"Now or never it must become clear just how serious we are about this common policy."
"And how is the problem of solidarity discussed?"
"What does convergence of opinions mean in the context of the negotiations?"
"What is Slovenia's position?"
"I would also add: How do they view subsidiarity?"
"Should we not be helping them to combat inflation, including by practical measures, and thereby boost the economy as quickly as possible?"
"Mr President, the European Union's enlargement to the east will be an enormous challenge from the point of view of our common environment."
"If successful, enlargement will place countries that have sought membership on a strong footing for economic growth based on sustainable development."
"This, however, will not come about automatically: we will have to get to grips with enormous problems in trying to achieve as much as possible with relatively few resources for development."
"For that reason we need to establish priorities, exploit the applicant countries' own resources, and implement tailor-made solutions."
"It will be a process that requires capacity for change and adaptability according to circumstances."
"I would like to express my full support for the ideas set out by Mrs Myller, which reveal a sound and realistic grasp of the problem."
"A list should be drawn up of the most important points to focus on in environmental legislation, and the implementation of those points would serve as objective indicators."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of how investment in sustainable development is implemented in practice and monitored."
"Introducing environmental legislation into the administrations of the applicant countries will be an immense challenge, and for that reason the EU must provide the necessary support through training programmes and exchanges of information."
"Mr President, before I begin I beg your indulgence to join with Mr Poettering in paying tribute to the work of Mr von Habsburg in this House."
"As coordinator of the Socialist Group I should like to thank him for his help and advice over the time I have been coordinator, and for the quality of his work in committee."
"I am the last speaker of the Socialists and my job, therefore, is not to speak about individual countries, but to sum up the general debates."
"However, I would like to begin by quoting directly from the Czech application to the European Union."
"In the preamble to that application the Czechs say: 'The construction of Europe has always been a matter of enlightened imagination, political courage, assiduous work, criticism, sober realism, solidarity and the art of cooperation, accommodation and compromise'."
"I do not think we could find a better commentary on the process that we are currently undergoing."
"We should be clear that if the challenge of the 1980s for the European Union was the creation of a single market, and the challenge of the 1990s was the creation of a single currency, the challenge for the opening years of the next millennium will be to enlarge the European Union so as to deepen it and also to create a zone of stability throughout the continent."
"This is our opportunity to reunite Europe, to build a whole continent built on the principles of peace, stability and prosperity."
"If we doubt the value of those characteristics we only have to look at the former Yugoslavia."
"Indeed the dream that should drive us is the dream of reuniting Europe."
"The nightmare that should spur our actions is what is happening in former Yugoslavia."
"Those are the alternatives which confront us."
"To go back to the Czech application, they talk of sober realism."
"That has to be, without a doubt, a major motivating force."
"It is a difficult process."
"Let us not in any way underestimate the difficulties."
"We have our own difficulties which have already been outlined in the debate today about Agenda 2000."
"But the applicant countries themselves must go through a process of economic reform and keep that process on course."
"In particular we must ensure that there is effective competition policy in all the applicant countries and that there is proper respect for intellectual property which will underpin inward investment, which is so important for them all."
"We have to ensure that their administrations are modernised."
"As I have said many times in these debates, in my view the biggest weakness of these countries is the administration and the judicial system and the lack of modernisation and investment."
"They must all take action against corruption because, as we know ourselves, corruption will undermine the political process."
"There can be no fudges whatsoever during that process."
"We have to be honest and realistic."
"We have to show solidarity and understanding for the difficulties these countries are going through."
"We have to ensure that we can take care of the social consequences of those reforms."
"But the applicant countries must also understand that none of them is as yet in the European Union."
"They will all be judged on their own merits."
"They must continue the processes which they have been going through and show patience whilst they are going through the negotiations."
"What is also needed, as the Czechs pointed out, is enlightened imagination and political courage."
"All problems can be resolved in politics if the will is there."
"Let us show that imagination and courage so that we can enlarge the European Union before the next European elections in 2004."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs."
"However, despite my strong commitment to the process of enlargement, I acknowledge that we face real dilemmas during the process."
"On the one hand we have a political and, indeed, a moral obligation to honour the Treaty by admitting new members in accordance with it."
"On the other hand, we must be careful that the arrival of new members is not detrimental to the future workings of the Treaties."
"The jargon of the Union sums up the problem."
"Is it to be deepening before widening or widening before deepening?"
"We took a risk at the last enlargement by admitting three new members before any significant institutional reforms were in place to deal with the consequences of expanded membership."
"That risk was heightened by the presence in two of those countries of very significant anti-EU minorities which, if they became majorities, could, under our present inadequate institutional arrangements, have stifled the very workings of the Communities."
"That risk, which I hope has disappeared, cannot be taken again even if it means postponing enlargement."
"An enlarged unreformed community has a permanently increased exposure to disagreements which could stultify progress to our ultimate goal of a United States of Europe."
"As an aside, I venture to suggest that this is the secret ambition of some of the supporters of early enlargement."
"There is now a new reason for hastening slowly on enlargement."
"The euro has had a successful birth and is established as a world currency but it is still an infant."
"Its continued health is an essential prerequisite, not just for the economic health of the Union and the Member States but to their economic viability."
"There can be no enlargement unless the applicant states are fit to join the single currency, posing no threat to its integrity and status, and are willing to join so as to avoid making the present two-tier Union even worse."
"Hopefully, all existing Member States will have seen the light and be participants in the single currency before enlargement so that the applicants will have no choice on this issue."
"Enlargement in the right circumstances will guarantee the benefits of the Treaties for new members."
"Enlargement in the wrong circumstances will certainly halt progress and will probably reverse it."
"We must get it right and I am confident that we can."
"Mr President, I shall confine myself to expressing the simple wish that we can make up for lost time and that Malta can join the European Union soon."
"This is therefore an appeal to overcome all the hesitations and uncertainties which up to now have characterised the attitude of the Council and the Commission."
"Above and beyond the size of the country, which is of course limited in terms of territory and population, Malta's importance lies in the fact that it can help us launch and consolidate our policy in the Mediterranean area, which is one of the fronts on which tomorrow's Europe will compete."
"We should bear in mind that new scenarios do arise and that overcoming the negative attitude, so to speak, on the part of Libya is a major factor in consolidating the situation."
"Therefore, from the forthcoming Cologne Council onwards, Malta should be considered in a positive light."
"I think all the right factors are there: the attitudes of the previous labour government have been overtaken by the determination of the current one, and the main macroeconomic indicators are good, as was acknowledged by the rapporteur herself, Mrs Malone."
"I hope things will move quickly, Commissioner."
"Mr President, as Mr Donner has indicated, many positive things can be said about Estonia's progress and the pace of reform there. The same applies to Latvia and Lithuania."
"I was delighted at the result of the Estonian elections on 7 March. The winning parties were those who are most unequivocally working for EU membership and they have now formed a government."
"It is particularly gratifying that Mart Laar has been appointed as the new prime minister."
"Over the period between 1992 and 1994, he led the government which steered Estonia along what has proved to be such a successful course of reform."
"25 March this year was the 50th anniversary of the day on which 20 000 Estonian citizens were subjected to mass deportation from Estonia by Soviet occupation forces."
"That tragedy was not played out on our TV screens as happens with today's atrocities, so there is all the more reason for us to remember those people."
"Even before enlargement takes place, the current Member States of the Union are benefiting considerably from the reforms and efforts undertaken by the applicant countries to meet the requirements which have been laid down."
"And we should be reminding voters of that when the elections take place in June."
"The switch-over to a market economy in these countries has created new markets and jobs for us, and a high level of stability has enabled them to weather the Russian crisis better than might otherwise have been the case. As a result, we have been spared the need to intervene with a programme of assistance."
"First and foremost, however, their commitment to conflict-resolution and human rights has meant that we have not had to endure 'Kosovo crises' on our doorstep."
"This is the new dimension of the EU as a peace-promoting enterprise."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the enlargement of the European Union is, without doubt, the most important challenge facing the European Union as it moves into the twenty-first century."
"One of the essential prerequisites for its success is maintaining a geographical balance when admitting applicant countries."
"Seen in this light, the accession of Cyprus takes on special significance."
"The fact that accession negotiations in this particular case have begun and are progressing normally is to be welcomed."
"These negotiations must continue until they have been successfully concluded."
"Impeding the negotiations, and linking their outcome to a resolution of the political and military issues that have afflicted the island for 25 years, as certain Member States of the European Union have unfortunately attempted to do, are diplomatic errors which go against the philosophy of the European Union and enlargement and jeopardise its successful completion."
"The report by Mr Bertens, whom I congratulate on his excellent work, is a major step in the right direction and we must therefore vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, Mrs Myller has produced a sound and interesting report on the environmental strategies to be implemented in the run-up to the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"This is an important text, which fits in well with the commitment the European Parliament has consistently demonstrated towards environmental issues."
"The report does, however, contain a number of points which I cannot support."
"It is stated, for example, that the ongoing privatisation processes in the applicant countries could jeopardise the status of conservation areas and the future of biological diversity."
"My view is quite the opposite."
"I believe that this privatisation thrust is essential to the interests of sound environmental policy."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have a sorry history of totalitarianism, which left them with a legacy of severe environmental problems."
"It is now up to individual countries and the EU to embark on joint efforts in the interests of a better environment."
"People care for the things they own."
"It is therefore paramount that legislation should safeguard the right of ownership."
"If someone pollutes my land, then I must have an incontrovertible right to claim compensation of some kind from the polluter."
"That is what the hallowed 'polluter pays' principle is all about."
"Mrs Myller also says in her report that increasingly intensive farming and forestry endanger the environment, as does road building."
"I disagree with her analysis."
"All human activity brings with it alterations to the environment."
"Such change need not necessarily be damaging, although human endeavour does sometimes impact negatively on the world around us."
"That is precisely why we need to set clear boundaries, but it does not mean that we should categorically condemn certain things."
"Normal agricultural and forestry activity does not in itself jeopardise the environment."
"It is therefore inappropriate to urge the applicant countries to abstain from the kind of farming and forestry practices that we view as normal."
"But it is essential that they comply with the environmental legislation we ourselves have agreed upon."
"By way of conclusion, let me highlight the huge environmental policy benefits associated with enlargement; the result will be a better environment for the whole of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say a few words about Malta."
"First, I would like to thank everyone who has helped to ensure that Malta is once again being considered alongside the other applicant countries, as envisaged at the Corfu and Essen Councils."
"I would also like to thank you in particular, Commissioner van den Broek, for the firm support you have offered ever since the present Maltese Government reactivated their country's application for membership."
"However, I have a few questions for the Commission on this."
"My first question is about the Task Force for the Accession Negotiations, which includes a special unit for each country."
"When will the unit responsible for Malta start work?"
"My second question is about the fourth financial protocol."
"According to this protocol the 1999 budget provides EUR 5 million each for Malta and Cyprus."
"But with the help of the Commission and before the recent elections in Malta, it had been agreed that the financial protocol for Malta would be extended by a further year."
"Now, several million euros are not available, because they were not included in the budget."
"Do you see any chance, perhaps by using the Notenboom procedure or some other method, of implementing this extended financial protocol now?"
"My third comment is on the report before us."
"I am very sorry that the rapporteur did not consider it necessary to be present for this debate."
"I am referring to the amendments tabled on the report."
"It seems to me that Amendment No 1, which takes the Maltese authorities and administration up on their promise to respect the vote in favour of membership of the European Union, is aimed at the wrong people."
"After all, with Norway we saw that it was ultimately the public who decided what would happen, without anyone making the authorities responsible beforehand."
"Overall, I am very grateful that we have had this debate here today."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteurs and others who have spoken this evening on the important subject of European Union enlargement."
"May I begin by again stressing, and this goes for all those responsible for preparing for enlargement within the Commission, that we are very much aware of the European Union's historic and unique opportunity to extend peace and stability to large areas of this continent."
"I therefore fully agree with Mr von Habsburg and all those who have reiterated his message this evening that precisely during these weeks and months of conflict in Kosovo we are particularly aware of what it means to be able to live in peace and freedom and without repression within this community of values."
"We must therefore help all those who aspire to join this community during the difficult and complex integration process."
"I am therefore grateful to have the opportunity today to reflect on the state of progress in this process, which by the very nature of things cannot be completed overnight."
"In any event I want to reassure all the honourable Members, as I have the applicant countries themselves, that as far as we are concerned the current so-called institutional crisis, which naturally affects the Commission's work, must not and shall not result in any delay in the enlargement process."
"All the preparations and our work on them will continue undiminished, as will the negotiations with the individual countries."
"Last December we discussed at length the situation in the applicant countries with which formal negotiations have not yet begun. Today we turn our attention to the other six."
"I should like to begin by saying that we are using all the pre-accession instruments at our disposal in order to help these applicant countries with their preparations."
"The Commission will be drawing up further progress reports in the autumn, but we also intend to adapt, or rather adjust, the accession partnerships on the basis of the recorded progress and development in October this year, in other words before the Helsinki summit."
"At this point we can already report that all 10 Europe Agreements have entered into force and that the pre-accession support agreed at the European Council in Berlin will double the financial aid granted to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Under the PHARE twinnings programme we expect around 100 experts from the current EU Member States to be in place in these applicant countries by the end of the year, and as far as we are concerned this figure of 100 needs to be doubled in the year 2000."
"These experts will be expected to transfer their knowledge about implementing the acquis communautaire to the main ministries in the applicant countries."
"Officials will then be seconded for longer periods in the field of agriculture, justice, home affairs, finance and the environment."
"Every applicant country has also approved a national programme for the adoption of the acquis communautaire which specifies the required personnel, budget and institutional resources."
"These countries are also being asked to make further adjustments to their programmes by the early summer in order to bring them into line with the latest developments."
"Before I say anything about each of the six countries individually, I should perhaps say a word about Malta, which clearly finds itself in a rather special position as a result of the interruption in its membership application."
"Last December I was able to inform you that Malta's application had been reactivated."
"As a result, the Council asked us to revise its 1993 opinion and we announced this on 17 February."
"The conclusion reached in this opinion was essentially that while there were no problems in respect to the political criteria for Malta, additional or structural economic reforms were still needed, while the two-year break in Malta's membership preparations had resulted in a delay in adopting the acquis communautaire ."
"The Commission believes the recommended screening should begin as soon as possible, as indeed will be the case, so that, as we say in the report, accession negotiations can begin at the end of this year."
"This may, as I hope, provide an impetus for the Helsinki summit in December."
"But at the end of the day it is the summit itself which must decide when to start negotiations."
"In any event, we are fully prepared."
"I can also reassure Mrs Günther that we have already taken steps to ensure that the task force negotiations can be enlarged at any time should the formal negotiations with Malta actually begin."
"I can also tell Mr Bertens, and on this occasion Mrs Malone too, that we will also be considering to what extent, for Cyprus as well as Malta, the present financial protocol can be converted into a financial instrument which is comparable to that for the other applicant countries."
"We are working on this at the moment and will return to it as quickly as possible."
"The negotiations are a complicated process in themselves, but I am delighted to be able to report that at the end of last year seven out of a total of 31 negotiating chapters had already been addressed."
"Faced with the need to determine their negotiating positions, the applicant countries succeeded in dramatically improving their internal organisation and coordination in a relatively short period of time."
"The questions we put to them about their ability to adopt the acquis communautaire provided an extra stimulus for their preparations in this crucial area."
"I am saying this in reply to Mr Titley who made a comment about this."
"The Commission for one also certainly plans to keep up the pace at which these chapters are addressed, which means that it should be possible to address another eight by the summer."
"The German Presidency itself has also announced this."
"This means that by around the middle of this year half of all the negotiating chapters will have been addressed, and if the pace can be maintained around three quarters will have been addressed by the end of the year."
"This says a great deal about the efforts made by both the applicant countries and the Commission presidency."
"This is a pace we want to sustain."
"You know that the issues involved here are political criteria, economic criteria, the acquis communautaire and administrative capacity."
"Before I comment on individual countries I should like to make a number of general points about these four important criteria which, as you know, were agreed in Copenhagen in 1993."
"Our evaluations set out in last year's November reports were based on an in-depth investigation of how democracy in these applicant countries works in practice."
"It was with great pleasure, not to say enthusiasm, that we were able to conclude that all things considered these are now well-established democracies."
"There are still a number of important aspects concerning the rule of law and democracy which still need attention and where further progress is necessary."
"I am thinking here of minorities, a particularly pertinent subject at this time, and also the need to strengthen the judiciary for example."
"In many countries, not only the applicant countries but in Member States too, there are major delays in the judicial process, usually because of staff shortages in the judiciary."
"Now for a general comment on the economic criteria."
"All the countries with which we are negotiating have made considerable progress in moving towards a market economy, with particularly marked economic progress in countries such as Estonia, Hungary and Poland, which have made constant efforts to implement reforms since the opinions were published."
"In the report we also made no secret of the fact that Slovenia and the Czech Republic had made less progress and that they really needed to speed up the process."
"We told these countries this, which they accepted and they are now taking the necessary measures."
"Next to the matter of the pace of adapting to the acquis communautaire ."
"The question is not only whether the countries are able to adopt the legislation but also whether they are able to implement it in practice?"
"In this respect I believe the performance of the applicant countries remains very varied."
"In November we concluded that Hungary and Estonia had generally maintained a good adaptation rate, and that Poland had made major progress in a number of areas while falling behind in others."
"On this point too we had to conclude that the Czech Republic and Slovenia were lagging somewhat behind."
"In the interests of the mutual trust which is also vital for European Union membership, it is crucially important for applicant countries to have the necessary administrative and judicial capacity."
"They cannot afford to neglect this area in their negotiations."
"This is also why we have devoted so much effort to the twinning operation under which experts from the Member States can be made available to the governments of applicant countries for longer periods."
"I will now quickly comment on each of the six countries individually."
"Poland, for example, has achieved excellent results in meeting the political criteria by introducing a new Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure and by appointing a commissioner for the protection of civil rights."
"On the economic front, I would also inform Mrs Hoff that Poland achieved high annual growth over the past year, coupled with falling unemployment and inflation, a strong currency and an increase in direct foreign investments."
"A major effort was also made for the economic restructuring of the social security system, the iron and steel sector and the coal sector."
"Less progress was made in adapting to the acquis communautaire , particularly in the environmental field, and the legislative work needs to be speeded up together with efforts to attract investment to the environment sector."
"There have been delays in passing important laws on certification and conformity assessment, which has created problems - which is why I mention it - in terms of access to the Polish market."
"As for Poland's most noted sector, namely agriculture, which Mrs Hoff also mentioned, I fully agree with her analysis that it is necessary to continue with reforms, especially in the field of rural development and improving veterinary and plant health facilities."
"On the other hand, I would praise Poland for the enormous work that has gone into the restructuring programme for the iron and steel industry."
"Nevertheless, greater efforts must be made in order to further clarify the entire privatisation strategy of the two largest companies and to set a clear timetable for privatisation and restructuring."
"I agree with Mrs Hoff's recommendation to continue with PHARE support for social measures to accompany restructuring in the iron and steel sector."
"This will therefore also be taken into account in this year's PHARE programme."
"There is a huge employment problem involved here."
"Next the Czech Republic, which I talked about earlier."
"Only limited progress has been made in the overall process of adaptation and the implementation of the short-term priorities for the accession partnership."
"Mr Carnero Gonzalez's report lists a number of priority areas in which the Czech Republic must step up its pre-accession measures, such as adapting its legislation to the acquis communautaire in general, as well as reforming the apparatus of government and the judicial system, privatising state banks, policy on state support, protecting the environment and the further integration of the gypsy minority, the latter a point raised by Mr Gonzalez."
"The new government's programme includes many priorities which do indeed correspond to the accession partnership, but we hope that the government will also succeed in transforming these priorities into concrete results."
"I can be quite brief on the subject of Hungary."
"There has been major progress in a number of areas, in particular the approval of a general reform package for the judicial system and the completion of the structural economic reforms."
"Another very favourable development is the strengthening of Hungary's government apparatus by increasing the number of staff - something the Commission is naturally very jealous of - and organising training programmes for the medium term."
"In some areas, such as environmental protection, the process of harmonising legislation is rather slow and regional development planning is also only in its earliest stages."
"Additional efforts are needed in setting up an effective service for controlling state aid, an important subject in itself."
"I will now turn to Estonia, where there has been clear progress."
"This is a real front-runner, with developments in the area of citizenship legislation particularly welcome."
"We know the political efforts this has required."
"We also hope, and I make no secret of the fact that I have some concerns about this, that Estonia will reexamine the language law and the law on parliamentary and local council elections which were passed following the publication of our last report. Our first impressions are that these laws could be at odds with international standards in this area."
"The Commission would be happy to work with Estonia to find solutions to this and shares Mr Donner's view that more measures are required to ensure the integration of non-Estonian speakers."
"Although it is no exception in this respect, Estonia must also make more effort to strengthen its administrative capacity."
"Now Slovenia, which stands second to last in the line of negotiating countries."
"November's progress report made it clear that Slovenia had not made sufficient progress on harmonisation in general."
"We discussed this at length with the Slovenian Government during a visit to Ljubljana, and I am confident that efforts will be made to catch up, as I agree with those who spoke about Slovenia, Mr Tindemans among others, that this is a country that has everything it takes for rapid and smooth integration."
"In this sense Slovenia's performance has been disappointing, at least as things stood in November."
"But I repeat, I hope the government will be able to catch up."
"Slovenia knows exactly what is needed and what must be done, and we now need to give it the political encouragement to achieve this."
"Finally, last but not least, Cyprus."
"Let me begin by saying that we much appreciate, and in a sense were reassured by - I say this to Mr Bertens - the fact that President Clerides had the wisdom to avoid creating tension on the island by reconsidering the decision to deploy defensive missiles."
"This certainly helped the island's stability."
"I should also like to take this opportunity to express the hope that we will see new political initiatives which will restart the UN process on the island's partition and dialogue between President Clerides and Mr Denktash."
"As I told Mr Dimitrakopoulos, I believe that in the meantime preparations for Cyprus to join the Union should continue unabated."
"President Clerides has made a generous offer to the Turkish Cypriot community to participate in the delegation to the accession negotiations."
"We also hope for better times in this respect."
"I should like to say the following on the subject of economic developments."
"Since the 1993 opinion on Cyprus it still remains to be confirmed that the economy has the basic capacity to adapt to the challenges of enlargement."
"In this respect more attention needs to be paid to restructuring the internal financial sector to enable it to stand up to the pressure of competition as a result of the liberalisation of capital movements."
"The necessary progress has been made in adopting the acquis communautaire , particularly in the context of the customs union, but considerable further efforts are required in the area of the internal market and more particularly in the area of tax and finance."
"Maritime transport, telecommunications, justice and home affairs are also points which require particular attention in the case of Cyprus."
"As regards Mr Bertens' request that we should come up with a proposal for a financial mechanism, I repeat what I said earlier on the subject of Malta, namely that we are working on replacing the financial protocol."
"This is a subject to which we will be returning."
"Mr President, I will end here."
"I would, however, just like to say a few words about Mrs Myller's interesting and well thought-out report."
"In May 1998 the Commission adopted a communication on accession strategy in the environmental field."
"The need for such a strategy stems directly from the Agenda 2000 proposals in which it is recognised that adopting the environmental acquis will be a huge task for the CEECs and one which can only be achieved in the longer term and at a very high cost."
"There was talk at the time of figures between EUR 100 and 120 billion."
"The communication looks at some of the practical questions which are relevant for drawing up national strategies allowing the CEECs to adopt the acquis communautaire without allocating funds from the pre-accession instruments."
"Two of the main points in the communication concern the efforts the CEECs must make, which are both considerable and expensive."
"It is, however, important to recognise that they not only serve environmental interests, but are also justifiable on economic grounds."
"The Union's financial assistance provides just a very small part of the necessary resources, which is why a targeted, effective and strategic approach to the accession process is absolutely essential."
"Mr President, I have attempted to sketch, although perhaps at too great a length, the current state of affairs, as this Commission, or at least this college of Commissioners, will probably no longer be responsible for producing the next report."
"In any event I should like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteurs and all those who showed great interest in or were involved in the debate on the enlargement process, for the encouragement they have always given the Commission to take new initiatives in order to maintain the tempo of the enlargement process."
"I should like to end by saying to the enlargement countries themselves that our philosophy was and still is that each of the enlargement countries should be considered on its own merits and progress, even if this can result in a certain differentiation. It is therefore extremely important to make it clear that the enlargement family remains a family, even if at any given moment one may have made more progress than another."
"All-inclusiveness is a basic principle and point of departure for all those involved in this enlargement process and will remain so."
"Thank you for that interesting and highly detailed statement, Mr van den Broek."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Agreements and concerted practices"
"The next item is the report (A4-0137/99) by Mrs Thyssen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on"
"I.the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation No 19/65/EEC on the application of Article 85(3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices (COM(98)0546 - C4-0627/98-98/0287(CNS))II.the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation No 17: First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (COM(98)0546 - C4-0628/98-98/0288(CNS)).The first speaker is the rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen."
"Mr President, the report I am about to present was approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy by just one vote short of unanimity."
"It concerns competition policy and two proposals in connection with vertical agreements."
"One proposal for an amendment concerns the first Council regulation on the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty."
"This is the famous Regulation No 17/62 which empowers the Commission to grant individual exemptions."
"The other concerns an amendment to Regulation No 19/65 which determines the Commission's powers to grant block exemptions."
"It seems that the system of block exemptions, which the Commission has used for more than 30 years, is no longer flexible enough to meet the needs of rapidly changing distribution structures."
"There is also increasing recognition of the risk that agreements between undertakings with a dominant market position, even if they comply with the legal conditions for block exemption, may still have a distorting effect on competition."
"In 1997 the Commission set out these and other findings and published a Green Paper on vertical agreements."
"Parliament also took the opportunity to give its opinion on this occasion."
"While we recognised the need for a change of policy we did not unconditionally share the Commission's view that market share should be an essential differentiating criterion."
"With the current proposals, the Commission is introducing an initial specific amendment phase."
"The Commission wishes in future to introduce a single block exemption regulation for all categories of agreements on the resale of goods and services, intermediate goods and industrial property rights."
"For this, the scope of Regulation No 19/65 must first be extended."
"The Commission also wants to drop the excessively strict legal conditions in the area of contractual content."
"Furthermore, it wants to grant the national competition authorities the power to withdraw the benefit of block exemption in their territory."
"If all this is to be achieved within a consistent legal framework, the scope of Regulation No 17/62 also needs to be adapted, which the Commission also proposes to do."
"Finally, the Commission wants it to be possible for agreements which are not individually notified, but which nevertheless qualify for exemption, to be exempt with retroactive effect from the date on which they were concluded."
"These then are the proposals."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is in broad agreement with the Commission when it says that the proposed amendments will bring competition policy more in line with economic reality in future."
"But we also have certain objections."
"First of all, I must say that, contrary to what the Commission maintains, not all economic sectors welcome the proposed policy change."
"This is certainly true of the brewing sector and of filling station contracts."
"These are sectors with special rules which have shown their practical value. The beer supply contracts, for example, are currently perfectly satisfactory for the catering sector, large and small breweries, wholesalers and also the consumer."
"Yet the Commission claims that there are insufficient economic and legal arguments for maintaining special rules for them."
"My first question to the Commission is therefore: What compelling reasons does the Commission have for replacing an effective system which everyone is pleased with in this sector and which does not distort competition?"
"Secondly, I should like to hear from the Commission how the general block exemption will relate to the duration of contracts and in particular whether contracts linked to long-term investments will be able to run for periods as long as at present?"
"Thirdly, I have a question about the transitional period for current agreements and wonder whether agreements made under the present system can be fully implemented under this system or whether the new system applies to them and, if so, from when?"
"Fourthly, I should like public confirmation of the Commission's undertaking to inform Parliament and to give it the time to draw up a report on the planned block exemption regulation and guidelines before the Commission makes any final decision."
"Finally, Mr President, I am curious to know what the Commission's position is on Amendment No 9 relating to the professional secrecy of in-house counsel and what position it intends to take on the automobile distribution sector when the block exemption regulation for this sector expires in 2002."
"I thank the Commissioner in advance for a clear reply on this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are today debating one part of the overall package of reforms in European competition law."
"Mirroring the trend in the United States since the end of the last century, the European Union's anti-trust authority has become the spearhead of the EU."
"We need rules to safeguard the free market and to provide protection against monopolistic situations."
"Only competition can guarantee the lowest possible price for the consumer, quality, free access to the market, and, of course, innovation and jobs."
"Commissioner, you quite rightly referred several times to the support which Parliament has offered up to now in its contacts with the relevant departments."
"The Commission can also count on Parliament playing a constructive part in future work on the reform of competition law."
"This of course includes a detailed analysis of the present communication which deals with vertical restraints on distribution."
"As a matter of principle, it is of course right to frame practical block exemption regulations. Let me say it again, practical."
"It is probably easier to assess the internal market situation by judging the impact of vertical agreements than by applying strict formal criteria, particularly as small economic operators would then benefit from simplified formalities."
"And we would be well advised to convince all sectors of the need for such a reform."
"The rapporteur, Marianne Thyssen, quite rightly points out that there is absolutely no obstacle either to exceptions being made or to sector-specific approaches being adopted for those sectors in which the existing arrangements work to the total satisfaction of economic operators."
"Some distributional restraints reflect an economic requirement, for example because of the scale of investment or the consequent rate of return."
"At any rate, changes in sensitive areas should involve appropriate transitional periods."
"In my country alone, assets measurable in billions are dependent on this approach."
"Mr President, Commissioner, it is certainly laudable that the Commission, and above all the Commissioner responsible, Mr Van Miert - who is not with us today but to whom I should like to say that he for one clearly cannot be accused of having lost control of his administration - is seeking to ensure that the Treaty is properly applied in order to avoid any distortion of competition in the single market."
"Nevertheless, we must guard against being over-zealous by questioning something that has been shown to work effectively, especially if this review of competition policy on vertical restrictions threatens to jeopardise a whole sector which, thanks to its exclusive distribution contracts, and beer contracts in particular, has functioned perfectly well thus far, to the satisfaction of the breweries on the one hand and the cafés, restaurants and hotels on the other."
"As our rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen, very clearly highlighted, the breweries invest in the buildings and equipment of their clients safe in the knowledge that they can then sell their perishable products there."
"The owners of cafés, restaurants and hotels benefit from these investments which they are unable to finance or finance in advance themselves."
"What is the harm in that?"
"The Commission must understand, and give us the assurance, that any reform must ensure that a brewery operator can conclude beer delivery contracts for at least 10 years, given the considerable volume of investments in this sector and the relatively long period before they yield a return."
"In sectors such as beer, and also hydrocarbons, where the present approach is satisfactory to economic operators, either an exception must be made to the general rule or a sector-specific approach adopted."
"There can be no question of giving the Commission carte blanche in this field."
"This is why we want to hear from the Commission that it will accept Parliament's argument and review its position."
"In a small country such as mine, Mr President, a new regulation on market thresholds could simply drive our breweries out of business."
"This must not be allowed to happen and the Commission must understand this."
"The approval of the Green Paper in January 1997 marked the start of the Commission's review of its competition policy in relation to distribution agreements."
"Since then we have received support for this review in the course of what has been a very open dialogue with Parliament."
"This support for one of the most important European competition policy reforms is clearly of great importance."
"The two proposals for Council regulations on the agenda today represent a second step in this process and should make it possible for the Commission to adopt new measures with regard to distribution agreements."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thyssen, for the support she has given the Commission's proposals in her report."
"Once the Council has approved the Council regulation, the Commission will draw up a proposal for a block regulation covering all vertical agreements below a certain market threshold."
"At the same time it will propose draft directives for those agreements not covered by the block exemption."
"The European Parliament will be informed of both proposals before the Commission adopts the final texts."
"The Commission supports a number of the amendments that have been tabled."
"Let me tell you which amendments the Commission has difficulty with and cannot support."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 2 on Regulation No 19/65 or Amendment No 1 on Regulation No 17."
"It is not the case that small and medium-sized enterprises in the beer and petrol sector may suffer adverse effects as a result of the policy review."
"SMEs in all sectors will benefit from the deregulation while the use of market share thresholds will ensure that dominant companies are unable to block off the market to new entrants."
"This is why a number of breweries and beer wholesalers support the policy review whereas some dominant players are opposed."
"There are a number of beer markets where market dominance seems to be a problem, which only highlights the need to treat this sector just like any other."
"However, the directives will take into account the specific situation of long-term investments in these and other sectors."
"For the same reason the Commission is unable to support Amendment No 3 on Regulation No 19/65."
"There should also be no need to stress that sector-specific regulations remain possible as these are always possible."
"The Commission also has objections to Amendments Nos 3 and 4 concerning the principle of legal privilege for in-house counsel."
"The law protects the confidentiality of written communication between an independent counsel and a company, therefore rendering it impossible for the Commission to use such documents as proof in applying European rules of competition."
"This protection is usually known as legal privilege."
"On the other hand, documents received or written by in-house counsel for the enterprise for which he works are not protected."
"The proposed amendments propose extending the principle of legal privilege to include in-house counsel."
"The Commission recognises the importance of this question but is unable to support the amendments, for three main reasons."
"First of all, this question lies beyond the scope of the present policy review which is concerned with competition policy as it relates to vertical agreements."
"The Commission's wide-ranging consultation in connection with its Green Paper did not include the question of legal privilege for in-house counsel."
"Accepting these amendments would mean changing the subject of the present legislative procedure and would result in a decision without prior consultation with all the parties involved."
"Secondly, we are at present busy considering an extensive reform of Regulation No 17, including a review of the Commission's powers of investigation."
"If any changes need to be made to the principle of legal privilege, it should be done in this framework."
"Thirdly, we do not believe that now is the time to resolve the question of legal privilege for in-house counsel."
"The proposed extension of this principle requires a new European status for in-house counsel, based on comparable rules on professional ethics and discipline. It will take some time to do this."
"Mr President, Mrs Thyssen has now supplemented her report with five or six questions, the first of which I propose to answer now, but I would ask Mrs Thyssen if she would be prepared to accept a written reply to the other questions tomorrow."
"I have noted them down here but in order to save time I should like to give a written reply."
"As to Mrs Lulling's question about the compelling reasons for changing the rules for the beer sector, the answer is that the present block exemption authorises market monopoly."
"No distinction is made as to whether a brewery controls 5 %, 30 % or 90 % of the cafés."
"That is not good policy as it does not protect competition."
"The present block exemption is also unnecessarily detailed in its formal requirements, resulting in unnecessary legal uncertainty."
"A good example of this is the British market."
"If there is no market monopoly then people have no reason to fear new regulations."
"This concludes my reply."
"Mr President, I have one more question, or rather a request for clarification. I would have been interested to know, and this has already been touched upon, how geographical catchment areas are to be defined for economic operators."
"How do you define local, regional, national and pan-European?"
"It seems to me that this is an essential criterion for exemption, so perhaps we could have a written answer."
"I should also like to give a written reply to this question."
"Mr President, I do not agree with the Commissioner's reply either, but I know that Mr van den Broek is not responsible, but Mr Van Miert."
"It is not possible to set thresholds in a small country such as mine where a small brewery can dominate, but in a very limited market, whereas a major brewery such as 'Bitburger', which is just next door to us and which is in a much stronger position and has a much bigger turnover, is not considered to be dominant because Germany is huge in comparison with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg."
"It will be the death of our breweries, and this must not be allowed to happen."
"We will also discuss this with Mr Van Miert."
"I do not want to attack Mr van den Broek."
"It is not his sector, but we cannot accept answers like that."
"It is not being responsible."
"Mr President, I will be brief."
"Of course I am prepared to accept written answers to my questions, but there is one question to which I should have liked to receive an oral reply because I believe it is important for this to be given in public."
"The question is whether the Commission will give an undertaking that its services responsible for competition policy will come to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy before the general block exemption regulation is finally adopted and before the guidelines are decided, and whether the Commission is ready to present the proposals to Parliament and we will have the chance to draw up another report on this."
"I feel that this is important if we are to consider the specific points raised by my colleagues in greater detail."
"On what Mrs Lulling said, it does indeed seem advisable, as she herself suggested, to take this point up with Commissioner Van Miert."
"I would of course like to give her a satisfactory answer now, but she has recognised that at the present time this is not really expected of me."
"In reply to Mrs Thyssen, I would say that I thought I had answered her first question in my speech."
"From what I have gathered here, this block exemption is under a certain time pressure at the moment, so any consultation must take place within a very short period."
"The present block exemptions expire at the end of the year."
"Finally, I should like to say that where Mrs Thyssen talks about consultation, if I heard correctly, I myself thought Mr Van Miert was thinking more about providing information, though of course information can also lead to an exchange of views."
"This is simply how I see it."
"Mr President, this is simply to say that in any event we plan to work very hard and fast during the coming parliamentary term with those Members of Parliament who are returned, or who very much hope to return."
"But we would very much like the opportunity to have an exchange of views on this issue before any final decision is taken."
"It was in this spirit that I drew up my report."
"In faithful cooperation with the Commission's services I limited myself to the legal aspects on the agenda, precisely because we had received an undertaking that we would be able to return to the details later."
"Thank you, Mrs Thyssen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr van den Broek has asked for the floor."
"I have a somewhat unusual request to do with the subject of enlargement which preceded the present item on the agenda."
"It was Mr Speciale, the rapporteur on Slovenia, who drew my attention to my mistake."
"I referred to a number of areas in which Slovenia had fallen behind in preparations for accession, but I failed to mention the following positive points which I would like to be added to the report on the previous subject if this is possible."
"The words are as follows: since the publication of the interim report, however, more progress has been made, in other words more progress in the preparations for enlargement."
"A number of important laws have been passed, including in the areas of VAT, excise, company law and the bank act. A government programme has also been approved for 82 priority laws in connection with the acquis communautaire which will be enacted before the end of this year by means of shortened parliamentary procedures."
"Mr President, I would very much appreciate it if the rapporteur can be borne out on that point, and I also offer my apologies to Mr Speciale for this omission."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"Your comments will be noted in the Minutes."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of our agenda for this night sitting, and I should like to thank the House's services for their invaluable assistance during what has been a long and busy day."
"The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"On Rules 2, 5 and 119 of the Rules of Procedure."
"I am here, but I refuse to take part in the roll-call votes in protest at the fact that the Quaestors have failed to take a decision for the appeal proceedings before the Court in Luxembourg, which I requested in writing last August, on Mr Chamier's decision unlawfully to reduce my general parliamentary allowances."
"Your comments will be included in the Minutes of the sitting."
"Mr President, yesterday the war in Yugoslavia claimed its greatest number of victims."
"Seventy innocent Albanian-speaking citizens of Yugoslavia, among them women and children, were killed by NATO bombs."
"I do not know if we should pay our respects to them."
"You can decide."
"It seems to me that the House has extended and is daily extending its sympathy to the victims - to all the victims - of the conflict."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I have a rather mundane and minor point."
"Could my name be added to those who were present?"
"You will see that I was present because I voted in all of the roll-call votes, but I am not on the list."
"It will be done, Mr Balfe."
"Mr President, I have a rather mundane point as well."
"Yesterday, during the vote on my report and Mr Chanterie's report, Mr Collins reported to the House that there was a photographer in the balcony photographing individual Members' papers and voting lists."
"I would like to know what the outcome of these investigations were, particularly given the amount of lobbying which I received concerning my report."
"I wonder whether representatives of the oil companies or the bus companies are trying to get a squint at what the Socialist voting lists were."
"Could the Bureau let us know the outcome of their investigations into this please?"
"As you know, Mr McMahon, after Mr Collins pointed out what was happening, Parliament's officials ejected the photographer."
"We are of course able to provide the information you asked for and you can even have it in writing if you like."
"Mr President, yesterday morning, during the vote on the resolution on the Berlin summit, Parliament adopted two amendments: Amendments Nos 18 and 19."
"I would like to ask that, before they are approved and forwarded to the institutions to which they are addressed, you have the competent services check that there is in fact a link between a resolution on the Berlin summit and Amendments Nos 18 and 19 which the House adopted."
"I imagine that you mean Parliament's legal service."
"I shall do as you request."
"Mr President, on my return to Parliament I have noted that it is particularly difficult to move through the corridors, especially when voting is about to take place."
"Of course, I am not suggesting that a one-way system be introduced or that Members walk about with a bell, but I do think that the great many visitors to this Parliament should let Members through who obviously wish to get to the Hemicycle on time."
"You are right that this is a problem."
"We need to strike a balance between the old days when we had to ask people to come and visit us and the current situation where we have so many visitors because the European Parliament has grown in importance, including as a result of our own work."
"Mr President, I was given to understand that the President was going to be in the chair this morning at this time and I hope he is not unavoidably detained."
"I do not know what problems you can be referring to, Mr Chichester; at any rate, it has long been scheduled that I would be in the Chair at the start of this sitting."
"I do not know where you have your information from."
"I had an appointment to see the President this morning at 9.30."
"He advised me that he was unable to keep that appointment because he was going to be taking the chair at that time."
"So I was just expressing anxiety and concern that he is not able to be here in the chair."
"Well, look at that: you mentioned the President and here he is!"
"Mr President, the Quaestors have informed Members that we shall be in our offices for the last time in May before the removal takes place."
"Now I have just discovered this morning that groups of visitors are already being shown round the new buildings."
"As a Member of Parliament, I must say that I have the distinct feeling that we have been left in the dark here, because we have had no opportunity for a preview of the new buildings, let alone examples of our offices."
"I regard that as a great mistake, and I ask that we find a means of rectifying that situation as quickly as possible."
"I think I may prove you wrong on that point, Mr Konrad."
"All the groups have had the chance to let individual Members visit the new building: they did this at different times and in different ways, but the opportunity was provided."
"As you know, there are some problems with the completion of the building and the timing of our move."
"Mr President, I should like to raise a slightly different matter."
"Rumour has it that there is every likelihood that the Statute for Members will be adopted by Parliament at the next part-session."
"Now I think that, if that does indeed happen, it would be the last opportunity and could create difficulties if the Members' Statute were not respected in the individual countries."
"It might perhaps be helpful if the President were to send a note to the various national governments and parliaments, pointing out the problem that could arise, in other words a discrepancy between the decisions of the European Parliament and any decisions on incompatibility which might be different from the ones which we have taken."
"As you know, this is an issue that is being looked at carefully by the President-in-Office of the Council."
"I am sure that the President of Parliament will provide all honourable Members with up-to-date information on it, and that will also enable us to consider the possible implications which you mention."
"The Minutes were approved"
"1998 annual reports"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0119/99 by Mrs De Esteban Martín, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 1998 (C4-0138/99); -A4-0117/99 by Mr Newman, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions during the parliamentary year 1998-1999.Before we embark on this joint debate, the European Ombudsman - whom I once again welcome to the House - will present his annual activity report and also his special report."
"I give the floor to Mr Söderman, the European Ombudsman."
"Mr President, let me begin by saying how grateful I am for the opportunity to address the European Parliament concerning my annual report for 1998."
"This is the fourth annual report of the European Ombudsman and the last to be presented during this legislature."
"When the annual report for 1997 was dealt with by Parliament, some critical voices suggested that the Ombudsman had success in only a small number of cases."
"This view was reached on the basis of all the complaints received, including those which were outside the mandate."
"I do not believe that this way of judging the results of an Ombudsman is really fair."
"There is not much to be done about a complaint which is outside the mandate other than to advise the complainant or transfer the complaint to a competent body."
"We have done that in almost 80 % of such cases so that citizens do not usually leave us empty-handed."
"In many cases these complaints could be dealt with effectively by an Ombudsman or a similar body at national level."
"We therefore try consistently to promote the idea that these non-judicial bodies be encouraged and assisted in dealing with complaints from European citizens concerning Community law."
"Although there have been calls to broaden the mandate of the European Ombudsman to deal also with complaints against national authorities, especially in cases concerning freedom of movement, I still believe it is preferable to create an effective system of cooperation with the national ombudsmen and similar bodies."
"During 1998 the Ombudsman's office received 1372 new complaints, compared with 1181 in 1997 and 842 in 1996."
"We also closed 185 enquiries with a reasoned decision as compared to 101 in 1997."
"In 45 % of these cases the institution settled the matter, a friendly solution was found or the case was closed with a critical remark."
"In 1997 and 1996 the figures were 40 % and 35 %."
"During 1998 no maladministration was found in 52 % of the cases in which an inquiry was carried out."
"A finding of no maladministration is not always a negative result for the complainant."
"The institution or body has to explain its behaviour to the complainant and, in some cases, even manages to convince the complainant that it has acted correctly."
"Today is the right moment to try to summarise what we have achieved together so far in cooperation with the Committee on Petitions and the European Parliament."
"Firstly, we have achieved a practice of cooperation in dealing with complaints and petitions which has been described in the annual reports of both bodies."
"Furthermore, we have developed a fruitful dialogue through the committee's reports on the annual reports of the Ombudsman, beginning with the first report by Mrs Ahern, through the reports of Mr Papakyriazis, Mr Newman and, this year, Mrs De Esteban Martín."
"For example, the call in the Papakyriazis report for a clear definition of the term 'maladministration' led me to offer a definition in the annual report for 1997."
"Following Mr Newman's report, the European Parliament adopted a resolution welcoming the definition."
"The practice of smooth and efficient dealings with the Ombudsman's reports in the European Parliament has now been properly and formally established by bringing Parliament's Rules of Procedure in line with the Statute of the Ombudsman and by expressly providing for the competent committee - the Committee on Petitions - to deal with both the Ombudsman's annual and possible special reports."
"Secondly, an own-initiative inquiry into public access to documents, supported by the committee through the report by Mrs Thors and by the European Parliament, has led all the Community institutions and bodies concerned to adopt rules on public access to documents, except for the Court of Justice."
"We have recently written to the European Central Bank to enquire if it has already adopted rules on public access to documents."
"Thirdly, I should like to refer to the idea of a code of good administrative behaviour, which was first mentioned in the Perry report on the Committee on Petitions' own activities for 1996-1997 and supported in the Newman report on the Ombudsman's annual report for 1997."
"It appears likely that such a code will soon become a reality, as the European Commission has adopted the draft in its first reading before the Commissioners resigned."
"The new Commission may of course even improve the draft before adopting it."
"Fourthly, we have managed to improve the administrative procedure the European Commission uses in its role as the guardian of the Treaty when dealing with complaints or petitions from European citizens."
"The procedure has become more open and effective as a result."
"I should also like to say a few words about the recent revelations and accusations about fraud and corruption in the European administration, in particular within the European Commission."
"An open administration makes most cases of fraud and corruption very difficult to carry out and extremely easy to detect."
"A closed administration, on the other hand, that conducts its business through secret meetings and the holding of secret files and documents creates precisely the murky circumstances that enable fraud and corruption to flourish."
"So openness is an effective tool in preventing and fighting fraud and corruption."
"In the present administrative practice, there is still an old-fashioned principle of exaggerated hierarchy."
"This principle, when applied, leads to a lack of motivation amongst those staff who really interact with the citizens."
"It makes all kinds of malpractice easier because the properly-acting staff cannot speak about their concerns over the activities of the institution."
"If civil servants cannot speak and write about their daily work without the consent of their superiors, this does not encourage a motivated and sound atmosphere in the workplace."
"So more transparency and less old-fashioned hierarchy would give more motivation to the staff and spare the EU administration many of its troubles."
"In improving transparency, it is essential that the new regulation on public access to documents under the Amsterdam Treaty be adopted as soon as it is possible to do so."
"It must contain modern and comprehensive principles in this domain."
"It is also essential that the Statute of the European Ombudsman contain a clear provision to give the Ombudsman the right to inspect all necessary files and documents, if unnecessary and time-consuming disputes with the institutions are to be avoided."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Petitions supports my initiative in this respect in the De Esteban report."
"I hope that this position will be confirmed by the European Parliament."
"I should like to use this opportunity to thank all the Community institutions and bodies for another year of constructive cooperation."
"I wish especially to address the Commission and its member responsible, Mrs Gradin, and thank her for her commitment to an open administration."
"My thanks are due also to the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, Mr Fontana, and all the members of the committee for their supportive attitude in their contacts with the Ombudsman's office."
"Special thanks go to Mrs De Esteban for her professional and competent work in drafting the report now before you."
"Thank you for your attention."
"Applause"
"Thank you, Mr Söderman."
"I give the floor to the rapporteur, Mrs De Esteban Martín."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should firstly like to congratulate the Ombudsman's office and its services on the transparency and speed with which it has provided details of its activities not only to Parliament and the Committee on Petitions but also directly to citizens and associations in the Member States."
"This House has always defended the institution of the Ombudsman as guarantor of the protection of citizens' rights in cases of possible maladministration on the part of Community institutions and bodies. It has also always defended the need to enhance the relations between these institutions and the public."
"However, protecting the rights of Community citizens would not be enough if closer collaboration and cooperation were not fostered between Parliament, through the Committee on Petitions, as the committee responsible, and the Ombudsman."
"It is no coincidence that the defence of citizens' rights is the chief aim of both institutions. This collaboration should therefore continue to guarantee these rights and the democratic work carried out by the Union in order to enhance the credibility of our administration."
"The institution of the Ombudsman constitutes one of the most important elements for European citizenship. It is also important in improving the democratic control of the Community administration, democratic control that can be seen as the task of this House, as the body which directly represents the people of this Community."
"Turning to the annual report presented by the Ombudsman, we must highlight the rise in the number of complaints submitted, a development the Ombudsman himself mentioned."
"A total of 1 372 complaints were lodged this year, 191 more than last year, which goes to show how important the Ombudsman is in the eyes of the public in terms of rectifying the alleged irregularities that may occur in the administration of the European Union."
"Over the years, Parliament has noted the increasing interest the public has taken in the European institutions and how the decisions taken here affect their daily lives."
"Making administration more transparent and accessible to the public is one of the main aims of all the national administrations in the Member States."
"Therefore, the Community administration should not aim at anything less and should endeavor to make such accessibility a reality."
"This House has adopted various reports on the transparency and simplification of Community law which have brought us closer to achieving this aim."
"An important step that needs to be taken to create harmony between the Community institutions and our citizens is to actually draw up a code of good administrative behaviour to increase the level of trust between officials and the public and to ensure that the code is accessible and easily understood by all."
"However, we must be aware that this code should not overlook the specific nature of each of the Community institutions."
"For example, I believe that within the European Parliament, given the nature of the institution, such a code should be negotiated with all the political groups."
"With this same aim of promoting collaboration between the institutions and the public, it is important to highlight the involvement of citizens in the preliminary infringement proceedings provided for in Article 169 of the Treaty."
"Similarly, I think that it is vital for the Ombudsman's work to ensure that his statute is amended, as I mention in the report, in order to allow him as effective access as possible to the documents related to the inquiries he is involved in."
"I believe that the work carried out by the Ombudsman in the field of information and communication serves as a good example for other European institutions, especially as regards the use of new communication technologies, for example, the use of the Internet to make the institution more accessible to the public."
"However, and this is something that the report also refers to, we need to make greater efforts to provide citizens with proper information on their rights so that no one is prevented from exercising his rights through ignorance of how to proceed."
"This information should be provided by the Community institutions through the press and the audiovisual media. In this way, we would avoid, among other things, a situation whereby more than 69 % of the complaints submitted to the Ombudsman in recent years have been beyond his remit, for example, the many complaints every year about restrictions on the freedom of movement."
"In this connection, I should like to acknowledge the efforts of the Ombudsman in his relations with national and regional ombudsmen."
"Such collaboration will clearly enhance the role played by these authorities and might lead to a system whereby those matters that one authority is not empowered to deal with may be passed on to the relevant body elsewhere, which will be able to resolve them more effectively."
"In order to achieve all of the aims that we have outlined, the office of the European Ombudsman must respond effectively to our citizens, which is why the report congratulates Mr Söderman on the commitment he has shown in trying to ensure that his secretariat functions properly."
"Although his efforts are appreciated, it is clear that for the secretariat to function properly, we must firstly have sufficient financial resources and we must also draw up a statute for the officials that work for the Ombudsman."
"Applause"
"Mr President, the right to petition is an important aspect of European citizenship."
"The right to petition can be exercised by all residents of the European Union, not just EU citizens, and by organisations based in the European Union."
"Petitions are admissible if they come within the fields of activity of the European Community."
"This definition is wide enough for the Committee on Petitions to apply common sense and political judgment in deciding whether a petition is admissible or not."
"During the past five years of this mandate 10 million people from all 15 European Union Member States have signed over 6 500 petitions."
"These fall into two broad categories: those raising individual problems and those raising broader policy questions."
"The areas most concerned are social security and pension problems often arising out of worker migration, free movement of persons, recognition of qualifications, taxation including VAT, environmental issues and animal welfare issues."
"However, the Committee on Petitions has only administrative and secretarial support."
"It does not have an investigatory staff."
"Therefore, our investigations into the grievances of petitioners rely on officials of the Commission and the Member States' representations to the European Union."
"The Commission officials cooperate greatly in our work and we thank them for this."
"Nevertheless, for those minority of petitions which find fault with the Commission, it is obviously not good practice that we are so reliant on the Commission staff."
"As for Member State governments - who do not seem to be represented today - through their representations to the European Union or collectively as the Council, their cooperation with the committee is usually only the minimum level possible and they are not prepared to send officials to the committee to argue the merits of petitions with committee members."
"Member States need to be more positive and to reply fully and promptly to requests for information and action addressed to them by the Commission concerning petitions."
"Naturally during our meetings the committee members have and do exercise the most vital role in questioning and urging on the Commission officials and in the decisions we make."
"In fact, if it appears that petitioners are being unfairly treated or fobbed off we take up the cudgels on their behalf."
"In a number of cases every year a petition leads to the opening of formal infringement proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty against Member States not implementing European Union law correctly, to the detriment of our citizens."
"The analysis of the infringement procedures since 1996 shows a minimum of 97 total cases linked to petitions out of 535 cases relating to direct complaints for which the Commission sent letters of formal notice thus initiating infringement proceedings."
"These figures indicate that petitions play an important role in the detection and handling of infringement cases."
"In its annual report on the application of Community law, the Commission should clearly identify the cases where infringement procedures under Article 169 were initiated through petitions."
"This is underestimated at the moment."
"The Member States must improve the action taken in cases in which infringements are reported."
"The European Parliament's information brochure for the public on the right to petition states that petitions often reveal practices in a Member State which are contrary to the letter or the spirit of Community legislation."
"In some cases the involvement of the Community authorities has prompted the national authorities to apply Community law more correctly."
"As a result of petitions the European Parliament has had a positive effect on the daily lives of citizens and has been able to act to find a solution to actual cases involving matters within the Community remit."
"This brochure needs circulating much more widely than at present."
"I should like to finish by saying that, as the only MEP with continuous full and active membership of the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions since its formation twelve-and-a-half years ago in January 1987, I hope that MEPs elected to the new Parliament will ensure that they continue to take seriously the right of European citizens and residents to petition the European Parliament."
"As this is likely to be my final speech to the European Parliament meeting in plenary session, I want to thank all those people whom I have worked with over 15 years' membership of the European Parliament and, in particular, the good people of Greater Manchester Central who under the fine individual constituency system I have had the honour to represent since 1984."
"I thank you and them."
"Applause"
"Mr Newman, I am sure all colleagues would want to thank you for the work you have done in this Parliament and, in particular, I am well aware of the vast amount of work you have done in the Committee on Petitions."
"The first time I came to this Parliament I had the opportunity to meet with you in that committee and we had the opportunity to work together for our citizens, which has always been your main interest."
"This House thanks you for your work."
"Mr President, I heartily endorse your words of gratitude to Mr Newman."
"As he told us, he has been a member of the Committee on Petitions since it was created in January 1987."
"I entered Parliament in March of the same year, and ever since then I have been a member of the Committee on Petitions, where I have been able to observe his efforts and his achievements on behalf of the European people."
"I should like to express my sincere thanks to him for that and for this annual report. May I also thank Mrs De Esteban Martín for her report on the Ombudsman's annual report."
"Both of them, like Mr Söderman himself, have presented reports which show very comprehensively that dialogue with the people is an indispensable element of European democracy and will remain so."
"What this means for us is that the Committee on Petitions is the interface between the European people and their Parliament when it comes to enforcing Community law."
"Regrettably, that fact is all too often disregarded by national, regional and local authorities, whether out of unawareness or because of a combination of bureaucratic power and national self-seeking."
"By acting as that link, we have been able to assist in some cases, for example in securing recognition of academic or professional qualifications and provision of welfare benefits, as well as in solving petitioners' specific problems."
"So that this direct contact with the citizens of the Union continues to be guaranteed in future, we in the committee are unanimous in advocating the preservation of a separate Committee on Petitions. In order to overcome the general information deficit among the people of Europe as regards their rights, we call on the relevant administrative departments of Parliament and the Commission to establish telephone advice centres in the Member States, and in particular to go on developing the whole sphere of information and communication technology with all the opportunities it offers."
"Our cooperation with the Ombudsman has always been extremely fruitful."
"For that I should like to reiterate my sincere thanks to Mr Söderman who, in his wrangling with European administrative bodies, has never been deterred by the initial placatory answers he has received from administrators but has insisted on a satisfactory response."
"His initiatives and enquiries have brought greater transparency and openness to the European bureaucracy."
"Indeed, the draft code of conduct for good administrative practice which the Commission presented in January was developed as a result of his own initiative, together with that of Mr Perry."
"We therefore call for the Ombudsman to be given access to all documentation in the pursuit of his enquiries and for all civil servants to provide him with the information he needs, rather than having to refer him to their superiors; these measures must be implemented so that the Ombudsman can work without unnecessary obstacles."
"I am convinced that cooperation between the Committee on Petitions, with its scope for intervention, and the Ombudsman, with his wide remit, will become an increasingly important factor in the promotion of democracy and the enforcement of citizens' rights in the European Union."
"Mr President, Parliament this week has been debating very many important issues, such as war and peace in Kosovo."
"We have heard speeches from the Commission President-designate, Mr Prodi, and a speech from the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, the German Chancellor Mr Schroeder."
"This morning's debate may well seem insignificant alongside those great events of the week - but it is not."
"All parliaments have four roles: to legislate, to control finance, to control the administration and to represent the citizen; but the greatest of those roles is the last of them."
"Our supreme responsibility is to represent and protect the rights of the 370 million European citizens."
"No committee of this Parliament performs that role more directly for the citizen than the Committee on Petitions and no European office-holder has the interests of the individual citizen higher on his list of responsibilities than the European Ombudsman."
"Given the value of the right to petition for the individual citizen I fully endorse the recommendations of the Newman report."
"As has already been said this morning, Mr Newman has worked very hard for the Committee on Petitions."
"He and I come from different political traditions, but we share a similar belief in the importance of protecting the rights of citizens."
"My group would like to thank him for the work he has done in the Committee on Petitions over many years."
"I will use this speech to stress just one section of that report."
"It is paragraph 8, where we regret, as did Mr Newman, the continued absence of any representative of the Council of Ministers attending the Committee on Petitions."
"In recent years, British, German, Austrian presidencies have boycotted this committee."
"I hope that the Finnish presidency, coming from the Scandinavian democratic tradition, will set a better example."
"However, given that the Secretary-General of this Parliament himself at one stage was proposing the abolition of the Committee on Petitions - and as I understand it some of the big groups have only at the last minute backed away from proposals to abolish the Committee on Petitions - perhaps we can understand why the Council of Ministers adopts that attitude."
"But we in the European People's Party have never waivered in our determination to keep the Committee on Petitions."
"Like the Newman report, I support the report by Mrs De Esteban on the Ombudsman."
"I did not vote for Mr Jacob Söderman to become the Ombudsman in Europe."
"I was wrong."
"There is one word in that report that stands out, and that is the word 'irreproachable' used to describe cooperation between the Ombudsman and Parliament."
"Irreproachable is not a word that is often used dealing with European institutions, but I am happy to see it and it was rightly used in describing the work of the Ombudsman and his relations with this Parliament."
"I support him in his call for greater transparency."
"That is certainly necessary."
"I thank him for continuing the bid I made to see that we should have a code of good administrative behaviour."
"I would say to this Parliament: if we want the Ombudsman to work well, we must make sure he has the powers and the resources to do that job."
"We should give him our fullest support in achieving it."
"Mr President, Mr Ombudsman, it is a pleasure to be able to agree with everyone today in saying that the office of the European Ombudsman has so far proved to be a very important feature of EU life. Having an Ombudsman facilitates openness and transparency in the Union."
"Perhaps I might mention a few of the many successful initiatives taken."
"First of all, we had the own-initiative report on public access to documents; as a result, virtually all the institutions now have some kind of code of conduct."
"Secondly, the Central Bank has been approached with a request for access to its documents."
"Thirdly, Council of Ministers documents will in future be deemed to include presidency papers."
"Fourthly, the absence of an inventory of documents within the Commission has been branded maladministration."
"And fifth, the Council has now drawn up a list of measures adopted under the third pillar."
"Once a functioning Commission is in place, we should soon see a new regulation on public access to documents. Some very significant parameters have already been established by the measures and initiatives to which I have referred."
"It is unfortunate that the whole process of the Commission's resignation has noticeably slowed down this work."
"It is also a pity that the decisions taken so far by the Council on public access to third pillar documents have proved relatively insignificant in their impact."
"What are we, the public, set to gain from learning about regulatory texts that have already been adopted and are available over the Internet?"
"We also need to know about future plans."
"Over recent days, much attention has rightly been focused on the 'Enfopoldo' document. This comprises a draft version of a text designed to regulate the interception of communications via the new media, together with a draft convention on mutual assistance between the Member States in respect of criminal cases."
"The whole exercise has been shrouded in secrecy; the Council's new pledges have been of scant value in this particular instance."
"It is not enough to keep us informed of when third pillar meetings are being held and what measures have actually been taken."
"We also need access to information on matters pending, and we should be given details of initiatives coming from the working groups, the presidency and the Member States."
"The debate on the Austrian 'strategy document' also pinpointed shortcomings in the Council's arrangements for transparency."
"As for police and judicial cooperation under the third pillar, many measures touch on the fundamental rights of ordinary citizens."
"I therefore look forward to the time when, with the backing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Ombudsman will be able to envisage overseeing a body such as Europol."
"We were told yesterday that the German Presidency intends to come forward soon with a timetable for the intergovernmental conference."
"This will be an opportunity for reviewing the status of the Ombudsman. His role must be strengthened in the manner called for in the De Esteban Martín report."
"Equally, we need to ensure continuation of the good cooperation observed in the past between the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman. The latter will need to forge cooperation with ombudsmen or equivalent bodies in the Member States, in this way facilitating the fight against breaches of civil liberties in the actual application of Community law."
"Finally, let me say a few words about the vote that will be taking place today on the future of the Committee on Petitions."
"This committee must be allowed to continue its work, but I hope that the Commission will be able to provide comparable assurances on the processing of petitions to those it has given with regard to complaints under Article 169 of the Treaty."
"I am particularly gratified that Commissioner Monti - who takes a special interest in this article - is with us today and has undertaken to speed up the procedures governing complaints."
"Sadly, it would appear that the Commission has been listening to the Member States and is slowing down the processing of complaints within the Commission."
"I also feel strongly that the newly constituted Committee on Petitions should exercise scrutiny over internal administration, although I concede that the current committee worked very hard indeed to speed up the handling of petitions."
"But it still takes far too long for a complaint to reach the Committee on Petitions at the moment."
"In conclusion, may I join the chorus of speakers who have expressed their heartfelt thanks to our former chairman, Mr Newman. He has done an excellent job in demonstrating the importance of this committee."
"And as he pointed out, 10 million citizens have availed themselves of its existence during the life of this Parliament."
"Mr President, I shall probably not use all of the five minutes allocated because I am not used to having such a long time to speak and usually have to keep my speeches brief."
"I should like to begin by expressing my delight that the proposal put forward by the Conference of Presidents, which will be put to the vote at midday, includes - among its 17 remaining committees - the Committee on Petitions in its own right and not as secondary to another committee."
"In my view, the Committee on Petitions is vital for the citizens of Europe."
"I fully agree with the rapporteur, Mr Newman, that this committee is constitutional in nature and should be maintained within Parliament's future committee structure."
"A short time ago, Mr Newman himself headed a delegation from the Committee on Petitions - a delegation that included our colleagues Laura de Esteban and Barbara Schmidbauer - on a visit to the Doñana park. This visit was aimed precisely at allaying the fears of the local population that had been expressed in a great many petitions submitted to the Committee on Petitions, fears relating to the Doñana national park, which is a biosphere reserve."
"While we were there we had the opportunity to meet not only representatives of the institutions involved - who explained the problems the area was experiencing - but also the ecological groups and members of the public who had expressed their concern at what was happening."
"I am therefore of the opinion that bringing the European institutions closer to the citizens' concerns sets an excellent example and it should continue indefinitely."
"In my view, this is one of the lessons to be learned from the work both of the Committee on Petitions and Mr Newman, who we were delighted to accompany to the Doñana area."
"I refer to this issue precisely because my relationship with the Committee on Petitions is based on the work I carry out within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Most petitions received by the Committee on Petitions relate to social security, the internal market or the environment."
"The fact that so many petitions are received in relation to the environment clearly proves the extent to which the people and the non-governmental organisations - who submit the complaints - are concerned about preserving the natural environment."
"What problems arise in dealing with these petitions?"
"The rapporteur and other Members have already referred to the problem of how slow the process is."
"In environmental issues, and I do not know if this is true of other areas, such slow progress can have irreversible effects."
"When a complaint is made that a road is going to be built in a natural area and decisions on it are not taken immediately, the road might still go ahead although the final decision may rule that it is illegal."
"As a result, the fact that the process is so slow becomes much more evident in this field."
"Therefore, a more effective method of dealing with petitions perhaps needs to be found between the Committee on Petitions, the European Commission and the Member States during the next parliamentary term. Perhaps we will have to ensure that the Member States comply with the demands of Parliament and the European Commission immediately rather than confusing the issue still further by taking far too long to deal with matters since this might have negative effects."
"If this does not happen, the public will feel increasingly frustrated about the concerns they express to the Committee on Petitions regarding the various problems that exist."
"The successful coordination that has been developed between the European Ombudsman and the Committee on Petitions must also be welcomed."
"Both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman should have their own independent budget to be used reasonably and sufficient staff, as these are two institutions that genuinely uphold the rights of European citizens."
"I also think that we need to develop and draw up a code of good administrative behaviour which would help the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman in their work and thus help make European integration more meaningful for the people of Europe."
"Mr President, I believe that brings me to the end of what I wanted to say and, as you can see, I still have a minute left to speak."
"I find it is impossible to speak for five minutes when I am used to only speaking for one."
"Mr President, Ombudsman, Commissioner, it seldom happens that the quality of a rapporteur's work is quite so pleasing as the content of this report."
"The European Ombudsman's annual report for 1998 shows that his institution has now become one of the best-functioning and most effective in the European Union."
"This applies particularly in terms of closeness to the people, which as we all know is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union."
"Mrs De Esteban Martín highlights this point so convincingly in her report that one can only hope it will be very widely read, particularly by those who would be responsible for fulfilling Professor Söderman's requests for his office to have its own budget and for the change of status he has suggested, developments that would enable him to continue his work."
"Against the background of the Commission's resignation, the call made by the Ombudsman for a code of good administrative practice to which citizens would have recourse is extremely topical."
"Foremost among the responsible parties I referred to is the European Parliament, since the European Ombudsman is commissioned by Parliament."
"One of the duties of the Committee on Petitions is to discharge that responsibility."
"How can it do that if it is not adequately equipped for its work?"
"The Committee on Petitions has already approached the parliamentary administration on this point, although its plea did not elicit much of a response."
"Every Member of this House should look at the annexes to Mr Newman's report in particular, which bring home the absurdity of the proposition that the work of the Committee on Petitions could be divided up among other committees."
"I am sorry to say that I must close by asking certain bodies in this House how they feel about the rights of their constituents when they seek to diminish the status of the basic right of petition by abolishing the Committee on Petitions, or when they try to change the name of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and call it the Committee on Legal Affairs and Consumers' Rights."
"The people of the Union are citizens first and foremost, then consumers, and any rights they have as consumers surely only exist by virtue of their civil rights."
"Allow me, Mr President, to thank Mr Newman, not only for his instructive and authoritative report but also for the work he has done in this important committee."
"I was only on that committee for a short time, but I was able to experience at first hand all those things for which my honourable colleagues have been expressing their gratitude."
"Thank you, Mr Newman."
"Mr President, we too would like to congratulate the Ombudsman and the chairman of the Committee on Petitions, of which I am a member and which I value most highly because it deals with citizens' rights."
"We are here to protect those rights because we act on the public's behalf, and it is becoming increasingly necessary for us to be able to hear what they themselves have to say."
"The institution of the Ombudsman is answerable to Parliament, which I think is a good thing because it helps him to be independent, a position which he exploits to the full, as we have seen from the report he has presented to Parliament today."
"I welcome the fact that he called so strongly for an open administration, and I could not help thinking that officials in various Member States have the right to speak, but this still seems to be taboo here in the European institutions, as we have seen with Mr Van Buitenen."
"The facts have borne this man out, yet the Commission still feels it necessary to continue with disciplinary proceedings against him, and he has been removed from his post in the financial control department where he had done some excellent work."
"It was precisely as a result of his work that we in Parliament were able to act and, together with the Committee on Budgetary Control and later the Committee of Independent Experts, arrived at such damning conclusions."
"I would therefore strongly urge that we should use all our influence to ensure that Mr Van Buitenen is reinstated."
"I think the Ombudsman certainly made his point in calling for openness and information, and I would like to conclude by urging a change of direction, so that Europe comes to stand not for a bureaucracy behind closed doors, but for democracy and transparency."
"Mr President, Ombudsman, as is the case every year, the debate on the reports concerning the work of the Committee on Petitions and of the Ombudsman is an opportunity to remind people of how important these two bodies are in terms of establishing trust between the Community institutions and the people of the Member States."
"Recent experience has highlighted, as well as reminding those who had forgotten, that remoteness and a lack of transparency lead to irresponsible behaviour and fraud."
"The common good needs to be constantly enhanced by daily realities."
"Without this, it risks becoming the confused expression of individual interests."
"By their very nature, the Community institutions are the furthest removed from daily life."
"Officials who are lost in the interminable corridors of their offices in Brussels try to draw up uniform rules in all areas that are to be applied to all the different national traditions."
"In the worst cases, these texts merely add rules with no European dimension to existing national legislation."
"It is therefore not surprising that the implementation of all these absurd Community rules might generate an increasing number of difficulties that form the basis of the appeals lodged to the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman."
"Both bodies should certainly be granted the necessary resources to function properly. However, is it not more urgent to reform the process of European integration so as to prevent these drifts and the complaints they generate?"
"Artificial empires always end up collapsing because all too often they forget about the people that are involved."
"Despite their good points, in the future, the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman will not be enough to offset the lack of consistency and excesses of a technocratic machine."
"This machine will inevitably lead to a rise in the number of problems and complaints from the citizens, who might find it hard to understand why these rules are not useful, realistic or applicable."
"Mr President, speaking here today, just 58 days away from the elections, and in the dying days of this European Parliament, I feel that the joint debate on the Committee on Petitions and on the European Ombudsman is of special significance and, as a review of the entire five-year term, will serve as a de facto pointer towards the coming elections."
"This joint debate will also pass on a heritage to the next European Parliament as it takes over from the current one."
"I therefore believe that it is a special honour for us all to take part in today's debate."
"It is a joint debate because the Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman function jointly."
"The operation of these bodies is joint yet distinct, complementary but without their powers overlapping and becoming confused, and with absolute respect for the independence of the European Ombudsman."
"I would like to thank our rapporteurs, Mrs De Esteban Martín and Mr Newman, for their reports which, as always in this committee, are the end product of the collective contribution and work of all its members."
"Mrs De Esteban Martín, I would like to make just one small parenthesis here and thank Mr Newman warmly for the help he has given to all of us through his example, but especially for the help he has given to ensure the smooth operation of this committee, and not just for the 15 years he has served the European Parliament."
"I am very glad that today - and it is perhaps not a coincidence - we will soon be called upon to vote on the continuation of the work of the Committee on Petitions."
"I have the feeling that the Committee on Petitions has come out of this period of questioning rebaptised, and precisely because the European Parliament has realised the extent of its contribution."
"Mr Söderman, Mr Perry has referred to your appointment and I will add to what he said by saying that I had the pleasure and the good fortune to vote for you as Ombudsman."
"I am delighted that my choice has been vindicated."
"I think that Mr Söderman, as someone who has represented the institution, has offered a new creation, a new body, to Europe and to the European Union."
"Mr President, I propose to speak about the annex to Mr Newman's report on my work as President's mediator for transnationally abducted children."
"But first of all I would like to pay tribute to Mr Newman."
"He has been a veritable 'British bulldog' in that committee, continually raising his voice in the name of the citizens of the Community."
"We will definitely miss you Eddy."
"I had also hoped that I would have a chance to personally thank President Gil-Robles because he has been a continual support to me in my work as mediator for abducted children, and also to thank Mr Söderman for his excellent work as European Ombudsman."
"You will note in the report that in the past year I have dealt with 29 petitions as mediator."
"When we receive a petition about abducted children we immediately make contact with the petitioner."
"Abducted children are always an emergency and have to be dealt with as such."
"They cannot wait to go through the long process of administration."
"Good law exists to deal with the problem of transnationally abducted children."
"But it is not always implemented in a proper way."
"Because of that, I have had an increasingly heavy work load in relation to this issue."
"The Council of Ministers should make a point of discussing this as soon as possible so that we can establish some kind of ground rules to respond to the problem."
"It is an increasing problem."
"The Hague Convention is meant to do one thing, and one thing only."
"It is not a custody hearing on children."
"It is a piece of legislation that requires children to be returned to the country where they habitually reside, for discussions and decisions about their custody to be worked out."
"There is considerable international ignorance about family law and what happens in the event of marital breakdown and children being taken back to a country where they do not normally live."
"We continue to have very serious problems with countries that have not signed the Hague Convention and where there are still a number of abduction cases."
"Our big problem lies primarily with countries that have religious courts - but not exclusively."
"Many European states do not implement the Hague Convention either in spirit or, indeed, in law."
"We have recently had a very significant success concerning a French mother and a German father."
"We are very happy with the decision by the German courts."
"But all too often these cases are heard in front of judges who are either ignorant of or badly informed about the law relating to child abduction."
"We need special courts that will deal with these issues as quickly as possible to prevent the inevitable trauma, particularly to the children, but also to both parents."
"Most of these cases are dealt with by national central authorities."
"Inevitably I get the cases that have not worked out that way."
"All our countries need the Hague Convention."
"In addition to my work in the committee I have also participated, on behalf of Parliament, in a great many international conferences."
"An increasing amount of concern is being expressed in all the Member States about the increase in the incidence of child abduction."
"I would like to thank Parliament for its assistance in this matter."
"Madam President, I should like to say a few words about the annual report by the Ombudsman and the report by Mrs De Esteban Martín, although I need say very little about the latter."
"It is a good report and, overall, I agree with everything it says."
"The office of the Ombudsman is manifestly playing an increasingly important role."
"The Ombudsman has a very positive effect on the whole EU system."
"I myself have been in contact with him and have met many other people who have approached his office."
"They generally seemed happy with the arrangements and their reception, including the manner in which their concerns were dealt with and the speed of response."
"Top marks must surely go to a structure which manages to make people feel that they and their complaints have been taken seriously and that they can now take matters forward."
"Bearing in mind that quite a number of people experience a sense of powerlessness in the face of the EU institutions, the way in which they are treated matters. And now they have a place to which they can turn."
"The Ombudsman's prime merit is - and has always been - to promote greater openness and transparency in the Union as a whole. Let us not underestimate that."
"Turning to the crisis within the Commission, several factors come into play. The situation has in fact been developing for quite some time."
"The nub of the problem - and the reason why the Commission had to resign - was of course mismanagement of the Union's finances. There was also a partial loss of control over expenditure."
"Yet there is another element which should not be discounted, namely the lack of openness and the particular administrative culture which have predominated hitherto in the Commission."
"Many ordinary citizens feel the Commission to be a powerful institution, but one which is closed, insensitive - and sometimes simply arrogant."
"When they approach the institution directly, people find it hard to obtain answers and information."
"This perception - justified or otherwise - helps to explain attitudes towards the Commission."
"An institution which leaves such an impression on people is no longer up to date; change is required."
"The idea of a code of good administrative practice is therefore to be welcomed."
"This initiative should go some way towards remedying and improving the situation."
"The Staff Regulations also need amendment, that much is clear."
"EU staff should not need to fear reprisals for drawing attention to mismanagement or exercising criticism. They must be able to have their say - publicly, where necessary."
"Otherwise they are operating in a very unsavoury environment."
"A change of culture, accompanied by new rules on openness and public access to documents, should bring about a real transformation in the way the administration is run."
"Top of the agenda now should be a strengthening of the office of the Ombudsman."
"Two aspects require particular attention, beginning with the financial parameters."
"If the office is to be able to handle properly all the complaints that are coming in, it needs long-term planning and an adequately resourced budget."
"Secondly, it is self-evident that the Ombudsman must have access to all the documents he needs."
"This is essential if a good job of work is to be done."
"An immediate increase in resources is therefore necessary."
"As an MEP, I myself am critical of much of what goes on in the EU."
"In the case of the Ombudsman, however, I have no criticism to make whatsoever. Instead, I should like to thank Jacob Söderman and his team for the excellent work they do."
"Madam President, Mr Ombudsman, Commissioner, I am one of those who feel that the Ombudsman is the European Union's best institution."
"He has certainly been responsible for positive developments in the Union's institutional structures, and it is important that he should be given greater powers."
"The report mentions freedom of movement. I myself recently met an Irish dentist who had problems practising in Greece."
"All such questions should be raised when discussing the Ombudsman's powers."
"The situation regarding public access to documents has improved in the European Union mainly as a result of the efforts of the Ombudsman and the courts."
"The legislative bodies have not done very much on the subject as yet, and I fear the Commission's work on the future regulation on transparency has slowed down somewhat."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Monti how work is proceeding on the transparency regulation based on the Treaty of Amsterdam, because that will also be an absolutely essential ingredient in solving the institutional crisis caused by the resignation of the Commission."
"Good administration will be essential in solving this crisis."
"I have noted to my satisfaction the Ombudsman's positive attitude towards civil servants' freedom to write and say what they wish."
"It is vital that the Staff Regulations are interpreted accurately, and changed so that civil servants have a real obligation to highlight any shortcomings they identify in the work of an institution or in their own department."
"Furthermore, producing document registers for all institutions is a very important innovation."
"I would point out that the European Parliament must also be a part of this programme of revision and embark on a course of good administration itself."
"Madam President, I completely agree with Mr Söderman that if the EU had had a culture of open administration, whereby the public could inspect the files of its officials once they have been finalised, we would be able to avoid a great deal of fraud and many irregularities."
"Officials who know that their files may be scrutinised by the public at any time are sure to be more inclined to administer them correctly."
"The EU does not have such a culture of openness, and this is also reflected in the Ombudsman's annual report, which incidentally is well set out, clear and meticulous."
"This is gratifying, since we are after all talking about consolidating an institution which is still very new, but already well known and valued."
"Nevertheless, there has been insufficient political will to give the Ombudsman proper working conditions."
"Incredible as it may sound, it is evident from the annual report that even he, who is supposed to be the public's guarantor with regard to the EU administration, simply does not have full access to Commission and Council documents."
"It is therefore clearly necessary to amend Article 3(2) of the Ombudsman's Statute, so that he has full and unimpeded access to all the relevant documents."
"To have a provision whereby the Community institutions can refuse to give the Ombudsman access to documents either by pleading duly substantiated grounds of secrecy, or because officials and other employees are speaking on behalf of and in accordance with instructions from their administrations, is not just unnecessary, it is extremely inappropriate."
"It is high time for a revision of the legal basis which underlies the Ombudsman's work."
"Otherwise, the institution is giving the people of the EU a completely false sense of the guarantee of due process of law."
"It is therefore particularly important to support paragraph 6 in Mrs De Esteban's motion for a resolution."
"Thank you, Mr Monti, and my thanks also to the mediator, Mrs Banotti."
"I think the House is very appreciative of what you have just said about Mrs Banotti, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Customs 2000"
"The next item is the report (A4-0136/99) by Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision amending the Decision of 19 December 1996 adopting an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2000) (COM(98)0644 - C4-0639/98-98/0314(COD))."
"Madam President, last November, the Commission put forward a proposal to extend the current Customs 2000 programme by two years."
"In September 1997, it wanted to allocate the programme an extra ECU 35 million, but Parliament rejected this - a codecision procedure was not required just for a budget increase."
"But there seemed to be more involved than just a budget problem: there were problems with the introduction of a computerised transit system which struck at the very heart of the work of the customs authorities."
"Deadlines were missed and the contractors failed to deliver the required quality of products."
"Parliament launched its own investigation and found that drastic policy changes needed to be made."
"The report on the discharge for 1996 which ultimately led to the fall of the Commission highlighted the problems with the computer system, and since then the Commission has cleaned up its act."
"A new design for the computerised transit system has been put forward which is more practical and realistic and less ambitious."
"Parliament is quite happy with the progress the Commission is making at the moment."
"In its current proposal, the Commission is proposing the following: to bring all customs operations, staff training and informatics projects under one budget heading; to set up another committee of representatives of the Member States to get the Member States more involved in the programme; and thirdly, to open the programme up to associated countries."
"Parliament has a number of problems with this proposal."
"Firstly, we cannot accept the Commission's original proposals about the new committee."
"In addition to the existing Customs Policy Committee made up of the directors-general of the customs administrations in the Member States, the Commission wants to set up a new committee to implement the programme."
"Parliament wishes to have only one committee."
"A possible solution could be found if the Policy Committee delegated the implementation of the programme to a second committee - so there would be two levels of the same committee - but the directors-general remained responsible for it."
"This would be sure to increase the involvement of the Member States, which is, after all, what the Commission wants."
"In addition to my own amendments, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy accepted many of the amendments put forward by the draftsmen of opinions, Mr Bardong and Mr Brinkhorst, on making the implementation of the programme more transparent for Parliament and for industry."
"The Commission has a great deal to gain from involving market operators more in the programme."
"It is often forgotten that they have a lot of in-house expertise and could make the Commission's work a good deal easier."
"Express delivery firms, for example, have been working for years with computer systems covering the entire globe."
"We recently saw a demonstration of the new computer system and it looked very promising."
"But of course it still needs to prove its usefulness in practice, linked up to terminals in 3 000 customs offices and the firms that are to use it."
"In one of the amendments, I have said that Parliament wishes to be kept informed of any delays that might arise in the development of the new computer system, and I would urge the Commissioner to take this very seriously."
"There is also a financial problem in the Council."
"The Commission thinks it will need EUR 142 million for the programme up to the year 2002."
"Before the Berlin summit, Germany and the Netherlands in particular expressed doubts about the level of funding but without really justifying their hesitation, and Germany and the Netherlands are vitally important to the running of Europe's customs services."
"You cannot send a parcel from Rotterdam, Europe's biggest port, to anywhere in Europe without it passing through German territory."
"Hopefully both countries were sufficiently reassured about the funding at the Berlin summit."
"I will come back to this in a moment and then we can perhaps reach a solution fairly quickly."
"We will be voting for all the amendments, Madam President."
"Amendment No 5 is the only one that is out of the ordinary, and it is very topical after the Berlin summit."
"It concerns a point of principle for Europe and was tabled by Mr Brinkhorst as the draftsman of an opinion."
"As a Dutch citizen, I find his position difficult to accept, but as rapporteur I have to say that he is 100 % correct."
"It is not true that a growing proportion of the European Union's already very limited own resources are disappearing into the pockets of the Member States."
"The Court of Auditors has established that the 10 % deduction as reimbursement of the collection costs is already excessive."
"This figure has now been increased to 25 %."
"It is thus basically a subsidy in disguise and is to be rejected on principle."
"When they themselves are not affected, the Member States always reject this kind of thing anyway, except for now."
"The common customs tariff is one of the most concrete signs of the common identity of the European Union."
"There are about 120 000 officials in the Member States' administrations."
"The European Commission has about 120 - one thousandth of that figure - which once again shows how ludicrous it is to claim that we are working with an over-centralised bureaucracy in Brussels."
"Against that background the Customs 2000 programme is absolutely essential to demonstrate that we are more than simply a group of individual countries working in a general area."
"Failing a common administration, Customs 2000 is an extremely important management tool for harmonised rules, automation and so on."
"It is significant that Member States sometimes find it difficult to improve on the Customs 2000 programme's efficiency."
"I refer to the transit inquiry which has given it a boost."
"Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I am very pleased with the cooperation with Mrs Peijs, the rapporteur, and very pleased that she has taken over our amendments."
"These amendments try to improve the action against fraud and she has pointed to the most important one, the question of how to relate collection costs to performance criteria."
"Indeed, after the European Council, 25 % is going back into the pockets of the Member States."
"But the idea of common performance criteria remains absolutely essential and it is against that background I would ask the Commissioner what impact he believes the European Council has on the attitude of the common customs authorities and whether they will now become even more relaxed than before."
"It is also against that background that the Committee on Budgets' amendments to harmonise the Common Customs Committee, to have one overall committee to operate the common customs tariff, have been adopted."
"We must simplify, we must harmonise."
"This is the direction that has been taken by Commissioner Monti, whom I welcome here again today, carrying out what I suppose will be one of his last official duties, because he has supported this idea and I am very happy that he will also be able to defend it before the Council."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Member States truly dug deep into the pockets of the European Union at the Berlin summit, helping themselves to customs revenue."
"With effect from the year 2001, they want to hold back 25 % of this revenue rather than 10 % as at present, even though these are traditionally the EU's own resources."
"I consider that unwarranted, especially since the Member States are not contributing much to the creation of a Community customs service."
"But we need the common customs tariff and the rest to lay the foundations of such a service. Even though Parliament, in the conciliation procedure, may have dropped its earlier demand for the development of a common customs administration, that nevertheless remains our goal."
"During the discussions, the recurring question was whether the Member States even merit the 10 % they retain for administrative expenditure, in other words whether the figure of 10 % is at all justifiable."
"Today we have to consider an amendment based on the firm belief that this percentage is too high."
"Moreover, an amendment has also been tabled which calls on the Commission to submit performance criteria that can be used to monitor the levying of customs duties by the Member States."
"From the conciliation proceedings on the first Customs 2000 proposal, this lack of commitment on the part of the Member States has been plain to see."
"The Commission was not exactly able to record much progress either in its interim report of July 1998."
"Coordination with the Member States and development of the risk-assessment system remain inadequate."
"Although the Commission praised itself in the report, a contrasting picture had emerged from the Court of Auditors' report of 1997."
"It does have to be said that, coming six years after the entry into force of the single market and 29 years after the entry into force of the customs union, this is hugely disappointing."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control is not satisfied with this state of affairs."
"However, we have refrained from tabling any further amendments so that some long overdue progress can be achieved."
"The adverse effects of irregularities, delays and fraud in this field are considerable and have made a very noticeable difference to revenue levels."
"This is certainly not a time when the Member States of the European Union could afford to make such sizeable concessions in terms of their own resources."
"Madam President, we cannot achieve an internal market with wide-ranging freedom of movement and fair competition between economic agents within the territory of the European Union if we still have 15 inconsistent and disconnected customs systems."
"How can we hope to combat tax fraud and organised crime or to protect the financial and budgetary interests of the EU if there is still no link between the various customs computer systems, despite the possibilities offered by the Customs 2000 programme or the IDA programme for computerisation of customs activities?"
"Six years after completing the single market, we have to agree that the results are disappointing."
"There is a lack of cooperation between Member States."
"The customs authorities in many countries are still in the age of paper and manual processing, having totally failed to make the technological transition to the demands of modern society."
"The rapporteur's acquiescence in proposing that finalising computerisation of the Transit system should be delayed until 30 June 2003 reflects very badly on the apparent value of the results obtained up to now in this area."
"These delays sit ill alongside the explosion in trade that the world will see in coming years, with a risk that the Union's resources will be badly hit because they have been robbed of a significant part of their most important own resources: customs duties and agricultural levies."
"How can we explain the lack of effective and consistent training of officials in the different customs administrations, although the Matthaeus programme came into force over six years ago?"
"When we talk about customs processing what comes to mind is a negative image of red tape, inefficiency and unnecessary duplication."
"So we cannot support the Commission's proposal to set up yet another committee, which would overlap with the work of the Customs Policy Committee."
"We have had enough duplication already!"
"Madam President, I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, for her contribution to and support for this Commission proposal amending the Customs 2000 programme."
"The rapporteur, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Bardong, among others, have explained very clearly the scope and importance of the proposal, and I shall therefore leave it at that and simply set out the Commission's position on the amendments."
"Let me first say that the Commission is able to accept a substantial number of amendments - namely Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12 to 17 and 19 - and I shall say no more about them."
"As far as Amendment No 1 is concerned, the Commission takes the view that a general provision, in the form of a code of conduct, exists already."
"The proposal does not therefore seem to be the proper place for that provision."
"Turning to Amendment No 3, the first part of the text is acceptable, except for the final sentence reading: 'whereas this will result in a four-year delay compared to the initial target date'."
"Not only does the Commission fully understand Parliament's concern about the delay in applying the computerised transit system, it has already had occasion to explain what it is doing in practical terms to bring the project rapidly to completion, and I am grateful to Mrs Peijs, Mr Kellett-Bowman and Mr Herman, who did us the honour of attending an initial practical demonstration of the system on 31 March."
"The last sentence of Amendment No 3 is, however, inappropriate in a legal text."
"Nevertheless, I can assure you that both I and my staff are making constant efforts to ensure that the work is done as quickly as possible."
"Amendment No 5 refers to Amendment No 16."
"The final part of the text, which concerns the performance of the Member States, the performance criteria, is acceptable, and I regard it as very important."
"Although the Commission understands the reason for the change, the first part of the text, which takes up a broader issue concerning own resources, would fit better within the framework of the legislation on own resources than in this proposal."
"Moreover, the text goes beyond the scope of the article to which it refers, Amendment No 16."
"We are able to accept the substance of Amendment No 8 to the extent that the committee in question takes over the work of the Customs Policy Committee, and I shall return to that in a moment."
"Amendment No 9 is acceptable on the point of transparency in relation to Parliament and the customs authorities."
"However, it goes without saying that there has to be a degree of confidentiality in regard to economic operators, particularly for legal reasons bound up with combating fraud."
"Amendment No 11 is in principle acceptable to the Commission, provided that the committee that is set up to administer the Customs 2000 programme takes over the current responsibilities of the Customs Policy Committee."
"That committee was in fact set up on the basis of Article 3 of the initial version of the Customs 2000 programme as an instrument of partnership between the Commission and the Member States."
"This amendment has also to be viewed in connection with Amendment No 18, and here the Commission believes it can accept the first paragraph, but it must be inserted where it most makes sense, in the text of Article 3 of the initial Customs 2000 proposal."
"Article 3, to which Amendment No 11 relates, concerns the application of the programme and the partnership between the Commission and the Member States."
"We therefore think it appropriate to combine the two proposed texts."
"We cannot accept the second paragraph of Amendment No 18."
"As far as the first sentence of the text goes, given the wide range of issues up for discussion in the context of Customs 2000, the Commission prefers to leave it to the Member States to decide whether to take part with more than one representative, so as to be able to discuss specific issues."
"That, moreover, is the approach consistently taken in relation to comitology, which cannot require Member States with different administrative practices to adopt a single organisational model."
"In any event, as far as expenditure is concerned, Community funding will be provided for a single delegate."
"The Commission is unable to accept the second part of the text, because the current rules relating to comitology do not allow the applicant countries to attend the meetings."
"That point should, however, be viewed in the context of Article 19 of the new proposal which provides for the Customs 2000 programme to be opened up to the applicant states generally."
"The specific rules governing the opening-up of the programme will be adopted within the framework of the relevant association councils, and those decisions will also cover participation in the meetings by the applicant countries."
"The final paragraph of Amendment No 18 is not acceptable: as I said earlier, the confidential nature of some of the issues to be discussed means that the Commission cannot agree to the committee's meetings being held in public."
"Finally, the second paragraph of Amendment No 20 is not compatible with the general principles adopted by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in their declaration of 6 March 1995 on including financial provisions in legal instruments, and the paragraph cannot therefore be taken on board."
"That, Madam President, summarises the Commission's view at this stage in the legislative procedure."
"Let me once again thank the committees, the rapporteurs and Parliament in general for the substantial and constructive work that has been done in this very specific area, which is extremely important, both symbolically and practically, to the operation of the European Union."
"We would be prepared to accept some of the objections raised by the Commissioner were it not for the fact that we are to take the vote in ten minutes and it is physically impossible to make any changes."
"We have already had very detailed discussions on this issue and I think we can manage without a conciliation procedure, because some of the objections are so minor that I hardly think my colleagues in the House will argue against them."
"We will take them into account in the hope of producing something that is generally acceptable apart from one or two basic points, and those will keep."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 a.m."
"Transport infrastructure charging"
"The next item is the report (A4-0111/99) by Mrs Schmidbauer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Commission White Paper entitled 'Fair Payment for Infrastructure Use: A phased approach to a common transport infrastructure charging framework in the EU' (COM(98)0466 - C4-0514/98)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last September the Commission presented us with a White Paper with the rather unwieldy title 'Fair payment for infrastructure use: a phased approach to a common transport infrastructure charging framework in the EU'."
"Behind that cumbersome title, however, is a proposed new European transport system in which mileage travelled would be charged with the aid of electronic data transfer, a system that would guarantee sustainable mobility."
"The subject is not new."
"Back in 1997, we voted on the report relating to the Commission Green Paper on this same matter; I was the rapporteur on that occasion too."
"And now it is time to develop specific legal mechanisms."
"One reason why the European transport system is threatened with collapse is that we have the fundamental problem of distortions of competition in the transport markets."
"The cost of a journey is not met by the party who causes the journey to be made, but by the general public."
"Distortions of competition between modes of transport and between individual EU Member States are the result."
"At the present time there are nine different charging systems in Europe for the use of the rail infrastructure, with subsidisation ranging between zero and 100 %."
"Road tax and road-pricing systems vary enormously."
"There are differences of up to EUR 3 000 a year between national rates of road tax, for example."
"Moreover, charges are seldom levied as and when they are incurred."
"They generally bear no relation to the environmental costs or to other external costs."
"At the moment, therefore, users have no incentive to alter their transport habits in any way."
"In the White Paper, the Commission proposes that the user should pay all the internal and external costs that he or she incurs."
"Charges are to be levied on the same basis in every Member State, namely on the basis of so-called marginal social cost."
"The marginal social cost comprises the average variable infrastructure costs plus the external costs."
"My report endorses the Commission approach."
"We must move in the proposed direction if we want to achieve a better distribution of the volume of traffic among the various modes of transport."
"The target date of 2004 and the establishment of committees containing government experts makes the implementation of this approach appear realistic, especially since it does not involve grafting a ready-made system onto any national structure but rather the joint development of solutions with the 15 Member States."
"In my report, I also suggest the possibility of reinforcing the charging system based on marginal social cost with measures in the realm of transport-related taxes, by which I mean coordinating these taxes on a European scale, lowering them where necessary."
"That would give us an acceptable graduated pricing system."
"In its White Paper, the Commission only took account of commercial transport and did not include private cars in the charging system."
"I believe, however, that the 'user pays' principle can only be effectively applied to transport if all those who contribute to the problems are expected to contribute to their solution."
"Traffic jams, accidents and environmental pollution, of course, are caused just as much by private cars as by commercial vehicles."
"In this context I should like the Commission to examine, as a matter of urgency, whether private cars could not perhaps be included in the charging framework."
"At the same time, it is important to conduct information campaigns to make it clear to the public that this is all about introducing an environmentally friendly and sustainable transport system and is not another scheme designed to fleece motorists."
"Heckling"
"No, that is not the case."
"That is why it is quite unhelpful when the public are deliberately misled, even by Members of this Parliament."
"At the beginning of this week, Mr Ferber issued a press statement with the heading 'Pure highway robbery!'"
"I consider that sort of thing to be irresponsible, because either that statement was a deliberate distortion of the truth or Mr Ferber has read neither the White Paper nor the report on which we voted in committee."
"Let me close by saying that we cannot accept the amendments tabled by the PPE Group through Mr Jarzembowski, because they are virtually tantamount to total rejection of the White Paper."
"The other groups cooperated very constructively in the preparation of this report, and I should like to thank them for that."
"Our cooperation with Commissioner Kinnock and Directorate-General VII was also very fruitful."
"I am grateful for that, and at the same time I would ask the Commission to make a determined effort to implement the White Paper, so that this approach, which my group and I support, can be put into practice, for I am firmly convinced that this White Paper will pave the way for sustainable mobility in Europe."
"Madam President, firstly I should like to congratulate our rapporteur Mrs Schmidbauer on her important report."
"I know she has worked very hard over many months on this difficult subject."
"Whilst this report is not legislative, it is, in transport policy terms, the culmination of much work covering many aspects and will without doubt give the green light to a legislative proposal in the future."
"Mrs Schmidbauer's report is to be welcomed because it deals with developing a phased approach towards a common transport infrastructure charging framework within the European Union, as well as a gradual harmonisation of charging principles in all major transport modes."
"My group also welcomes the principles outlined by Mrs Schmidbauer that users of infrastructure should pay the cost, including environmental, and the cost of other external impacts imposed at the point of use."
"This is a complex issue, especially where the subject of road pricing is concerned."
"But Members would do well to remember that many Member States already have road pricing schemes in place and others are looking to introduce them."
"Therefore, there is a need to try to bring some structure and harmonisation to the whole system."
"The rapporteur has not only worked hard on this report but she has also recognised the complexity of the issue, the sensitivities that exist around this subject, and has produced a very carefully worded report that deserves the support of the whole of the House."
"Madam President, I shall follow the lead of my honourable colleague Brian Simpson and thank Mrs Schmidbauer for her cooperative approach to the preparation of this report."
"Regrettably she has arrived at the wrong conclusions, as I must now explain on behalf of my group."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party must reject the Commission's strategy of introducing a uniform system of charging for all modes of transport on the basis of so-called marginal social cost."
"The fact is that the system of marginal social cost proposed by Neil Kinnock, the Socialist Commissioner for Transport, clearly emerged as an objectively unsuitable method of infrastructure charging when the Committee on Transport and Tourism consulted with scientists and transport specialists on 17 February 1999."
"On the one hand it takes insufficient account of the construction, capital and maintenance costs for the transport infrastructure, while on the other hand it indiscriminately imposes a blanket charge to cover so-called external costs such as the cost of environmental pollution, traffic jams and accidents."
"We are prepared to discuss external costs."
"That is why we in Parliament called on the Commission back in January 1997 to provide us with scientifically demonstrable assessments of external costs and how they can best be recouped; these assessments were to be presented for each individual mode of transport."
"The Commission, however, chose to shirk that responsibility."
"It has not substantiated the external costs or outlined any procedures to us, but has come up with a new magic formula and now wants to do everything on the basis of marginal social cost."
"But this magic formula, as the hearing with the scientists and experts showed, is unsuitable."
"In other words, this whole approach is built on sand."
"A second reason why the Commission approach should be rejected is that it is designed to be quite systematically devised and implemented in three steps, thereby deliberately preserving the distortions of competition between modes of transport and between companies in the various Member States."
"This means that existing distortions will not be eliminated, even though they actually ought to have disappeared by 1 January 1993, the date when the single market was supposed to take effect."
"In practice, however, we still have completely different oil duties, road taxes and so forth. That distorts competition, and the aim of the Commission's approach is to preserve this disparity for several years to come."
"We reject that."
"The recommendation of the Red and Green majority in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mrs Schmidbauer, is nothing short of reckless, going further than even the Commission has ever gone by calling for the inclusion of private cars in this new special system on the basis of Community law and not, as is customary in such cases, on the basis of national legislation."
"Mrs Schmidbauer, my colleague Mr Ferber was absolutely right."
"This system, if you think it through to its logical conclusion, means purely and simply that private cars would also be liable for road tolls in Germany."
"I do not believe the Austrian system is worth copying."
"In my opinion, on the basis of all the studies that have been conducted in this field, it is crystal clear that private motorists, through the excise duty on their petrol and through road tax, are already paying the tolls with which it is intended to burden them."
"By broadening this system, Mrs Schmidbauer, we should quite simply be giving Member States the opportunity to impose even higher charges on private motorists."
"It also says in your report that, besides private cars being incorporated into the new charging system, an even heavier financial burden should be placed on motorists in sensitive areas - these include mountainous regions, but they also include all the major cities, such as Paris, Hamburg and Frankfurt."
"Your approach cannot work; if it were implemented, it would only induce many Member States, as Mr Ferber said, simply to fleece the motorist once again."
"We reject that."
"Applause from the PPE Group"
"Madam President, I am hearing a lot of electioneering here from both sides, both from Mrs Schmidbauer and from Mr Jarzembowski."
"It is quite clear that this White Paper is vitally important for the creation of an internal market and a system in which costs are switched from fixed costs to variable costs."
"This is something we are all in favour of."
"Mrs Schmidbauer rightly said that we must be careful that this does not lead to another separate cost increase."
"I put this down in an amendment, so I can only agree with her."
"She is absolutely right when she says that we need to involve private cars in some way."
"Of course we must."
"Traffic congestion is reaching critical levels, so it is extremely important that we should treat the little room left on the roads as a market commodity."
"That is the best way to go about it."
"There can be no objection to this from a Liberal point of view, although all sorts of people are taking a stand on the issue in my country."
"If there is no alternative, so they would have us believe, you must not charge extra for using the roads."
"But that is not true."
"You should make a charge."
"On the other hand, we should not make a charge if it is not necessary."
"Finally, it is extremely important that we should make this a European system, which is currently by no means the case."
"Each Member State is busy reinventing the wheel."
"I would point out in passing that the example of Norway, which many people have mentioned because of the excellent way in which it has organised access to Oslo, Trondheim and Bergen, is not really all that good."
"There is a lot of abuse and fraud and the situation is extremely chaotic, so it is exactly the sort of bad example we should not follow."
"We must not sit back and wait for the compatibility that I described in a working document for the Transport Committee to be achieved, because it would take us at least ten years and this could be used as an excuse to charge what it actually costs to use the roads."
"I very much welcome Mrs Schmidbauer's report."
"We in the Liberal Group would like to make just one further improvement, which is really no more than dotting the I's and confirming what the rapporteur has already said."
"We agree with her that if the PPE Group's amendments are approved they would destroy the whole purpose of the report."
"However, this is not to say that there are not some extremely good elements in those amendments, which we will be happy to accept."
"We shall suspend the debate at this point for voting time."
"It will be resumed at 3 p.m."
"I would like to speak on a point of order, Mr President."
"At the moment there is a group of more than 100 visitors blocking the corridors of Parliament."
"I do not think that this is in line with our Rules of Procedure."
"I should like to add that this group has been singing religious songs on the ground floor for quite a while, which has somewhat shocked the layman in me."
"Mr Caudron, I shall ask the services immediately to make it easier for Members to enter the Chamber."
"VOTES"
"Mr President, in this list that we have here, some committees are not included, although we know that they all have to do with the budget."
"What we are essentially proposing is that no selection of committees should take place and that instead, with your permission and the cooperation of the House, we could perhaps move an oral amendment to include all committees that have anything to do with the budget."
"I believe this would be only fair to the committees that are not listed here."
"Can we agree on that?"
"As there is no objection, Amendment No 40 will be put to the vote, with the clarifications provided by Mr Hänsch."
"After the vote on Amendment No 5"
"Mr President, I may be mistaken, but I was under the impression that to amend such allocations an absolute majority was needed."
"You are generally one of the experts on the practices of the House, Mr Herman, but on this occasion I am afraid you are mistaken."
"A simple majority is sufficient."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 1"
"Mr President, I would like to table a minor oral amendment. Overall responsibility for the new anti-discrimination Article 13 is to remain with the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, but as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs also has jurisdiction here, I wish to table an oral amendment stating that, from the point of view of the Committee on Women's Rights, a small change of focus, in other words an addition, is required: measures etc other than those mentioned in VIII and XVI."
"I trust the chairman of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Hughes, will have no objection."
"Are there any objections to us considering the amendment proposed by Mrs Hautala?"
"More than 13 Members rose to express their opposition"
"After the vote on Amendment No 11"
"Mr President, I think you were somewhat hasty in answering the question that our colleague Mr Herman posed earlier."
"I should indeed like to believe that our practice leads to the annex being adopted by a single majority, but I do not think that this complies with the Rules."
"Rule 135 states that the powers of committees are to be recorded in an annex, but it does not in any way rule out the use of an absolute majority. What is more, as this text defines the powers of the parliamentary committees, it would be something of a paradox if, as has recently been the case, the composition of a relevant committee in a key area - in this case immunities - were to be determined by a difference of just a few votes."
"I would therefore like us to look at this matter more closely, as it seems to me that an absolute majority is needed, given that it relates to an amendment of a core element of our Rules of Procedure."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I have listened very carefully to your comments. It is a view to which we can give due consideration."
"However, I have to tell you that I answered very quickly in order to gain time, and also because I had looked into this question before entering the Chamber."
"Besides this Rule, there is also the tradition in this House that such questions are always decided in the way we currently decide them."
"If you think there is another issue, we can look at that. However, at this time, I have no reason to change this practice and the way we implement this Rule."
"Mr President, you are completely right and, in my view, you are applying the Rules of Procedure correctly."
"I should like to point out to Mr Fabre-Aubrespy that he has a strange way of interpreting the Rules of Procedure."
"In cases where an absolute majority suits him but a simple majority would suffice, he protests; then, where the Rules of Procedure provide for an absolute majority, as in the case of the discharge, he wants a simple majority."
"We cannot evidently have Rules of Procedure to suit everyone, according to their particular interests."
"On Amendment No 74"
"Mr President, I should like to move that in paragraph 1(c) of Amendment No 74, after the reference to 'humanitarian aid, emergency aid and food aid', we add the words 'in developing countries', so that the text would then read '... humanitarian aid, emergency aid and food aid in developing countries'."
"Mrs Günther, I can see no objection from the House and so I will put the amendment to the vote with that addendum."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 9"
"Mr President, Mrs Hautala, who chairs the Committee on Women's Rights, was trying to move an oral amendment to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 in order to specify which forms of sex discrimination fell within the remit of committees I and VIII."
"It goes without saying that these committees cannot be responsible for those forms of discrimination that are a matter for the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Unfortunately, a number of colleagues have intervened to prevent the adoption of this reasonable motion."
"I believe that my honourable colleagues were unable to grasp what was at stake here."
"Laughter"
"You did not see me, although I was asking to speak in order to make that clear to you before you all took the floor."
"Since we are now voting about the Committee on Women's Rights, let me spell out that Amendments Nos 1 and 2, which relate to the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs and to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, naturally cannot and do not in any way imply that these committees should be responsible for the forms of sex discrimination that fall within the remit of the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Mrs Lulling, the House did not agree to putting Mrs Hautala's amendment to the vote."
"If you wish to table another amendment rather than criticise the Members for not accepting Mrs Hautala's amendment, you have every right to do so."
"Before the vote on Amendments Nos 23 and 24"
"Mr President, as a former chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy and an active member of that committee, allow me to draw your attention to this amendment."
"As you are all aware, it is not a matter of making radical changes, rather, as we understand it, of putting things in their place."
"In other words, according to the initial proposal, this committee would be called the 'Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism'."
"We propose - and this seems quite natural - that it firstly be called the 'Committee on Regional Policy', without detracting from the importance of the other two areas."
"This gives it a more global dimension, which is why I am asking you to vote in favour of this amendment."
"Mr President, I am the first signatory to this amendment."
"I simply want to say that one of the main aims of the Union is to promote economic and social progress by strengthening economic and social cohesion, among other policies."
"In this respect, we recently voted in favour of bringing Community regional policy and economic and social cohesion under the remit of this committee."
"Here we are dealing with a horizontal policy as opposed to a sectoral policy and, what is more, one of the tasks recently assigned to this committee is 'relations with regional and local authorities and with the Committee of the Regions'."
"Parliament, in my opinion, needs to demonstrate the priority it gives to relations with regional and local authorities, which represent the intermediate levels of any power and any institutional political structure. In short, we share our elective nature them."
"I am therefore calling on the House to vote in favour of keeping the Committee on Regional Policy as the first name of this committee."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a question of whether we are in favour of social cohesion."
"We are all in favour of social cohesion."
"It is a matter of the Rules of Procedure and what they prescribe."
"We have just unanimously adopted the catalogue of responsibilities: number one is transport, and number two is regional policy."
"It makes no sense to reverse that decision ten minutes after taking it."
"What is even more important is the fact that the wise ladies and gentlemen of this House have justified the amalgamation of the committees by saying that no major legislation would be necessary in the field of regional policy for the next two years."
"All of this substantiates the case for leaving things in the proposed order: transport, regional policy and tourism."
"Applause"
"Mr President, given this debate - and it is clearly a very important one - maybe a compromise would be to put tourism first."
"Laughter"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to make a brief remark."
"As usual, when a debate becomes so intense, the great principles put forward to fuel such debate actually have nothing to do with the basic reason for it."
"Here we have two committees, one for regional action and one for transport, which are due to merge. As a consequence, each is seeking to impose the name of the original committee."
"There is nothing else at stake in this debate."
"That said, I should simply like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that, following the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty, almost all our powers relating to transport will come under the codecision procedure, which seems reason enough to retain the name of the 'Committee on Transport' as the first name."
"Parliament adopted the decision"
"Mr President, I should just like to ask you to submit the question I posed earlier to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"I simply wanted to point out that my question was not motivated by personal interest."
"There are some amendments that were adopted without an absolute majority that I favoured."
"My question relates solely to Article 142 of the Treaty that states that 'the European Parliament shall adopt its Rules of Procedure, acting by a majority of its Members'."
"I therefore think that given this vital issue, it would be appropriate to refer this matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities, so that it can decide whether or not the annex relating to the powers of the committees can be adopted with a single majority."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, you have already asked that question and I have told you that I will look into it."
"You do not need to ask it again."
"Mr President, everybody who has been engaged in this whole issue over the last year understands the enormous pressure under which we have put the services of Parliament in the last few days."
"Personally, on behalf of my Group, I should like to extend our thanks to your services for the enormous help they have given us in ensuring that this vote went as smoothly as it did."
"Applause"
"I endorse what Mrs Green said about Parliament's services."
"On the subject of the majority required, however, I think it is essential that Parliament should know what majority it needs to take decisions."
"I think you were right, Mr President: this was not about rules but about powers, so I think a simple majority was enough here."
"First of all, Mr President, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy is quite right, it is a majority of Members that is required to amend the Rules of Procedure."
"Secondly, I do not entirely agree with Mrs Green that this vote has gone smoothly."
"We have now spent more than an hour on just one report, and there are another 19 to go."
"This means we will need another 19 hours."
"Would you perhaps allow someone to replace you so that we can get on a little more quickly?"
"Mr President, I should firstly like to congratulate you on the way in which you confidently chair these votes and I hope you continue to do so."
"As the chairman, Mr Martens, said, we have been discussing this issue for some time."
"Annexes are annexes and the Rules of Procedure are the Rules of Procedure."
"I therefore believe that you are acting appropriately."
"We do not need the Committee on the Rules of Procedure to tell us that the annex is not part of the Rules of Procedure."
"Mr President, on the subject of the job description of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, I see that we have only voted on paragraph 1 and the amendments tabled before and after it."
"Does this mean that the committee's job description is limited to paragraph 1 and the rest of the proposed text is deleted?"
"All the microphones have stopped working."
"I shall suspend the sitting for a few moments so that they can be repaired."
"The sitting was suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 1 p.m."
"Because of the time, I would like to propose to the House that, following on from the report by Mr Valverde López, we proceed to the vote on Kosovo, so that the House can express its opinion on this very important issue."
"Parliament agreed to this proposal"
"Mr President, with all due respect, we cannot call for a check to be made every time the PPE Group is in a minority of 50 or 100 votes."
"I have noted your comment, Mr Duhamel, but you have to bear in mind that if Members ask for an electronic check, the President is obliged to take one, whoever asks for it."
"Mr President, I would like you to take account of the fact that there are many Members who will have to leave for an early flight."
"The technical breakdown in the system should not be held against them when it comes to counting time spent voting in this House."
"Parliament adopted the legislative resolution"
"Mr President, 80 refugees have just been killed as the result of an indiscriminate air attack by NATO."
"We must stop these strikes that are no more surgical than they were in Iraq."
"I think it is high time we reconsidered our policy on the former Yugoslavia."
"We are not going to start a debate now, Mr Pinel."
"Mr President, I just wanted to say that although I shall remain in the Chamber, I shall be taking part in the final vote on the resolution only and will give an explanation of vote in accordance with Rule 122."
"On Amendment No 7"
"On Amendment No 7, Mr President, I should like to point out that there was a mistake in the Dutch translation, among others."
"It is very badly translated."
"The original text was in English, but the French translation is very clear, which is why I am referring to it here."
"The French text reads: 'exhorte le Conseil à ne ménager aucun effort pour créer les conditions propices à une brève interruption des bombardements '."
"When we talk of creating conditions in this way, it means that we expect Mr Milosevic to react before the campaign can be suspended."
"That is why we are tabling this amendment, and we hope that everyone is aware of this."
"On paragraph 5"
"Mr President, I should very much like to support paragraph 5 with a view to protecting the refugees."
"But may I ask the groups that have tabled this motion to explain what can be done to ensure that the creation of militarily protected humanitarian corridors to Albania and Macedonia does not usher in the partition of Kosovo."
"That is the problem I have with paragraph 5."
"Mrs Müller, I think you are not the only one who has problems with this paragraph, and with others."
"But we are not in the habit of solving such problems here at this time."
"On paragraph 14"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a further oral amendment but was agreed during the coordinators' negotiations."
"It relates to no less a person than Dr Ibrahim Rugova, who holds the Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament."
"That must be added."
"We really did forget that."
"It is not an oral amendment that we are free to reject, but was actually agreed by all those who were present."
"Mr President, I should like to remind Parliament that Mr Demaçi was also awarded the Sakharov Prize, so we should invite them both and mention them both; otherwise, it is not worth doing."
"At this precise moment we are speaking about Ibrahim Rugova, who is in serious danger and to whom our prize was awarded four months ago, and not about Mr Demaçi!"
"Loud applause"
"Mr President, I should like to make it absolutely clear that in our discussions on the compromise resolution we spoke specifically about Mr Rugova as the Sakharov laureate and about no one else."
"That was the agreement."
"Applause"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"I voted in favour of the proposal but would certainly have preferred if the committee now named 'Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities' had been named 'Committee on Mainstreaming and Gender Equality'."
"Mr President, I voted against this resolution because I feel Parliament is extremely reluctant to criticise NATO and NATO's actions."
"I believe that NATO has basically ignored international law in the action it has taken and that proper efforts were not made to find a peaceful solution."
"This is not a humanitarian effort, especially when you see what happened last night, when civilians were killed as a result of NATO activity."
"Also, Parliament was reluctant to address the fact that NATO is hitting civilian targets in Yugoslavia and the fact that it is using cluster-bombs and depleted uranium in its ammunition."
"These issues have to be raised."
"We have to look at respect for all human life."
"All human life is valuable."
"We cannot put one human life above another."
"Today in Parliament we voted against supporting the German peace proposal that has been put forward."
"I also think the British are blocking this proposal."
"If we can find a peaceful solution, nobody should be pushing for the right to war and to bomb."
"Two wrongs do not make a right."
"Parliament has a duty to express its discontent at some of the actions of NATO, in particular the bombing of civilian targets and the use of weapons that are considered by some people as weapons of mass destruction."
"Mr President, there are many extremely good points in this resolution."
"Nevertheless, I abstained because of the adoption of the Greens' amendment which sought to tie us down to a solution whereby Kosovo would be autonomous within the Yugoslav borders."
"Several weeks and months ago, such formulas could certainly have provided a basis for discussion."
"But they have now been overtaken by developments."
"Unless the Milosevic regime is removed, such a solution can never be an option."
"And even if it were removed, the prospects for such a solution would still be slim."
"It is impossible to force people to live in the same place, in the same state, as the murderers of their families."
"That is why I believe that this approach is totally divorced from reality."
"We should not have committed ourselves to a specific solution."
"What is good is that the House has unreservedly supported the military action by NATO, which is necessary, appropriate and justified, as well as the aim of bolstering Serbia's neighbours."
"One thing, however, seems to be missing from the resolution: it is high time we also sent a strong signal to Croatia, which is a major stabilising factor in the region but has been the victim of what amounts to blinkered disregard on our part."
"I earnestly appeal for the conclusion of a trade and cooperation agreement with Croatia."
"Mr President, as a member of the Greens who supported the compromise motion today, I merely wanted to express my respect for all the members of NATO currently engaged in the fight for human rights in the states bordering on Kosovo."
"We, the MEPs of PASOK, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Greece, are voting against the European Parliament resolution on Kosovo because we feel it has nothing positive to offer towards finding a solution to the problem."
"We denounce in the strongest possible terms the policy of ethnic cleansing and the violation of human rights that is being carried out by the Milosevic regime."
"We express our solidarity, without exception, with all the populations of the region who are suffering the trials and tribulations of a senseless war."
"However, we are equally opposed to the logic of the continued and increased use of violence, which not only will not lead to a solution but, on the contrary, stands in the way of resolving the problem."
"Furthermore, it is clear that not only have the bombardments not prevented ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, they have helped to create a huge wave of refugees and have contributed to the overall destabilisation of the area."
"It is doubtful whether the military action has thus far had any positive outcome, and it is therefore imperative that a political solution to the problem should be found as quickly as possible."
"The leading role in this effort must be assumed by the European Union which, together with the United Nations Secretary-General and the United Nations Security Council, must take the necessary actions to resolve the deadlock."
"We also believe that a basic condition to finding a solution to the problem is to respect existing borders and the territorial integrity of the states in the region. Only in this way can we prevent a new Balkan crisis."
"In addition to finding a political solution to the problem, we regard it as expedient that a new political, economic and humanitarian initiative should be undertaken immediately in relation to the Balkans."
"Finally, in the present tragic circumstances, it is imperative that an international conference should be convened for the purpose of improving the coordination of humanitarian aid."
"The MEPs of PASOK represent a country which is suffering the direct consequences of the war and which, from the outset of the crisis, has steadfastly come to the aid of the Kosovar Albanians who have been forced to abandon their homes."
"We believe that, as the new century dawns, we, as Europeans, must not allow this tragic situation to continue."
"The time has come for Europe to take specific initiatives to find a political solution to the problem for the good of all the people in the area."
"Milosevic is an intolerable national-communist dictator, which is a particular form of fascism that has grown out of the fall of communism without the emergence of a sustainable democracy."
"His policy of repression, separation, persecution and ethnic cleansing is contrary to all the humanitarian principles, ethical conditions and fundamental liberties which underpin democracy in Europe."
"The EU's highly regrettable inability to present a united front, using its own resources, including military resources, is demonstrated by the antecedents of the present conflict: the break-up of the former Yugoslavia; unilateral recognition of Croatia and Slovenia; 'ethnic cleansing' and atrocities by Serbs against Croats and Bosnians and then by Croats against Serbs and so forth; and Milosevic's success in staying in power."
"But this intervention by NATO, which was decided without full UN backing and has inadequate means to achieve the declared objectives of neutralising the Serbian military's capacity to continue with so-called 'ethnic cleansing', has not only failed to resolve the issue, it has also aggravated all the problems."
"Furthermore, the doctrine of the 'right to humanitarian intervention' - which is making headway but has not been recognised by the United Nations - cannot be imposed by force by a powerful and sophisticated military machine destroying not only military targets but also all the economic infrastructure of a country."
"At the same time, the creation of a new international legal order with appropriate means for 'humanitarian intervention' is coming up against the implacable opposition of the major powers, including the United States, with regard to reforming the UN, and the opposition of the United States, Russia, France and China to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court."
"At the same time, the NATO offensive, instead of isolating the dictator Milosevic and his regime, is in fact having the undesirable effect of building up nationalist unity around him against foreign intervention. To make things worse, this is also having the effect of humiliating Russia, which is a dangerous mistake."
"If the public felt sure that there would only be missile and air-based attacks, but no ground-based military forces involving the risk of casualties, it would be able to support the bombing for a certain period as a means of condemning Milosevic's unjust and abominable regime and his atrocities against the Kosovars."
"However, even leaving aside the question of dual standards - why not intervene in Turkey, Indonesia, Chechnya, and so on? - this is not the right approach to solving problems of this kind."
"Apart from extricating ourselves from this situation without damaging the authority of NATO and the EU, and without condoning the atrocities committed by Milosevic, which call for a diplomatic solution involving the UN and Russia, we above all need to stabilise the entire region."
"That is why I have to say that - as has already been demonstrated - the solution was not to enlarge NATO eastwards, but rather to enlarge the EU and adopt a policy of association and economic support which would promote economic and political integration and combat irredentist nationalism."
"What is the logic of fighting ETA, Corsican terrorists and the IRA and then supporting the KLA?"
"The EU needs to be able to apply to the Balkans, and to the CEECs in general, the same approach that within its borders has prevented war between Germany and France and has guaranteed peace for over half a century: economic and political integration."
"That is the issue."
"In addition, but no less important, the decision to launch military attacks with predominantly American forces simply highlights the United States' hegemony and the subordinate role of the EU, which if it continues down this road will never have a common foreign and security policy or common defence."
"Accepting this US hegemony represents a serious attack on the European Union, the consolidation of the euro, and the possibility of the EU being on an equal footing with the US within the World Trade Organisation, as demonstrated by the 'banana war' at present."
"Instead of this foolish policy, what we need is to lay the foundations for a partnership of equals with the US, which implies the EU being politically autonomous in its dealings with the US."
"For all these reasons, I voted against the compromise resolution adopted on Kosovo, and in particular against the immensely hypocritical recital H - which blames the UN for the fact that NATO violated the United Nations Charter - and against paragraph 2, which tries to legitimise the bombing by pretending that it has nothing to do with us."
"I did this although I approve of the specific points condemning the Milosevic regime and those on aid for refugees and measures designed to stabilise the region."
"I also voted against despite several positive amendments tabled by the Greens and by Mrs Theorin."
"I did not vote in favour of the European Parliament's resolution on Kosovo because it reflects a sense of self-satisfaction and complete failure to question our actions, which, in my view, does not reflect the seriousness of the situation."
"Without going over the past, to see who started what, I should personally like to take four lessons from the situation for tomorrow's Europe."
"First, I do not know whether the idea of a multi-ethnic Kosovo ever had any basis in reality, but I am sure that any such idea is dead today, wiped out by NATO's bombing campaign."
"It is difficult to imagine how the Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo will be able to live together in the near future."
"I do not therefore see how it will be possible to prevent the province from being divided. After all, this will only make us resort to the oldest solution in the world for restoring peace: placing borders between peoples."
"Second, tomorrow's Europe must show respect for national sovereignty."
"Some may indeed claim that as a system sovereignty is flawed, but the fact is that throughout history it has proved the only system capable of preventing chaos and arbitrary power that are even greater than those that can be attributed, where possible, to a particular form of sovereignty."
"Europe, which has a tendency to forget such things, will rediscover this with some bitterness."
"Incidentally, we will remember that the Serb regime, however much it might be criticised, had never attacked any of its neighbours or any of our allies, unlike the Iraqi regime."
"Third, if Europe wants to impose the rule of law, it must respect it too."
"Let us not forget that NATO intervened in the situation without a mandate from the United Nations Security Council, and that the French Parliament was presented with a fait accompli. These procedures may prove too tedious for some but they would undoubtedly have slowed the process down and enabled more dialogue to take place."
"They would have also made people realise that in this case the bombings were a simplistic response. They were also a costly response in moral, human and financial terms as well as in terms of the collateral damage that we ourselves will suffer - on top of everything else - without even having come up with a viable solution."
"Lastly, we must express our doubts concerning the very principle of a European defence which would involve institutionalising, in military terms, all the operations involving all the Member States."
"In fact, this is what has just happened to a certain extent with the intervention in Yugoslavia."
"Have the results of this intervention been so successful that we feel that this approach should become the rule?"
"I do not think so. Rather, each people must retain its free will out of respect for the sovereignty and rule of law that I referred to earlier."
"If Europe is attacked, then a collective response will take place automatically."
"However, if it is not attacked, why should countries allow themselves to become recruited in advance into battles they would not have chosen?"
"We need to forge alliances and foster cooperation that will generate a joint defence but certainly not a united common defence."
"I have abstained on the joint resolution on Kosovo because I have from the outset been opposed to the decision on NATO military intervention, which I believe to be a mistake that could have been avoided."
"At Rambouillet in fact, according for example to what was said by a number of influential participants, the kind of political circumstances were established that would have allowed other, in my view effective measures which could have prevented the deaths of so many innocent people and the distressing deportation of hundreds of thousands of Kosovars, the victims of Milosevic's crazed nationalism."
"I fully understand that there is a political duty and a duty on the institutions to intervene as matters now stand, and for that reason, while confirming my own position on the conflict, I now support any initiative designed to seek a positive solution from a political, moral and legal standpoint, focusing particularly on the role that the UN, the EU, NATO and Russia can and must fulfil."
"I am not and never have been a lover of war and possess nothing of a warmonger in me."
"For me, war always represents a failure of the spirit, of human spirit and intelligence."
"However, I know, and should like to point out, that we have to know how to wage war when the 'interlocutor/enemy' only understands force and especially if we want to quickly provide diplomacy with the greatest possibility of succeeding."
"Let us never forget that diplomacy actually means using dialogue to persuade one of the sides in a conflict to agree to give up some its initial aims, demands and even rights."
"The side concerned will only agree to do so if it thinks it might be the target of an attack in the event of a negotiated refusal of this agreement on its part."
"This is why, in the case of Serbia and Kosovo, after 10 years of negotiations that were punctuated by human rights violations, rapes, massacres, destruction and deportation - which were always instigated by Milosevic - there was unfortunately no alternative to the use of force to put an end to these crimes."
"As a consequence, I approve of NATO's military action."
"I also approve of the governmental, non-governmental and European humanitarian activities."
"I naturally hope that a European diplomatic solution can be found with the support of the United States and Russia, but it must not allow the principles of democracy and human rights to be abandoned."
"It is in this way, and this way alone, that we will be able to guarantee a lasting and just peace."
"I should like to end by congratulating the German Presidency on the action it has taken in this crisis, and finally, I should also like to congratulate Emma Bonino, the European Commissioner, on her personal and courageous commitment and her humanitarian passion."
"The speech she gave at the end of the debate on Wednesday afternoon was one of the high points of the day."
"In the light of such intolerable and inhuman acts, our resolution covers the most essential points."
"However, it should not prevent us from questioning the absence of a genuine 'common foreign and security policy' (CFSP) in Europe, which is becoming more regrettable by the day. Nor should it stop us from questioning, in particular, our inability to support the democrats who fought against the barbarous policies of Radovan Karadzic in the past and who are fighting against those of Slobodan Milosevic today."
"In spite of all of its promises, Europe did not provide financial and moral support for the democrats in Belgrade when they most needed it, when they were fighting against Milosevic's domestic and foreign policy, and today they are forced to remain silent and hidden."
"I am very dismayed to see that at a time when all political parties, with the exception of the extreme right, recognise the new virtues of international law in Pinochet's arrest, we have continued to hold talks with Milosevic, who has more blood on his hands and more 'crimes against humanity' on his conscience."
"It is understandable why the International Criminal Court set up in The Hague is unable to judge all the crimes committed in our time after the event has taken place."
"But was it necessary to overlook Milosevic's crimes so soon when the Dayton agreements on Bosnia were signed in 1995?"
"Can we negotiate with Milosevic today when the International Criminal Court has itself just accused him - although not publicly - of crimes against humanity?"
"It is because the Hague Court is dealing with the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia that Karadzic is out of the running and forced into hiding."
"I was shocked by the publicity-grabbing handshakes between Mr Primakov and Mgr Tauron, the Vatican envoy, with the criminal Milosevic, while thousands of Kosovars were being expelled from their homes and expatriated by force."
"Our resolution makes five or six references to Milosevic, but does not say a single word about Ibrahim Rugova, the head of the Democratic League of Kosovo, winner of the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize in 1998 and one of the Rambouillet negotiators."
"On three occasions Yugoslav television cameras have shown him in the process of 'negotiating' with Milosevic."
"On seeing these pictures, everyone wondered what freedom Rugova enjoyed, while 'protected' by the Serb police, in a country that has been emptied of its inhabitants."
"I should like to have seen our resolution invite Rugova to Brussels or Berlin so that he could freely put across his point of view on the present situation and the solutions he envisages."
"I am also concerned about the situation which, through our inaction, is developing on the border between Albania and Kosovo, where the KLA and the Serb army are engaged in repeated clashes which risk spilling over into the countries surrounding Kosovo and eventually into the entire Balkan region."
"Can NATO retain its credibility if, on the one hand, it bombs Serb military and economic infrastructures, and on the other hand, lets one of the sides in the conflict recruit freely?"
"NATO cannot play a leading role in the conflict and, according to Le Monde newspaper, be a partner to the KLA, which supplies it with information concerning the Serb positions to be destroyed, be a new international police force with a duty to intervene, and be a humanitarian body."
"It needs to decides what it wants to be and stick to that decision."
"We should like to voice our indignation today in light of the agony, the misfortune and the suffering of the people of Kosovo, who are victims of the criminal acts that have been planned by the Milosevic regime for some time."
"Of course, we did not seize the opportunity offered by the fall of the Berlin Wall to begin to build a wider political and democratic Europe."
"Of course, we must regret the failures of the diplomatic efforts made in Rambouillet and in Paris."
"However, with the best will in the world, we cannot change the past."
"We support the values on which the intervention was based."
"We support the rights of humans against the rights of a barbaric and totalitarian state which is forcing a terrorised population into exile, destroying houses, and threatening and killing women and children. We support freedom and hope that the criminals will be punished."
"That is why we give our unreserved support to the courageous decision taken by the European Heads of State and Government."
"We nonetheless regret that a European presence on the ground was not planned at the same time as the air offensive and that large-scale humanitarian action was not envisaged to cope with the floods of destitute refugees thrown out onto the streets."
"It is now vital to implement measures to support Albania, to devise the best way of contributing to the reconstruction of Kosovo, and to provide more general development aid for the rest of the Balkans."
"I voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Kosovo because it negates international law, and that is both an historical blunder and a serious political error."
"Never has a state that is a signatory to the United Nations Charter experienced an act of aggression by the international community such as the one perpetrated for eight years against Yugoslavia at the instigation of the United States and Germany."
"A flood of unprecedented media propaganda has undeniably created a completely false impression of the Balkan crisis."
"Instead of integrating the former Yugoslavia into the Union and thus promoting its process of political democratisation and economic progress, the European Union, with the European Parliament leading the way, has encouraged its break-up and created - at least indirectly - the conditions for the wars in Croatia and Bosnia in the past and in Serbia today."
"We have made Bosnia's borders sacred and prevented the Bosnian Serbs from establishing links once again with Serbia."
"Now we are waging war on Serbia to allow the Kosovar Albanians to establish links once again with Albania."
"Make of this what you will."
"We wanted international society to be subject to the rule of law, and now, in the most humiliating fashion, we are giving our consent to a strike by the Americans who have received no mandate from the United Nations."
"By playing with international borders - Yugoslavia's since 1991, and Macedonia's and Albania's in the future - by disregarding the lessons of the past, by pretending to ignore Russia's role in the region, by seeking a military knock-out instead of a political solution, and by trying, in particular, to cut the Serbian people off from Europe, which they have done so much for, we will undoubtedly provoke the very conflagration we claim we want to avoid."
"When the time comes, those who are consciously involved in this undertaking will have to face up to their responsibilities."
"A majority of Members of the House seem to have little interest in the fact that the NATO bombing and military offensive in Yugoslavia are continuing, causing the destruction of a country and the death of an indiscriminate number of people, both Serbs and Kosovars, men and women, young and old, as was the case when more then a hundred refugees perished. They simply express regret at the loss of human life and the 'collateral damage'."
"No, this majority prefers to justify NATO's intervention, the subservience of the EU and its Member States in the face of American strategic interests and a lack of respect for order, for international rights and for the United Nations Charter. These Members prefer to defend the escalation of the war and the approval of a political approach which is bound to jeopardise negotiated solutions and the resolution of key issues concerning autonomous regions and their ethnic minorities."
"This majority seems to be blind to the fact that NATO's military aggression is the cause of the dramatic deterioration in the humanitarian situation in the Balkans, that it is putting the political future of that region at risk and seriously endangering world peace. They prefer to insist on agreements which have never been accepted by the negotiators, but have simply been imposed by NATO and are jeopardising sovereignty, borders and ancestral facts."
"The resolution adopted by Parliament today will go down in the political history of this House as the centrepiece of a total failure of political memory, typical of the political hysteria now being generated by media manipulation in the interests of those who gain from war and aggression, and ignoring the values of peace, justice and the sovereignty of nations."
"We intended to vote in favour of Amendment No 19 - we were in fact among those who tabled it - and to abstain on paragraph 5."
"I will not be voting in favour of the motion, which is being put forward as a compromise and which is essentially a one-sided and, on a good many points, an inaccurate analysis of the situation. The opinions and proposals it contains do very little to help find a peaceful, political and viable solution to the crisis or even to the particularly tragic problem of refugees."
"Furthermore, the motion for a resolution claims that the UN and the Security Council 'could not' (!) be involved in the NATO decision to carry out aerial sorties, whilst it is clear that this decision was taken in violation of the principles of the UN which, in this case, was irreparably shamed and humiliated."
"The claim that this treatment of the UN occurred because two Members of the Security Council blocked NATO activities (as they have the right to do under the UN charter) is a monument to high-handedness and a dangerous example of a totalitarian notion: that the UN is useful only when it agrees with NATO."
"Given this background, any reference to the idea of an 'international community' is superfluous and unacceptable. Reference to an Atlantic community suffices."
"It is verging on the ridiculous for the motion for a resolution (paragraph 3) to call for the implementation of UN resolutions or (paragraph 4) to welcome the 'initiative taken by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan', without making a single reference to the content of this initiative!"
"The motion for a resolution calls for priority to be given to human rights over national sovereignty concerns."
"Who will interpret this just principle and who will implement it?"
"Will it be NATO, with the same lack of credibility and the same self-interest with which it interpreted and 'implemented' the principles of the UN?"
"Perhaps it will be done by each state according to its own intermittent needs and aspirations?"
"These are the dangerous posturings of hair-brained advisors who, in drafting the motion for a resolution, have trivialised any serious effort to construct a real international order and community that is capable of implementing such principles in a credible and viable way, without selective interventions and the irrational use of violence."
"For NATO interventions and the preferences of the authors of the motion for a resolution are indeed selective. If they were not, upon reading the motion for a resolution, fear and terror would have enveloped Turkey, Indonesia, Latin America and Africa."
"I am voting against the resolution of the majority in the European Parliament who support the war in Yugoslavia."
"Taking a terrifyingly superficial approach and showing a lack of historical understanding and disregard for detail, the European Union governments have taken our countries into this war from which we cannot now withdraw."
"It is most distressing that, dancing to the tune of the national governments, the European Parliament too should be acquiescing in this highly dangerous enterprise."
"The war unleashed by NATO cannot rely on justification."
"There is no legal justification for it."
"International rules have been ignored and the international institutions have been sidelined."
"And so this is ethical warfare."
"If the intention was to invent the principle of selective humanitarian intervention, why strike at Milosevic for ethnic cleansing but ignore the Kurdish question in Turkey and open the door to disturbing scenarios in Europe's trouble spots: Corsica, Ireland and the Basque country?"
"We now have a 'humanitarian' war, the effect of which has simply been to achieve anti-humanitarian objectives by encouraging the campaign of ethnic cleansing and the slaughter of defenceless civilians in Serbia and Kosovo."
"' Collateral damage' - that is the language NATO uses to describe the loss of civilian life: for centuries to come, the Balkans will have to endure this so-called collateral damage, given that the depleted uranium contained in NATO weapons has already contaminated Yugoslav territory, thereby automatically preventing the Kosovars from returning to their country unless they want to risk sickness, deformity and death from radioactive contamination."
"From that point of view, no European country is safe: if the wind gets up, the ultra-fine uranium powder will be transported to Italy, Germany, Hungary and the whole of Europe, with the same deadly effects that occurred in Saudi Arabia as a result of the pollution caused in Iraq during the Gulf War."
"The war that NATO is waging against Serbia is a failure."
"Some claim that it amounts to a failure on the part of 'Europe' and it would certainly appear that unleashing a war under NATO command suggests an 'absence of Europe'."
"These people solely lay the blame for the situation on 'American imperialism' which they believe has forced the allies into action and is set to keep them under its iron rule."
"Indeed, US military intervention is not without its ulterior motives."
"We are well aware of Washington's desire to establish the Alliance's credibility following the disappearance of the common enemy that gave rise to it."
"What is more, the way in which the Americans behaved at the Rambouillet talks gives the impression that they did not do everything possible to help the parties reach an agreement."
"However, to merely focus on this issue would be to forget the fact that NATO's military action against Yugoslavia is first of all the result of a unanimous European will, which was apparent at the Berlin summit and which was welcomed and hailed by federalists as the veritable birth of the CFSP."
"Waging war under the guise of NATO does not therefore reveal an absence of European policy, but rather a flawed European policy."
"It is not an isolated action."
"This political error is entrenched in a rationale that goes back to the choices made by an entire generation of European leaders following the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"They chose a small western Europe that is rigid and inaccessible, and whose characteristics were defined by the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. They rejected the idea of a wider, flexible and welcoming Europe that could hope to include all those countries in Central and Eastern Europe that had just regained their sovereignty after decades of totalitarianism."
"Instead of inventing a Europe with variable geometry that offered new opportunities to all of the continent's states to coexist through cooperation, these European leaders stubbornly pursued the Monnet method, with its established dogma, without realising that it was no longer the most appropriate way of uniting the very diverse countries of the new European continent."
"As regards the Union, there has been considerable reluctance to admit that we needed to seriously reconsider the objectives and methods of European integration."
"The 'Monnet method' has been adhered to in the belief that our economies must be united in order to allow us to imperceptibly abandon our political sovereignty."
"When applied to the countries of Eastern Europe, this boils down to postponing indefinitely their membership of the club."
"All we have done is merely offer the countries of Central and Eastern Europe a waiting room and a timetable for admission which is constantly pushed further into the distance like a mirage, leading to exclusion, discrimination, frustration and humiliation."
"The promotion of this outmoded notion of Europe has discouraged, weakened and marginalised the leaders in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, who have emerged as a result of dissidence, and the reformers who now look to us for answers. It has also restored prestige in men who have emerged from totalitarian regimes, of which Milosevic is the archetype."
"The failure to create the permanent forum for a wider Europe, that would have enabled us to immediately engage in open cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe on such key issues as security and foreign policy, shows that our continent is once again becoming divided."
"The war in Yugoslavia is the tragic symbol of this new division in Europe: it embodies it and accentuates it."
"We are actually seeing a Slavonic Europe seeking to organise itself without us, a Ukraine that has decided to become a nuclear power after it initially decided against doing so, and a Yugoslavia that has adopted a draft Slavonic union with Russia and Belarus."
"We are also seeing Serbs rallying round Milosevic in the name of their violated homeland - in spite of the fact that most of them once rejected him - and the manifestation of an orthodox sense of solidarity in their disapproval of the Atlantic military action."
"Today the fruits of NATO's military intervention are particularly bitter."
"The Slavonic and orthodox worlds are moving further away, whereas they should constitute a vital component of the continental Europe we must build today."
"The legitimacy of borders is being called into question."
"The Balkans are at each other's throats and we are seeing two Europes re-emerge."
"We must put an end to this spiral of destabilisation at all costs and as quickly as possible."
"This does not simply mean stopping the bombs that give rise to hatred; we also have to develop a new concept of Europe, one that is applicable to the whole of the continent."
"This should involve a family of nations called on to live side by side in a spirit of trust, with their identities restored and recognised, and with mutual respect."
"This vital redefinition of our concept of Europe will be the best possible preventive policy."
"Despite containing a number of useful recommendations, the motion for a resolution tabled by various groups does not look at the situation in this context, although it is essential."
"Indeed, by proposing in recital J to weaken and exclude the notion of national sovereignty which, however flawed it may be, still constitutes the fundamental regulatory principle of our international community, it introduces an element that would only have extremely destabilising and disturbing consequences for international life."
"That is why we were unable to vote in favour of the resolution."
"I supported Amendment No 3 and believe that there is a strong case for deploying ground troops to protect Kosovo."
"I believe it is also necessary to consider establishing an independent Kosovo."
"However, although I have supported firm action against the Milosevic government for more than seven years, I am concerned that innocent casualties should be kept to a minimum."
"I therefore voted for Amendment No 10, expressing concern about the use by NATO of weapons with depleted uranium."
"These continue to have horrific consequences in Iraq, with some reports suggesting a 70 % increase in Iraq's rate of cancer and malignant births."
"Paragraph 13 calls on the EU 'to step up efforts to provide information as to the populations of Serbia and Montenegro'."
"If more efforts had been made in this direction when Milosevic first started his aggressive policies, the Serbian opposition to Milosevic would have been strengthened and many lives might have been saved."
"Ethnic cleansing and massive acts of cruelty against the Albanian people can never be accepted."
"It is essential that internationally accepted standards of human rights take precedence over national sovereignty."
"That will entail changes in international law. Some of this change must come about within the United Nations, but the permanent members of the Security Council have yet to address such an option."
"The international community itself must function in full compliance with the provisions of international law."
"We cannot therefore support a motion advocating endorsement of the NATO bombardments."
"This would create a precedent, with serious consequences for the future."
"Europe has stumbled into a war which has produced a million refugees, and there is no evidence of any policy to extricate ourselves from the crisis."
"The EU's prime agenda now must be to work for a political solution; to put a end to ethnic cleansing; to support the refugees; to stop the bloodbath; and to provide realistic possibilities for the refugees to return."
"It is not enough for the EU to be welcoming Kofi Annan's offer to mediate and bring an end to this conflict."
"The EU also has a duty to reinstate the UN as the paramount body for overseeing the rule of law in the international community."
"The Union should call for a peace-keeping force under UN auspices, involving Russian peace-keeping troops, so that the ethnic Albanians can return to their homeland."
"Swift ratification is needed of the agreement setting up the International Criminal Court, so that we have an instrument to deal actively with war crimes in the future."
"The EU's remit cannot be to sanction NATO's military initiatives, on which no elected parliament has taken a position."
"The EU's duty is to devise constructive solutions - politically, diplomatically and economically - to this and other conflicts."
"I wish to stress the urgent need for NATO intervention in the region, to safeguard the fundamental rights of the people of Kosovo, and to point out that this tragedy could have been avoided had the European Union long since been a genuine united political entity as well as an economic and monetary union."
"If at the beginning of the Balkans crisis, dating back to the early 1990s, Europe had acted with common accord and with the courage to take unequivocal decisions as Yugoslavia began to break up, if even recently Europe had presented a unified and united front at the recent Rambouillet summit, we would not perhaps have witnessed the massacres and ethnic cleansing currently under way."
"I would further ask for the European Parliament to sponsor an initiative to show solidarity, including financial solidarity, with the people of Apulia, who have not only generously taken in and continue taking in tens of thousands of Albanian and Kosovar refugees, but are paying the high price of the war given the logistical difficulties they face as a result of the closure of the region's airports and the impact on the whole of Apulia's tourist industry as tourists cancel their reservations and decide not to visit the region."
"That concludes voting time."
"The remaining votes will take place after the votes on topical and urgent subjects."
"The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Transport infrastructure charging (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the report (A4-0111/99) by Mrs Schmidbauer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the White Paper on fair payment for infrastructure use: a phased approach to a common transport infrastructure charging framework in the EU (COM(98)0466 - C4-0514/98)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no one will deny that the development of transport has a considerable impact on the environment."
"All countries are faced with the problems of nuisance, pollution or even congestion in city centres, so the desire to internalise the external costs incurred by the various forms of transport is perfectly justified."
"That is why we support the Commission's document. However, since it deals with a key issue that has potentially far-reaching consequences, it needs to be approached carefully and pragmatically."
"We are all aware of the importance of transport, particularly in terms of economic development."
"Yet we must also guard against any excesses in this area."
"I would like to state that we disagree with two points in Mrs Schmidbauer's report, namely, the proposal to include car traffic in the charging system and the taxation of kerosene."
"As to the first point, I am not convinced of the relevance of this proposal, at least in terms of the charging system that is suggested in the Commission document."
"I do not believe that the problems caused by car traffic relate to the White Paper, as it focuses more specifically on public transport, be it passenger or goods transport."
"I also think that it would be better to deal with car traffic in a specific context."
"As far as my second point is concerned, I believe that we should not be too hasty in legislating on the taxation of kerosene."
"Instead, we should wait until the international agreement on air transport has been concluded so that it can be taken into consideration in all future legislation."
"I feel that it would be best to leave things at that for now and to keep to the Commission's proposals."
"Mr President, I generally refrain from using my precious time to congratulate the rapporteur because this has really just become a habit, but I should like to do so on this occasion, despite the fact that she has unfortunately left the Chamber, because I am extremely pleased with her report."
"In my view this is an extremely important proposal from the Commission, and Mrs Schmidbauer has written a very good report on it."
"There are two important points here as far as my group is concerned."
"First, the principle. As everyone knows, the Greens have for many years been strongly in favour of passing on the costs of using infrastructure to the consumers, because transport is currently too cheap and places too great a burden on the environment."
"There are also practical reasons why I am pleased to see this proposal, despite the fact that, as Mrs Schmidbauer's report points out, there is clearly too little money being invested in infrastructure."
"Overall spending is falling precisely when more money is needed, particularly in our view for investment in rail infrastructure."
"This is why it is only right and proper that the users of the existing infrastructure should help to pay for extending it."
"Of course, there are all sorts of practical problems involved and there is naturally opposition to the idea, as we have seen in the Netherlands, especially if it is not made clear that the investment and charges are needed to keep densely populated areas livable and accessible."
"We have two other minor comments on this report."
"The first concerns paragraph 15, which states that private car traffic must be involved in the proposals as far as possible."
"In my view this is too weak, since it is actually absolutely necessary."
"Private car traffic is responsible for a good deal of the marginal costs involved, and I think it is unfair that goods transport alone should be made to pay the price."
"Finally, paragraph 10 of the report proposes to offset the costs involved by reducing other taxes on transport."
"I do not think this is the right approach."
"I still think that transport is too cheap and that hauling goods backwards and forwards across Europe is still made too attractive."
"We should be trying to make a fresh start here by doing more than just passing on the capital costs of infrastructure, for example, even in the future."
"Mr President, in economic dealings, the customer usually has to pay a price for the goods or services he obtains."
"There is nothing wrong with this, and it is a rule that I think the whole of society accepts."
"But when it comes to using infrastructure, the link is often not obvious enough."
"The total costs of transport and the prices charged in many cases bear no relation to each other, and the Commission proposal is a laudable attempt to improve this situation."
"However, it is very questionable whether the proposed method of charging - the marginal social costs - will cover all the costs involved."
"The Commission is obviously trying to be fairly straightforward here."
"A number of Members have stressed that the introduction of a system of charges must not be allowed to lead to higher costs for the transport user."
"I would not go as far as this. The 'user pays' principle must come first, even if this means increasing prices."
"We must ensure that the costs are borne by the transport end-users, not just by the operators."
"If certain users are excluded from the system of charges, this will inevitably mean that the total costs cannot be completely covered."
"I therefore entirely agree with Amendment No 7 by Mr Lagendijk."
"The proposed charging method must produce a situation where the forms of transport that are least harmful to the environment have a greater share of the whole transport market, and it must therefore be possible to apply an amended version of the 'user pays' principle."
"Mr President, it is an acknowledged fact that external costs are increasing dramatically in the transport sector."
"Apportioning these costs to the respective transport modes therefore makes good sense."
"Most relevant in this regard are the costs of accidents, where we have seen steep rises within the different modes over recent decades."
"A variety of costs can be identified when considering the causes of environmental deterioration."
"We need to assess the impact of noise, for example, and of ground, air and water pollution."
"The problems are growing in these areas."
"Difficulties begin in earnest when it comes to evaluating such costs."
"Major differences exist at present between the EU Member States; both the White Paper and the report highlight this."
"Vehicle tax can be as high as EUR 3 000 per annum, for example. There are nine different charging systems for rail transport, with the level of cost coverage ranging from zero to 100 %."
"Not least for reasons of competition, it would be desirable for the Union to have a common approach to cost coverage for all the different modes of transport."
"Everyone would surely agree on the need to seek a fair basis for calculating Eurovignette charges, motorway tolls and so on."
"What is more, in the light of developments over recent years, we now have greater scope to introduce uniform technical systems - applicable in all the Member States - for example using telematics."
"Such possibilities were simply not available on the same scale in the past."
"This all sounds very positive, of course."
"And there is undoubtedly good reason to try to harmonise rules and provisions within the transport sector, not least in order to ensure that the single market operates better in future than it does today."
"We need to strive for fair competition between all modes of transport, with a level playing field in terms of competition between the Member States."
"The EU can see to some of this, but a great deal - possibly the major part - lies in the hands of the Member States themselves."
"Some countries - my own included - levy considerably higher taxes and charges than others in several areas."
"Until people take this fact on board, we are never going to have fair conditions of competition."
"The proposal endorsed by a majority of the Committee on Transport and Tourism could well trigger a further increase in the costs affecting the transport sector."
"Private cars could lose out badly, and certainly will do if the rapporteur's line is followed."
"This is quite unacceptable."
"The PPE Group has tabled a number of amendments to counter such effects, but so far we have received no support."
"Unless such support is forthcoming today, I can see no way of backing the committee's proposal as it has been presented."
"Mr President, my colleague Manuel Porto could not be here this afternoon and I wish to speak on his behalf."
"We welcome this further initiative by the Commission and Barbara Schmidbauer's report on sharing the costs of transport infrastructure."
"This is a field where there is clearly no doubt about the jurisdiction of the European Union, particularly in relation to the distortions that occur when different criteria are applied from one country to another, no matter whether this happens close to or far from borders, as in some countries users pay for infrastructure through fuel taxes and tolls, and in others it is financed from the public purse."
"It is hard to find fault with the philosophy of also recovering external transport costs."
"As these are very high for road transport, including noise, atmospheric pollution and accidents, as demonstrated in the diagrams presented by the rapporteur, there is every justification for making users pay more. In fact this amounts to extending existing practice, whereby road users - via fuel and vehicle taxes and tolls - pay twice the amount spent on roads, whereas railway users pay 56 % and users of inland waterways pay 18 % of the relevant expenditure."
"Apart from this being fair, it also meets the desirable objective of providing an incentive for shifting demand towards modes of transport with lower external cost factors."
"However, to avoid the risk of the public being unfairly penalised, it is essential to encourage immediate improvements in such types of transport. In my country, for example, this applies to tracks for high-speed trains within the country and links to other European countries."
"Furthermore, it is important to ensure proper distribution of the costs of each mode of transport and route, in a way that is fair and does not distort competition."
"So we totally support the rapporteur's call for private car use to be properly taken into account when distributing the costs of road transport."
"It is also important not to end up with the same situation as in my country, where virtually identical motorways and bridges are subject to widely varying tolls - or none at all - depending on the political clout of the region they serve."
"In this context it is particularly shocking that as a result tolls are being scrapped in metropolitan areas populated by people with higher incomes and where it should be important to discourage the use of private vehicles, whilst they are being maintained in less privileged areas, where there are no demonstrations or electoral backlash, and are raised every year."
"Automatic charging systems like the one on the 'Via Verde ' in Portugal avoid potential problems with tailbacks."
"Another point is that for perfectly understandable social reasons, it would be possible to set an upper limit on monthly payments for anyone who needs to use this infrastructure on a daily basis."
"Mr President, on behalf of Mr Neil Kinnock I am pleased to react to this report and start by welcoming the support offered in the report and also acknowledging the concerns expressed."
"I feel certain that we will be able to address these concerns as we implement the principles and develop concrete proposals."
"On behalf of Mr Kinnock I should like to thank wholeheartedly Mrs Schmidbauer for her very constructive report and her support for the Commission's approach in the White Paper."
"Let me make a few comments about the points of concern."
"Firstly, yes, the timetable for implementation is ambitious but we are well on the way, with the Eurovignette agreement near conclusion, railway directives before the Council, the port-cost survey with Member States, airport-charging proposals, aviation charges under review, the Committee of Government Experts having met and commissioned the high-level group to report on cost-estimation methods."
"Indeed, we are almost ahead of schedule!"
"Whilst we are still using more specific directives, the Commission will, of course, ensure that no inconsistencies or perverse effects result from this approach."
"The White Paper also stresses the need for balanced implementation, in particular between road and rail sectors."
"It is for this reason that the railway package provides explicitly for subsidies to railways where there are unpaid external costs in competing modes, such as roads."
"It is a good example of how the Commission is avoiding inconsistencies in the implementation process by clearly identifying a problem and offering a practical solution."
"The White Paper addressed equity and distributional issues as well as the problems faced in peripheral areas."
"Much of this discussion applies equally to enlargement issues and candidate countries, and I feel sure that we will be able to consider these aspects when we further develop our proposals."
"Member States are encouraged to incorporate the principles of the White Paper within their own charging schemes for private car transport in harmony with any EU-wide developments."
"Whilst some Community legislation applies to private car users - such as fuel duties, excise duties, VAT - our current approach to charging is focused on commercial traffic, because that is a problem which can be addressed successfully only by a Community regulatory framework, safeguarding the functioning of the internal transport market while, at the same time, fully integrating environmental objectives."
"Private car use raises a host of regional and local issues which, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, call for a somewhat different type of approach, which we have been developing primarily through the action programme for the citizens' network."
"I am convinced that at this stage of Community policy-making the differentiated approach will be both the most effective and will rightly respect the legitimate roles of transport policy-makers at other political levels."
"Finally, I should like to thank you for the support the report offers."
"We all know that this area, pricing issues - be they in road, rail, aviation or maritime sectors - is fraught with obstacles and progress, especially at the political level, can be painfully slow."
"To have the support of Parliament on such subjects is therefore particularly welcome."
"Maximum authorised dimensions and weights in international traffic"
"The next item is the second report (A4-0114/99) by Mr van Dam, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive amending Council Directive 96/53/EC, laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic (COM(98)0414 - C4-0486/98-98/0227(SYN))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, on the way here this morning, various colleagues said to me 'this is your big day'."
"Normally it is indeed a pleasure when you have a report on the agenda, but no rapporteur likes to have the mixed feelings that I am experiencing at the moment because of the annoying stalemate in which we find ourselves."
"Two months ago, we had another debate on combined transport here in the Chamber."
"The vote which followed confirmed that the European Parliament could not agree to the Commission's proposal to exempt combined transport from the generally accepted 40-tonne weight limit."
"As a result, the proposal was referred back to the Committee on Transport."
"Shortly afterwards there were consultations between members of the Transport Committee and representatives of the Commission, and after a subsequent discussion in the committee I concluded that the majority were still in favour of maintaining the position adopted two months ago."
"Formally speaking this is the correct line to take, since the Commission has not come up with any new or amended proposals since Parliament rejected its original one."
"So in formal terms, there is no reason for Parliament to revise its position of two months ago."
"However, as rapporteur I can tell you that the Commission has not just been sitting on its hands."
"Both in its consultations with Parliament's representatives and at the Transport Committee meeting, it indicated that it was prepared to re-examine those sections on which Parliament had insurmountable objections."
"Because of the limited time available, it has not been able to produce any proposals on paper, but it has become clear that the Commission is favourably disposed and appears prepared to take Parliament's objections on board and amend the current proposal accordingly."
"According to my information, there is also almost unanimous support in the Council for increasing the maximum weight."
"Only the United Kingdom appears to oppose this, but if there is an exemption for islands it should be able to benefit from this in view of its island status."
"Given the present circumstances, it is difficult for me to vote for or against the resolution by the Transport Committee."
"I would not vote against because the situation has changed since two months ago, but I also would not vote in favour because the Commission's approach deserves a better response than for Parliament simply to dig in its heels."
"I have to say, therefore, that I find it difficult to understand the hard line that some of my colleagues are pursuing."
"In my view, there is no doubt that we can find a way out of this impasse through negotiation, but as rapporteur I had no choice but to represent the view of the majority in the Committee on Transport."
"I would urge them to keep an open mind on the Council's position and the Commission's amendments, and I am confident that this issue can be brought to a successful conclusion which is acceptable to all parties at the start of the new parliamentary term."
"Mr President, first of all, I believe we have to thank Mr van Dam for stepping into the breach here and taking on the thankless task of continuing this report."
"Unfortunately, I believe - and I am not the first to say this - that we have the classic case here in which a principle that we welcome and support, namely combined transport, in other words the effort to shift traffic away from the roads and onto the railways and waterways, has been dealt a severe blow by a single inappropriate measure."
"That was the criticism last time and, sad to say, nothing has changed."
"I do not think it makes any sense to create a rule which virtually makes every ban on Sunday and night haulage negotiable."
"Nor does it make any more sense to allow a 44-tonne weight limit without any other restrictions at all."
"We have criticised this several times."
"We rejected it here in Parliament."
"The Council, for its part, did not take up Parliament's proposal on the inclusion of tax incentives to promote combined transport."
"The fact is that we rejected this on the last occasion."
"The Commission has had the opportunity to make changes, as Mr van Dam rightly said, because it is after all the initiator of the legislative process and can revise its own proposals."
"We in Parliament made our position perfectly clear."
"We said we rejected this blanket solution and asked the Commission to come back with concrete proposals involving tighter rules. And I have to say to the Commissioner, even if he is not here at the moment, that sending a letter to the committee is not a proposal."
"It is not enough!"
"I shall make no bones about this: a letter does not suffice as notice of intent."
"That is why we await a more concrete set of proposals from the Commission."
"I believe Parliament is disposed to support the principle of combined transport."
"But if no proposals are forthcoming, we can do nothing."
"For that reason, we can only endorse the concluding words of the report: '... rejects the Commission proposal and calls on the Commission to withdraw its proposal'."
"That is the position."
"There is nothing else we can do at the present time."
"The Commission may be slightly incapacitated because of the current situation, but we hope that it will be able, as soon as possible after the start of the next legislative term, to present some reasonable proposals that we can discuss."
"That would enable us to see this business through quite quickly, and there will be no need for us to make full use of our speaking time, because this issue practically generates its own momentum."
"Mr President, the van Dam report, previously the Wijsenbeek report, is running the risk of becoming another Tolman report on isoglucose, in other words an institutional first."
"First of all, Parliament and the Commission originally had diametrically opposite views on this issue, and I have to say that when I was rapporteur, I entirely agreed with the Commission."
"Now we have to find a solution."
"If it is held over until after the elections, it will come under the codecision procedure."
"But what is doubly remarkable is that under a heading which does not exist in the Treaties, a current affairs issue on which Parliament and the Commission have opposing views, Mr Kinnock, should have come before the Council unamended."
"If it were not for the fact that there was no question at all of unanimity in the Council, not even unanimity minus one, then the Council might well have agreed with the Commission and might have accepted the decision, despite Parliament's very different views."
"I therefore feel it is time to try to find some common solutions calmly, quietly and through consultation."
"As Mr Piecyk said, we agree that combined transport needs to be promoted and that greater use must be made of the inland waterways and railways."
"It seems that all we disagree on are those few tonnes, although we all know how much discussion there has been on excess weight and how many exceptions have been agreed over the weekend."
"We have to find a middle ground here."
"Even though, the political circumstances being what they are, the present Commission is only supposed to be dealing with current affairs, in this particular case I am dealing with something 'in transit' on behalf of Mr Kinnock."
"The discussions that have taken place with the rapporteur and other Members since the debate on the van Dam report, previously the Wijsenbeek report, at the February part-session have convinced me, or rather Mr Kinnock, that we all agree on the need to make combined transport more attractive and competitive."
"We want to encourage a shift from road transport to other forms of transport that are more sustainable, safer and more energy-efficient, while at the same time giving transport users more choice."
"As an important element of these joint efforts, the Commission is proposing to enable transport operators in the Community to use a maximum lorry weight of 44 tonnes, but only for road transport which forms part of a combined transport operation and only for the relatively short road legs of the combined transport journey."
"Of course, this is not the only way to make this potentially important transport sector more competitive, but I want to make a significant contribution by improving the conditions under which the road legs of combined transport journeys are carried out, not least by reducing the often unreasonably high costs involved."
"If we could reduce the costs by 10 % for heavy goods transport, it would be an important incentive for potential combined transport users."
"Experience in a number of Member States has shown this to be the case."
"Seven of the Member States already allow a weight of 44 tonnes or more for all road transport, while others allow 44 tonnes for part of a combined transport operation."
"As honourable Members are undoubtedly aware, the Member States can prescribe a maximum weight of 44 tonnes for three-axle vehicles forming part of a five- or six-axle combination to prevent such vehicles from causing too much damage to the roads."
"Clearly, this proposal is not intended to give road transport an unfair advantage, quite the reverse."
"It is specifically designed to influence the behaviour of road transport operators by persuading them to use other forms of transport."
"The net result will be that a greater volume of goods will be transported by rail, inland waterway and short-haul transport."
"As Mr Kinnock pointed out to Mr van Dam in his letter of 11 March, he genuinely believes that we need to translate the consensus we have achieved on the need to promote combined transport into specific, practical measures."
"In our view we need at this stage, as someone said earlier, to consider more restrictive weight rules for island Member States than those originally proposed by the Commission, for the obvious reason that their links with the rest of the market are not just by road."
"In addition, it also makes sense to examine ways of determining whether a road journey genuinely forms part of a combined transport operation."
"On behalf of Mr Kinnock let me say - including to Mr Wijsenbeek - that I hope we can find universally acceptable solutions on the basis of compromise proposals."
"Finally, I should like to thank the Committee on Transport and Tourism and the rapporteur, Mr van Dam, for all their efforts on this very complicated subject."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken this evening at 5.30 p.m."
"Electronic money and its use"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report deals as you know with electronic money."
"Obviously, it is not easy for us to tell today how much this type of money will be used in the future."
"Today we basically have two ways of paying electronically: using 'smart' cards, onto which we can 'load' money; or by 'loading' money onto our computers via various programs and systems which enable us to pay over the Internet."
"It is worth pointing out that these two methods of payment have failed to take off in the manner predicted a few years ago."
"I hope that we will soon be bold enough to make the necessary great leap forward."
"Along with many others, I believe that the euro will open up fantastic prospects once it actually exists in physical form."
"And using the methods I have been describing, we can in practice already make use of the euro now. From the point of view of ordinary people, this lends reality to the new currency."
"Of course, European legislation will be required in this area."
"Harmonisation is necessary in view of the single market and the fact that, to a large extent, we live in a common currency area."
"There is no contradiction here with the subsidiarity principle."
"The apple of discord when discussing this directive has been whether the holding and issuing of electronic money should be limited to banks."
"We know that certain Member States sought such a restriction, whereas others did not want there to be any rules at all."
"I am pleased to see that a large majority in Parliaments Committee on Legal Affairs does not wish to see a restriction on the right to issue."
"That is the correct approach, in my view; in this way, we can promote the development of new means of payment."
"Many operators - among them telecommunications companies - are currently bringing new means of payment onto the market."
"This will mean new possibilities for consumers, and the resulting competition should benefit everyone."
"This directive deals mainly with how the issuers of electronic money are to be supervised and how we can ensure that they are fully viable and liquid."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs does not have many amendments to put forward here."
"We did however note with disappointment that the consumer aspects have not been covered in this directive."
"Parliament has observed on many occasions that consumer concerns have been ignored when the Commission has submitted proposals on financial services."
"We would seriously urge the Commission actively to monitor the situation with regard to consumer protection and to keep an eye on how the recommendations on the security and reliability of such means of payment are being followed. As soon as possible, we need to see the appropriate measures put in place to protect consumers."
"It is unfortunately likely to be necessary to introduce further rules governing liability in respect of abuse and breaches of the law in connection with electronic money."
"A horizontal directive, focusing on more general gaps in regulation in the sector, should be able to remedy the situation, ."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs was broadly united in supporting the proposal that consumers should be entitled to redeem electronic money."
"I hope that the Commission can go along with this."
"If such money is to become a feature of our everyday lives, we must of course be able to spend it."
"One way of achieving this is by ensuring that different payment devices and systems can handle all the various cards and programs."
"That is what is meant by the high-sounding term 'interoperability'."
"This can only be achieved if sound business conditions are applied."
"I myself remain convinced that the sector itself will soon launch a series of measures of its own."
"The duty of the public authorities is to guarantee the creation of open systems."
"The Commission can exercise oversight here under its competition powers."
"We also want the Commission to make sure that any standards produced for this sector do not exclude certain operators."
"My group cannot, however, support the proposals in Amendments Nos 12 and 13, which call for separate directives in order to safeguard interoperability."
"May I also point out that we have tabled a number of technical amendments which we hope will clarify the scope of the directive, making it easier in future to amend the legislation."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is pleased with the two directives that have been presented to us, as we believe that extending the provisions to non-bank issuers of electronic money is a good way of stimulating competition in this area whilst improving the quality of service offered and the prices charged to consumers."
"I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, on her report and to welcome the fact that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights has taken on board nearly all the proposals of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in its report."
"This means that I do not have to repeat many of the points the committee made, as they have already been dealt with, and I will therefore use my speaking time to stress some of the problems we face, which are a matter of great concern to us."
"Firstly, there is the problem of interoperability."
"We think it is extremely important to have an interoperable system of using electronic money between different countries, but this interoperability involves having a card that everyone accepts."
"Mrs Thors and I have been informed that the CIP very recently reached agreement on a card, but we were also told, during a hearing that we organised, that it could take 18 months before this type of card comes into use."
"Well, Commissioner, we on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs think that the various forms of electronic money are of vital importance for implementing the euro as quickly as possible before the coins and notes come into circulation. This could be either in the form of virtual money stored on computers for electronic commerce or in the form of interoperable cards."
"This 18 month lead-time will yet again delay an opportunity for the public to use the euro, which seems rather worrying to us."
"We also find it rather worrying that each country has its own inter-bank system so that there is no internal market in banking systems. Similarly, we are concerned that payments effected within the internal market are treated as international payments, with all the costs that implies."
"We have therefore made some proposals on this subject, namely Amendments Nos 12 and 13, which Mrs Thors has already referred to. We have tabled these amendments because we consider it essential, Commissioner, for the Commission to bring forward draft directives on this subject, so that there is a set of regulations which everyone recognises and which provides a guarantee for every citizen in Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Thors, for her excellent report on an important subject."
"This report should be seen in conjuction with Mr Ullmann's report on electronic signatures and my own report, which will come up next month, on electronic commerce."
"The Internet and methods of working electronically are a way forward for the world and the European Union."
"This is a growth area and should create a large number of jobs."
"At a briefing yesterday, Commissioner Flynn said there were around 100 000 job vacancies in the European Union in this area."
"It is important that we get sensible rules that will encourage growth of the Internet and electronic commerce."
"Electronic money is not used very much at present, but I am sure that it will become very important in the future."
"The basis of Mrs Thors' report will encourage this growth."
"We need to ensure that we establish rules at European level that encourage the use of computers and do not stifle economic development."
"I thank the rapporteur."
"I shall be supporting her report."
"Mr President, this issue always seems to create confusion."
"Because the electronic world is unfamiliar, we imagine that this is all about some sort of virtual money."
"There is no such thing."
"What we are really dealing with here is a new way of undertaking and recording credit transactions."
"Like the assignat in revolutionary France, which marked the introduction of credit money, electronic money has brought new forms of fraud and new ways for governments to circumvent budgetary restrictions."
"We really must find common rules."
"It is perhaps important to point out that this must not be taken as a pretext for returning to a type of situation in which private trading houses control the money supply."
"In the high middle ages, one of the main instruments that was used to promote economic development throughout Europe and to overcome the problems connected with private money was the introduction of silver coinage, guaranteed by the monarch."
"By the same token, I believe there are three demands to be made, and indeed they are made in the report: universality must mean interoperability, redeemability and free use."
"Money can be made from the related financial services."
"All of this must be organised in the euro framework; it must not be based on the harsh terrain within which the banking and financial services sector still operates."
"If that condition is met, important avenues will open up here, and they must be pursued."
"But we do need to cast off the Klondike mentality which sees electronic operations as the key to a great financial boom, just as the assignat was expected to be."
"The outward token of credit is not a collateral loan."
"Merely promising to honour a loan is not honouring the promise, which is something that has to take place in the future."
"That is why the whole area of the prudential supervision of issuing companies is actually a key element without which the realm of electronic money cannot develop in an accountable way."
"I should also like to remind the House of our urgent need to act in the field of banking supervision too."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteurs, Mrs Thors on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights and Mr Torres Marques on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy."
"They have made an extremely valuable contribution to the review of these proposals."
"I must stress that the issuance of electronic money is just one element in the far broader context of electronic commerce systems and, within those systems, electronic payments themselves."
"The Commission thinks it right to tackle the horizontal issues common to this broader context with horizontal instruments and measures, rather than applying restricted solutions limited to just one service."
"The proposals for directives that we are discussing in fact relate to a specific aspect which has its own special features, requiring a targeted legislative response."
"By this I mean the problem - and it alone is the problem - of the minimum prudential rules which, by ensuring that electronic currency institutions are stable and sound, will open the way to mutual recognition of authorisations and controls, and hence genuine free movement of operators and services."
"You will know that traditional credit institutions are already themselves authorised to issue electronic money, in accordance with the whole array of banking directives, and this new service of theirs may therefore make use of the European passport."
"These two proposals are designed to open up to other operators, within a neutral competitive framework, the new market for the issuance of electronic money, taking into account both the concern to see proper competition develop in the sector and the situation as it currently exists in a number of Member States."
"The report from the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is largely positive in its assessment of the two proposals and includes amendments which improve their clarity."
"It is a view that I welcome and for which I am grateful."
"But I do not think that two other different issues - which I consider to be extremely sensitive - can usefully be tackled in this directive, namely the concerns voiced in the report in relation to interoperability and redemption of the stored money."
"As I have said, the Commission is already looking at these important issues within a broader framework and has undertaken to deal with them appropriately, including, among other things, all the expectations relating to bearer protection."
"And so although we are today unable to accept the amendments in this area, this is only because the Commission does not consider the two proposals under discussion to be the appropriate context."
"Nonetheless, we agree with the analyses of the problems that will have to be resolved in the appropriate context and manner."
"Let me mention briefly the individual amendments."
"The Commission is able to accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 14, 20, 21 and 22 to the proposal for a directive on the electronic money institutions."
"Amendment No 3 asks the Commission to draw up a specific directive on the contractual relationship between issuers and bearers of electronic money."
"As the House will be aware, in 1997 the Commission adopted a recommendation in this regard and we are now looking at its application: it would therefore be premature to undertake to adopt a proposal for a directive at this juncture, as the situation cannot be properly assessed until the current review is completed."
"That is why we are unable to accept the amendment."
"Amendments Nos 4 to 13, with the exception of Amendment No 10, concern the problems linked to the payments system, in particular the existence and administration of inter-bank systems, interoperability and access to them."
"As I have said, these issues are being dealt with horizontally, within a more comprehensive framework, as part of other work in which the Commission is engaged, and we therefore cannot agree to these amendments."
"Similar considerations apply to Amendments Nos 10, 18 and 19 to the proposal for a directive on the electronic money institutions, and Amendments Nos 1 and 2 to the other directive."
"They relate to the problem of redeeming stored electronic money."
"This problem is also being tackled as part of the review of the application of the recommendation on the relationship between issuers and bearers."
"Furthermore, the Commission has already undertaken to monitor consistently all the problems concerning bearer protection in relation to electronic money, and these problems naturally extend further than the issue of redemption alone."
"I must repeat that the Commission is very sensitive to these aspects and open to many of the solutions set out in the amendments, but we do not believe the approach and the legislative instrument used to be appropriate, and therefore feel that we cannot accept these amendments."
"The Commission also agrees with what is proposed in Amendment No 15, but has to enter a reservation with regard to its exact wording and the order of the individual paragraphs."
"Amendment No 16 is also acceptable, but it is helpful to place the adverb 'only' before 'references', so as to avoid creating confusion with references contained in other instruments."
"That, I believe is the intention of the author of the amendment."
"Clearly, the Commission accepts Amendment No 17 in that same perspective."
"It also accepts Amendment No 23, except for the second paragraph; this cannot technically be deleted because in the event of derogation from the first and second banking directives, neither the competent authorities nor the own funds would any longer be defined."
"Let me conclude, Mr President, by again expressing my sincere thanks for the broadly favourable report that has been presented and for having been given this opportunity of explaining the Commission's views on the amendments which we are unable to accept but which it will, I hope, be possible to reconsider in the light of what I have said."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"Financial services framework for action"
"The next item is the report (A4-0175/99) by Mr Fayot, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the communication from the Commission 'Financial services: building a framework for action' (COM(98)0625 - C4-0688/98)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is working towards the creation of a single market in financial services."
"It is a process that was given political impetus by the Heads of State and Government at the Cardiff and Vienna summits and which should lead, at the Cologne summit, to a report detailing the measures needed to implement a single financial market."
"I hope that Commissioner Monti will continue to participate in this process for the remainder of the Commission's term of office as he has the authority and know-how to see it through."
"He has headed a high-level group of representatives of the finance ministers which assisted the Commission's deliberations on the matter and which has just completed its work."
"We hope that this method will bear fruit at Member State level."
"Thanks to Parliament's report, together with the consultations the Commission held with experts, Mr Monti is in a position to put forward a series of measures at the Cologne summit."
"In spite of the restrictions the resigning Commission has imposed in terms of new legislative initiatives, I feel that the work undertaken in this area over quite some time now should be brought to a conclusion at this European Council."
"The present Commission communication is entitled 'Building a framework for action' and it is extremely useful for examining all the issues relating to financial services."
"I should like to begin by saying a few words on the theoretical background to the communication."
"The document states that a financial market, a genuinely single financial market, would automatically mean better optimisation of resources leading to lower cost capital for industry."
"Such increased efficiency would appear to lead to stronger growth and therefore to the creation of jobs."
"However, I remain somewhat sceptical about all of this."
"Mergers and economies of scale in this sector, the trend for the creation of mega banks and conglomerates, technological developments that lead to improved productivity, and the consequent pressures on employment or on the actors working at a regional level all have their own particular logic which is not necessarily akin to the general interest or the employment objectives."
"The communication outlines the measures that are needed in the area of the single market and financial services."
"If we really want to make progress, we must establish political priorities, though it is clearly not easy to make clear choices."
"So, for example, I believe that we need to rebalance the current strategy that places the emphasis on the supply side, through a strategy that has a more demand-driven approach."
"In fact, consumer organisations have shown, for instance, that existing European legislation in this field concentrates on the supply side, whereas demand, which benefits consumers and small businesses, plays a minor role."
"It is striking to note in this connection that, contrary to all expectations, the advent of the euro has not improved the supply of transnational financial services, but has instead made it more expensive."
"Whereas trade and cross-border consumption are on the increase, the general feeling is that this increase has not been mirrored in the area of financial services. Nor have these services adapted to the new context."
"They either remain entrenched behind their national and sectoral logic, or appear to consider the sector of little interest. What is more, this logic may simply be the logic of easy profit, rather than one that takes account of the nature of the services in the general interest that the bank should provide for a range of consumers."
"The retail market undoubtedly merits special attention."
"Instead of enabling consumers to benefit from competition, the present situation is marked by huge price differences in credit cards, mortgages and other services and the communication contains detailed information on this."
"However, the wholesale market needs as much impetus and supervision from the Community as the retail market."
"Pension funds and risk capital markets are good examples of this."
"In its report, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs highlights the importance of liquid and efficient European venture capital markets for start-ups and innovative companies in the high-technology industries."
"Nonetheless, at the moment, almost all the Member States are trying to develop their own venture capital markets, yet none of them have achieved the necessary critical mass to allow such markets to really take off."
"We would also stress the need to create a single market in pension funds."
"Whatever the attitude towards this type of social security, it is true that the aging of the population creates considerable demand that financial services will have to meet."
"And this sector will only be able to evolve within a large internal market."
"To achieve this, the funds collected must be invested in diversified and internationalised portfolios, the principle of freedom of choice must be respected and we must also prevent all types of discrimination on a national level, be it of a fiscal or procedural nature."
"More generally speaking, the Commission is proposing eight points for action concerning the wholesale markets."
"These initiatives will form a major legislative body of new legislation and revisions of existing outdated legislation or ineffective regulatory apparatus."
"It would be interesting to learn what the high-level group thought on this issue."
"Are we, for example, to replace the 11 banking directives, the eight directives on investment services, the 21 directives on insurance as well as the interpretive texts, and if so, what are we to replace them with?"
"Are we heading towards the creation of a single body of legislation for financial services, or are we going to continue, as we have done in the past, to pile essential texts on top of one another, according to developments in the market and in financial services?"
"One of the very sensitive issues in this sector relates to supervision and prudential supervision, which is still currently based on the frontiers of a country and the home-rule."
"The debate on supervision in home countries as opposed to supervision in host countries has, until now, prevented any major shift towards either European supervisory systems or a European body for supervision."
"However, the increasing pace of electronic banking, distance selling and electronic commerce will render the differences between home and host rules obsolete."
"At present, the speed with which capital movements take place defies the ability of national authorities to supervise them."
"We must therefore think in terms of new form of international cooperation and therefore consider, for example, defining a European Union rule and making it the basis of the new rules and new prudential supervision within the Union."
"I am well aware, Mr President, that, given the present situation, this presents some prospects for the medium, and even the long, term."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is very concerned about the high levels of consumer protection that exist in relation to the retail market."
"This is why we are proposing to study the appointment of a European Union ombudsman for financial services provided in the retail markets, independent of any Community or national institution and of any particular interests."
"There are many arguments in favour of the creation of such an institution."
"No genuine cross-border appeal and redress procedure currently exists."
"Pan-European products are going to be developed."
"National appeal and redress procedures are very varied and are often difficult to understand."
"I should just like to add that there is a need for legislation on financial middlemen in the area of consumer and housing credit and insurance in order to protect consumers in cross-border markets."
"I regret that the committee did not support me on this point which is, in my view, a very precise and important requirement of European consumers."
"Mr President, our political task is clear. The Commission must present an action plan on financial services to the ECOFIN Council, which must then submit this plan to the approval of the Cologne European Council."
"I might add that, once their blessing has been given at the highest level, the Commission and the Council will have to act promptly."
"I can assure you that Parliament will not delay the decisions needed to set up this single market in financial services, which, to a greater or lesser degree, we all hope will become a reality."
"Mr President, we broadly agree with what the rapporteur has just said."
"First, we believe that a Commission, even a resigning Commission, must continue the work it has undertaken since such work forms an integral part of the management of daily business. This might seem quite daring in relation to some of the definitions in national public law, but bearing in mind both the urgency and the pressure applied by the Council to complete the work within the deadlines - we have timetables to adhere to - we must see it through to completion."
"We are therefore particularly pleased with the request put forward in this respect since we have here in the House a Commissioner who has shown himself to be an expert in these matters and who has demonstrated his ability to listen to Parliament's requests. Moreover, he is someone who holds considerable sway with the governments and with the ECOFIN Council in particular."
"I therefore think that the conditions are right for this work to continue, and if I might add a personal wish, I hope that Mr Prodi will include Mr Monti in his new team; both the Commission and Parliament would benefit from this."
"Let us look at several retail problems."
"I do not exactly share Mr Fayot's doubts as regards the significance of the single market, though it is true that it is not providing us with much proof of its purpose at present."
"This is simply because there is still great diversity in terms of the various national legislation and very little harmonisation."
"For example, we have 38 different securities markets."
"In my view, the key element in all of this is prudential supervision."
"Much can be said and done in this respect at European level because securitisation has completely changed the nature of prudential supervision."
"Before, there were only banks, where it was easy to find the appropriate recommendation, sanction, etcetera. But it is a different story when it comes to securities that can travel across the world, because this creates systematic risks that our current organisation does not allow us to compensate for."
"This is all the more reason, therefore, for creating a form of European prudential supervision that is more effective than our own systems."
"Mr President, I in turn would once again like to thank the Commissioner for carrying on with the work he had already embarked upon in this extremely important area of the drafting and renewal of financial services legislation."
"I am especially pleased that, despite the shock waves that have reverberated through the Commission recently - even though the Commissioner himself is above suspicion in this affair - he has not stopped promoting this extremely useful work in the area of financial services."
"I also want to agree for once with what Mr Hermann said on the subject of the usefulness of the major stock exchanges. One of the things we are expecting from the single currency is the unification of the securities market in Europe."
"This will put it on a par with the American money market. In this way we will be able to draw from it the necessary investment to increase the activity of the European economy and to create jobs."
"Of course, there are some very real dangers associated with the major stock exchanges, some of which have quite rightly been pointed out by our rapporteur, whom I would like to commend on his work."
"We should add to these the danger of systemic shock, which is caused by excessive 'leveraging' and may even lead to the collapse of the stock exchanges."
"Mr President, I would like to end by announcing in this part-session that last week a historic event took place in this area."
"The Canadian Parliament, the first in the world to do so, took the decision to introduce a tax on speculative capital, the famous Tobin tax."
"I think that this is something we must begin to address in the fullness of time."
"Mr President, I must begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Fayot, for the extraordinary work he has done in this complex report."
"I am also grateful to Mr Fayot, Mr Herman and Mr Katiforis for their kind words: needless to say, I am greatly touched by them."
"The Commission welcomes the fact that the report expresses general support for the framework for action."
"It sets out what we believe needs to be done."
"The Fayot report largely mirrors our own views and I am grateful for the support that has been expressed, particularly in relation to the urgent need to fill a number of existing gaps in the law, for example in relation to integrated pension schemes."
"The Commission is in complete agreement with the rapporteur that, despite the substantial progress which has been made towards the completion of the single market in financial services, cross-border sales of financial products on a retail basis to individual consumers remain the exception rather than the rule within the European Union, and there are still large variations in price between the Member States."
"I take a slightly different line from Mr Fayot, in terms of explaining the situation at least, in that I believe that we have to look here both at the economy of supply and the economy of demand, which are closely linked."
"In any event, I believe that the concerns he voices have to be fully shared."
"Union policy ought to be based on a pragmatic approach tailored to three key sectors: firstly, it is essential that those who purchase financial services are provided with clear and comprehensible information; and secondly, the appeal procedures are vital to consumer confidence."
"In that context, the rapporteur suggests that we consider the arguments in favour of setting up an EU ombudsman for financial services;"
"I would suggest that we go further along that path and consider more widely the forms of redress which are currently available to users of financial services throughout the Union."
"Thirdly, harmonisation and mutual recognition are intrinsically linked."
"If all the Member States have the same basic level of protection, it will become easier to accept and grant mutual recognition for protection accorded in other states."
"The rapporteur suggests setting up a system of integrated retail payments."
"There is already in operation a fully effective and integrated infrastructure for wholesale and inter-bank transactions, but developments in the infrastructures for small-scale cross-border payments have not kept pace with this."
"I agree with the rapporteur that it is absolutely necessary to reinforce the efforts being made by the financial institutions and the national administrations to overcome these obstacles."
"But it is not possible to create by statute a single retail financial area in which basic banking transactions are economic and effective, as in the national systems; however, the framework for action illustrates how progress can be achieved in that process."
"As far as the prudential rules are concerned, and the rapporteur suggests that the Commission should submit a report on the effectiveness of those currently in force, I believe that the recent upheaval and the way in which the European Union has, on the whole, coped with it, demonstrate that the prudential rules are basically effective."
"I therefore prefer to focus on how to integrate and improve them, rather than on what I might describe as a backward-looking report."
"The pace of change in the markets and the financial intermediaries has revealed the possible limits of a sectoral approach, and that tendency becomes more marked with the process of global financial integration."
"I agree with the rapporteur that, as far as the regulatory and supervisory authorities are concerned, these developments represent new challenges that can be met through effective cooperation and coordination between the regulatory and supervisory authorities, with a clear division of supervisory responsibilities and sound financial regulations to manage the global institutional and system risk."
"I would stress that, as far as the possibility of better supervision of financial services at European Union level is concerned, our attention ought to focus on the large financial groupings."
"Finally, how can the Commission, Parliament and the Council take forward this process?"
"The framework for action is addressed to the European Parliament, which will have a key role in the process of modernising the financial services sector, on the basis of the results obtained by the group in which the representatives of the finance ministries are taking part and Parliament's own report."
"We are now working towards the ECOFIN Council of 25 May, and I have to say that your words have given us great and valuable encouragement to press on with this work."
"I wish finally to say that as regards the amendments tabled at the end by Mr Fayot, I am in agreement, with three exceptions, namely Amendments Nos 2, 5 and 7."
"I have already explained to the rapporteur why I have some doubts about them."
"I will also add a word of explanation about Amendment No 11."
"I should like to end by making the point that, as regards the large number of directives in the sector - and Mr Fayot is right about that - the bulk of the existing directives are in fact directives amending earlier directives, so that rather than there being 22 banking directives in force, there are actually only six."
"But we are working to codify those six directives into a single directive and, to give you an idea, to reduce the mass of banking legislation in the European Union from 360 to 80 pages."
"We are trying to do the same in relation to insurance and securities."
"Finally, I must agree with the point made by Mr Herman, to whom I once again extend my thanks, about ensuring security, a view which I share."
"We shall be tabling proposals that reflect the broader aspect of the capital markets, and following closely the work under way in Basle."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The Daphne programme"
"The next item is the report (A4-0188/99) by Mrs Bennasar Tous, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights, on the amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision adopting a programme of Community action (the Daphne programme) (2000-2004) on measures aimed to prevent violence against children, young persons and women (COM(99)0082 - C4-0099/99-98/0192(COD))."
"I give the floor to Mrs Colombo Svevo, who is deputising for Mrs Bennasar Tous."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let me first apologise on behalf of the rapporteur, Mrs Bennasar Tous, who is unable to take part in the debate on this report, which she drafted, as are many colleagues who took part in the discussion in committee and are currently otherwise engaged, attending an international conference in Paris."
"I am sorry that Mrs Bennasar Tous is unable to be here because we should have liked - or at least I personally should have liked - to have sincerely thanked her in person for the work she has done: she has managed to win support for the programme by maintaining a balance - and this is no easy matter - between the spirit and political significance of the programme and the constraints imposed by a legal base which we, unfortunately, regard as very restrictive in terms of the objectives of the programme itself."
"The report that is being presented today is one in which the members of the Committee on Women's Rights take some pride, because it is based on broad consensus and cooperation between all its members."
"Of course, the change the Council made to the legal base - at a time when the first draft of the report was actually ready - has significantly complicated our work, from both a procedural and a substantive point of view."
"That was a source of concern, because you have to bear in mind that after three years' work, on the one hand, the Daphne programme required a strong and secure legal base before 1 January 2000, but we could not let the legal base proposed to us undermine the political approach on which the programme had been based."
"The report that we have drawn up and the amendments that we are putting to you reflect the debate following which the House adopted, in March of this year, a resolution on violence against women."
"We therefore consider the amendments to be an integral part of the programme itself."
"Most importantly, we have the concept of public health, to which we have given a broad interpretation in line with the World Health Organisation - health as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being - and in accordance also with the case-law of the Court of Justice."
"And then we have the actual concept of violence, which specifically covers the elements cited: violence is not only violence against the mental and physical integrity of those on whom it is inflicted, it is also a serious social ill that is damaging to all - the victim, the aggressor and the public."
"That is the second point."
"Still within the ambit of that legal base - which, as I keep saying, seems to us excessively rigid and strict - violence is above all, and we are resolute on this, a violation of human rights, and that is why action to deter violence must be based on a multi-disciplinary approach."
"We cannot therefore leave aside some rights, we cannot permit abuse and violence within the family but not trafficking, and our amendments seek to include violence in all its forms."
"The Daphne programme has proved a source of great added value in combating these problems, particularly because it has successfully involved the NGOs, getting them to work with the institutions."
"We must stress that there has to be linkage and coordination between the different programmes that relate to these issues, particularly the STOP and Daphne programmes."
"As you see, we have tried to devise a broad strategy because a Europe that is able to create a single market and a single currency must be able to find ways and means of jointly tackling a problem of this magnitude."
"We have a five-year programme, and we therefore have the opportunity - and this is also a challenge - to assess the most effective methods and to prepare medium- and long-term measures."
"This is the aim of Daphne: to seek to obtain cooperation between all the parties involved, from the communications media to the local, regional and national authorities and the international organisations."
"We take some comfort from the fact that the programme will come into being under the auspices of the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that the new Article 152 on public health will enable the European Community to take wider-ranging and more dynamic action and, we hope, action that has greater synergy in preventing and combating disease, but also in preventing violence."
"The statistics given in the report make us shudder."
"I must stress that we have to be resolute in asking the Commission and the Council to accept the substance of the amendments in order to ensure that the spirit of the programme is maintained."
"My thanks, in particular, to the Commissioner who is here with us and to Commissioner Gradin for their help and for the initiative which they have shown on this matter."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Colombo Svevo."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to correct a piece of information which I gave you earlier."
"I had a note regarding Mr Fayot's report which said that the vote would take place this afternoon, but I have since been informed that it will take place at the May part-session."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of Mrs Zimmermann who is unfortunately not able to be with us today."
"I should like to begin by thanking the deputy rapporteur, Mrs Colombo Svevo, for all her hard work and for her willingness to accept the amendments and suggestions put forward by the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs."
"For many years now, Parliament has played a prominent role in combating violence, through the various reports it has produced and its initiative to launch a campaign to combat violence against women, as well as through special budget lines which enable us to support some very useful initiatives by the many NGOs working in this field."
"We were therefore delighted to see that the Commission is now planning a multiannual programme called Daphne."
"However, I have to say, Commissioner, that the change in the legal basis made by the Council working party, which we have been forced to accept rather reluctantly and with a great deal of scepticism, has dampened much of our enthusiasm and threatens to undermine Daphne's chances of success, because as Mrs Colombo Svevo just said, violence against children and women is not just a health risk, it is an out-and-out violation of their basic human rights."
"It is an obstacle to equality, to development and to peace, and it cannot just be tackled by looking after the victims."
"It must also be prevented and combated among those who inflict it."
"Combating violence is a particularly complex issue, requiring cooperation with the police and judicial authorities, possible changes to legislation, and information and awareness-raising not just among the public, but also among the official services involved."
"Women's refuges are needed, and special facilities to provide help for the victims."
"There are so many things involved that a multidisciplinary approach is absolutely essential."
"This was the thinking behind the amendments that our committee tabled, and we would like to thank the rapporteur once again for accepting so many of them."
"The only advantage, if I might say so, of the new legal basis is the fact that Parliament decides under the codecision procedure."
"I hope that the Council will take our message on board and accommodate our wishes as much as possible."
"Thank you, Mrs Van Lancker."
"We shall suspend the debate on the report by Mrs Bennasar Tous at this point, since it is time for the topical and urgent debate."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0380/99 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0381/99 by Mr Wijsenbeek and Mr Fassa, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0396/99 by Mr Florio and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0401/99 by Mr Simpson, Mr Cot and Mr Bontempi, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0406/99 by Mrs Moreau and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0414/99 by Mrs Leperre-Verrier and Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0417/99 by Mr Cohn-Bendit and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the Mont Blanc tunnel accident."
"Mr President, with one minute to speak on the Mont Blanc tragedy, I shall not mention the human errors, which are a matter for the courts."
"Instead, I want to talk about political responsibility, because that concerns all of us."
"There has been a tenfold increase in traffic through the road tunnels under the Alps over the last fifteen years."
"That traffic is good business."
"The operating companies have made a fortune out of it without necessarily investing in safety, or even in elementary staff training."
"The local authorities and finance ministers have encouraged that tendency, only too happy to collect extra takings on the cheap."
"Of course, there were alternative solutions, such as the Lyons-Turin piggyback project, which was one of the Delors plan's infrastructure projects."
"That stated priority which we are rediscovering today was never a real priority at top level."
"More spectacular, more symbolic projects, near here, were preferred."
"But most of all, the road lobby was on the alert, even opposing the safety measures the French Minister for Transport has taken recently, because they would have lost articulated lorries precious hours on the London-Milan or Amsterdam-Milan route, and we all know time is money."
"Safety has no price."
"Yes, it has a price, but obviously it is too high - until tragedy strikes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I want to express our horror at the extent of the disaster in the Mont Blanc tunnel which has taken the lives of 41 people."
"I want to send our condolences to the victims and their families and pay tribute to the courage of the rescue services."
"But in a parliament, we have to do more than bear witness to disaster. We must help find answers."
"How could it have happened? How might such a tragedy have been prevented?"
"The figures are revealing."
"In the last thirty years, the heavy goods traffic through the Mont Blanc tunnel has grown eight times as fast as private car traffic."
"One sixth of Italian exports go through that tunnel."
"And there is a Commission report which predicts that the traffic between Italy and France will double in the next ten years."
"Has anyone really thought about the safety consequences of this staggering increase?"
"Is safety one of the Commission's priorities when it puts pressure on countries like Switzerland to dismantle their road transport restrictions, or when it imposes competition and liberalisation to the detriment of rail transport, even though it is safer and more environmentally friendly?"
"On the contrary, in my view, the tragedy in the Mont Blanc tunnel calls for two types of measures."
"Safety diagnostic equipment must be installed in all tunnels immediately, safety measures must be introduced and the level of HGV traffic limited while waiting for the conclusions of the inquiry."
"But in the medium and long term, will the Commission propose firm measures to increase safety by acting on the conditions and modes of transport of goods, as proposed in the joint resolution?"
"Beyond that resolution, I want to stress four points. The first is the maintenance of restrictions on HGV traffic and their harmonisation on the basis of the most widespread current restrictions."
"The second is the more vigorous action to reduce working and driving time for HGV drivers. Thirdly, we must give priority to freight transport by rail in mountain areas and high-risk areas, and fourthly, we need determined action for cooperation between rail companies to harmonise standards, materials and staff training."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are right to express our sorrow today, but it must lead to specific regulations for greater transport safety."
"Mr President, it has taken forty deaths in the Mont Blanc tunnel in horrific circumstances for the European authorities to recognise the consequences of the uncontrolled development of road transport in mountain areas."
"That has not been for lack of pointing them out though, including in this House, but sometimes it is hard for reason to prevail where Alpine transit is involved."
"A rapid and effective response is needed immediately to compensate the families of the victims and give them moral and material support. Moreover, the flow of traffic now converging on the Fréjus tunnel as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel must be channelled."
"The issue must also be looked at as a whole. Obviously, the results of the inquiry will clarify the circumstances of the tragedy and the French Government deserves to be congratulated for having acted promptly and made the initial results of the inquiry public."
"All the same, it is essential to identify responsibilities and strengthen safety measures in all road tunnels, not just the Fréjus tunnel."
"But we must go further because, whether we like it or not, sending columns of forty-tonners up to heights of over 1 200 metres is an aberration."
"Piggyback is the obvious answer to the unavoidable need to cross the Alps."
"It is clearly an expensive answer, but it is justified by its human and environmental benefits."
"Local representatives and associations for the protection of the area and its inhabitants did not wait for disaster to strike to promote cross-border cooperation and sound the alarm."
"We should have listened to them sooner."
"Many victims would have been spared."
"Mr President, as conveyed in the joint resolution, the Green Group wishes to express its sincere condolences to the families of the victims."
"We firmly believe that this is not the time to draw conclusions, given that investigations are under way, but there are certainly a number of points which can be made."
"The first is that the tunnel did not have a lateral safety tunnel and therefore did not meet the necessary safety standards for people travelling through it."
"We can also say that the rescue systems were not adequate, and warnings to that effect had already been given, at the beginning of this year, by the Haute-Savoie fire service."
"My third point is that, in the context of the original decision to build the tunnel to guarantee transit through the Alps, the huge increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles using the tunnel means that the structure does not have sufficient capacity."
"Consequently, we have to point out once again that the priority for European Union transport policy has to be to move the bulk of heavy goods from road to rail."
"Only in that context will it be appropriate to identify safety criteria, for both road and rail tunnels."
"We have seen that rail tunnels have safety problems too."
"The Channel Tunnel has on several occasions run into great difficulty, despite being extremely modern."
"I believe that general policy on long tunnels has to be reviewed."
"Our whole approach to safety needs to be reviewed."
"It has to be a priority of the European Union to invest adequately to guarantee road safety."
"In that context, we believe that policy on tunnels must be properly reviewed."
"Mr President, my group fully concurs with this document drawn up in conjunction with honourable Members from all political groups."
"I wish to stress that, amongst other things, the document calls on the Commission to draw up European legislation - currently sadly lacking - to guarantee high safety standards in road and rail tunnels, and on the Council to adopt without further delay a directive on the control of commercial vehicles."
"It also worth pointing out that the resolution further calls for closer cross-border cooperation between the civil protection units; points to cooperation with the Swiss authorities as the best way of tackling, in the short term, the problems caused by the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel; and calls upon all the Member States to assess the need to equip with a safety tunnel, allowing rapid evacuation in the event of an accident, those tunnels which currently do not have one, as was tragically the case in this incident."
"But I wish also to stress, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission needs to make available a programme of aid for the Italian and French people who are bound to suffer greatly as a result of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel, both as a result of excessive traffic on other roads which are really going to be overloaded and as a result of a decline in traffic and tourism as a result of the tunnel's closure."
"I also think it important that Commissioner Kinnock should carry out an on-the-spot inspection, both at Mont Blanc and in Fréjus, to see for himself the gravity of the situation."
"It is in any event crucial that, provided safety conditions have been met, the tunnel should reopen as soon as possible."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should like to express our deep regret at what happened and extend our sympathies to the victims."
"However, I have to say that I was extremely saddened by what the previous two speakers said."
"Everyone is calling for us to get traffic off the roads and onto the railways, and what happens?"
"Nothing."
"Italy and Austria in particular are creating nothing but obstacles and have not lifted a finger to do any of the work that needs to be done."
"This means that far too many heavy-goods lorries are having to go by road and through the tunnels."
"Now we are asking Switzerland to help."
"It has already started work on the Lutschberg project and the Gotthard tunnel, and now we are going to have to accept its charity."
"But we should have started the work ourselves."
"You cannot say that we have to get the traffic off the roads and then simply do nothing, opposing any new infrastructure and any liberalisation of the railways."
"This is no way for the Greens to go into the elections."
"Mr President, I must first extend my condolences to the victims of the accident and express my admiration for the courage of the rescue services. I want then to make a point which complements what Mr Florio has already said, and is again at the centre of the concerns of the local institutions and economic operators in the regions of Savoie and Valle d'Aosta."
"In particular, the Valle d'Aosta is experiencing a huge rise in the number of hotel bookings cancelled since the closure of the tunnel, and so there is also an economic factor, linked to the tourism which is extremely important for the region and which needs to be taken into account."
"I expect representatives of the affected regions to meet in the coming weeks to assess, not least in the light of our debate, what new measures can be taken both to bring traffic back on to the roads and as regards the issue of tourism."
"I should like to ask the Commission to consider, in relation to those aspects which fall within its jurisdiction of course, the issues linked to tourism which is vital to the region."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to what has already been said, the Mont Blanc tragedy means that we have to clarify the implementation of European Union programmes."
"The European Union came into being on the basis of the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital."
"The free movement of goods must, specifically because it is free movement, also and above all be safe."
"We therefore have to take all necessary, useful and appropriate measures, and we deplore that this was not done."
"Similarly, we so often speak of transfrontier areas, we have programmes for frontier zones and we are concerned to create a Europe of the regions."
"Plainly, we cannot tolerate accidents of this kind, which are totally incompatible with the approach being taken by the European Union."
"By liberalising the movement of persons, the European Union has allowed them to move more frequently; the European Union must implement and secure the implementation of programmes to ensure that movement is both free and, I repeat, safe."
"Mr President, we must first pay our respects to the victims and extend our condolences to their families."
"The publication of an initial expert report on the tragedy of the Mont Blanc tunnel has added an element of farce to a tragedy which has cost more than 40 people their lives - and more bodies may yet be recovered - and which has inflamed the debate on the responsibilities that the French and Italian authorities are trying to offload on one another, making absurd and pretentious excuses."
"So far, no one has been able to tell us what has happened to the video cassettes which record movement through the tunnel and which have yet to be found."
"No one has been able to tell us whether it is true that the lorry that entered the tunnel from the French side was already on fire as it entered the tunnel, and we waste time trying to establish a tiny difference of a minute or two between the time it took the French and Italians to intervene."
"We read that the Italian authorities had calculated that the wind was that day blowing from Italy in the direction of France and therefore prevented cold air intake."
"We read that the French authorities are condemning the dearth of Italian rescue services at the entry to the tunnel and the fact that, in the event of an accident, the rescue services actually had to come from Aosta."
"We say, enough is enough!."
"We repeat that safety in the transport sector has to be a priority of European transport policy and we are therefore asking, as in a question put to the Commission, that the Commission itself should soon - indeed as a matter of urgency - provide for a directive on compulsory safety systems for road tunnels."
"We would further stress that it is similarly important to have a directive laying down roadside procedures and inspections of roadworthiness for commercial vehicles circulating on Europe's roads."
"Mr President, some tragedies are avoidable and the Mont Blanc tunnel tragedy was surely one of them."
"The courts will naturally determine the causes."
"As well as sympathising with the families of the victims, I want to express my support for the local councillors of the Chamonix valley and the Mayor of Chamonix who, sadly, has witnessed several tragedies in the last few months."
"I know that councillors in the Chamonix valley have repeatedly spoken out against the thousands of lorries that travel through that narrow valley and that tunnel, which evidently was not built for such heavy traffic."
"We must learn the lessons of this avoidable tragedy and we must put pressure not only on you, Commissioner, but on the Council too, in order to ensure that a proper road-rail policy is at last developed for goods transport, for both difficult sectors and all national territory."
"Mr President, although I am the last to speak, I too wish to express my sympathy with the families and, of course, the hope that an inquiry will shed light on where responsibility for this accident lies."
"But we need to look to the future, and I have two, or in fact three proposals to put forward."
"My first proposal calls for the application of the rules on the transport of hazardous goods, the subject of debate on more than one occasion during the life of this parliament, in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"My second proposal is to further encourage the shift of hazardous goods from road to rail - hackneyed words, but this approach has never been adequately implemented - and therefore to provide new incentives for combined transport."
"Switzerland has been mentioned."
"We all agree that we should ask Switzerland for a provisional agreement to try to resolve these problems of the Alpine passes, but we must also bear in mind the characteristics of the Swiss road system, a veritable Gruyère with the 17 kilometre long St Gotthard pass which is three metres narrower than the Mont Blanc tunnel."
"We hope that this solution too will secure adequate safety conditions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first, like previous speakers, and on behalf of the UPE Group, I want to express my sorrow, compassion and solidarity to the families of the victims of the Mont Blanc tragedy."
"I would also like to salute the courage and commitment of the rescue services who had to work in particularly difficult circumstances."
"The accident of 24 March was a cruel reminder of the problem of transport safety."
"The issue is one of the European Union's priorities, and we must welcome that fact."
"But in light of the conclusions of the inquiry the French authorities have initiated, we will have to implement certain specific measures, particularly those measures involving the safety of major transport equipment and transport infrastructures."
"That is why we are asking the Commission to draw up a report based on the committee of inquiry's conclusions, together with proposals aimed, in particular, at harmonising safety equipment."
"This tragedy is another illustration, if one were needed, of the vital need to control the flow of road traffic - especially heavy goods vehicles - promote rail transport and establish operating rules to ensure maximum safety within a properly diversified European transport market."
"Mr President, I too should like to begin by offering my sincere sympathies to the families of the victims of this terrible accident and expressing my admiration and praise for the courage shown by the emergency services afterwards."
"They too lost colleagues in the fire."
"Until we know exactly what happened and what the causes of the accident were, there would appear to be little point in talking about how we can prevent such a disaster from happening again in the future."
"The Commission therefore intends to wait for the results of the investigation and then to consider what measures could be taken at European level to improve safety in tunnels."
"However, I should like to take this opportunity to bring the European Parliament up to date on what the Commission is currently doing to help to limit hazards in tunnels more generally."
"As part of its programme of legislation on EU type-approval for motor vehicles, the Commission has launched extensive legislation on vehicle standards, including minimum requirements for vehicle flammability."
"The directorate-general for transport, DG VII, is also currently cofunding a study with the OECD on the risks of transporting dangerous substances by road through tunnels."
"We had already decided to organise research into tunnel safety under the fifth framework programme of research and development, and we had specifically planned to fund improvements to the Mont Blanc tunnel as part of the trans-European networks."
"The project, totalling EUR 3.7 million, was to improve the accident signalling equipment in the Mont Blanc tunnel and the control room."
"The closure of this important artery will naturally cause a certain amount of disruption and congestion, but the impact will not be the same for car drivers and lorry drivers, since lorry drivers are bound to be more seriously affected."
"Around 700 000 lorries passed through the Mont Blanc tunnel every year, and alternative routes or alternative forms of transport are now going to have to be found."
"The natural alternative to the Mont Blanc tunnel is the Fréjus tunnel to the south."
"Despite new restrictions to increase safety, the Commission expects the Fréjus tunnel to be able to take most of the freight traffic from the Mont Blanc tunnel."
"Lorries can also use the border crossings between France and Italy which are situated further south, while lorries under 28 tonnes have unlimited possibilities for travelling through Switzerland."
"Those are the road alternatives."
"Another alternative would be to use a different form of transport for freight."
"Rail and combined transport must use the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel as an opportunity to show what they are made of."
"Rail transport must now show what it can do with its existing rolling stock and infrastructure."
"At the moment, it is not clear what extra freight capacity the railways can offer on the Alpine routes, but the Commission expects them to take advantage of the commercial opportunities."
"Finally, the Commission acknowledges that lessons must be learnt from this disaster in order to minimise the risks of anything similar happening in future."
"However, we will not be bounced into taking hasty decisions which are supposed to make transport safer."
"As far as the effects of the closure of the Mont Blanc tunnel are concerned, we will do everything it is in our limited power to do to try to ensure that traffic is not too severely disrupted."
"We feel it is too early to start predicting traffic chaos, and we would urge everyone to keep calm and to monitor the situation to see whether road and rail transport cannot solve the problems themselves."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0383/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0395/99 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0397/99 by Mr Barros Moura and Mr Marinho, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0405/99 by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0413/99 by Mr Dupuis and Mrs Maes, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0415/99 by Mrs Hautala, Mr Telkämper and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the situation in Indonesia and East Timor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, just when everyone has finally realised where East Timor is, the largest Islamic country in the world, Indonesia, is falling apart - we only need to think of Ambon, Madura, Aceh and Kalimantan."
"The state of Indonesia is about to become one huge battlefield."
"The forthcoming elections in June/July are of vital importance, and I think that if they are organised properly, they could form the basis for a different sort of federal Indonesia, all being well."
"This is why I think the European Union and, of course, the United Nations must do everything they can to help in the only way they can, to ensure that the elections are indeed democratic. All it will cost is a little money and effort."
"For goodness' sake, do not let this huge country, the 'emerald belt' as we call it in Dutch, become just a patch of rust in the Pacific."
"Mr President, the situation in Indonesia is getting worse from week to week, which is not a good omen for the elections on 7 June."
"Although the problems are concentrated in the Moluccan Archipelago and East Timor, there is also unrest in other regions like Irian Jaya, Kalimantan and North Sumatra."
"The Indonesian Government's approach in recent years of distributing the inhabitants of Java over the whole of Indonesia as a sort of dominant group now appears to be having disastrous effects."
"The Javanese people are not to blame for this, of course, but they have become pawns in a project with a dual agenda: combating poverty among the Javanese and weakening the identity of certain island groups."
"In the midst of all this, there are also the enormous problems in Timor, which are getting worse again and have even led to massacres in Liquiça."
"This is extremely disappointing, because agreements had been reached on improving the situation there."
"We call on the Commission to bring pressure to bear on Indonesia to ensure that the situation does improve, and we would strongly urge the Commission to help to ensure that the elections there run smoothly and that the minority groups on the smaller islands are also treated fairly in those elections."
"Indonesia deserves this."
"As Mr Bertens said, it is a huge and beautiful country, and it would indeed be a shame if it fell apart completely and if human rights and democracy came to be discredited once and for all there."
"Mr President, we are all greatly concerned about the situation in Indonesia and its effects, especially on East Timor."
"As the elections set for 7 June draw nearer, and as we move towards a critical stage in the negotiations on the future of East Timor being held between the governments of Indonesia and Portugal under the aegis of the United Nations, we are seeing attacks on supporters of the Nobel Peace Prize winner D. Ximenes Belo, and on civilians praying in a church. We are witnessing attacks on the entire population, which is experiencing an enormous wave of panic because of a proliferation of military brigades doing nothing to defend them and instead attacking them."
"All this is happening at a time when Xanana Gusmão has still not been given complete freedom, which this House has repeatedly demanded."
"For all these reasons, we urge the European Parliament to approve a resolution drawing the attention of the Indonesian authorities to the need to restore legality, to the need to halt these massacres, to the need for the armed forces to defend rather than attack the public, to the need to free Xanana Gusmão, and to the need for the United Nations to continue to support Portugal's efforts to restore peace in East Timor and throughout Indonesia."
"This is a pivotal area for world stability and I therefore believe that we should vote in favour of a resolution which once again sends a message of support from the European Parliament to the people of East Timor, who have suffered so much from genocide."
"Mr President, apart from Indonesia's complicated geographical structure, it is also struggling with the economic crisis, its debt burden, inflation and falling exports, all at a time when the country is preparing for the elections."
"I would not go so far as to say, like Mr Bertens, that the country is threatening to fall apart, but the risk is there."
"The situation appears to be calm on Java, while on Aceh the government and the army have restored order and, importantly, have punished those responsible."
"Unfortunately, there are still occasional confrontations between the people there."
"The most recent developments on Timor are extremely regrettable, but there is perhaps also some evidence of progress, with attempts now being made to set up a commission involving all of Timor's leaders - even Xanana Gusmão has been invited."
"Of course, the militias on the island must be made to hand over their weapons and the negotiations between Portugal and Indonesia must continue."
"There must also be an investigation into the massacre."
"Forty-eight political parties are now preparing for the elections, and most of them include political tendencies with the following characteristics: Islamic, nationalist, liberal, supporters of central planning, maintainers of the status quo."
"It is an extremely complicated country where simple black-and-white solutions do not work."
"Fortunately, if my information is correct, the electoral commission has adopted an independent position."
"I know that the Commission and the Council have already earmarked a great deal of money to support the elections, but I am amazed that, although Parliament has been calling year in year out for democracy in Indonesia and the opposition groups there are now asking for Parliament to send observers, the Bureau has decided against doing so."
"Mr President, would you urge Parliament and the Bureau to reverse this decision?"
"I think it is incomprehensible, and it undermines the credibility of this debate here in the House."
"I agree with the previous speakers. We too signed up to this resolution because we think that at this particular point, we need to remind people of the importance of negotiation as a way of finding a solution to the problems in East Timor."
"With the increasing bloodshed there, the negotiations are threatening to be swept away by a tide of military and paramilitary violence."
"The Indonesian Government must be urged to end support for the paramilitary organisations, to limit the military presence, to restore the rule of law and to bring those responsible to justice and ensure that they are punished."
"We think that Indonesia is right to be proud of its self-determination, but in view of the diversity of the people living in this archipelago, we should also expect the same respect to be afforded to all those living in and around Indonesia and in particular to East Timor, which Indonesia has always unlawfully occupied."
"I would specifically like to support Mrs van Bladel's request that we should send observers."
"We have often seen violence increase before elections, and we have also seen that the presence of foreign observers can help to calm the situation."
"It is not too late for us to do something about it."
"Mr President, sadly, as previous speakers have said, the events which have taken place on East Timor are no accident."
"There are plenty of other places in Indonesia where fighting has flared up and irregularities have occurred, often or almost always along ethnic or religious divides, unfortunately."
"Last week, I happened to talk to someone who had just come back from Ambon."
"The story he told was sadly all too familiar: systematic human rights violations, terrible murders and large numbers of displaced people."
"And precisely because this is a worldwide phenomenon as we reach the end of the 20th century, with small-scale, interethnic, interreligious conflicts in Europe, Asia and Africa, we need to keep on putting this subject on our agenda here in the European Parliament, however frustrating, however often it may be and however little it may help in the short term."
"Fortunately the European Union can do more, and here I would like to add my voice to those of Mrs van Bladel and Mrs Maes."
"I understood that the EU had made money available to send some 60 observers to the Indonesian elections."
"What I would like to know is what kind of observers they will be and whether the Indonesian Government has already agreed to have them, since it has already shown that it does not think much of observers, wherever they are from."
"If not, what does the European Union plan to do to ensure that these observers, who I would stress are extremely important, are there for the elections in June?"
"Mr President, the Liquiçá massacre is just the latest bloody episode in which the victims are the people of East Timor."
"On 6 and 7 April, 25 civilian victims of the armed militia known as the 'Meraputi' were killed with the active connivance of the mobile brigade of Indonesia's elite police squad."
"We are demanding an international inquiry."
"We are demanding that those responsible for these criminal acts should be held to account."
"We cannot accept that this violence should be used as a pretext for postponing the meetings between Portugal and Indonesia under the aegis of the UN to draw up a text giving this territory autonomous status."
"The UN cannot turn its back, it must have a force on the ground to guarantee peace and to ensure that these discussions take place."
"We denounce the cynicism of the Indonesian regime, which while pledging that it is defending human rights is simultaneously arming the militias which are slaughtering the people."
"We are accordingly sending a message of solidarity to Xanana Gusmão, the man who in 1992 was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. Although he is at present under house arrest, he is being threatened with a return to prison, to total incarceration, simply because he called on the people of East Timor to defend themselves."
"We are accordingly sending a message which expresses our indignation at these events, a message of solidarity with Xanana Gusmão and with the people of East Timor, and we call upon the UN and other international bodies to intervene."
"Mr President, I am glad Parliament is looking at the situation in East Timor, a Portuguese territory which was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and unilaterally annexed by that country in 1979."
"Personally, I agree with the joint resolution on the whole, and I shall vote for it."
"But there is no point in pretending that a resolution from our Parliament, however forceful and well-intentioned, is going to improve the fate of the Timorese."
"This small Catholic people is the target of an actual attempt at genocide by the Indonesian Government."
"Tragically, the massacre of 25 worshippers in a Liquiça church is only a drop in the ocean of blood from the atrocities committed."
"Over 24 years, 200 000 Timorese, or a third of the population, have already been exterminated."
"Jakarta seems to want to wipe this small, courageous Catholic people off the map for resisting being engulfed by an Indonesia of 150 million Muslims."
"Like the Turkish Government in Cyprus, the Indonesian Government is also trying to replace the Catholics with a Muslim population by sending in tens of thousands of colonists."
"Just as in other countries where a government asserts that it is Islamic - Sudan, Turkey, Syrian-occupied Lebanon - Christians are persecuted, marginalised, treated as second-class citizens, or even massacred."
"But the fact is, East Timor holds no interest, beyond good intentions, for the powers that govern us from Washington and Brussels."
"Indonesia can violate the sovereignty of Portugal and the right of peoples to self-determination, and perpetuate a kind of genocide, yet apparently all that arouses is purely verbal indignation."
"Disregarding the principle of sovereignty, and at the risk of starting a third world war, the powers that be prefer to bomb the Serbs, who are trying to save their national and religious identity in their own province of Kosovo, the cradle of their nation."
"This is clearly a question of double standards."
"We are indignant at this so-called new world order imposing the law of the jungle: weak towards the powerful and ruthless towards the weak."
"Mr President, the Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the situation in Indonesia has certainly deteriorated in terms of the interethnic and interreligious conflicts that were mentioned."
"In its statement of 7 April on the subject, the Council added that the Indonesian Government has taken a number of clearly very welcome steps to do with the elections, new laws on the political parties and certain economic measures that have been announced to stabilise the economic situation."
"A number of social programmes have also been set up to deal with the current crisis, and announcements have been made about improving the human rights situation in Indonesia."
"All of this is set out in the Council's statement of 7 April."
"At the same time, the Commission also decided on 31 March that it should make available EUR 7 million for the forthcoming elections in Indonesia."
"Of that sum, EUR 5 million are to be spent through the NGOs on election training and information, and EUR 2 million on sending 60 observers from the Member States for two weeks as part of a broader election observation programme organised by the United Nations."
"The United Nations itself is to send 30 observers for a longer period of two months, and Indonesia has already agreed that they should be present."
"With regard to East Timor, the Commission shares the House's concern at the recent increase in violence and we support the statement of 12 April by the presidency."
"We also support the Member States' initiative to set up a peace and reconciliation committee to help to restore calm on East Timor."
"We feel that the recent series of incidents clearly calls for a United Nations presence in the area, and we would therefore strongly urge that the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations should be given free access to East Timor."
"The Commission welcomes the Indonesian Government's new policy of recognising that direct elections need to be held on Timor in order to determine how far the conditions for independence currently being discussed in New York are acceptable."
"We would point out that the efforts of the United Nations Secretary-General to find a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution must also be given international support."
"The Commission reiterates that, needless to say, it supports the current discussions on East Timor, which we also feel offer the only opportunity of finding a peaceful, just and lasting solution that takes account of the East Timorese people's right to self-determination and the interests of all the parties concerned."
"Thank you, Mr van den Broek."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0375/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0384/99 by Mrs Maij-Weggen, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0389/99 by Mr Pasty and Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0399/99 by Mr Colajanni, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0410/99 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0416/99 by Mr Telkämper and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton Burma;"
"B4-0374/99 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, and Mr Bourlanges and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0390/99 by Mr Pasty and Mrs van Bladel, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0400/99 by Mr Harrison, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0407/99 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left-B4-0422/99 by Mr Telkämper and Mrs McKenna, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton Cambodia;"
"B4-0382/99 by Mr Fassa and Mrs André-Léonard, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party-B4-0394/99 by Mr Pasty, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group-B4-0409/99 by Mr Hory and Mr Castagnède, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance-B4-0420/99 by Mrs Aelvoet and Mr Telkämper, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton Niger;"
"B4-0391/99 by Mrs Banotti and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party-B4-0398/99 by Mrs Malone, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists-B4-0421/99 by Mrs McKenna and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliamenton the murder of Rosemary Nelson."
"Burma"
"Mr President, it is frustrating to see how the authorities in Burma miss every chance they have to show good will."
"Their refusal to grant an entry visa to Michael Aris, the terminally ill husband of Aung San Suu Kyi, showed their lack of respect, and the completely unnecessary suffering that this caused Aung San is typical of the way the government behaves."
"If it carries on like this, there is no prospect of an end to Burma's isolation - on the contrary, it can only get worse."
"Unfortunately, we are once again having to call on the Burmese Government to respect the basic rights of the Burmese people in general, and we are again having to condemn the forced displacement of whole villages and the use of forced labour."
"No crisis gives any government the right to violate the rights of its people, and the Burmese Government must understand that its leaders will be held personally responsible for the suffering that they cause."
"The international community does not forget, and at some point Burma's present leaders are going to have to stand trial for the crimes they are currently committing."
"The application of international criminal law in practice will ensure that everyone's basic rights are protected."
"Mr President, this is the umpteenth time that we have had Burma on our agenda - I think this is the eighth resolution on the subject, and its people are still suffering under the conditions that the military government has imposed on them."
"This time it has hit the headlines by refusing to allow Aung San Suu Kyi's husband, who was seriously ill, to come to Burma."
"It goes without saying that Aung San Suu Kyi herself could not go to England, because she would not then have been allowed to return."
"But it is disgraceful that a couple who have been married for 25 years should be refused the chance to be together at a time when one of them is dying."
"In addition, the Karen villages along the border are once again coming under attack."
"I was in Thailand last year to visit some of the refugee camps, and now I hear that large numbers of people are again coming over the border to these camps, which are already overflowing."
"Some positive steps are also being taken."
"A group of 285 MPs has been formed which hopes to convene the Burmese Parliament itself."
"Would it not be a good idea for the European Union to lend its support, so that the parliament, which is currently dissolved, is able to work through different channels on a constitution that could finally bring about a fundamental change in Burma's situation?"
"It is a situation that we have been forced to sit and watch for years now. It is one of the most badly governed countries in the world."
"The European Union needs to adopt a much harder line than it does at present, and I would urge the Commission to do so."
"Mr President, in recent weeks, the Burmese regime has committed yet another appalling act: the Sakharov laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been denied freedom of movement, was not even able to see her own husband before his death."
"She and the whole of her country have for many years now been deprived of every fundamental freedom, respect for the most basic of human rights and any glimpse of democracy."
"We also know that any opposition is severely repressed and that repression is particularly severe in relation to the ethnic minorities."
"Forced labour and indeed slavery are widespread in the country."
"The problem is that the military clique in power has so far been unmoved by and insensitive to any internal or international pressure."
"I have to say that, if we talk of defence and promotion of human rights as a fundamental element in the European identity and its international image, then Burma today is certainly one of the key litmus tests, and I believe that one of the best ways in which we can extend our sincere condolences to Aung San Suu Kyi is principally by adding to the initiatives we are taking against the Burmese regime, increasing its international isolation at both a political and diplomatic and an economic and commercial level."
"Furthermore, so long as human rights are not guaranteed and the democratic process that the majority of the Burmese people want is not resumed, it will be impossible to have normal or indeed any kind of relations with that country."
"At the same time I believe that, in relation to Burma, we shall have to establish, alongside the measures to isolate it, a political strategy, a strategy to promote change, the kind of change the Burmese people also long for."
"We must therefore move beyond fine words and adopt a specific strategy that is shared and applied by all the countries of the Union."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to hold forth about the regime in Burma - which I think we all agree on - as Mr Bertens, Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Vecchi have just described it."
"The Union has held a very clear position on Burma, with the Commission - especially Commissioner Marín - the Council, rather exceptionally, and obviously our Parliament, all in agreement."
"So I think what we need to discuss is the question raised by Mr Vecchi. Is Burma really isolated?"
"I do not think so, because if it really were isolated, the sanctions we have put in place would have had some effect."
"The truth is that Burma is getting very strong backing. In particular - and I am sorry Commissioner Brittan is not here - Burma is strongly supported by China, on both an economic and a military level, and that is why it is able to continue with the repression and prevent any democratic development."
"So we must do the same for Burma as for North Korea, another country which finds favour with Commissioner Brittan, by putting pressure on China to urge the Burmese and North Korean Governments to bring about change at last."
"Further support for Burma comes from our worldwide prohibitionist approach to drugs."
"We know that Burma is one of the major producers of drugs and it has the resources to be able to do without the support of Western countries because it has money - plenty of money - from the drugs trade."
"Mr President, as in recent motions for resolutions and debates, all we can do again this time is to condemn once again the continued violations of the human rights of various sections of the population in Burma."
"All we can really do is repeat ourselves."
"Regrettably, an already grim situation has been made even worse by the sad news of the death of Dr Michael Aris, the husband of Aung San Suu Kyi. The couple were forced to live apart, because she was unable to visit him and he was not permitted to visit her."
"I believe their private grief is a microcosmic illustration of the repression and cruelty practised by the Burmese regime."
"We must encourage the Commission to use its influence, particularly with Burma's neighbours, to isolate Burma with a view to securing the resignation of the present government and halting the maltreatment of villagers, who are taken away for forced labour or whose entire villages are resettled."
"We must encourage and exhort the Council to discontinue any cooperation with the ASEAN states in which Burma is involved, not to integrate Burma into any cooperative ventures in the region and to prevail upon Germany, as the holder of the Council presidency, not to issue any entry visas."
"We have imposed a ban here, and all the Member States of the Union should enforce it."
"Mr President, the previous speakers have already dealt in sufficient detail with the entirely unacceptable circumstances surrounding the refusal of the Burmese Government to let Dr Michael Aris enter the country before he died, and they have also spoken about China's support for that barbaric regime."
"For this reason, I should like to focus your attention more sharply on the ethnic cleansing that is taking place in Burma."
"The fact that we have adopted a resolution on Kosovo this very day lends special significance to this point, in my opinion."
"In our resolution we are especially critical of conditions in the Karen villages this time."
"But at the same time we must not overlook the fact that this is all part of a larger plan, as Amnesty International, for example, exposed very graphically in London last year."
"We showed how, in the previous two years, some 300 000 members of the Shan people had been forcibly resettled and how the Mon, Akha and Lahu peoples were being driven out into neighbouring countries."
"In the light of this fact, it is only right and proper for us to rethink our policy on visas, as proposed in paragraph 9, and to ban Burma from attending EU-ASEAN and ASEM meetings until genuine improvements are observed in the human rights situation."
"Cambodia"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last summer I myself saw just how deeply traumatised the people of Cambodia still are."
"As King Sihanouk told me, 'mon peuple est toujours très malade '."
"The tragedy continues, 20 years on, because there has been no investigation or trial whatsoever."
"The Cambodian Government could not carry out such an investigation or trial even if it wanted to."
"In August 1998, work was still being done on drawing up a civil code and a penal code, and the American and European experts were still arguing with each other and amongst themselves in an attempt to impose their views on these various forms of law."
"There is a complete absence of any judicial apparatus in Cambodia, and this is why my group wants an international UN tribunal to investigate the genocide and punish those responsible. We want the European Union to help Cambodia to become a constitutional state."
"Mr President, the term 'killing fields' immediately makes you think of Cambodia and the genocide which took place there from 1975 onwards."
"It is sad to see that a quarter of a century later they are only just beginning to try to obtain justice for the victims, and even this is threatening to fail because the present political leaders want to hide their involvement in the genocide."
"I myself would prefer to see the country taking its own responsibility for sorting out its terrible past, but now that it seems that the facts are about to be swept under the carpet, my group feels that an ad hoc tribunal on the genocide in Cambodia would offer a better guarantee of justice for the Cambodians."
"Mr President, the failure to prosecute Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok before an independent international tribunal is extremely worrying but also instructive."
"Worrying, because a domestic trial in Cambodia is unlikely to bring out the full facts of the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge in the years of the killing fields in the late 1970s."
"Worrying too, lest Hun Sen unwarrantedly uses international aid for domestic treason law to move against some of his current political opponents."
"Instructive, however, in clarifying the need for the international community to set up a permanent international criminal tribunal which can deal with the all-too-frequent acts of genocide which besmirch us all."
"But a tribunal which will also act as an inhibition to practitioners of evil, whether they manifest themselves in Indo-China or in former Yugoslavia."
"The rule of law is a paramount strut of a civil society."
"Sadly, in nearby Malaysia the jailing this week of Anwar Ibrahim illustrates how far we still have to go to ensure that the law is used to enshrine and support the concept of human rights."
"Anwar Ibrahim's black eye on arrest is a reproach to the rule of law in Malaysia and to all of us who cherish the primacy of human rights in the conduct of human affairs."
"Anwar Ibrahim should be released immediately if Mahathir's failing Malaysia is to be restored to health and prosperity in the eyes of the watching world community."
"Mr President, I call upon you to issue a note of protest to Dr Mahathir concerning the flawed political trial practised on Anwar Ibrahim, a note of protest in accordance with the many critical resolutions passed by this Parliament concerning Malaysia."
"I hope you are able to do that on behalf of this Parliament."
"Mr President, this Parliament, like all democratic institutions, must send out a signal and a warning to the international community that violations of human rights are unacceptable and that history does not forget them."
"The massacre in Cambodia must not be consigned to history, and its perpetrators must be called to account."
"That is why it is right to set up an international ad hoc tribunal here."
"It is right because Cambodia itself is apparently unable to set up a tribunal, since the Cambodian State does not possess the necessary structures."
"The establishment of a framework of civil law is a challenge to the Commission to show how it can help."
"We have issued that challenge on several occasions, and I believe Europe has a considerable amount of assistance to lend."
"That also applies in the context of our work with all the nations of ASEAN."
"It also applies to Malaysia."
"The previous speaker dealt in some detail with the case of Anwar Ibrahim."
"We cannot tolerate unlawful detention in that case either, and we call on the Commission and the Council to make the appropriate approaches in Malaysia."
"Otherwise we should have to take measures to freeze our diplomatic relations."
"Mr President, it is inconceivable that the most serious crimes against humanity since the Second World War should not be the subject of appropriate criminal sanctions."
"That is why Parliament must make three demands. First, there must be a tribunal, because a culture of political indignation and exploitation can hardly be expected to end just where required by considerations of political opportunism."
"Secondly, the tribunal must be international, not just because at one time, before he rejected the idea, Mr Hun Sen demanded that, but because we cannot allow the Khmer Rouge trial to become entangled in political and legal score-settling in a country where democracy is still being established."
"Thirdly, it is essential that it should not be Ta Mok alone, but all the leaders of the death organisation, Angkar, who are brought to book."
"We cannot allow one scapegoat to pay on behalf of everyone, even if that scapegoat is a butcher."
"Mr President, anyone who has read a book on the recent history of Cambodia or who has had the good fortune, in inverted commas, to travel round the country must find it incredible that there is still no sign whatsoever of an international tribunal to try the perpetrators of the 'killing fields' and the slaughter that Mr Bourlanges rightly called one of the worst crimes since the Second World War."
"Nor is there any sign even of an investigation into it all."
"I am seriously concerned about the impasse that has been reached here."
"The present Cambodian Government must not allow the Khmer Rouge leaders to go unpunished for whatever reasons it may have - patriotism, perhaps."
"I also think that an international Cambodia tribunal might still be able to bring some influence to bear and could send a signal to the government in Burma and other governments in South-East Asia."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the case of Ta Mok confronts us with a legal problem that is both fascinating and tragic."
"We would be deluding ourselves if we were to think that a Cambodian court could give an unprejudiced ruling on the crimes he committed against humanity or, more generally, the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge."
"It is desirable that an ad hoc tribunal should be set up, but there will always be the suspicion that this is a special court that has already predetermined, so to speak, the tenor of its judgment and has not given the accused the guarantees that even a defendant like Ta Mok deserves."
"Consequently, there is only one solution: a permanent international court, a natural court with jurisdiction to try all crimes against humanity, regardless of who commits them, or where and when they are committed."
"Niger"
"Mr President, the resolution on Niger, which all the groups are tabling jointly in this House, has the air - I regret to say - of a kind of routine resolution."
"Here we have yet another coup, yet another failure to observe the principles of the constitutional state, the assumption by a military junta of legislative and executive authority with no popular support, against a background made worse by the recent annulment by the Constitutional Court of the results of administrative elections which should in theory have completed the process of a return to democracy and were, strange to say, won by the opposition."
"The European Union must therefore be resolute in its response."
"In particular, the Commission must suspend development cooperation under the Lomé Convention and simply maintain humanitarian aid and direct assistance by the NGOs to the most vulnerable sections of the population."
"Mr President, on 6 April 1994, the shooting down of President Habyarimana's plane marked the start of the terrible genocide in Rwanda."
"Now yet another president who had come to power through a coup d'état has been assassinated, murdered by his own military bodyguard who then himself seized power."
"The parliament has been dissolved and the army has seized almost total power for itself."
"Naturally, we need to keep a very close eye on this situation, which was why I mentioned the events of five years ago in Rwanda."
"Yet again a country which already had enormous problems has been thrown into turmoil."
"In these circumstances, it would be irresponsible to enter into any form of cooperation with those in power."
"If we want to provide humanitarian aid, we must send it through reliable NGOs and hope that our intentions are carried out."
"Mr President, what a terrible shame that, once again, conflict in an African country has been resolved in the worst possible way."
"Niger is now in a very tense situation in the wake of the coup d'état and the murder of its President on 9 April."
"The results of the recently held local and regional elections have been declared invalid and, following the dissolution of the National Assembly, the military have taken over legislative and executive authority."
"Let us trust that this is not the end of the process of evolution towards more democracy."
"Some hope still remains, since the opposition has stated that it will allow the military nine months to hand back power to a civilian government."
"All we as Members of the European Parliament can do is to call upon the Commission to cease cooperation under the Lomé Convention and to implore Niger's self-appointed leadership to abide by the constitution, return power to a civilian government, and respect human rights and civil liberties."
"That is the one and only road to freedom and stability in the country."
"Mr President, the coup d'état in Niger and the assassination of President Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara has plunged another African state into the abyss of a military coup and blocked an albeit partial process of institutional reconstruction."
"Admittedly, the system of countries such as Niger is barely compatible with the fragile processes of democratisation, and this has been demonstrated in recent months with the annulment of the regional, provincial and local elections in which the opposition held the day."
"The military cliques which have perpetrated the coup and are wielding power arbitrarily must be stopped."
"What now has to be done is to restore the institutions and set in train a genuine process to bring democracy to the country and, to that end, we too agree that official cooperation under the Lomé Convention must be blocked until the process of establishing democracy has been resumed."
"But this situation also shows that there has to be a qualitative improvement in the policy adopted towards the African countries, so that the promotion of human rights, democratisation and conflict prevention - the only conditions that will ensure development - become essential elements of cooperation."
"Mr President, I think all of us are entirely in agreement in our analysis of the events which have just taken place in Niger and the need to restore the rule of law and a functioning democracy to that country as quickly as possible, after the coup d'état and the assassination of President Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara."
"Having said that, Mr President, I have to announce that my group will not be voting for the four amendments to this resolution, not because we do not share their concerns or agree with the content, but because we think another time should be found to express in a general manner Parliament's feelings on the issues raised."
"We want to see today's resolution concentrate exclusively on the problem of Niger."
"That is important. These are very recent events and we want to respond to them by dealing only with this one issue in the resolution."
"So I repeat, we will not be voting for the amendments."
"Murder of Rosemary Nelson"
"Mr President, one of the saddest things I have seen in recent times was Rosemary Nelson's children following the hearse to the graveyard last month after this human-rights lawyer was brutally murdered in Northern Ireland."
"I want to echo the concerns of many people in Ireland and the international community about the circumstances surrounding this murder."
"The UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Commission of Jurists and, last night, US Congressmen have all expressed their worries over the case."
"If we in the European Union are to be taken seriously in promoting high standards of human rights in the world, we must make sure that our own house is in order."
"We have to ensure that lawyers, who are an essential part of any effective and credible system of justice, are allowed to conduct their professional duties without any hindrances or fear of intimidation or worse."
"The murder of Rosemary Nelson, and the earlier killing of Patrick Finucane, provide clear evidence that this minimum requirement for justice is not guaranteed in Northern Ireland."
"I would draw your attention in particular to recitals D and F of the resolution - which time does not allow me to read out - and I would ask you to read them carefully."
"In these circumstances I think an investigation by the RUC would lack credibility."
"Indeed, the RUC has more or less admitted so much by asking British and American police officials to supervise the investigation."
"It would be better all round if the investigations were to be conducted in a completely independent manner so that it could be seen to be objective and impartial by all sections of the community."
"I would ask Members to support the resolution and our call for a full, independent, international judicial inquiry into all the circumstances surrounding this case."
"Mr President, the murder of Rosemary Nelson sent a shiver through the whole of Ireland."
"The only merciful thing was that neither her husband nor her children were in the car when it blew up savagely within sight and sound of her own home and the school where her little daughter was playing in the playground."
"Regrettably, in many parts of the world, but also in Northern Ireland, the lawyers and judges have found themselves in the front line where the trouble is most intense and the murder of Rosemary Nelson brings home to us once again the danger that many of these professionals put themselves into when defending one of their clients' most basic human rights."
"The call for an independent inquiry circles around the fact that there is considerable belief that an inquiry by the RUC into the death of Mrs Nelson will not be as rigorous as it should be because of the evidence that suggested that she feared very much for her life and for quite a long time believed that her life was in serious danger."
"Tragically, she was proved right."
"I hope that colleagues will support this resolution and vote with us on it."
"Mr Chairman, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group, and in particular of my two Irish party colleagues, I wish to express our twofold sense of shock."
"First of all we are shocked by the cold-blooded murder of a woman who was personally and professionally devoted to the defence of human rights, and secondly we are shocked by the fact that particular elements, not in a distant part of the world but in the heart of a country of the European Union, are using terrorist violence to undermine an emergent peace process."
"But our task here is not only to express our shock but also to state our unequivocal demands."
"Firstly, we demand an enquiry by the prosecuting authorities into the background to this murder."
"In addition, like those who have spoken before me, I call for an international enquiry by the competent staff of the High Commissioner for Human Rights."
"Mr President, like many colleagues who have already spoken, I utterly condemn the murder of Rosemary Nelson."
"Like many Members of this House I also witnessed the scenes of the wreckage of her car and of her family at the funeral."
"I can assure you that we utterly condemn the acts of violence that brought about those scenes and no effort will be spared in bringing the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice."
"However, I believe there is an effective and credible investigation taking place."
"Mr Port who is in charge of the investigation has been given a total and unlimited remit and the freedom to add resources or change resources as he so desires."
"Mr Port has worked with the UN in Yugoslavia and in Rwanda as an investigation coordinator and Director of Investigations in the UN Tribunal for Rwanda."
"If he so desires he may use independent investigators."
"The FBI Legal Attaché has said that in their professional judgment the best chance of detecting those responsible lies in RUC involvement in the investigation because of its knowledge on the ground and local intelligence."
"Without the involvement of the RUC any investigation would be severely hampered."
"It is necessary for us to cooperate in order to identify and prosecute those responsible for this crime."
"As the ongoing investigation into Mrs Nelson is still under way it would be unhelpful to prejudice that investigation by calling at this stage for any new inquiry."
"I hope colleagues in Parliament today will appreciate the delicate and sensitive nature of this investigation and the fact that the ongoing peace process must not be jeopardised."
"Let the investigation finish its work before looking to additional or further inquiries which at this stage can only complicate matters."
"The signal that has to go out from this Chamber, however, is that no matter what political colour you are you cannot get away with these acts of violence."
"Mr President, the murder of Rosemary Nelson was a brutal and cowardly deed."
"It was an attack on the justice system, it was an attack on democracy and it was a deliberate attempt to undermine the Good Friday Agreement."
"It is regrettable, but it must be said that there are legitimate concerns about the role of the security forces."
"Those that enforce the rule of law must always operate within the law."
"But let me say this: this resolution should not be misconstrued as a blanket condemnation of the RUC."
"The people of Northern Ireland have a lot to thank the RUC for."
"They have given their lives to buy time for politicians to solve the political problems of Northern Ireland."
"They have been at the coalface of terrorism from both Loyalist and Republican thugs."
"The overwhelming majority of its members are fine men trying to impartially enforce the rule of law."
"When we condemn this particular action we should remember that there are Loyalist and Republican thugs who are deliberately attempting to undermine an agreement which was overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Ireland, both north and south, and we will not let them do that."
"Mr President, before we come to the end of the debate on human rights, allow me to express my delight at the decision taken by the British Home Secretary to go ahead with the extradition proceedings against General Pinochet, in line with the wishes of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the Commission is entirely in agreement with the House on the continuing serious human rights violations in Burma, which are to be on the agenda for the forthcoming General Affairs Council on 26 April."
"A decision will probably be taken to extend the existing measures against Burma, including visa restrictions, for a further six months."
"As you know, the initial decision on this was taken a year ago; it was extended six months ago and is now to be extended again, for the simple reason that the situation has not improved."
"Secondly, discussions are currently taking place in the United Nations Human Rights Commission on drawing up a new resolution against Burma."
"Thirdly, I would point out that, in addition to the fact that the Council regularly devotes attention to the Burma problem, the EU-ASEAN conference in Berlin which was scheduled for a month or six weeks ago had to be cancelled, because agreement could not be reached on whether Burma should participate and because ASEAN rejected the special arrangement proposed by the Council in order to be able to discuss the human rights issue with the Burmese."
"We will have to see how we can continue to demonstrate our rejection of the human rights situation in Burma and help to bring about improvements there, without allowing the situation to blight our entire relationship with ASEAN."
"Moving on briefly to Cambodia, the EU troika has made diplomatic approaches to the prime minister, who has said that he personally accepts the basic principle that the Khmer Rouge leaders must take genuine responsibility for the crimes they committed."
"The Commission therefore welcomed the recent statement by Prime Minister Hun Sen in which he agreed to allow foreign judges and prosecutors to play a central role in the trial of the imprisoned Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok in Cambodia in order to guarantee that the trial meets international standards."
"With regard to Niger, it goes without saying that we strongly condemn the recent coup d'état there, and the Commission is pressing the military authorities to restore the rule of law as quickly as possible."
"The Commission is currently considering what measures to take following recent events, as the House suggested, and one possibility is that we will propose to the Council that development cooperation should be partially suspended in accordance with Article 366a of the Lomé Convention, with which you are familiar."
"At this early stage, the Commission still intends to suspend all new projects and programmes that are currently in preparation, together with existing projects, until the country is returned to lawful rule."
"Humanitarian aid and measures to help the poorest sections of the population are naturally not included here."
"Finally, like this House, the Commission was horrified to learn of the cowardly murder of Rosemary Nelson."
"On behalf of the Commission, I should like to take this opportunity to express our deepest sympathies to her family."
"We feel that the most important thing we can do is to honour her memory, to continue to support the peace process and to refuse to allow terrorism to gain the upper hand in Northern Ireland."
"We also hope that those guilty of this cowardly murder will be tracked down and brought to justice."
"Mr President, it is good to see Indonesia and East Timor on the agenda."
"But I wonder whether the Commission could prevail upon the British Government not to supply arms to the Indonesian Government, or arms-related materials."
"The joint debate is closed."
"I am sure the Commissioner will have taken note of the question raised by Mr Morris."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"VOTES (continuation)"
"The impressive number of transit operations taking place annually in the European Union and the size of the sums involved are in themselves sufficient to demonstrate the urgency of computerising the Community transit procedure and at the same time ensuring maximum transparency throughout the European customs policy."
"But this important issue is not just about the proper functioning of the internal market or the distribution of resources between the Member States and the Community. We are concerned with combating international fraud and organised crime as effectively as possible."
"From this point of view, the four-year delay in finalising computerisation is very worrying, because it comes on top of other delays, which can be ascribed fundamentally to the intergovernmental nature of the third pillar."
"Once again we are forced to recognise that Parliament's ambitious aim has met with opposition from the Member States, some of which insist on rejecting the logical consequences of the advent of the single market."
"Nonetheless, everyone would gain from optimising the Commission's action, which would allow us to rationalise the instruments and resources involved."
"From this point of view, I firmly support their incorporation into a single decision-making centre and a single budget line."
"Similarly, as the rapporteur says, it is imperative for the computerisation of Community transit to come into full operation by 2003."
"So on that basis, I shall vote for the proposal for a decision as amended."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against the Thyssen report, because it is detrimental in many respects to certain business sectors and of course to people starting up in business."
"Examples of these disadvantages are that an agreement with a brewery could no longer consist of the brewery financing the establishment of a restaurant or public house, subject to the proprietor signing a ten-year supply contract."
"This, I believe, is a blow to people starting up in the licensed trade and to the trade itself, because these supply arrangements have been standard practice and have served as a stepping-stone to success."
"The same applies to the oil industry, which builds service stations and at the same time concludes supply agreements with the service station operators for ten years or more."
"On the basis of this report, all such arrangements will become more difficult or impossible in future."
"That is why I voted against it."
"I believe it is inconsistent with our aim of promoting business start-ups and the creation of jobs."
"We voted against this report, since we believe the Commission's standpoint to be correct."
"Mr Herman's report on improvements in the functioning of the institutions without modification of the Treaties complements another report we passed last year on practical action to reduce the democratic deficit in running economic and monetary union."
"In reality, as a little hindsight makes clear, that was just empty posturing to get people to accept a monetary system with very little democracy to recommend it."
"This second part, which the European Parliament has just voted on today, is essentially about reforming the Commission."
"The timing is doubly bad."
"It is bad first of all because, as stated in the explanatory statement, it concentrates on the aim of reinforcing the independence of the Commission, when recent experience, with the resignation of that institution for maladministration, suggests that, on the contrary, its independence should be reduced and the controls over it strengthened."
"The timing of the report is also bad because, by definition, it is only proposing reforms that can be implemented without modifying the Treaty, whereas Chancellor Schröder explained to us yesterday that there can be no remedy for the crisis unless the Treaty is modified."
"That is certainly our opinion and we were happy to hear that the new intergovernmental conference, to be launched at the Cologne Council in June, will have that mission included in its mandate."
"There will clearly be different views about the necessary reforms."
"The view of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is that the first thing to do is to stop thinking of the Commission as a superior body, as the guardian of the European public interest."
"It must become merely the executive arm of the Council."
"We must also stop manufacturing a European civil service cut off from the nations and virtually endogamous, both literally and figuratively."
"It should be much more open to national civil services and should be based on exchanges of personnel with the Member States."
"That kind of permanent interaction will be very fruitful in bringing Europe closer to the people."
"We must stop thinking that the European public interest is something imposed on the nations from on high."
"On the contrary, it is the result of the free expression of their needs and open dialogue between their representatives."
"After a report by the same rapporteur on the policies of the European Union in May 1998, we adopted a resolution on improving the functioning of the European institutions."
"In a way, this text represents the balance not dealt with earlier, either in the first report or in the reports by Mr Brok, Mrs Lööw and Mr Bourlanges."
"As regards the European Parliament, I support the rapporteur in asking for our work to concentrate on the essential tasks, for greater professionalism on the part of Members and for improved information to the public."
"We should pay particular attention to this last point."
"Improving the way we welcome visitors, who will be coming in increasing numbers, and improving access to documents are two measures that speak for themselves."
"I especially like the idea of an open centre, easily accessible and without security controls, where those interested would find documents, audio-visual materials, CD-ROMS, and so on. Perhaps an extension of the Bureau pour la Belgique could be envisaged."
"I also hope a formula can be found whereby the people of the Quartier Léopold , who are fighting to prevent their environment becoming a bureaucratic desert, can have a special relationship with Parliament and feel at home."
"It will be a big step forward when the area between Parliament and the station, the famous 'dalle ', is finally landscaped in a more welcoming and friendly way."
"That means releasing the necessary resources, which will require closer cooperation between the Espace Léopold society, Parliament - in its moral role - and the relevant Belgian authorities."
"A few years ago, I told a journalist that I was astonished not to see more of his colleagues covering Parliament's important work."
"He replied that they go where the power is - the Council first and foremost."
"Fortunately, the Treaty of Amsterdam, which enters into force on 1 May, will increase our power a little, notably as regards the investiture of the Commission."
"I hope that we will become more visible. But it is up to us to become more transparent."
"The importance of this debate needs no emphasis."
"Despite some progress, the Treaty of Amsterdam has basically failed to come up to the expectations of all those who hoped that the European Union was something other than a huge market."
"The rapporteur is right to emphasise, in line with the Commission, that another intergovernmental conference is necessary and urgent to provide acceptable solutions to the various institutional problems which have existed for a fair number of years now."
"But we cannot stand idly by, waiting for another IGC to start."
"Events remind us every day of the political holes in the construction of Europe and the Union's inability to tackle alone most of the great challenges it faces."
"So, as of now, we must make maximum use of the opportunities provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam to deepen European integration and reform the Union's institutions."
"In the present context, I want to stress that, whichever way you look at it, the workforce has hardly expanded in terms of a European civil service - I am referring in particular to the Commission - and has not followed the exponential curve of the tasks that have been entrusted to it since the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"Here, it is worth thinking about the role of the Council and its pursuit of objectives that are sometimes contradictory."
"At the same time, there are grounds for concern about the possible harmful consequences of widespread use by the Commission of temporary staff seconded from national civil services or from industry."
"I am in no way casting doubt on the competence of these temporary workers, or suggesting that they may not be good Europeans. And I can appreciate the desire for flexibility and acquiring new methods and skills."
"But, like our rapporteur, I am afraid that there might be conflicts of loyalty between the vital independence of the Commission and national and sectoral interests which may lead to ambiguity in terms of a worker's status."
"The Commission has resigned, a new treaty is about to come into force and there will be European elections in due course - things are happening in Europe."
"It is time for a clear-out."
"Too much has been allowed to go on for too long."
"This applies to the blurring of the lines of responsibility within the Commission, an out-of-date staff policy and a European Parliament which was not taken seriously because it was lacking in real power."
"At present, the public's confidence in the EU is at a low ebb."
"That is logical in the wake of recent events."
"The debate which we are about to have should, in my view, be used constructively to improve the cooperation between the institutions."
"And there is a great deal that can be improved."
"We shall insist on the staff policy being one of the key priorities in the clear-out."
"But I must emphasise that interest also needs to be shown by the Council in order to carry this through."
"If we can get the cooperation between our institutions to function properly, then the public will also gain greater confidence in us."
"The Amsterdam Treaty gives the European Parliament the opportunity to acquire greater supervisory powers than it has had in the past."
"This will find expression in relation to the environment, amongst other areas."
"But not within agriculture."
"This is unfortunate, because what is it that makes it unnecessary to monitor agriculture, especially when one considers that more than 40 % of the budget is spent on it?"
"We must insist that the European Parliament's stance on agricultural matters is taken more seriously."
"If control is not exercised by Parliament, then there is no control."
"The events of last month have set an extremely important process in motion, which will reinforce the cooperation between the institutions."
"Through the Amsterdam Treaty, the European Parliament is acquiring even more influence."
"We must now also be even better at using that influence."
"Since the BSE follow-up committee was stood down, deaths from CJD have continued to accelerate alarmingly, with ten recorded in the last quarter of 1998. Deaths are still being recorded in the United Kingdom and, with an incubation period of 5 to 30 years, many cases of new variant CJD caused by BSE have still to emerge."
"The European Parliament and the Commission still differ strongly on certain points, including financial compensation and counselling for the victims and their families."
"To this day, the disciplinary measures called for by the follow-up committee, that is, the administrative measures against the British Government for non-appearance, have remained without effect."
"I am also very concerned about the significant increase in cases of BSE in Belgium, Portugal and the United Kingdom."
"Finally, the financial assistance to victims of CJD is, in my view, utterly inadequate, not to mention insulting."
"Mr President, I was basically happy to accept everything in the report, along with the amendments."
"However, I should like to comment on one point which goes somewhat beyond the Hungarian question."
"When we talk to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, we are all too inclined to assume a schoolmasterly pose and lecture them about things that we should do better to put right in our own backyard."
"It is exceedingly hypocritical of us to reproach them continually about corruption, for example, when our own Community is notoriously plagued by recurrent widespread corruption on a grand scale."
"These countries undoubtedly have serious problems, since they have emerged, after all, from foreign occupation and dictatorship, which has invariably led to a certain breakdown of a nation's moral fibre; under these circumstances, I believe it is absolutely hypocritical of us to wag our finger at them."
"All I wished to say was that I have voted in favour, because I am keen to see these countries' early accession to the Union."
"The point I have made is for future reference, so to speak."
"Mr President, I gladly voted for Mr Carnero González's report."
"One reason is that he himself has adopted a very sound approach, focusing very sharply on the rule of law, the legal system and minority questions."
"But I am also very pleased about the adoption of Amendment No 8 - the Nassauer and Poettering amendment - in which the European Parliament calls unequivocally for the repeal of the so-called Benes Decrees."
"I have no doubt that we want to forge ahead with enlargement."
"But if we wish to extend our legal community, we must insist emphatically on the preservation of its character as a community in which the rule of law prevails."
"When unlawful decrees are brought into such a community, it is like introducing a virus into a computer system."
"It endangers the whole system."
"That is why unlawful decrees must be repealed prior to accession."
"We have taken a major step in that direction today."
"We have today voted in favour of the Hoff report on Poland, since we wish to express our full support for enlargement."
"However, we find it hard to welcome the rapid 'progress' which has been made in transposing Community law, and in particular we feel that the lack of flexibility that has been shown by the EU is beneath contempt."
"Furthermore, the report welcomes the government's planned information campaign about EU membership, and the hope is expressed that it will be possible to communicate a pro-European attitude to the public."
"It is also evident from the report that not all Poles are enthusiastic about the EU - witness the demonstrations by farmers."
"We would like to urge the government to make balanced information about both the advantages and the disadvantages of membership freely available to all Polish citizens, and we likewise hope that it will keep its promise to hold a referendum on the country's membership of the EU."
"I share the rapporteur's satisfaction with Mr Söderman's work over the past year and the outstanding clarity and conciseness of his report."
"I think the Ombudsman has recognised the importance of his role in a European Union that hopes to move closer to the people."
"How can European citizenship be envisaged if the Community institutions can act in a discretionary or even arbitrary way towards the people they administer and not be held to account?"
"That unacceptable situation only ended in 1995 with the appointment of the European Ombudsman."
"At last the complaints from European citizens about maladministration by the Community institutions would be heard."
"At last there would be a minimum of dialogue and transparency in the functioning of what is often regarded as the 'Brussels bureaucracy'."
"Successive annual reports, and especially the 1998 report, have illustrated the progress made. First, there has been progress as regards the amount of cases dealt with."
"The number of complaints is up by 200 on the previous year."
"This means that people are becoming more aware of the Ombudsman and no longer hesitate to express their concerns and indeed their anger."
"They want to make themselves heard and have their rights respected."
"And we must welcome that."
"But honesty and realism force me to put a damper on this."
"There are 370 million people in Europe and there were only 1 372 complaints in 1998."
"We therefore need an information campaign."
"There is no lack of new forms of communication. On similar lines, I support the Ombudsman's suggestion that all remedies open to individuals should be clearly mentioned in the EC Treaty, including the right to complain to their national ombudsmen."
"And here the excellent cooperation developed between the latter and the European Ombudsman should be highlighted."
"Cooperation is also a watchword of the relations between the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions and the European Ombudsman."
"Their networking will definitely result in effectiveness. And this will all benefit the people of Europe."
"While the balance sheet is largely positive, improvements still need to be made, in particular as regards the status of the Ombudsman in terms of his investigative role."
"It really is vital for him to have access to all the relevant documents he needs, which is not the case today."
"The adoption of a code of good administrative behaviour for the European institutions would also provide a guarantee for the public, who would be able to consult it freely."
"More generally, what emerges from the European Ombudsman's report is that the confidence of Europeans depends on transparency, dialogue and clear legal rules allowing them to defend their rights."
"These are the necessary conditions for developing a sense of belonging to a project which often seems remote."
"Our rapporteur, Mrs Barbara Schmidbauer, has not shrunk from her task in this pre-election period, when criticising road transport and its cost does not appeal to all voters."
"I congratulate her on that, just as I congratulate her on having established that the measures suggested by the Commission should not make transport more expensive, but should permit more effective use of infrastructures and greater respect for the environment."
"But I want to add 'safer use' to that 'effective use', thinking of the current increase in the number of road and rail tunnels and the serious accidents that have occurred in the last few years."
"The accident in the Channel Tunnel - where there is a modern alarm system - could have caused heavy loss of life."
"It was pure chance that the burning carriage stopped near an access door to the second tunnel, so the people were able to escape."
"The Mont Blanc accident has cost the lives of forty people and nobody knows when the tunnel will be open to traffic again."
"We must take on board all the conclusions of the inquiries in progress and take the necessary decisions."
"But I feel that one principle should be adopted right away, covering all safety aspects in tunnels."
"The service responsible for safety must be genuinely independent of the company operating the tunnel and the company must apply all the recommendations made by the safety service."
"This principle will have financial implications, but safety, in other words, the lives of those who use the tunnels, naturally comes at a price."
"In the final analysis, perhaps the authority to control safety should be exclusively a matter for the government."
"I have one final comment. Of the 35 million tonnes of goods that travel between Italy and France each year, 10 million tonnes are carried by rail."
"The Chamonix valley is a notorious HGV corridor with traffic growing exponentially, along with the nuisance and the risks this entails."
"That is the measure of the absurdity of an 'all by road' policy based on profit at any price."
"I have therefore paid tribute to the courage of the rapporteur who, despite the infrastructure costs, firmly stresses the advantages of the rail alternative in terms of safety and the environment."
"We support the principle of creating fair competition between different modes of transport."
"The main point is of course to ensure that lorries and passenger cars pay all the costs involved, including environmental ones. Air transport also needs to be taxed more heavily."
"This is necessary if we are to encourage the use of environmentally friendly modes of transport; currently, these are at a disadvantage."
"We are, however, opposed to a number of the proposals in both the Commission's White Paper and the report."
"Of prime concern to us are the proposals on a uniform system of charging for the whole of the EU."
"Bearing in mind the subsidiarity principle, we feel strongly and unequivocally that the EU should not go beyond setting minimum charges; it is up to the Member State concerned to manage its own rates."
"The Union should on no account be granted the right to levy taxes."
"We firmly reject any kind of detailed regulation by the EU."
"Mrs Schmidbauer has invested a great deal of work in her report."
"Indeed, it is even fair to say that, as far as the Commission White Paper is concerned, it is a good report."
"And, to be perfectly honest, even I have to recognise that the White Paper provides some interesting food for thought."
"I too am all for fair competition between individual modes of transport and for fair and efficient pricing of transport services."
"I too am in favour of shifting more transport operations from the roads to the railways and waterways, but I am opposed to making cars, lorries and buses the sole scapegoats for every possible problem and even for some impossible ones."
"And that is the thrust of the White Paper and, I am sorry to say, of the parliamentary report as well."
"When we speak of fair competition, we cannot ignore the fact that railway wages are higher and jobs are virtually guaranteed for life - conditions that will probably never obtain in the private sector."
"Given the present craze for liberalisation, are there plans to change this and, if so, in what way?"
"The White Paper is talking facts when it says that external costs throughout the EU are assessed by the Commission at an annual figure of EUR 250 billion."
"There is talk of marginal social cost, although we never quite discover precisely what is meant by that, of taxes on diesel and of uniform charging systems being introduced throughout Europe with the aid of electronic data transfer."
"However, the rapporteur goes too far when she calls for the inclusion of private non-commercial vehicles in the charging system as a means of distributing the costs among all users of the road network."
"Is this designed to ensure that in future only the rich will be able to drive cars and that the bulk of the population will stay at home?"
"To the rapporteur's credit, however, she insists that the proposed measures must not result in more expensive transport and that, if price rises are inevitable, the burden on road users should be reduced in some other way."
"In this context, it would have been interesting to learn from the Commission how much each Member State collects in road tax and in excise duty on petrol, diesel and so on, and how much of that is systematically ploughed back into the construction and maintenance of the road network."
"Even if every possible and impossible means is already being used to master the perennially increasing volume of traffic, care must be taken to avoid burdening users and operators of rail, road, air and water transport with a procession of new taxes, and that is the bottom line."
"We would do well to remember how great the outcry was in Germany when there was talk of increasing the price of a litre of petrol to the equivalent of 100 Belgian francs."
"I have the impression that the policy set out in the White Paper is designed to achieve that same objective by a different route."
"Europe needs a good transport system and so does the business world, and at the end of the day, someone will always have to pay."
"And that someone just happens to be the citizen."
"I also note that the Commission is acting as though it were unaware that a great deal of environmental innovation has taken place in the field of transport."
"European transport companies, whether they operate trains, road vehicles, aircraft or ships, are the most modern in the world."
"To keep burdening them with new taxes would drive them to the brink of unprofitability."
"At one of the hearings on the White Paper, I could scarcely believe my ears when one of the invited experts said we should have to think about taxing aviation fuel at four ecus per litre for the sake of the environment: Concorde prices as the everyday norm, but who is supposed to pay them?"
"I shall be voting against Mrs Schmidbauer's report."
"That concludes voting time."
"The Daphne programme (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the debate on the report (A4-0188/99) by Mrs Bennasar Tous on the Daphne programme."
"Madam President, I should like to congratulate, in her absence, the rapporteur, Mrs Bennasar Tous, on her report."
"I wish to extend those congratulations to all the members of the Committee on Women's Rights and all Members who have contributed to the formulation of the programme and the plan of action to combat violence against women and children."
"I warmly thank the two Commissioners, Mrs Gradin and Mr Flynn, for their support and persistence."
"Now we have a legal base for the programme, a budget and a plan for a European awareness campaign against violence against women."
"After all the struggles, delays and financial and legal barriers placed in our way by those who did not see the significance of this issue, we are now on a fairly firm footing and I hope we can begin to address this very serious issue."
"The new legal base, which was not really what we wanted, relies on the European Union's competence on health and it must not restrict the scope of the Daphne programme."
"Violence against women and children occurs in many different public and private situations and has many causes and effects."
"Trafficking, domestic violence, sexual abuse and mutilation, rape, sexual harassment at work: all are forms of gender-based violence."
"The Daphne programme is designed to give added value to the work of NGOs dealing with prevention, supporting the victims, reintegrating the survivors and dealing with the perpetrators."
"All these fields of work will benefit from better research and dissemination, which the Daphne programme can fund."
"Part of the Daphne report contains information about the European campaign to raise awareness of the issue of violence against women, and this was launched in Cologne under the German presidency last month."
"That conference attracted a large number of non-governmental organisations and stimulated a great deal of creative thinking."
"Mrs Bennasar's amendments, which were supported by the Committee on Women's Rights, give more weight to the involvement of NGOs in the execution of the Daphne programme."
"The Commission should welcome this, and I look forward to hearing its response to those proposals."
"The Commission should also welcome the great involvement of Members of this Parliament, which she proposes."
"I have examined very closely the current guidelines for the applicants for Daphne funding."
"I can see a real need for improvement: they are complex and confusing."
"The NGOs and MEPs could, indeed would, suggest a far clearer approach - a more user-friendly set of guidelines - which would therefore be far more relevant and effective in meeting the objectives."
"This is a small programme and a small campaign in budgetary terms."
"However, the violence it aims to combat is a major problem in Europe and beyond."
"Our research has already indicated that one woman in four experiences violence during her lifetime and 90 % of the perpetrators are men."
"At least 50 % of these acts of violence are carried out by the victim's husband or partner."
"There is a real need to challenge this culture and to make violence against women unacceptable."
"Such violence cannot be seen as an act of love: it is an act of dominance and intimidation."
"We are working towards equality between men and women and respect for human rights, both within Europe and beyond it."
"The level of violence the research has already illustrated demonstrates that we still have a very long way to go."
"We believe that the Daphne programme is very badly needed and trust that it will shortly be provided with more resources and a more open and democratic system for decision-making."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Daphne programme, which is designed to combat violence against children, young people and women, addresses an urgent problem, and it therefore deserves all our support and the proper scope for action."
"It is difficult to understand why some Member States want to limit the scope of the programme, making it hard to take proper account of its multi-dimensional nature."
"Violence in all its forms, but especially violence against children, is a gross infringement of human rights, and not just a matter of public health."
"The aim of the programme must therefore remain the prevention of all kinds of violence and the protection of the victims of violence, which includes cases of sexual abuse and abandonment."
"Of course, the most important thing would be to get to a position where we can to take preventive action and work as effectively as possible."
"We need training, education and advice facilities, as well as broad networks of support to cope with risk situations."
"Advertising campaigns, information exchange programmes, and, obviously, research into violence will be important tools in reducing the incidence of violence."
"We must have derived benefit from the Daphne initiative, as a new year five-year programme is being put together which will promote cooperation among voluntary organisations and the local authorities."
"The organisations need support to set up various networks, to improve the dissemination of information, to forge partnerships, and to promote reciprocal information exchange."
"I would especially like to stress the importance of the Daphne programme for defending the rights of children and protecting them from sexual exploitation in particular."
"For this we need the simultaneous efforts of parents, teachers and the whole immediate community to work towards preventive child protection."
"I believe it is also very important to extend this programme gradually to other countries, especially the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as violence in its various forms has a transnational dimension, for example in the sex trade and child pornography on the Internet."
"Cooperation to safeguard fundamental human rights, and thus also the rights of children, is vital, and has to work effectively between the applicant countries and the current Member States."
"The law in these applicant countries also has to ensure that basic rights are safeguarded in a way that is clear to all and which makes it possible to deal effectively with infringements of human rights in the form of violence."
"Otherwise, I would hope that issues of children's rights will be one of the priorities on the EU agenda, as only then will we be able to protect our future and status as a community of civilised states."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate Mrs Bennasar Tous, albeit in her absence, and I would also like to congratulate Mrs Colombo Svevo who so capably presented the issue here this morning."
"Chiefly, however, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this extremely important contribution to the Commission proposal on the Daphne programme, and on the way she has handled such an important issue."
"As has already been said, we have discussed it at some length in the Committee on Women's Rights and there has been general agreement on its proposals."
"The rapporteur welcomes the proposal put forward by the Commission, but she has tabled major amendments, with which - and I would like to stress this - my group concurs."
"In particular, we agree with the reservations she has expressed on the change of the legal base of the action programme."
"The use of Article 235 of the Treaty instead of Article 129 may lead to the exclusion from the Daphne programme of all issues relating to violence, sexual exploitation and the trade in women and children, on the grounds that these issues do not have a bearing on public health."
"We are glad that there is some form of legal base but we have some problems with this particular legal base."
"We also agree with the rapporteur asking the Commission to place the plans that are adopted into some order of priority, with a view to using the available resources in the most effective way possible."
"Here we are talking about plans of prevention, programmes for the rehabilitation of children, young people and women who are in danger, and provisions relating to the perpetrators of these criminal acts, especially the young."
"Attention must also be focused on legitimate practices and on the means of protecting the interests of children, young people and women who have fallen victim to violence."
"We support the request for the presence, on the advisory committee, of a representative of the European Parliament and a representative of the NGOs. We also support the request for the submission of an annual rather than a triennial report on the progress that has been made."
"We also agree that we must call on the applicant countries to take part in the programme, and that there must be better dissemination of information, especially to the media and to the public at whom the programme is directed."
"Finally, I would like to stress that we too are asking for a new report to be submitted to take into account the above amendments, and also that all forms of violence and sexual exploitation perpetrated against women and children continue to be covered, including trafficking in slaves."
"Madam President, I am delighted that there is going to be this Daphne programme and I hope that we will be able to put it to good use, because violence against women and children is one of the unacceptable sides of our society and it is constantly on the increase."
"My arrival at the European Parliament coincided with a conference which Parliament organised on violence against children and child abuse, and I resolved to investigate this issue in depth here in the House."
"In particular, I would urge you to consider ways of supporting those trying to combat paedophile and prostitution networks on the Internet."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we are dealing here with a problem that is going from bad to worse."
"This week in Parliament, we voted on what I thought was a very good report on Internet crime. But let me tell you how things are in reality."
"In reality, there is an awful lot to think about."
"In each case, the children concerned have been the victims of a real crime."
"The number of victims is increasing, as is the number of potential criminals, because unfortunately victims themselves sometimes go on to commit crimes if they are unable to find ways of dealing with their trauma."
"One of the main problems - and one which the police also share - is that the NGOs working on combating the pornography and paedophile networks on the Internet often have to search among thousands and thousands of pieces of data."
"The report therefore rightly calls for help to be given to projects that are designed to track down victims, such as those who have been abducted and forced into prostitution, and who may be identified from the photographs offered for sale on the Internet by certain criminals."
"This is why I would urge that considerable scope should be offered to the NGOs working in these areas, but we must also not forget the scant resources that our judicial authorities often have to work with, not to mention the lack of European-level coordination."
"I therefore think that the report is right to ask whether Europol should be given the resources to play an effective role in combating this sort of violence."
"What I said about children also applies to combating violence against women, because young refugees are also often forced into prostitution and become the victims of the same kind of violence."
"Madam President, Commissioner, on International Women's Day, Commissioner Gradin issued a challenge to men to do something about violence against women by saying that violence against women was a men's problem."
"I find it striking that her words have found little support here in this debate."
"If the Commissioner meant that men are responsible for a considerable proportion of the violence against women, I have to agree."
"Saying that the two sexes are like chalk and cheese, however, is a distortion of reality."
"I certainly do not mean to deny that the problem exists."
"My main objection to the proposal is the level at which it is tackled."
"Violence is a problem that occurs in small groups, so a national or local approach is needed."
"I firmly believe that the Bible has a great deal to teach us about interpersonal relationships, and feel I have to point out that mankind, both men and women, is made in God's image."
"This belief can do much to help harmonious human relations, and anyone who is violent to those around him is simply denying this biblical truth."
"Mr President, the idea of adopting a programme designed to prevent violence against children, adolescents and women is a generous and noble idea which everyone can of course support."
"This programme, which takes its name from the Greek myth of Daphne, provides for a number of administrative actions and procedures that we approve of."
"But the rapporteur does not really seem to have investigated the causes and the sources of violence in European societies today."
"That violence is growing steadily."
"In France, for example, the number of crimes and offences rose from 200 000 in 1948 to 4 200 000 in 1998."
"Of course, not all these crimes and offences are against women and children, but there is undeniably a general upward trend in violence in that area too."
"That trend coincides with the collapse of the traditional framework in which people's lives were once rooted."
"In fact, for 50 years, society has become more urban, the family framework has been crumbling, and moral and religious landmarks have very often collapsed."
"Emancipated from such civilising frameworks, the individual who thinks he is free may be tempted to use violence against others with complete impunity."
"An administrative and financial programme like the one presented to us here, while not without merit, is not going to resolve this problem, which is in fact the challenge of a new barbarism."
"That is all the more true because, by always insisting on rights and never on duties, the ideology of human rights produces the opposite of its intentions - justification for excesses of all kinds."
"Ancient wisdom recognised that man was always tempted by excesses resulting in violence."
"For example, Plato demonstrated that the human spirit has three components: the rational, the emotional and the instinctive."
"If education fails to achieve an alliance between reason and emotion to keep instincts in check, they are unleashed and the door is opened to all kinds of violence."
"That ancient teaching is still valid."
"That is why mere palliatives cannot be enough."
"We must also combat the deep-rooted causes of the rise in violence in general, and in violence towards women and children in particular."
"This presupposes that the media will cease to cultivate violence systematically and that moral education will once again become a major requirement."
"Under the Third Republic in France, there was a consensus about this civic and moral education."
"This was broken down by the incursion of lax ideas on education."
"Man is not naturally good, he needs to feel the weight of civilising disciplines."
"As illustrated by the great Greek dramatist, Aeschylus, in the tragedy 'The Eumenides', a society which fails to punish crime will open the door to growing criminality."
"We need better teaching of ethics and more repressive courts, but people also need to be able to put down roots in small communities rather than in sprawling cities."
"Modern techniques mean that planning can allow people to live in human-sized districts and villages where everyone knows each other."
"There would then be spontaneous social control, which is more effective than repression through the courts or administrative support to victims."
"We should be aiming towards such a policy of re-rooting people in human-sized communities."
"Some of the sources of violence could then be eradicated."
"Madam President, when I presented the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs on behalf of my colleague Mrs Zimmermann, I said that Parliament was delighted with this initiative by the Commission, and I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to pass on our thanks to his two colleagues."
"However, I also made it clear that we are extremely concerned about the change in the legal basis, which as I said at the time is certainly going to make things difficult and has considerably dampened our enthusiasm, because violence against women and children, Commissioner, is not just a health risk."
"It is a fundamental attack on human rights."
"Combating violence is a very complex problem."
"It is not just about helping the victims, but also about preventing and combating violence among those who inflict it."
"It also requires cooperation between the judicial authorities and the police."
"It is therefore by definition multidisciplinary."
"What I am trying to say is that it would be completely unacceptable if the change in the legal basis meant that we only ended up with some new health programme for women and children rather than structural measures."
"I also wholeheartedly support the attempts by the Committees on Women's Rights and Internal Affairs to make various adjustments to the Commission's amended proposal."
"I would like to draw attention to a number of points which I think are important here."
"First there is the World Health Organisation's definition of health, which is very important in that it goes further than just risk prevention."
"It refers to people's quality of life, making the challenge even broader: equal opportunities for different people and different groups in society, and above all the right to life, the right to dignity, the right to freedom and integrity that everyone should enjoy."
"This is a clear reference to human rights, which is an area where this programme could be a little broader and where it should reinstate some of its original proposals."
"I would therefore like to appeal to the Commission and to my fellow Members to continue to urge the Council representatives to adopt a broad interpretation and a broad scope for the Daphne programme."
"I would like to hear what the Commissioner thinks about this."
"Commissioner, the signals coming out of the Council still show that it is obstinately refusing to take this message on board."
"In particular, its plan to allocate Daphne only a mini-budget, even less than Parliament had proposed and the Commission had agreed to, makes me very anxious about what the Council really intends for this programme."
"I suspect that the Council is really planning to use it only for micro-projects - a bit of awareness-raising and a few information campaigns - which stands in stark contrast to the very clearly stated ambitions that we have for it."
"If we do not broaden the scope and provide Daphne with the money it needs, it will remain a white elephant."
"Yet the public has enormous expectations here."
"So the European Parliament, as the co-legislator in a codecision procedure, cannot accept this, and I hope the Council will listen to what we are saying."
"Madam President, violence is a dominant feature of contemporary society and an enigma of our open society, a society that has lost its values and is taking on new idols and new symbols, confounding those traditional values which have always formed the basis of our civil life."
"And so we should not be surprised when television and other means of communication transmit to us images of violence and when our children feed on these images and base their world and ideals on them."
"We who are responsible for their education and, as politicians, have to be the most reliable interpreters of what it is that our people want, are under an obligation to condemn the sources of this violence and identify the most effective ways of combating it."
"In point of fact, this Community of ours is committed to combating violence, by stressing the principle of the right to life, to security, to freedom and to physical and mental integrity through a whole array of programmes, not least those which we are today trying to bring to completion."
"The Daphne programme combats violence against women, minors and children; it is a programme which has combated violence within the family, through ill-treatment and sexual abuse of children and partners, and the kind of violence we see in daily life, in the form of rape, sexual violence and molestation, harassment at the workplace and so on, a true battle of values and civilisation."
"This programme does not shy away from the truth, does not provide simple solutions, but incorporates a number of interacting factors: education, custom, issues of economic independence and employment, legal and jurisdictional issues, services to help victims, and health matters."
"But the regulation, the legal definition of the means of redress, as defined in Article 52 of the Treaty of Amsterdam - which is the legal basis of the programme - is restricted to combating violence."
"Therefore, an area to which we believe it would have been more consistent to have applied Article 235 of the Treaty has been encompassed under the heading of 'public health', even though in the final analysis Article 235 allows for powers of action that are not specifically provided for, where Community action proves necessary to achieve one of the Community's objectives."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is sadly true that many aspects of the world in which we live are far from perfect; one of its sordid aspects is that of violence against women, children and young people, and this is a problem we have to tackle relentlessly."
"For that reason, the German Presidency has made the problem one of its priority issues."
"A meeting on the subject has already taken place."
"The Bundesrat , the chamber of the German Parliament in which the federal states are represented, has expressed its regret that 1999 was not declared to be an official year of action on violence against women, which would have been an important means of reinforcing this message."
"Violence-prevention strategies must incorporate different approaches, depending on whether the violence in question is domestic or non-domestic."
"That distinction is not adequately covered in the Commission proposal, and so it is essential to add amendments that refer explicitly to sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and traffic in human beings and to support all the other amendments on the table."
"These additions are necessary for two reasons: firstly, it must be made clear that the definition of violence goes beyond the use of physical force."
"Sexual abuse, for instance, does not always entail the use of physical force, especially when the victims are young children, but can involve all sorts of intimidation and threats which leave no physical trace."
"This does not make its effects any less drastic; on the contrary, they are often far, far worse."
"One of the most humiliating experiences of sexually abused women and children is not to be believed unless they can furnish proof in the form of physical injuries."
"Sexual exploitation is one of the most despicable manifestations of the sex industry, about which a word should be said at this point."
"More money is now made from trafficking in women than from drug trafficking."
"Traffickers in women run a far lower risk of prosecution than dealers in drugs or weapons, because there is often a lack of evidence that would stand up in court."
"Traffic in women is a 'growth industry', not least because of the more open borders with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, from where most of the victims in our Member States are drawn."
"The desperate economic situation in their own countries forces many women to clutch at any straw, which makes them easy prey for the traffickers."
"The fact that the enormity of this affront to humanity is no longer a taboo subject, but is being discussed more and more openly and has even been the subject of official action programmes is to be warmly welcomed."
"These efforts have our unreserved support, and in that context we surely owe a debt of gratitude to Commissioner Anita Gradin as well."
"I need only remind you of the conference which was held in Vienna and attracted widespread public attention."
"We need comprehensive measures to prevent trafficking, to educate the public and to protect the victims, as well as cooperation and coordination with the judiciary, the police, the competent authorities and, last but not least, with the non-governmental organisations that operate in this field; this cooperation and coordination must take place within each Member State, between the Member States and with the relevant countries outside the European Union."
"The suitability of the chosen legal basis, which has rightly attracted severe criticism here, is open to question."
"But there is no disputing the fact that violence against women, children and young people ultimately damages their health and - very importantly - their psychological constitution."
"Reducing the problem to a mere health issue would amount to an intolerable trivialisation."
"Let it be clearly understood that violence against women, children and young people must be outlawed and punished as serious violations of human rights, with no ifs or buts."
"Madam President, The Commission would like to thank Mrs Bennasar Tous and the Committee on Women's Rights for the report."
"It gives strong support to the Commission's initiative and underlines in an admirable way the need and urgency for the Daphne programme to be adopted well before the end of the year."
"The Commission also appreciates the important role the European Parliament plays in putting the fight against violence on the agenda of the European Union."
"The main objective of the proposed five-year Daphne programme is to support and encourage NGOs and voluntary organisations to work together to protect children, young persons and women from all kinds of violence."
"This is to be achieved through the setting up of networks, exchange of information and best practices and the raising of public awareness."
"Preventive action, including how to prevent violent behaviour by men towards women, will be among the priorities."
"The programme is building on the experiences of the Daphne initiative which has been running since 1997."
"The Commission shares the report's assessment of the programme."
"It is an important tool in the fight against violence."
"The multiannual character of the programme will allow for the planning of initiatives on a longer-term basis."
"The progressive extension to the acceding countries, as has been mentioned by a number of parliamentarians, and the EFTA countries, is vital, given the trans-national dimension of many forms of violence."
"The programme will also help to develop the NGOs' potential in a number of fields."
"Mrs Bennasar Tous proposes a number of constructive amendments and additions to the Commission's proposal."
"The Commission is happy to accept most of them."
"The Commission also agrees on the need for a careful choice of projects."
"One objective should be to ensure a balance between different areas and target groups."
"The proposed advisory committee will play an important role in assisting the Commission in this respect."
"The rapporteur and a number of honourable Members deplore the fact that the Commission decided to change the legal base for the proposal from Article 235 to Article 129."
"It was a difficult decision for the Commission."
"Nobody should doubt that the Commission would have preferred to stick to the original proposal but there was a considerable risk of blockage in the Council."
"Several Member States were openly opposed to the use of Article 235 and we have to bear in mind that there is no value in an unacceptable Daphne programme."
"A question was also raised about the extension of the programme."
"The Commission assumes that a change to Article 129, public health, will not limit the scope of the programme."
"The context in which we work to combat violence and in which women and children suffer is indeed in the whole context of human rights."
"However, the impact of violence amounts to injury, or risk of injury, to the victim's physical, mental and psychological health."
"Furthermore, the Daphne programme is, as the rapporteur underlines, victim-based."
"Its aim is to prevent all forms of violence and to protect all victims and potential victims of violence, irrespective of whether the violence takes the form of trafficking, sexual abuse, the abandonment of children or any other form."
"When the Daphne programme is adopted it will provide a new impetus for the fight against violence."
"It is now important to have it adopted swiftly and, at any rate, well before the end of the year."
"The Commission appreciates the European Parliament's strong support for this objective."
"The Commission is prepared to accept 16 of the amendments, 10 with some rewording and cannot accept 10 of the amendments."
"If you want me to specify which one by one I can do it today or tomorrow as you wish."
"Commissioner, our amendments follow a gradual progression: some raise problems of subsidiarity, others procedural problems - and on that, I think, we will be able to reach agreement - but there are also some fundamental amendments."
"I would like to remind you of them, and you will then be able to give your assessment."
"I am thinking, for instance, of Amendments Nos 7, 27, 29 and 35, third indent, which we regard as part of the essential substance of the programme and which I believe the Commission ought also to accept."
"I think the Commissioner has already said which amendments are being accepted."
"No, that is clearly not the case."
"Can you tell us which amendments are being accepted by the Commission?"
"The Commission is prepared to accept - with rewording - Amendment Nos 29 and 35 but it is not able to accept Amendment No 7."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"The sitting was closed at 7.45 p.m."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, page 9 of the Minutes refers to three consecutive speeches: those made by myself, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy and Mr Wijsenbeek on the important decision to vote by simple majority on the amendments to the responsibilities of the parliamentary committees."
"However, the responsibilities of these committees are part of the Rules of Procedure, and any amendment to the Rules requires an absolute majority."
"I am aware that there is a precedent to this, and that it is on the basis of this that the President decided to dismiss the matter."
"However, I should like to point out that - so as not to continue with any bad habits - the Committee on the Rules of Procedure should at least be given the opportunity to discuss the matter. In my view, it would be improper - or would at least be a biased interpretation - to allow a simple majority to amend the responsibilities of the parliamentary committees, or for that matter to remove the essence of those committees where this relative majority would not assume the Chair."
"It is therefore possible that we are acting in an improper manner here, and the Rules are made to protect minorities."
"Therefore, I believe that it would be worth referring the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, rather than simply dismissing this objection which I believe to be fundamental."
"Mr Herman, you know that one of my criteria has always been that in the event of a discussion on the substance of a matter, the Chair must take a decision on the immediate situation and then, if necessary, refer it to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure."
"I shall therefore refer this matter, which has been raised by yourself and other Members, to the committee."
"Mr President, we voted yesterday on my report concerning the Commission White Paper on infrastructure charges."
"I see that the parliamentary services, probably for stylistic reasons, have changed the text on which we voted in paragraph 1."
"In my report, which was adopted by the committee without any amendment to paragraph 1, I called for the introduction of a uniform charging system for all modes of transport, 'based inter alia on marginal social cost'."
"The wording represented a deliberate attempt to keep open the option of incorporating other factors."
"Now some language freak has changed this into 'on the basis of marginal social cost', which conveys an entirely different message."
"I must insist that the original wording be put back into the report, both in the German version and in any translations that have been altered."
"Thank you, Mrs Schmidbauer."
"Parliament's services will check on that and we shall keep the original translation that was adopted, since that is the will of the House."
"The Minutes were approved"
"Statement by the President"
"In the vote held yesterday morning on the proposal for a decision on the number, powers and responsibilities of parliamentary committees, Parliament adopted two contradictory amendments relating to the responsibility for the legal protection of consumers, namely Amendment No 31 by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and Amendment No 60 by the Group of the European People's Party."
"The Rules do not allow two committees to be responsible for the same matter."
"Therefore, in order to ensure that the text approved is consistent, responsibility for the legal protection of consumers should be given to the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"I have consequently given the necessary instructions to the relevant services."
"Yesterday I received a motion of censure on the Commission, which resigned collectively on 16 March 1999."
"If approved, the motion would require the Commission to resign as a body, pursuant to Article 144, second paragraph, of the EC Treaty."
"However, in accordance with the legal principles 'nulla quia absurdum ' and 'ad impossibilia nemo tenetur ', I cannot admit a motion of censure on a body which has already resigned."
"I have therefore declared the motion inadmissible."
"Applause"
"Mr President, I do not know how you can take such decisions."
"I must admit that I am surprised at the way in which we automatically look for legal arguments in order to oppose a particular group of Members."
"In this case, a tenth of the Members of Parliament are involved, that is, 66 Members from all the political groups: 5 from the PSE Group, 8 from the PPE Group, 4 from the ELDR Group, 6 from the UPE Group, 6 from the GUE/NGL Group, 9 from the Green Group, 3 from the ARE Group, 15 from the I-EDN Group, and 10 Non-attached Members."
"This is therefore not something that has been initiated by any particular Member, but by a tenth of the Members of Parliament."
"This matter had been referred to the Legal Service on 6 April."
"In a memorandum of 7 April, which was sent to Mr Priestley, our legal expert concluded that a motion of censure against the Commission could be declared admissible in order to clarify the Commission's legal situation and to further limit its powers, despite the fact that this would provide very little added value in legal terms."
"The resigning Commission will remain in office until at least the end of September or the start of October."
"It retains all its powers because it has resigned in the context of Article 159."
"Thus, Mrs Bonino, a resigning Commissioner, visited the headquarters of NATO, an international organisation, to meet its Secretary-General for the first time."
"Was such a decision taken in the context of a Commission which is dealing with current business?"
"We cannot therefore accept a situation where the Commission retains all its powers for more than six months following its resignation but yet you yourself are unable to exercise your fundamental right to assert control over it, particularly through the motion of censure."
"This is why I feel that the decision you are taking, Mr President, is extremely serious in light of the present situation - although that is not so serious - and in terms of its implications for the future of this House and the future of democracy in Europe."
"Mr President, I think Mr Fabre-Aubrespy misunderstands the whole issue because the fact is that, even if his motion of censure were to be passed by this House, the same Commission would continue, as it is legally obliged to under the Treaty, until we replace it."
"Mr President, you are acting absolutely properly in maintaining the dignity of this House."
"I, like you, believe that this is the right decision and as far as I am concerned I do not believe in mutilating dead bodies."
"I am going to give the floor to Mr Kerr, who also signed the motion of censure, and we shall then take the final decision."
"Mr President, it may well be that your lawyers have found a way round the political obligations of this Parliament."
"But the point surely is a moral one."
"This Commission resigned more than two months ago, yet it is still in office, it is still drawing its salaries, it is still making decisions and it is still not making decisions."
"Europe is in a crisis, and this Parliament has an obligation to say to them: get an interim Commission appointed quickly."
"It they do not, I recommend all Members to reject Mr Prodi in May as a sign of objection to this situation."
"We are going to hold elections in two months time."
"The citizens of Europe do not understand why a Commission, which resigned two months ago, is going to continue for another nine months."
"It is a disgrace and we should say so!"
"Thank you, Mr Kerr."
"I think that we have had enough debate on this issue and I would like to tell those responsible for the motion of censure that I consider it to be inadmissible."
"The reports by the Legal Service must be studied carefully, but they are not binding on the President in terms of how the Rules are to be interpreted."
"The President is responsible for all interpretations of the Rules of Procedure and only the Committee on the Rules of Procedure can alter any interpretation by the President."
"I can assure you that, in taking this decision, I have given every consideration to my responsibilities now and for the future."
"The aim of the motion of censure, under parliamentary law, is to demonstrate that an executive has lost the confidence of the majority of Parliament or, if the motion is rejected, that it still has that confidence."
"It is clear that in this case the possible rejection of a motion of censure could in no way have the effect of restoring confidence in the executive, and it would serve no purpose."
"This procedure therefore seems somewhat ridiculous, and we must always reject any form of ridiculous interpretation concerning one of our Rules, particularly in the case of a motion of censure, which is a highly political instrument."
"I respect all the signatories to the motion, as I respect all the Members of this House, but it is our responsibility to use the appropriate channels in this matter, that is the Court of Justice or the relevant resolutions, since the Rules allow us to express our wishes in many forms."
"A motion of censure is not the appropriate channel, and this House is not responsible for the fact that the Commission is going to continue in office for many months."
"We have offered to cooperate with the Council in order to replace the Commission as soon as possible."
"We could not have done anything further, and it is not our responsibility if the Council has decided that for various reasons it still cannot appoint a new Commission."
"We have done what we can until now, and indeed we must continue to acknowledge our responsibilities."
"The matter is therefore settled."
"Applause"
"Mr President, you have raised the subject of the text we adopted and Amendments Nos 60 and 61, which you now say are contradictory."
"I do not think they are."
"In any case, our group specifically tabled an amendment to relieve the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights of its responsibility for the legal protection of consumers."
"So I think on that point I cannot agree with your interpretation, Mr President."
"Mr President, . I have two roles: firstly as the original author of the document which sought to change committee structures and, secondly, as chairman of the committee responsible at the moment for consumer policy."
"At the end of the Conference of Presidents' meeting yesterday, I spoke with Mr Rømer and other officials."
"The position is that the legal protection of consumers will be the responsibility of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights."
"However, consumer rights as such, and consumer policy in so far as it affects, for example, food safety and the like, will continue to be the responsibility of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"That is the clarified explanation and, as far as I am aware, that is the situation that was accepted by senior officials in Parliament."
"I think that is perfectly reasonable."
"The point is that we really had to adopt Annex VI, to avoid the conflicts of competence which have sometimes caused so much trouble in the last five or ten years, and the explanation I have just given avoids such conflicts."
"Amendment No 60 states that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is responsible for consumers' rights, which remains, and their legal protection, which must be deleted."
"Why?"
"Because Amendment No 31 states that the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights is responsible for consumers' legal protection."
"There is a clear contradiction."
"The legal protection of consumers' rights should remain the responsibility of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights, and consumers' rights should remain the responsibility of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, as Mr Collins has just explained."
"Mr President, I cannot follow the sequence of events here."
"I also have the impression that I was mistranslated into English."
"What was the first vote on yesterday?"
"The first vote was on the responsibilities of the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Then our amendment was adopted making the Committee on Consumer Protection responsible for the legal protection of consumers."
"If this is the case, then the interpretation you have given us is wrong."
"We deliberately chose to transfer responsibility for the legal protection of consumers to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection."
"Mr President, I think you need to find out what we voted on first."
"Mr President, I believe our honourable colleague Mrs Oomen-Ruijten is mistaken this time."
"Although she rightly reports that our group adopted an amendment, I must point out that the same amendment was rejected here in the Chamber yesterday."
"This means that the President's interpretation is correct."
"I am going to ask Parliament's services to check which vote was taken first."
"As far as I am aware, the amendment by the Group of the Party of European Socialists was voted on initially."
"The PPE Group's amendment could therefore not have been adopted, as it would have contradicted the result of a previous amendment."
"The system we use allows us to clarify the matter, with the result that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection will continue to have the responsibilities that correspond to it, just as the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens' Rights will continue to have the responsibilities it ought to have."
"In my view, therefore, this is the only possible outcome, given what has happened."
"We have no option but to keep things as they are."
"This matter is thus settled."
"Mr President, I did try to raise this earlier on the Minutes, but my request was apparently not spotted."
"I only wish to draw attention to the two amendments tabled by our group on the question of carry-overs, where the texts are incompatible in their present form."
"They were rejected."
"These amendments are based on the current Rules of Procedure, and we have now adopted a resolution that is at odds with the existing Rules of Procedure, according to which the Committee on Budgets is responsible for transfers of appropriations from the reserve, while all other carry-overs - and I am generalising somewhat here - are the responsibility of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"May I ask you to check that, because we undoubtedly have a contradiction here."
"That is why I tabled these amendments on behalf of my group."
"I cannot tell you the numbers of the two amendments offhand, but that can easily be checked."
"Thank you, Mrs Theato."
"I did not give you the floor because I did not wish to confuse two different issues."
"Parliament's services will check this, and we shall then take the relevant decision in the light of their findings."
"Mr President, I would like to refer back to the matter of the responsibilities of committees."
"It is very important that Parliament is clear about the different responsibilities of committees."
"Otherwise, the general public's understanding of the European Community will become more confused."
"They will see the Parliament adopt different positions in different committees."
"Therefore, clarification of responsibilities is vital."
"I respect the decision you have made and I understand very clearly what Mr Collins said."
"But in the future we have to make sure that this Parliament, if it is going to change the responsibilities of a committee, does it by a clear majority."
"If there is no provision for this at present, the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities should look at it, as Mr Herman has already suggested."
"There should be a clear majority in the House for a change of responsibilities, not just a small margin, especially when, as at present, we have said two different things in two different amendments."
"I urge the House to recommend to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure that an overall majority is needed to change the responsibilities of committees."
"Mr Provan, as I said, I am going to forward the question immediately to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure, the Verification of Credentials and Immunities."
"It is important that more time is taken with future changes."
"This confusion has arisen because our services have to work to a very short timetable, political needs often taking precedence over proper preparation for the part-session, and this leads to difficult working conditions."
"Mr President, I was not in the Chair at the time."
"However, I must admit that I do not fully understand what we have been discussing for some time now, because I see that Amendment No 31 was adopted and Amendment No 60 was rejected."
"So how can there be a contradiction?"
"There is no contradiction."
"Perhaps there is a mistake in the Minutes, although it says that Amendments Nos 60 and 61 were rejected and Amendment No 31 by the Socialist Group was adopted."
"There is therefore no contradiction because Amendment No 31 was adopted and Amendment No 60 was rejected."
"I have the impression that this discussion is futile, though no harm has been done as it was interesting nonetheless."
"Thank you."
"That backs up the decision we have taken."
"I will however check, because if Amendment No 60 was rejected, there should be no confusion."
"I am acting on the basis of the information received from DG II."
"Of course, a mistake may have been made after the vote was held, and I am extremely grateful to you for having pointed this out."
"Mr President, I can confirm what Mrs Fontaine has just said."
"I myself raised a point of order yesterday after the second vote to say that we should have declared that amendment null and void, and that it should not have been put to the vote since it contradicted the first amendment."
"The President of the sitting said to me at the time that that was of no importance since the amendment had just been rejected."
"Therefore, I can confirm - and I am also surprised - that no reference is made in the Minutes to the point of order I raised."
"I had not realised this, but you will be able to check it with the tape."
"The situation is becoming more and more surreal."
"Laughter"
"We shall check the Minutes and proceed accordingly."
"Mr President, I wish to return to the question of the motion of censure."
"You terminated discussion of the matter before all the facts were presented."
"Protests"
"There have been two speakers in favour and two against on a subject which is, ultimately, the sole responsibility of the President."
"The discussion is now closed."
"I cannot give the floor to any further speakers on this question."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I suggest we move on from this surrealism and return to the relaxed state of mind we usually enjoy on Fridays."
"So let us all relax as we move on to the vote on the Bennasar Tous report."
"VOTES"
"I would congratulate Mrs Bennasar Tous and ask Mrs Colombo Svevo, who deputised for her in yesterday's debate, to pass on our compliments to the rapporteur."
"The European Commission amended its first proposal so that it could have as a basis Article 129 of the EC Treaty - public health and the codecision procedure - instead of Article 235."
"The amended proposal now includes some of the amendments by the Committee on Women's Rights that appeared in the initial report."
"Moreover, Mrs Anita Gradin, a Member of the Commission, said in the House that choosing Article 129 would not limit the scope of the programme."
"I am pleased about that, because this is a serious and urgent matter."
"It is urgent, in particular, because violence affects one in five women across Europe and 50 % of women that are murdered are killed by their husband or partner."
"Violence in general, and this type of violence in particular, is unacceptable and is a violation of human rights."
"Europe must move quickly in this area."
"The UN Commission on the Status of Women included this issue in its agenda for March 1999."
"I had personally informed the Belgian representative in that Commission of the European programme, Daphne, and of the work carried out by our Committee on Women's Rights."
"She reminded me that at a preparatory conference held in Vienna in 1998, the UN Commission on the Status of Women had listened, in particular, to European women talking about the pain, suffering, abuse and coercion they were subjected to during the tragic nationalist conflict in the former Yugoslavia."
"The European Parliament must continue its work on the Daphne programme and, in fact, it introduced a specific line of credit for the programme's launch."
"Above all, it must ensure that the problem of violence against children, young persons and women is not reduced to a mere health problem."
"At the end of the 20th century, the various forms of violence against children, young persons and women have increasingly become a matter of concern."
"No one denies this any more."
"And at least we are starting to show our outrage about it."
"From this perspective, I agree with the draftsman of the opinion that it is important to pay close attention to this particular form of violence, that is, sexual abuse and exploitation of these members of society."
"Moreover, it is imperative that the necessary measures to support and reintegrate victims are complemented by other measures that aim specifically to prevent crime, including actions aimed at offenders."
"Public information on the criminal nature of these offences and strict criminal proceedings must replace the silence and leniency that all too often still accompany such crimes in our nonetheless developed societies."
"More generally, I should like to say that all the measures proposed in this Community action programme can and must be supported in order to combat this genuine scourge of violence in all its forms."
"However, I should like to point out once again that they will not be enough to stamp it out singlehandedly."
"I would like to remind you that insecurity and impoverishment form a particularly good breeding ground for all types of violence."
"It is therefore vital for this Community action programme to fit into a general context which also maintains a strong social security system and allows for economic growth that creates sustainable employment."
"Given these considerations, I support the action programme as amended."
"I will be voting for the Bennasar Tous report - Daphne - as I believe that violence against women, young persons and children, is an important issue that needs to be addressed."
"Throughout all the Member State this is an issue that affects one in four women but is often overlooked or viewed as a taboo."
"Often projects addressing this issue only receive short-term funding."
"However, in order to achieve objectives and to ensure an impact is made, a long-term funding programme is required."
"The European programme draws its inspiration from the 'Zero Tolerance' campaign that Edinburgh Council ran in my constituency in the mid-1990s."
"The 1997 Daphne programme was heavily oversubscribed with less than 10 % of applications receiving funding."
"Since then the budget has been increased but still falls short of the amount needed."
"Therefore, I consider this report to be a welcome step towards reducing violence against women and children."
"Senior citizens in the 21st century"
"The next item is the report (A4-0160/99) by Mr McMahon and Mr Schiedermeier, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on senior citizens in the 21st century - a new lease of life."
"Mr President, this is a joint report by my colleague, Mr Schiedermeier, and myself."
"Indeed, on the subject of Italy, which we will be discussing, I remember a few years ago we went to Italy with the Social Affairs Committee."
"The Secretariat did not know who was doyen d'age , the oldest Member."
"They thought it was Mr Schiedermeier because he had white hair."
"In actual fact, when they checked the records, I was a few weeks older than him, so it should have been me."
"So it was quite interesting that we were both approaching our 60th year."
"This report is the result of the conference which we held on the elderly in October."
"It put forward the views of the elderly citizens of the Community, what they might like to see for the future, and what kind of recommendations we would make for the United Nations Year of the Elderly."
"The elderly - senior citizens, or 'grey panthers', as they are called in the United States; 'grey power' in the UK - represent a very important part of the Community."
"I see many of the 'golden oldies' or 'grey oldies' around me this morning: on my left, Mr Schiedermeier, on my right Mr Falconer."
"They have changed their usual political positions."
"The conference came up with some recommendations which we have put to the Commission."
"The Commission is bringing forward a communication on problems of the elderly."
"We are not just talking about people beyond the age of retirement, we are talking about people from 60 years of age to 75."
"There are 75 million people over the age of 60 in the European Union."
"This will increase."
"Demographic trends are going to create a time-bomb for the decision-makers of the future."
"We must be able to respond to this."
"Ageing is high on the EU's political agenda."
"I am quite sure that in the next few weeks, when our colleagues go to the hustings, they will be besieged by many of the Community's senior citizens, asking what the European Parliament is going to do for them."
"Over 42 % of voters in the EU are over 50 years of age."
"So, if we have 75 million people over the age of 60 and 42 % of the voters are over 50 years of age, obviously the issues of senior citizens and the elderly are going to be important in campaigning."
"The over-50s represent 33 % of the whole population of the EU; one-third of the EU is over 50."
"Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty outlaws discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, gender, disability, sexual orientation, etc."
"It now gives the Commission a legal peg to introduce measures for the elderly and senior citizens."
"At the moment the Commission is constrained by the existing legal bases."
"But the Amsterdam Treaty now gives the Commission the opportunity to deal with discrimination on the grounds of race or age."
"We look forward to seeing what will come out of the employment guidelines which the Commission agreed at the conference in Luxembourg and some of the discussions about the European Social Fund and older workers."
"There are tremendous possibilities there."
"Fifty-one percent of all men seeking work are in the 50-64 age group."
"There will probably be some Members, like myself, who are in a similar position after 13 June."
"The percentage for women is the same: 51 % of women who are seeking work are in the 50-64 age group."
"Employment is a very serious issue for this age group."
"It is time that we, in the institutions, put our own house in order and deal with the ageism that we practice in some of our recruitment policies."
"So what can we do about this, now having stated the problem?"
"The Amsterdam Treaty is one area where we can do something."
"Health is another area."
"I would hope that the Commission will bring forward an action programme on health for elderly people and for the whole Community under Article 137."
"The elderly are not a homogeneous group."
"We must not treat them just as elderly and lock them away in a cupboard or parcel them off and say 'that is elderly'."
"We must try to pull the Union and its citizens together and have genuine solidarity."
"We must not just limit our measures to older people themselves."
"So these are some of the measures we are putting forward."
"I would like to thank Mr Schiedermeier for his cooperation."
"I thank the staff of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment."
"As this is my swan song as rapporteur for this mandate, I must say I have enjoyed my experience this year."
"Loud applause"
"Mr McMahon, I am quite sure that 'Loud applause ' will appear in the verbatim report of proceedings following your speech, since this report has earned many fans."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will now give the floor to Mr Schiedermeier as joint rapporteur, and since Mr McMahon said that you are a few months older than him, you will have five and a half minutes instead of five minutes."
"The history of the conference on the elderly and their prospects for the 21st century demonstrates the gulf between words and action where senior citizens are concerned."
"On the one hand there is the catalogue - one and a half pages long - of previous findings, meetings, resolutions, petitions and reports, and on the other hand it took almost a year between the decision to hold a conference, which was adopted on 16 October 1997, and the conference itself on 1 and 2 October 1998."
"We rapporteurs faced many initial difficulties. The President of the European Parliament, for example, refused us the use of the plenary chamber, so that we had to squeeze into our group meeting rooms."
"Moreover, interpreting facilities were originally offered for only three target languages, to name only one of many other obstacles."
"The European Senior Citizens' Parliament that was held in Luxembourg, Mrs Lulling, from 22 to 24 November 1993 was attended by 508 senior citizens as well as 50 Members of the European Parliament and 15 representatives of institutions."
"Our senior citizens' conference was authorised for 131 participants and two MEPs, namely the rapporteurs."
"The report is being presented and discussed here today - on a Friday, which is known to be the day with the lowest turnout of Members."
"In the face of all this evidence, who still dares to speak of the growing recognition accorded to senior citizens?"
"Not I, to be sure!"
"Everyone talks about demographic development."
"As Mr McMahon said, 75 million people in the European Union are over 60 years of age."
"That represents more than 20 % of the population, and this is tending to rise because of the steady increase in life expectancy."
"Unfortunately, few observers are aware of the heterogeneous nature of the community of senior citizens."
"There are huge differences in terms of prosperity, social status and physical capacity."
"Many people, thank God, reach retirement age in full possession of their mental and physical faculties today and remain fit up to a ripe old age."
"Let me turn to the obvious problems."
"Unemployment has already been mentioned."
"It affects a disproportionately large number of older people."
"What is more, the unemployment statistics do not include those who have taken early retirement or who, for some other reason, are not counted among the active population."
"In other words, unemployment among the older age groups is far higher than the figures would suggest."
"And then there is the ostracism and victimisation that occur in workplaces."
"Attempts are made to root out older colleagues from the group or company boardroom and the shop floor."
"Add to these the regular discrimination which is a fact of everyday life."
"It is astonishing that society does not really recognise its own failure to harness the experience and potential of older generations."
"Far more importance should be attached to making room for senior citizens, especially in the voluntary sector but also in the workplace."
"On the basis of their own experience, they could impart a great deal of useful information and advice to junior staff."
"As far as material wealth is concerned, the fact that poverty is still rife among the elderly, and especially among elderly women, is undisputed."
"There is still a great deal to be done here."
"But there are smart people out there, especially younger people, who are now saying that they want to terminate their social contract with the older generation."
"I asked some of them, 'So do you also want to renounce the benefits that the elderly have obtained for you?"
"Do you intend never to use a motorway again?"
"Are you willing to give up free university study?"
"Do you intend to stop using the hospitals and clinics we have provided?'"
"That silenced them."
"Additional voluntary pensions must not diminish the existing solidarity pact between the generations."
"That is very important to me."
"Management and labour, government bodies, the Member States and the European Union must adopt the appropriate countermeasures in their respective areas of responsibility; in other words, they must not seek to centralise their responsibilities in this sector but must pursue a coordinated and, where appropriate, a cooperative policy on senior citizens in the EU."
"First and foremost, there is a need to initiate and encourage a new approach to the elderly within society, and I consider it very important that this approach should serve to prevent discrimination against older employees and the elderly in general."
"Unless society changes its thinking, not even legally enforceable rights will do any good."
"In our report we have presented a long list of instruments through which our aims for senior citizens can be achieved."
"A number of useful points emerged from the preparatory phase before the conference when the Group of the European People's Party, the Senior Citizens' Union and numerous experts in the field shared their experiences."
"I should like to thank my group, especially my colleagues Ria Oomen-Ruijten and Bartho Pronk, my assistant Mrs Stein and the staff of the group delegation in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as well as the group secretariat."
"All of their efforts in this matter went far beyond the call of duty."
"Finally, let me express my sincere thanks to Mr McMahon of the Group of the Party of European Socialists for our close and harmonious cooperation over the past year and a half, during which we became friends."
"A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved."
"The sad thing we both learned was that performance and experience in senior citizens count for nothing."
"Our parties, especially the heads of our parties, have blocked our bids to stand for re-election, and so we share the same fate."
"For all that may be said to the contrary, fulsome praise and discrimination are never far apart for the elderly, in politics as elsewhere."
"There is still much to be done for senior citizens."
"Please let us set about it."
"This was also my last report to the House, Mr President, and I thank you for your patience."
"Applause"
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the two rapporteurs for this excellent and very comprehensive report."
"I shall not spend any time enumerating the really good initiatives and options it contains, because we can all read that for ourselves."
"The title 'Senior citizens in the 21st century' strikes me as being very ambitious as well as presenting an obligation."
"It challenges us in Parliament, along with the Commission and the Council, to develop a far-sighted policy for the over-60s in the European Union, of whom there are already 75 million."
"Most people over the age of 60 are in full possession of their mental and physical powers."
"I would go along with Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon on that."
"There is still a huge amount of discrimination everywhere, and I believe these people have no desire to be treated as basket cases; all they rightly ask of policymakers and society is a level playing field and a social safety net."
"Now that we have the Treaty of Amsterdam and its Article 13 on the suppression of discrimination, including age discrimination, we have a legal basis for common European action."
"We did adopt a senior citizens' programme a few years ago, but it was blocked in the Council by the Conservative Governments of Britain and Germany on the flimsy grounds that there was no reliable legal basis and that it was ultimately a matter for national governments to pursue such a policy."
"But this meant that there was no accompanying activity of any description at European level, and that the information links which were already established between senior citizens' organisations in the European Union were no longer financed, which resulted in some of them fading into oblivion."
"We could truly have made more progress by now, and I hope that we shall advance in future on the basis of this report."
"My wish for all the people of Europe is that both the senior and the junior citizens of the Union will be able to live together in solidarity."
"Mr President, since I am no longer the youngest of 626 Members, as I was when I first entered the House in October 1965, this report on the outlook for senior citizens in the 21st century is of particular interest to me, not least in my capacity as president of a national and a major European women's organisation in which the older members are the most active and which, like many other organisations, would no longer be viable without the voluntary work of their older members, since the younger ones are so overburdened with professional and family commitments that it is well-nigh impossible to recruit them for voluntary activities."
"What our two rapporteurs have proposed in the 30 paragraphs of the resolution and in the introductory recitals is naturally music to our ears."
"It is sheer balm on the wounds of many elderly people, especially women, to discover that their special problems have not been forgotten, and my heartfelt thanks go to the rapporteurs for that."
"You are so right to emphasise that the older people in our countries possess a rich treasury of experience, knowledge, education and values that we cannot afford to cast aside, that a general rethinking of conventional attitudes and stereotypes is necessary, and that society must adopt a new approach with a view to combating the many different forms of discrimination and social exclusion to which older people are subjected both at work and in the social arena."
"They call for research and better practice in the care of age-related diseases."
"In this connection, I should not like to miss the opportunity to point out the urgent need for better information regarding the fact that moderate and regular consumption of wine is the best way of preventing age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, for which we now have scientific evidence."
"Applause"
"It would, however, be necessary for the northern Member States such as your own, Commissioner Liikanen, to reduce their unduly high excise duties on wine so as to enable all citizens of the Union, be they young or old, to enjoy that particular form of preventive medicine."
"With regard to the pension rights of the elderly, and especially of women, I should like to refer to two initiatives I have taken here, both of which resulted in unanimously adopted parliamentary reports."
"The first relates to the splitting of pension rights acquired during married life in favour of women who have given up their careers to look after their families and who, in the event of divorce after 20 or more years of marriage, are particularly liable to fall below the poverty line."
"We also called for a Commission initiative in this area, but nothing has happened."
"The second initiative related to the social security of those who assist their self-employed spouses."
"Here too, we called for an improvement of the 1986 directive on the equal treatment of self-employed persons and their assisting spouses."
"Once again, nothing has happened."
"Mr President, allow me to say one more thing."
"I should like to refer to a paragraph in the resolution, the one concerning the participation of older people in decision-making processes, including the political process, since there are naturally those elements who take pride in presenting the list of candidates with the lowest average age."
"It is surely ironic that our two rapporteurs have fallen victim to that very tendency and have not been selected as candidates in the forthcoming elections."
"What makes that all the more regrettable in my eyes is the high regard we have had for their work here, since it is undoubtedly discrimination against the ever-increasing number of elderly people to omit such competent and sprightly colleagues from the party lists."
"That was just something I felt I had to say here, Mr President."
"Although I should be delighted if I were re-elected to the European Parliament, I should find it most regrettable if I were to be returned as the oldest Member!"
"Laughter and applause"
"Thank you, Mrs Lulling."
"After the sitting, when I see you in the corridor, I will have to ask you to tell me how much wine you drink each day, what kind of wine you drink, and in particular how much it costs, including tax."
"Mr President, I too would like to thank the two rapporteurs, who have illustrated the point that 'you are as young as you feel'."
"The situation today is different from what it was 20 or 30 years ago, in that many older people in society are now in better health."
"We therefore need to galvanise public opinion so as to ensure that people's later years are seen as a pleasant phase of life, and this means providing information and support, as well as consolidating national legislation."
"We see discrimination against senior citizens; older people have problems with their sight and hearing; they can find themselves more affected by unemployment than other groups; and they run the risk of social exclusion. All this illustrates the need to work ceaselessly to mobilise public awareness in a bid to prevent certain groups in society from being marginalised."
"My view is that policy for senior citizens should be dealt with primarily at national level; it is to national legislation that we should turn."
"In Sweden, the Swedish Parliament sets the general parameters, but responsibility for social and health care for the elderly lies further down the line, with the regional and local bodies operating at the grass roots."
"We need to ensure that this continues to be the case."
"There is no need for actual legislation at EU level, although benefit could be drawn from information, consultation and exchanges of experience, as well as from practical work, research and the sharing of results into Alzheimer's disease or other health problems which affect senior citizens."
"Social legislation is perhaps the most important instrument available to a country, since its effects are felt by people in their everyday lives."
"We cannot therefore afford to make concessions in this area; the whole issue must continue to be dealt with at regional and local level."
"I am not too happy about the manner in which the report calls on the Member States to implement measures affecting areas such as pensions, health care, housing and jobs."
"The points made are not incorrect, but it is in reality up to the national authorities, not the EU, to take decisions on these matters."
"We in the European Parliament are quite entitled to our views, but rather than 'calling' for action, we would perhaps be better advised to 'recommend' or 'suggest'."
"There is however one area where we do have considerable scope for improving the lives of senior citizens in very practical ways, and I am thinking here of how we can use the machinery of European cooperation to ensure mutual recognition of acquired social rights such as sickness pay and pensions."
"Senior citizens often have entitlements of this kind and we are in a position to exercise considerable influence here, given that there are major shortcomings in the system when people move from one country to another."
"It is all very well to encourage public awareness, to hold conferences on issues affecting senior citizens and to run campaigns focusing on their concerns. When it comes to legislation and its implementation, however, action must be taken nationally, regionally and locally."
"Thank you, Mr Lindqvist."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall now give the floor to Mrs Ilivitzky, who will speak on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left for a maximum of six minutes."
"Mrs Ilivitzky has replaced Mrs Ojala, and this will be the first time she has spoken in the House."
"Let me therefore welcome her here on behalf of you all."
"Tervetuloa rouva Ilivitzky ."
"Mr President, thank you for welcoming me in Finnish."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is indeed the first speech I have made in Parliament, and I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on such an important matter."
"The extent and seriousness of the problems facing older people have up till now been paid too little attention in the European Union."
"Our rapporteur, Hugh McMahon, and Edgar Schiedermeier have worked hard, not only in producing this report, but also in organising a conference on the elderly, the outcome of which forms the main basis for this report."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their success in taking all the essential aspects of this matter into account: the status of older people on the labour market, their special training needs, and questions of income and services."
"In addition, I think their basic position is the right one."
"Senior citizens are to be seen as a resource that society should exploit more and not as a problem we have to solve at minimum expense."
"As the average age of the European labour force rises all the time, it is vital that people should be able to work until they are of pensionable age."
"This will require changes at work both in attitudes and in the organisation of work."
"Work must adapt to people's skills and abilities, rather than insisting that people adapt to the demands of work."
"Older people have much of the sort of knowledge and skill which could be put to better use, as long as they are willing to participate."
"However, it is more difficult for them than it is for young people to adapt to a very fast pace of working."
"In many workplaces problems have been caused by pressure, when an attempt is made to achieve the same results with a reduced workforce of lower-paid employees."
"In my opinion, the public sector should set an example to employers and be capable of thinking in the longer term."
"It is of no benefit to society if older workers are forced into early retirement, when they might still be able to work if conditions were more suitable."
"One of the greatest problems older people have on the labour market is their poor level of training."
"In all European countries those over the age of 45 have clearly received poorer levels of training than those below that age."
"The difference in my country, Finland, is the greatest among all the OECD countries."
"Unless older workers can be trained up for new jobs, we face the threat of age discrimination on the labour market while many sectors are suffering from labour shortages."
"Training for older people has to be tailored to their needs."
"It has to take account of their poor basic levels of training, which in turn often give rise to poor motivation when it comes to training."
"For that reason, training must be closely linked with practical work."
"Ageing, as with many human phenomena, affects men and women in different ways: it is by no means a gender-neutral phenomenon."
"I am very pleased that the rapporteur took account of the special problems of older women."
"Age discrimination on the labour market affects women quite a lot earlier than it does men."
"A woman of 40 is often too old, in the opinion of the employer."
"The financial inequality that exists between men and women becomes even more noticeable when the age of retirement is reached."
"In all countries women's pensions are substantially smaller than men's."
"This is a result of both women's lower rates of pay, which thus cause them to suffer doubly, and the fact that women's careers are often short and fragmented as a result of family care obligations."
"For this reason, it is very important for women that all people of pensionable age be guaranteed an adequate basic pension, supplemented by an employer's pension scheme."
"Although retirement schemes naturally differ from country to country, I believe there should be a statutory minimum income at Union level, which Member States should guarantee citizens who are unable to work or for whom there is no work available."
"Numerous voluntary organisations have proposed that, next time the Treaty is revised, it should incorporate a list of citizens' basic rights, including their right to a basic income."
"Thank you for allowing me to speak here, and I can see that you have listened very attentively to me."
"I would like to thank you all for that too!"
"Mr President, the title of this report sounds very promising, but I think the biggest setback for senior citizens at the moment - and I count myself as one of them - has been the resignation of the Commission, which has meant that Commissioner Monti's plans for a directive to liberalise the European market in pension funds has had to be shelved for the time being."
"Much as I admire the rapporteurs, in my view the report focuses too much on the idea of a dependent older generation, which I find a rather patronising attitude. I know people in their 80s and 90s who have lived through two world wars and are still completely independent."
"Of course I also realise that there is a category of older people who are more needy, but they are a national responsibility."
"The rapporteurs refer three times in their report to discrimination against older women."
"This is rather too much, and is undoubtedly the result of pressure from Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, as well as being a bit of a nod in the direction of the substantial numbers of women voters."
"I am a senior citizen, an older woman, and there are many like me who do not need patronising."
"We want to be free to take our pensions with us to other countries, and we want no age discrimination."
"We also want to be protected against tax disadvantages if we continue to work after our pension has started, both in our own countries and in all the Member States of the Union."
"The report also fails to consider the potential wealth of knowledge that those over 65 possess and the trend on the labour market to keep more and more people in this category involved in the employment process. In some countries, the underlying aim is for these people to continue to pay contributions so that there is enough money to pay pensions to the growing numbers of older people."
"Seventy-five million people over the age of 60 do not just want a sense of belonging to society, they also particularly want realistic legislation within the EU single market."
"I am not saying that this report is pointless, but it concentrates too much on the welfare side and certainly does not live up to the title of 'Senior citizens in the 21st century: a new lease of life'."
"That aspect is not covered at all."
"Mr President, we have heard how the segment of society comprising senior citizens is growing fast in the EU and in Europe as a whole."
"Seventy-five million people alive today are 60 years old or more, and that is one fifth of the total population."
"In the year 2000, over 20 million people will be in their eighties."
"That truly is a demographic revolution."
"This report is therefore very timely and I would congratulate the two rapporteurs."
"I also very much appreciated the conference held in Brussels in October and entitled 'Senior citizens in the 21st century - a new lease of life'."
"I personally found this one of the most rewarding events I have attended during my time as a Member of the European Parliament."
"Some very exciting issues were raised. And - as one who has crossed the threshold into her fifties - it gave me fresh hope to meet all those stimulating and inspired older people."
"My guests from Sweden were also full of praise for the conference."
"From my point of view, the most important elements in this text are contained in recitals D and E. Here the point is made that, just because a person has reached pensionable age, he or she does not have to stop leading an active life."
"On the contrary, many people take on new commitments and projects after retirement, not to mention all those who only manage to fulfil their working dreams after they stop work proper."
"We need to review our traditional attitudes towards senior citizens and rethink the roles we expect them to play in society."
"This applies particularly to the world of work."
"Paragraph 7 contains a series of ideas as to how our vision of the labour market and senior citizens can be rendered more flexible and up to date. There is a reference to promoting innovative forms of transition between work and retirement, for example a whole new model of part-time working for older persons."
"The notion of a flexible retirement age is fundamental."
"Senior citizens organisations in Sweden have been calling for this, as has my own party, the Greens."
"Many people simply cannot carry on working until they are 65, whilst others can continue until they are 70 or more, and are happy to do so."
"What is required, therefore, is a flexible retirement age and a new attitude towards older people."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, both rapporteurs are of course right to emphasise the importance of a policy for senior citizens in Europe, especially in view of the development of the population pyramid."
"They address economic and social issues in their report and, in particular, the problem of access to the labour market."
"I believe that this particular issue could remain in the realms of wishful thinking: present growth rates will continue and the already high level of unemployment - which affects the younger generations in particular - will persist in the future."
"We would therefore require economic conditions that are very different from those that exist today to enable older people to have access to the labour market, in addition to abolishing discriminatory legislation in this respect."
"Paragraph 28, in particular, stresses the need to project a better image of the elderly in our society. In this connection, I must say that we have regressed somewhat in comparison with ancient societies."
"Ancient Greece, to which we owe the best part of our civilisation, rightly valued the experience and wisdom of the elderly. We therefore have to tackle a genuine ideology of underestimating the value of the past."
"This ideology of underestimating the value of the past and thus the value of older people too, basically dates back to the Romanticism of the last century, and it is a cultural obstacle that we will have to overcome."
"Nowadays, we think that everything new is therefore better."
"This is of course perfectly true in terms of science and technology, where knowledge is cumulative."
"But it is not necessarily the case with regard to ethics, aesthetics, human beings, in general terms, and institutions."
"In the past, Solon, the great Greek lawmaker, who did not hesitate to innovate in his field either, always used to say: 'A man when he grows old may learn many things - for he can no more learn much than he can run much; youth is the time for extraordinary toil'."
"Finally, it is unfortunate that the report makes no reference to the demographic aspects, despite the fact that the rapporteurs discuss this right at the start of their report. Nothing will be possible, particularly on a financial level, if we do not correct the population pyramid in Europe, which reveals a real tragedy."
"If we look at this pyramid and our low birth rate we can see that there are more deaths than births."
"If we want to guarantee pensions, it is particularly vital to implement a broad family policy, which is not an issue here. I would possibly go so far as to say that we should adopt a pro-birth policy, even if this term is looked down on nowadays."
"Therefore, and in spite of all these omissions, I support the analyses carried out by our two rapporteurs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Staudinger, one of our mayors from Upper Austria, once made a remark to the effect that senior citizens are an important political factor with a bright future."
"I believe that sums up this issue very neatly."
"One in four of the European population is directly involved, and it is our concern to focus on the self-esteem of this section of the population, so that they can assume their role and their responsibility in society as we would wish them to do."
"When it comes to the working world, I believe we must ensure that we find models of best practice, that we ask ourselves how we can help to integrate older people into the labour force and help them to feel comfortable in their working environment."
"There are many models in Europe that are worth considering. We also favour flexible working hours to take account of the needs of older employees in particular."
"We in Parliament have been staunch advocates of the European Bus and have expressed the view that getting on and off public transport must be made easier, or indeed possible, for elderly people."
"Too little attention is paid to that, and we shall press hard for this demand from Parliament to be met."
"One of our aims in the field of research policy is to ensure that increased biotechnological research is conducted with a view to improving the health of all people, including the very elderly."
"The European Parliament has managed to ensure that an extra billion euros will henceforth be earmarked for research."
"I believe that is something to be proud of, something that will benefit our older citizens too."
"Mr President, I am speaking here from a unique position as the only Member of this House who was born before the First World War and who, moreover, was elected to this Parliament long after reaching pensionable age; since then I have enjoyed 20 wonderful years of life and work here."
"Applause"
"It is from that perspective that I should like to say just a few words. There can be no doubt that far too little is said in our countries about the problem of older people and that there is sometimes an excessively strong inclination to indulge in a certain glorification of youth."
"That is certainly warranted as a means of helping younger people to break through into public life."
"But we build and maintain structures that make it well-nigh impossible for youth to have its head. The electoral system in our democracies is organised in such a way that young people find it extremely difficult to assert themselves."
"If there were a system whereby we really voted for candidates in small constituencies rather than parties - and such a system, I regret to say, has even been abandoned in Britain now - young people, and old people too, could assert themselves."
"That would be real democracy."
"What is being established today is not genuine democracy but rather a 'partiocracy', in which party officials, through their power of selection, effectively have the right to decide where democracy begins and ends."
"In this connection, I should like to point out that one of our key demands is that the elderly should finally be given the greater freedom to which they have long aspired."
"In the economic sector we are always talking about the free market, and rightly so."
"But for the elderly there is no such thing."
"Although people's pension rights are recognised when they reach retirement age, at which point they are 'brought down a peg' in terms of social status, there is no recognition of the other rights they have acquired at earlier points in their lives."
"Surely people cannot be compelled to consent to the loss of these rights in order to avoid having to give up what they want to do."
"There happen to be elderly people who are very glad that they can go on working."
"In such cases we hear talk of keeping young people out of a job."
"That is not true."
"In my opinion there is only one country where this has been properly understood, namely Switzerland, strange as it may seem."
"In Switzerland, in the Swiss Parliament for example, there are many pensioners who bring the benefits of a lifetime of experience to their work."
"That is something on which we should insist, namely genuine freedom of choice for the elderly."
"Such freedom of choice would also help us to achieve some degree of control over the demographic pyramid to which some speakers have rightly referred, for the pyramid needs a broader base, and the breadth of that base is also restricted in our part of the world."
"The main thing is to safeguard the freedom of the elderly."
"Applause"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a child born today will have an average life expectancy of 100 years or more."
"While it was still commonplace a hundred years ago for people to die at the age of 40, we are now averaging a life span of 80 years."
"A child born today is likely to reach 100 or more."
"One of the dreams of mankind has thus been fulfilled."
"We can live a second life, as people have always wanted to do, and it fills me with anger and rage when I read or hear talk of the ageing or indeed the senilisation of Europe."
"To the honourable lady from the Green Group, may I say that you have cut me to the quick."
"You used that very word, or at least that is how it was translated."
"When it comes to people who grow old because God has given them the genes to do so, let us please beware of speaking in terms of the onset of European senility."
"And there is something else that angers me."
"There is such a thing as human rights, of which this House is a vigorous advocate."
"So how do we reconcile that stance with a situation in which people at the age of 60 or 65, and sometimes even 55, are forced to give up their occupations, to stop working."
"Work is a very, very important aspect of human existence."
"There will undoubtedly be people who are weary of their work or who have performed demanding and strenuous work over the years and want to retire, but surely the law cannot say to a person 'Thou shalt not work' merely because he or she has reached the age of 60, 65 and sometimes only 55."
"I see that as a violation of human rights, and Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam will be a good basis for the discussion of this issue."
"I very much regret that Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon have to leave us."
"Had they produced their report sooner, they would most probably have made it impossible for their parties to force them out."
"Applause"
"My party and Austria are very progressive."
"I have been selected to stand again for election to this Parliament because I am an old woman, because I am in my 66th year, and I look forward to being granted the privilege of spending the next few years here."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Parliament adopted the resolution"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Schiedermeier and Mr McMahon - or Mr McMahon and Mr Schiedermeier - on their excellent work, not only on this report but throughout this parliamentary term."
"We did not vote in favour of this report."
"We see no need to develop a common policy for senior citizens at EU level."
"Such issues should be dealt with primarily at national and regional level."
"The report's coordination proposals go much too far for our liking on several counts."
"However, we do believe that the EU has an important role to play in making it possible for pensions to be transferred and recognised across national borders."
"Starch"
"The next item is the oral question with debate (B4-0155/99) by Mr Colino Salamanca and Mr Garot, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Commission, on vegetable protein supplies and the situation in the European starch industry."
"Mr President, Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development intends to refer to the Commission the matter of the European Union's deficit in vegetable proteins added to animal feedingstuffs and what is at stake strategically for biotechnologies in the European Union as a result of this situation."
"Several of my colleagues are due to take the floor after me this morning and will clarify the subject."
"I must point out right away that it is estimated that the European Union fails to provide around 70 % of its internal consumption of these proteins. This therefore means that we are very dependent on US imports."
"I would remind you that this situation is the result of the concession made to the United States when the Treaty of Rome was signed on duty-free soya imports into the Community."
"The situation has deteriorated with the Blair House agreement, which sets a quota for the production of oleaginous protein crops in Europe, and it could become even worse during the 2000-2006 period."
"On the one hand, the provisions of Agenda 2000 will probably lead farmers to reduce their production of oleaginous protein crops in favour of cereals unless, of course, wise steps are taken to promote crops in the non-food agricultural production sector. On the other hand, production capacities for amino acids, particularly synthetic lysine, are decreasing in Europe."
"In fact, we should be aware that European manufacturers are increasingly choosing to invest in the United States."
"I should like to emphasise this point, because the synthetic lysine produced in Europe is important in that it enables us to use the maximum amount of cereals in feedingstuffs, whilst working towards reducing our own protein deficit."
"However, we have to recognise in this connection that the redistribution of the cards between Europe and the United States with regard to lysine production is a matter of concern."
"For example, the cover rate of the US market has increased from 0 % to about 165 %, whereas the cover rate of the European lysine market decreased from 84 % in 1991 to 54 % in 1997, and is predicted to fall to around 38 % in 2002 if present trends continue."
"However, since it is likely that the maize used for starch production will continue to be sold in the United States at a lower price than that of Community cereals, it seems logical not only to preserve the present system of refunds which compensates for the disadvantage in relation to the United States, but to greatly reinforce the system."
"That is why the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like the Commission to answer the following questions. How will the European Union reduce its dependence on protein imports and use the agricultural potential available in the 15 Member States?"
"How will the present level of refunds be adjusted to take account of the use of cereal derivatives and the relaunch of intra-Community lysine production? How does the Commission intend to promote on a more global level the expansion of the starch and biotechnology industries that could open up agriculture to new markets?"
"The answers to these questions are of particular importance for us at the moment since the WTO negotiations are soon to begin."
"Mr President, the Commission maintains an active policy to reduce the Community's dependence on imports of vegetable proteins and to increase the use of grain in cattle fodder."
"The Community agricultural policy reform, begun in 1992, has led to a substantial annual increase in the consumption of grain in cattle fodder of around 20 million tonnes and a significant reduction in the importation of cattle fodder and, in particular, vegetable proteins."
"In Agenda 2000 the Commission proposed to extend the 1992 reform for the specific purpose of boosting Europe's agricultural competitiveness both in the single market and in external markets."
"The 15 % drop in the price of grain and the additional direct aid for protein crops should do much to achieve this aim."
"The Commission has always been keen to ensure that the starch and starch-processing industries in Europe, and especially the biotechnology sector that uses starch and its derivatives as raw materials, remain competitive."
"Generally speaking, starch-based industries have maintained a healthy position and have developed steadily."
"Protection from imports is assured with the application of appropriate customs duties."
"Exports, meanwhile, are enhanced by means of export subsidies, which make it possible to export a diverse range of products in their original state, or sometimes as highly processed starch products."
"Within the Community, sales of starch and its derivatives are promoted by means of production subsidies when such products are used in the sectors of industry which have no protection from imports, such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industry and the paper industry."
"These systems of aid mean that a significant and constantly increasing volume of products emanating from the starch industry and the starch processing industry reach markets in countries outside the Community as well."
"With the Agenda 2000 programme, the Commission will continue to use tools to control these markets as long as there remains a significant difference between the global market price and that prevailing in the Union's single market."
"These measures should guarantee that industries that use starch, and the biotechnology sector in particular, will remain competitive in the global markets."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"Before we continue with the debate, I would inform the House that I have received five motions for resolutions to wind up the debate, tabled pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ink has scarcely dried on the documents recording the results of the Agenda 2000 discussions in Berlin, and already we have to start examining the impact of this Agenda 2000 on all areas of activity."
"I believe that the examination of the impact on this industry, occupying what might still be called a small niche in the market, is rather important, which is why we owe a debt of gratitude to Mr Garot for putting his finger on the wound straight away and calling on the Commission to take the lead and do something positive."
"The Commissioner has just spoken of deepening and strengthening."
"The nature of his address, though complimentary in tone, was that of a declamatory statement of intent."
"We naturally want more than verbal declarations of deepening commitment; we also want assistance on a massive scale, which is why it is gratifying that the Commissioner responsible for financial policy is sitting in our midst."
"This massive assistance, of course, must include financial resources; however, the Socialists in the European Parliament do not place all their trust in public funding, but naturally rely on the free and socially controlled market too."
"That is why it is necessary that this market niche, this environmentally acceptable niche, should be established at long last as another supporting leg, as an additional source of income, for the agricultural sector."
"This additional supporting leg also has the merit of not entailing any further surplus production, but actually creates a means of promoting our market policies by replacing surplus production with alternative crops which may also serve as a substitute for mineral oil, for example."
"What we want to do in the European Union is to take this product out of its niche as a set-aside option, to increase production and to place starch on an even footing with other agricultural products."
"But since we are part of a world market, we also have an interest in ensuring that, at the WTO negotiations which are due to begin in Seattle on 30 November, barriers to free trade are properly removed and that the European Union obtains the same sort of level playing field on which to operate in this market as it does in the other major markets."
"That demands a great deal of work, Commissioner."
"Not only do we need money; we need decisive action too."
"I know that our tasks at the WTO negotiations have been made far more complex and numerous by the results of the agricultural talks at the Berlin summit, some of which were far from satisfactory, but I assume that the Commission and the other representatives of the European Union are capable of robust defence of our interests in this area as well."
"Mr President, this oral question deals with the links between a number of important EU agricultural products, the high-tech sector that uses them and the supply of vegetable protein fodder."
"The Blair House agreement also covered protein-rich fodder in the form of processed oilseed extract, and was so restrictive that it held back the further development of the oilseed crop sector in the EU."
"In Agenda 2000, the Commission tried to overcome this problem by giving oilseed the same hectare premium as grain, a decision confirmed at the Berlin summit."
"This meant that the premiums have been decoupled for an entire group of agricultural crops: grain and oilseed."
"I would like to ask the Commission whether we can now tell the United States - entirely in keeping with our current method of transatlantic communication on agricultural matters - that this aid has now been decoupled just as it has in the US, and that therefore the one million tonne oilseed extract restriction no longer applies."
"I am assuming that we do not need to wait for a full WTO millennium round agreement to regulate this."
"However, will the cure not be worse than the disease for the future of the EU oilseed sector, and will the lower hectare premium not prove a strong disincentive to grow oilseed?"
"Now that the Berlin summit has confirmed that a non-food agricultural policy is to be pursued more energetically in future, does the Commission plan to do more to promote the use of biodiesel and biolubricants?"
"Next there is the issue of the relative price of cereals in the EU compared with the price on the world market."
"The EU starch industry is complaining that its products are becoming increasingly expensive in the EU compared with competitors who obtain their supplies of cereals on the world market."
"Will the industry's position be helped by a further 15 % reduction in the price of cereals?"
"When it proposed this price reduction, the Commission claimed that it would improve the EU's competitive position, and this should also, and perhaps in particular, apply to the starch sector."
"Or will the sector simply have to learn to live with a price difference between cereals on the world market and in the EU because the EU currently has a shortage?"
"In any event, the EU's starch consumers are calling for an incentive to be given to secure the use of EU starch in future."
"On the subject of the price of cereals on the world market, I would like to ask the Commission whether prices for this product do not tend to be forced up by the application of marketing payments as in the United States."
"In the European Union's recent study of US agricultural support policy, very little was said about this, whereas the current American farm bill has used marketing payments for almost all agricultural products as a very efficient way of increasing competitiveness."
"Are we not overlooking a very important support instrument here?"
"I would also just like to mention the balance between potato starch and cereal starch."
"I assume that the agreement reached in Berlin on this is being ratified, and I would like to ask the Commission whether the implementing regulation has been drawn up, because I think it is extremely important for the existing balance between the potato starch and cereal starch regimes to continue by maintaining the existing system of balancing premiums for the potato starch sector."
"Mr President, I should like to begin where Mr Sonneveld left off."
"My group too feels that is it particularly important for the balancing premium between potato starch and cereal starch to be maintained."
"It is vital that potato production should be maintained in various parts of Europe, and particularly in the north of the Netherlands, otherwise there would be a huge economic slump which would cost us even more money to resolve."
"So it certainly needs to be maintained."
"I would also like to express my support for the industrial use of agricultural products for non-food purposes."
"I am pleased that Commissioner Liikanen is here at the moment, because I would like to make a suggestion that will cost nothing at all, which I am sure he will be delighted to hear."
"What if we made it compulsory in certain ecologically sensitive areas, for example in Finnish waters, to use products that can be made from agricultural products, such as plastics that can be made from starch and biolubricants that can be made from protein-rich products in the south of Europe?"
"This would create an enormous new market for these products and we would probably need to spend less on subsidies."
"I admit that these products might be a little dearer than the conventional ones, but the environmental benefits are so great that I think the Commission should come up with some definite proposals to give these products greater access to the European market."
"I also wanted to ask something about the situation after Berlin."
"We all know that the Blair House agreement was not very advantageous for us."
"How confident is the Commission that the current proposals are compatible, in other words that we can grow as much as we want and the Blair House restriction no longer applies?"
"Or are we going to have another trade dispute with the US in the WTO?"
"I hope not, and I would like to hear what the Commission has to say on this point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the development of the European chemical industry that uses carbohydrates derived from agriculture - particularly starch - has been taking place for a few years against the background of a particularly difficult economic situation."
"The origins of this delicate situation lie in the significant differences between the European Union and the world market in terms of the conditions of supply of agricultural raw materials."
"However, along with the starch industry in particular, the industry's use of non-food agricultural products in the cereals balance is very significant. Moreover, the industry is one of the cornerstones of the future development of biotechnology industries."
"Admittedly, compensation in the form of a production refund was introduced in 1986 - as Commissioner Liikanen mentioned earlier - in order to remedy the situation. However, when this system is applied, it unfortunately only partially compensates for the disadvantage, thereby weakening the position of European industry not only on the world market, but on our own market as well."
"The disparities in glucose production costs for industry between the US and the European Union can frequently amount to between 30 % and 100 % of the cost price. It is impossible to overcome this through technological advances or greater productivity, particularly since the majority of European manufacturers are also at a disadvantage because of their size."
"This situation raises the burning issue of European industry's durability."
"In the last few years, several production units have closed their doors in Germany and Italy."
"In order to respond to greater demand, capacity is currently increasing but mainly outside the European Union, whether it be in the United States or in the newly industrialised countries, such as China, India or Brazil."
"The European market is increasingly supplied from industrial areas outside the European Union."
"You only have to look at Eurostat's statistics to see this."
"The depreciation of world prices means that the European Union can no longer maintain its trading position on the world market."
"These converging trends demonstrate how unattractive Europe is. The main cause of this is the cost of starch raw materials and this comes on top of the other disadvantages affecting the industry, which I just mentioned."
"We must therefore make two demands at European level."
"The first is that the production refunds should be calculated on the basis of world maize prices, and not wheat prices, since the starch industry is based on the maize industry."
"Secondly, as our colleagues Mr Sonneveld and Mr Mulder just mentioned, we must also ensure that we maintain a certain balance between potato starch and the starch produced from cereals."
"Above all, we want the European Union to demonstrate an aggressive attitude at the international conferences in Vienna on the WTO."
"If we make some concessions to the Americans - as we now apparently should - particularly on the issue of wheat gluten, which is a sector where they are attacking us, and where we have not yet referred the matter to the WTO, we can harbour legitimate concerns."
"This battle must be won at the future WTO negotiations; it is essential for the future of our biotechnology industries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the recent conclusions on Agenda 2000, it is possible to think that the balance of the European budget always bends under the weight of excessive agricultural subsidies. These are linked, in particular, to the production of surpluses that have to be taken off the market, put into storage and processed."
"In short, agriculture and its surpluses are to blame for all evils."
"Yet when we analyse Eurostat's statistical data and the annual situation of European agriculture, we see that - contrary to all expectations - the European Union is not self-sufficient with regard to certain types of agricultural products."
"This is the case for sheepmeat, which is the only resource of many dry regions in the south of Europe."
"We only provide 80 % of our consumption requirements."
"We are still short of tobacco, wood, non-processed citrus fruits and certain types of fruit and vegetables."
"But most importantly, as a recent study by the Directorate-General for Research revealed, we only produce 30 % of the protein-rich products required to produce feedingstuffs, mainly for pigs and poultry."
"Imagine what will happen if there is an American embargo, like the once we witnessed in 1973."
"This would prove to be catastrophic for the European Union within a few weeks."
"Cereal stocks would continue to provide energy feedingstuffs, but we would soon have a shortage of vegetable proteins, which have been essential since the BSE crisis."
"Yet at the same time, the starch industry, which is the basis for the production of numerous industrial compounds, including amino acids such as lysine, is being penalised by overly high prices in Europe for these raw materials."
"It is now time for the Commission to go beyond making speeches and to deal specifically with these issues."
"For a start, we must maintain and improve the current system of refunds for the use of cereal derivatives."
"But we must also implement a genuine policy on non-food agricultural production in order to produce the raw materials required for the organic compound and biofuel industries, particularly by promoting the use of set-aside land."
"Moreover, we simply need to make use of the possibilities that exist in the regulations on cereals and oleaginous protein products in order to make our livestock production sector self-sufficient in feedingstuffs once again."
"Furthermore, we strongly urge the Commission to include all aspects of the problem - which was very well presented by Mr Garot - in the preparatory work for the WTO negotiations. We do have some weapons we can use, provided that there is the political will to use them."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my sincere thanks to Mr Garot for taking this initiative and enabling us to deal with this resolution here and now."
"I believe this resolution has to address four problem areas and that each of them is actually very important in its own right."
"First of all there is the question of the competitiveness of the European starch industry, and then there are the Berlin decisions on oilseeds and protein plants, which as we now know are entirely inadequate and completely incapable of overcoming the prevailing deficit in these markets and therefore of little use to us in their present form."
"Thirdly, it is crucial that the Commission should pursue and develop a more active policy in the realm of non-food crops, because we have simply ground to a halt somewhere along the line."
"We have conducted a great many experiments."
"We have developed organic oils for use in protected water-collection areas, at places such as Lake Constance and other popular tourist destinations where the use of conventional mineral oils would cause severe pollution."
"But progress is not being made."
"The process of introducing these products into the market is stagnating."
"Our policies have been based on the principle of pushing forward a little and then retreating a little."
"That will have to change, otherwise nothing good will come of our efforts."
"Lastly, it is also about competition between grain and potato starch production, for they each have different production costs, which means that harmonisation is required."
"In short, Commissioner, the issue is this: instead of financing surpluses, we must invest in markets that still operate efficiently."
"They provide a rough framework that cannot give us any cause for satisfaction."
"But of course it is ultimately the responsibility of Parliament and the Commission to develop that framework and above all to grasp the opportunities that these markets still offer, opportunities that are no longer available in the realm of mass production, where we have lost the initiative."
"We must look for our opportunities in areas where we can help the environment, and we are not doing nearly enough in that respect."
"That is why it is imperative to take this action."
"Mr President, I have just three comments to make on this debate."
"Firstly, there is no doubt that industries producing specific products, such as lysine, are confronted with increased imports, particularly from the United States where production capacity is expanding more rapidly."
"This situation, and the investments possibly made outside Europe, is not to be attributed to the common agricultural policy."
"The system of export and production refunds compensates for the difference in the price of the raw material on the world market and the EU market."
"Other factors, external to agriculture, are involved, such as labour and energy costs, regulations on the environment, the proximity of markets, and so on. Economy of scale can also bring comparative advantages, and this can be seen clearly in the United States, which has very large manufacturing units that are sometimes integrated into the starch industry."
"Further, several comments have implied that the level of aid is not sufficient."
"The Commission cannot allow levels that are insufficient."
"The present refund rate - effective since the Management Committee's decision yesterday - is ECU 60 per tonne, that is, approximately 30 % of the value of the raw material."
"This means that the difference between the world price and the Community price is compensated for."
"Finally, many general questions have been raised in connection with the common agricultural policy, as well as in connection with the WTO negotiations."
"I shall refer these questions to my colleagues, Mr Fischler and Mr Brittan, who will thus provide you with answers to them."
