"But to leave this objective in the report completely contradicts what we believe to be an ethical policy on arms."
"We feel that an ethical code of conduct on arms exports should not be dictated by the needs of the European defence industry."
". (NL) The sale of instruments which facilitate the killing of people can be very lucrative."
"Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September in America, the profit expectations of the arms industry have risen."
"The only possible justification for producing weapons is in self-defence against external enemies who aim to take over, suppress us or wipe us out."
"The production of arms as an economic activity, to make profit by means of exporting to regions where people want to buy those weapons, means that money is considered more important than human life."
"Against the wishes of Parliament, last year, the Council pressed ahead with lifting the arms embargo against Indonesia, despite the violence in East Timor, the Moluccas, Aceh and West Papua."
"Mr Titley' s proposal contains only a non-legislative reference, but includes a number of improvements on the current situation, such as the legal enforcement of the Code of Conduct for arms exports, and its application to candidate countries."
"He is right to request that permission from the Member States be required by European companies to transfer licences for the production of military equipment outside of European territory."
"I support him in his aims of a worldwide agreement, annual reports on the application of the Code of Conduct and a refusal to allow the supply of weapons to countries that do not provide information to the UN conventional weapons register."
"Langenhagen report (A5-0288/2001)"
"- (FR) The GALILEO Programme is being presented to us as enabling progress to be made in various fields (the management of land, air and sea transport, road traffic, the organisation of life-saving at sea) thanks to radio-navigation by satellite."
"We are told that GALILEO testifies to a desire to ensure the independence of Europe from the United States which, with its Global Positioning System (GPS), has launched a similar programme."
"In fact, what it really does is provide an enormous market for European businesses, in other words a new source of profits for their owners and shareholders."
"For it is they who will be the primary beneficiaries of GALILEO - indeed they already are - whether in the telecommunications sector, the transport sector or the space sector, since GALILEO involves the launching of a network of thirty satellites."
"Public funding amounting to almost EUR 2 billion has already been budgeted for and to some extent released by the European Union and the European Space Agency."
"As for private investors, they are reluctant to pay a single penny. Yet the European Union is not planning to call for their financial involvement until the final phase of the project, after it has been launched and guaranteed by public money."
"According to the reporter, however, the private investors who have been promised responsibility for managing GALILEO and therefore 'possible revenue flows from GALILEO services' , are unwilling to take any 'economic risk' ."
"They are waiting for a 'positive signal from the political side' of Europe. In other words they are waiting to be told that the political side will take on responsibility for all the costs, leaving the investors with nothing to do but collect the profits."
"Though the European authorities are revelling in the supposed virtues of private initiative, the capitalists, for their part, want paying with more than words."
"They want guaranteed profits, without any risk, and they know that they can count on both European and national authorities to give them what they want."
"We have therefore voted against this report."
"- (FR) I am pleased to be able to express my opinion of the GALILEO project at a time when the events of 11 September are forcing us to review our capacity to handle crises."
"Remember that the GALILEO project is intended to deploy a set of satellites orbiting about 20 000 km above the Earth."
"All those satellites would be linked to a network of control stations on the ground."
"Cover would thus be worldwide, making it possible to improve considerably the management of air, sea and road traffic and to support search and rescue operations."
"This technology already exists in the USA (the GPS system) and in Russia (the GLONASS system)."
"It is currently financed and controlled by the military authorities in those two countries."
"The quality and continuity of its use for civilian purposes are dependent on those authorities who may, at any time, discontinue or downgrade the signal."
"In Europe, on the other hand, the GALILEO programme will be managed and controlled by civilians."
"It is proposed that the system should be developed in four stages, namely a definition phase in 2000, a development and validation phase up to 2005, a deployment phase up to 2007 and an operational phase after that."
"Ideally then, the GALILEO system should be operational from 2008 onwards, thereby responding to the wishes expressed at the European Council in Stockholm and to the European Union' s urgent needs in this field. This, at any rate, is what emerges from the report by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"On the question of financing, it seems to me to be important to clear up the question of how this will be organised before coming to a final decision."
"I also deplore the fact that some Member States are reluctant to lend their support to this project."
"I therefore invite the Commission to take the necessary steps to break down this reluctance."
"It will then have the task of defining a general financing structure, and that will have to be done between now and 15 November 2001 if we want to be reasonably sure of meeting the 2008 deadline."
"The European Parliament will have to be consulted on the Commission' s draft."
"Once this draft has been approved, it should be possible to encourage the involvement of European industry in the financing of the later stages in the medium and long term."
"- (FR) First of all I should like to thank both our rapporteur from the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, Mrs Brigitte Langenhagen, and also the whole of that Committee, for the high-quality work that they have submitted to us and also for the fact that they have strongly emphasised both the advantages and the difficulties that could result from the implementation of the GALILEO satellite navigation programme."
"Let us remember, briefly, that the GALILEO satellite navigation programme is an ambitious project which provides for the deployment of an arrangement of satellites in orbit at a distance of about 20 000 km from the Earth, linked to a network of ground control stations."
"This definition shows us how important it is to vote in favour of this report, as I shall be doing."
"The implementation of the GALILEO project will enable us to have world coverage which can be used not only for controlling air, sea and road traffic but also for supporting search and rescue operations."
"However, although it is necessary, for the above-mentioned reasons, to vote in favour of the report, thereby allowing the EU to develop a system which the European Council in Stockholm considered was important enough to be launched 'without delay' , we should do so while bearing in mind those areas - highlighted in the report - which may prove to be problematical in future."
"It is, in fact, extremely important that we should remain vigilant regarding the possibility of such a system being used for military purposes."
"It is possible that the system might be misused, and it is up to us to be aware of this and to ensure that such a thing cannot happen."
"In addition, it should be noted that the immediate funding of such a project will not be without its problems."
"Member States, or at least some of them, are reluctant to lend their financial support to the implementation of GALILEO, and private investors do not seem to be particularly enthusiastic about the idea of participating in such a project either."
"In other words, before coming to a final decision, the budgetary authorities of the European Union need to have an accurate understanding of the financing involved, which means that the Commission will have to prepare proposals for the management structures for the GALILEO project."
"(Speech shortened under Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
". (PT) Our vote expresses the conviction that it is worthwhile having a European project that functions properly and is independent of military and defence activities, including that of third countries, which is not the case at present, given Europe' s dependence in this context on the United States of America."
"It is crucial, however, that the implementation of the project respects citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees, namely their privacy."
"Its creation may be an advantage for the mobile telecommunications services, which can use it for localisation applications requested by users if the financial cost does not render such use prohibitive."
"It is also necessary to take the cost of financing it into account, especially the share that may be demanded of countries that do not participate directly in its creation, in order not to hinder its implementation in the various Member States."
". (NL) GALILEO will not come into being until American competition has cornered the European market, which will be too late."
"Such a navigation system by satellite might have become part of a strategy to make Europe less reliant on the US."
"There are plenty of reasons for this."
"America is threatening us with increased global warming, again with an anti-missile shield dating from the 'Star Wars' period, with meat containing hormones, noisy aircraft, the ECHELON tapping system, a monopoly of patents and with a dollar which, as international currency, has for decades passed on the deficits of the American balance of payments to the outside world."
"At the moment, it is even threatening to drag us into a war against the third world. Restricted access of American products manufactured under poor working and environmental conditions to the European market might force America to pay more attention to labour, the environment, public health, animal torture, human rights and peace."
"Only in a confrontation of that kind could we possibly have a need for GALILEO."
"As long as such a confrontation is not forthcoming, the GALILEO project remains a contribution of the European taxpayer to industry in the field of electronics and space travel, and that industry is largely subject to military interests."
"It would be preferable to spend the money for GALILEO on environmental care and useful collective facilities."
"Rübig report (A5-0234/2001)"
"- (FR) Deploring the fact that the European Union is lagging behind the United States and Japan, the report proposes a series of measures claiming to encourage 'innovation promotion and progress in research' ."
"All the proposed measures are centred on the idea that it is the task of the public authorities to finance the research, directly or indirectly, but that it is private interests who will profit from it."
"This ranges from subsidies to what the report calls 'innovative enterprises' to measures to encourage 'synergy between businesses and universities' , which means that as far as research is concerned the latter will be subordinate to the former."
"In its explanatory statement, the report not only preaches the promotion of 'entrepreneurship at the educational level' but also says that 'obstacles to mobility arising from social security systems should be removed' ."
"The title of the report is 'Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy' ."
"It would be more accurate to talk about the subordination of knowledge, research and public money to the interests of the bosses in a profit-driven economy."
"Since we are opposed to both the spirit and the letter of this report, we have voted against it."
"- (FR) The reception given to this Commission Communication on 'Innovation in a knowledge-driven economy' has been largely positive."
"It sets out the European scoreboard for innovation, drawn up on the basis of statistics available at European level."
"An analysis shows that despite the efforts made by Member States to promote innovation, Europe' s performance is still trailing behind that of its main competitors."
"Yet innovation was one of the strategic priorities identified by the European Council in Lisbon in March 2000."
"Consequently, the Commission makes several recommendations to Member States with a view to improving their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises and support for innovation throughout the whole of the economic and social fabric."
"The Member States are invited to improve their policies on encouraging innovative enterprises, removing obstacles to initiatives and innovators, encouraging private investment in research and innovation, and improving the rules governing the use of the results obtained by publicly funded research."
"Naturally I support these proposals."
"I believe that the projects that are covered by this philosophy will be able to obtain funds as part of the Sixth FRDP."
"The rapporteur has identified three key sectors in which Community intervention and Member States' commitment are necessary. These are the creation of entrepreneurship at the educational level, the promotion of the training of workers, and the promotion of innovation among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)."
"He also emphasises the need to take into consideration the needs of the SMEs, since they represent 60 million undertakings and 60% of jobs in the European Union."
"Innovation cannot exist without the SMEs."
"I agree with him there, of course, but I have to admit that we have been hearing the same speeches for years, all about the essential role of the SMEs in the European economy and the need to remove the many obstacles to their development."
"Alas, little progress has been achieved."
"I took this into account when I drafted my report on the Sixth FRDP, and as far as possible I tried to guarantee the SMEs access to European research and development funding."
". Madam President, I warmly welcome my colleague Paul Rubig's report which promotes research and innovation and backs a Commission initiative to promote innovation."
"Time and again the EU has been criticised for failing to keep abreast of technological innovation and is sorely lagging behind its American counterparts in this field."
"The EU should do more to exploit its potential to innovate in this field and this was recognised, as the report outlines, in the Lisbon, so-called, dot.com Summit."
"European Member States need to collude and pool their separate specialisms and create a system of 'benchmarking'."
"To supplement these measures the report rightly calls for more high quality education."
"This will do much to boost the EU's Lisbon Strategy."
"Lastly, these innovations cannot progress unless there is a loosening of bureaucratic regulations."
"If we decrease the amount of red tape which currently hinders European innovation, then we will go some way in becoming more able to compete with America."
"This will promote more start-ups and new ventures."
"Mayer report (A5-0311/2001)"
"- (FR) Yesterday evening, at the end of the debate, and quoting various studies in support of his argument, Commissioner Balkestein clearly contradicted those who claim that prices have risen since the introduction of the Community exhaustion system."
"On the contrary, he maintained, prices have even fallen in some cases."
"Those who claim to defend consumers are in fact protecting parallel import circuits which threaten quality, innovation and employment and encourage counterfeiting."
"Hence the three amendments which I tabled, and which seem to be worrying the rapporteur."
"In effect, the PPE-DE called for a roll-call vote on all our amendments so as to ensure, right to the end, the control of its members and the commitment of certain coordinators."
"I am afraid that, yet again, pressure and bargaining will carry the day and that a bad decision will be taken."
"In order to avoid any useless multiplication of the costs represented by these requests for roll-call votes, we withdraw our first two amendments and retain only Amendment No 3, which we believe is enough to demonstrate the sad reality of the situation."
"That the international exhaustion of rights conferred by trade marks has been an energetically discussed topic in recent months, is shown by this report, which has dragged on for months and has been thoroughly revised, as is clear from a comparison with the first draft report."
"The exhaustion of trade mark rights affects all branded products."
"As President of the Wine Intergroup, I would like to concentrate on the consequences for this sector."
"The international exhaustion of trade mark rights will be of no advantage to the consumer in the European Union as regards food and drink, as is confirmed by the study produced by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) at the Commission's request."
"European consumers could indeed be put at a disadvantage in the longer term by our industries' losing the opportunity to develop new products and to offer the consumer new services."
"Should yields decrease decisively through parallel imports from third countries, there will also be a decline in motivation to invest in new markets."
"In the event of the international trade mark rights becoming exhausted, complex distribution networks will come into being and it will become more difficult to put a stop to trade mark piracy."
"There is no doubt that disadvantages will result for the consumer and for the manufacturer of branded goods, for example with regard to consumer health protection."
"I am therefore speaking out against the international exhaustion of trade mark rights."
"However, in view of events since the report was drafted, I will not be voting against it."
"Joint resolution on racism (RC B5-0605/2001)"
". The UK Conservatives voted against this motion for resolution since it repeats the errors of the Durban conference."
"We cannot support the undue emphasis on the Middle East, and are not convinced that it might not have been better had the conference failed to reach a conclusion."
"In many respects, the Durban conference belongs to an age that came to an end on 11 September."
"There are three reasons underlying any racist behaviour: firstly, ignorance about the other person, which may lead to fear and thus rejection; secondly, the bad faith and arrogance of those who want to feel superior, maybe subconsciously prompted by an inferiority complex; and thirdly, the political, economic or religious ambition of those who want to acquire as much power as they can by dominating other people."
"Therefore, while it is clear that large-scale, incisive cultural measures need to be taken to teach all people respect for others and acceptance, it is equally clear that civil society must use every tool available to it to fight those political, cultural, economic and religious systems which breed and are based on racism."
"Respect for diversities must include, however, constant, enlightened action on the part of civil society so that the objective of respect for human rights and dignity is achieved throughout the world."
"Therefore, the behaviour of those civilised Western - and other - cultures which are fighting against religious or ritualistic practices, for example, which physically or psychologically damage a person, cannot be considered to be racist."
"In being subjected to these practices, women continue to be treated not as human beings entitled to exercise all rights but as objects subject to customs which prevent or limit their participation in society and politics."
"The entire history of mankind has, I am sad to say, been marked by collective and individual racist behaviour."
"In condemning the racism of the past, the political world must avoid falling into the trap of fresh racist behaviour now."
"Indeed, we cannot disregard the fact that there is a form of political racism currently in existence: the racism indulged in by those who condemn the ideas of others merely because they are the expression of a different political hue."
"That is why we call upon Parliament, the Commission and the Council to take much more effective action both within and outside the Community than they have done thus far, to promote a culture of mutual respect among people and governments, which, if it is to be genuine, must not tolerate attitudes, ideas or behaviour which fail to respect human dignity, whether they are based on religious, cultural, economic or political ideals."
"For these reasons, I voted for the resolution."
"- (FR) The MPF Members abstained from the vote on the resolution on the Durban Conference as a sign of their very strong disapproval of the highly ambiguous conduct observed in this House by European Union representatives."
"In fact, here we have a conference convened under the aegis of the United Nations allowing itself to be overrun and exploited by a grouping of Islamist NGOs, with the active or benevolent complicity of a significant number of states, mainly in the Arab-Muslim world, some of which are usually described as 'moderates', a conference that goes so far as to suggest an untenable equation of Zionism with racism, while our representatives go on sitting there as though nothing had happened."
"In face of the attitude of the United States and Israel, whose departure from the conference was a sign that the threshold of the unacceptable had been crossed, the European Union, by remaining, and however much it denies this today, ran the risk of appearing to support these shameful equations and intolerable excesses that the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut summarised as follows: 'In Durban, anti-racism has taken over anti-Semitism and the denial of humanity'."
"The Europeans should have left for the sake of their honour and dignity, which would have sent out a strong and salutary signal to the UN and its General Secretariat and encouraged them to take a firm stance in face of the attempt by Islamism to impose its ideological influence, and genuinely to represent the interests and values of the international community."
"Any show of complaisance towards the kind of equations proposed in Durban can indeed be interpreted as a sign of weakness on our part and of encouragement towards those who have set themselves the objective of destroying our values."
". I voted against the resolution in relation to the World Conference against Racism in Durban to make it clear that this conference has done the gravest possible disservice to the promotion of good race relations."
"The conference was hijacked by those whose sole objective was to attack the state of Israel and to ignore the fact that it is the one nation in the Middle East based on democracy."
"Israel was singled out by countries and organisations which have an appalling record on human rights."
"Even worse the language and the tone of the attacks had more in common with 'Der Stürmer' in the Germany of Adolf Hitler."
"And yet despite this no condemnation of the United Nations or the conference for allowing this to happen."
"The United States made it clear that it would take no part in these proceedings."
"The European Union should have taken a similar view."
"That it failed to do so was a sad reflection on its failure to learn the lessons of history."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.39 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to say what a pleasure it is for the presidency to welcome the delegation from the Moroccan Parliament to this House. This delegation is led by Mr Brahim Rachidi, who is visiting us for the ninth time."
"In welcoming Mr Rachidi and the members of his delegation, I would like to highlight the importance we attach to such meetings. They provide an opportunity for both Parliaments to reaffirm their common commitment to the fundamental principles of democracy."
"As you are aware ladies and gentlemen, Morocco has joined with us in condemning the recent criminal attacks on the United States. In addition, Morocco has expressed its solidarity with the United States and all freedom-loving countries in no uncertain terms."
"Along with its southern Mediterranean neighbours, the European Union is intent on playing its part in the building of a stable, strong and democratic region within the framework of the Barcelona process. This process is essential to the future of Europe and of its nearest and dearest neighbours."
"I should like to emphasise, Mr Vice-President of the Moroccan Parliament, that we shall maintain our commitment to these common values throughout. We shall also maintain our strong opposition to any attempt to identify terrorism with the Arab-Muslim world."
"In this connection, we have committed ourselves to act resolutely and nip in the bud any consequences for nationalism, racism or xenophobia."
"Mr Vice-President, it is my earnest hope that the conversations you are to have with the members of the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Maghreb and with other colleagues will serve to strengthen existing links between European Union countries and the Kingdom of Morocco. I hope too that these contacts will help us to continue making progress in our common quest for peace and prosperity for all countries bordering the Mediterranean."
"(Applause)"
"Growth and Stability Pact - Informal ECOFIN of 22/23 September in Liege"
"The next item is statements by the Council and the Commission on the Growth and Stability Pact, and also on the informal meeting of ECOFIN ministers in Liege on 22 and 23 September."
"I shall give the floor first to Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, who will speak on behalf of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too have great pleasure in welcoming a delegation from the Moroccan Parliament to the gallery."
"It so happened that my duties had taken me to Casablanca when the tragic events of 11 September took place. I was leading a Belgian economic mission to Morocco."
"I was at lunch with ten members of the Moroccan government, including the Prime Minister of Morocco, and we heard the tragic news together."
"Together we shared the distress caused by these horrific events, and the subsequent reactions you are aware of. I too would therefore like to welcome the delegation which is here with us today."
"(NL) As far back as the introduction of the single currency, it was decided to bring about reinforced, economic coordination among the then eleven, and now twelve, Member States belonging to the eurozone."
"This coordination materialised via the Eurogroup which Belgium is chairing throughout this year and in which finance ministers of the Member States which have adopted the euro are represented, together with the European Commissioner responsible for economic and monetary matters, as well as the President of the European Central Bank."
"As you know, this reinforced coordination has an informal and structural dimension and does not prejudice the responsibilities assigned to the ECOFIN Council by the Treaties."
"For the first few years when the single currency came into being - and I am talking about 1999 and 2000 - the bulk of the activities were aimed at the development of, and familiarisation with, this reinforced economic coordination among the Member States taking part in the eurozone."
"Pursuant to, and with due respect to, the subsidiarity principle, this coordination faces the most important challenge of marrying the practice of economic authorities of each individual Member State involved, with the common monetary project to which these Member States have subscribed."
"It is the task of the European Central Bank to adopt an independent monetary policy, the key objective of which is to maintain price stability."
"The decentralisation of the economic policy and the centralisation of monetary decisions are, as it were, a basic contradiction in terms within the Economic and Monetary Union."
"The Eurogroup' s first task in this reinforced, economic coordination, is to outline the mainstays of the eurozone' s economic policy."
"In fact, the message which was formulated in Nice last year by the Heads of State and Government is very much along the same lines."
"In its conclusions, the European Council is delighted at both the improved operation of the Eurogroup and the reinforced coordination of the economic policy of the Member States in the eurozone."
"All efforts by the Belgian Presidency of the Eurogroup are channelled into reinforcing the role, the visibility and the credibility of the Eurogroup."
"In addition, the Belgian Presidency is also drafting a reference framework and the working method for the coming years, especially in connection with the coordination of the economic policy of the different Member States."
"The key instruments of a macro-economic policy, especially the monetary and budgetary policy, must be combined in an optimal policy mix, as it were, to achieve the pre-supposed objectives, such as promoting price stability and bolstering economic activity."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the interests of the Eurogroup it is important firstly to develop an effective and lasting budgetary policy for the entire area, and also specifically for each of the Member States."
"This must be done in line with national constraints and special considerations."
"This budgetary policy must dovetail with the monetary policy of the European Central Bank."
"However, it will not be easy to finalise the details of this type of budgetary policy for several reasons. Firstly, the results of any budgetary policy depend on the time scales established."
"For example, in the short term, pro-cyclical budgetary policies should not be used. In the medium term, the objectives of the Growth and Stability Pact to establish a balance or surplus of public finances should be maintained."
"In the long term, it will be essential to ensure the viability of public finances. This should take account of the different elements involved, including the difficult and important problem of the ageing of populations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, what I have just said clearly demonstrates the extent of the challenges before us. Do I really have to highlight just how difficulties with planning and methods, and the inevitable economic uncertainty, make it very difficult and complicated to define and implement budgetary policies?"
"We are confronted by statistical problems, the uncertainty surrounding economic forecasts, even in the short term, and the diversity of the many situations. There is also the fact that the effects of budgetary policies are only felt after a certain period of time."
"The long-term analysis of budgetary policy is also an essential part of structural policies. The strategy combines a number of approaches as regards the ageing of our populations."
"The strategy aims to step up the reduction of public debt. It also promotes the adoption of measures to increase employment levels."
"This involves the gradual elimination of obstacles to employment, particularly by reducing the fiscal burden on employment. Lastly, the strategy provides for the in-depth reform of pensions systems, in order to ensure their viability."
"The Belgian Presidency is seeking to examine public finances in greater depth on an ongoing and long-term basis. Particular attention will be paid to examining public finances in relation to the stability and convergence programme."
"Member States and the other interested parties agree on the long-term objectives and the instruments to be used."
"However, as regards the short and medium term, recent economic deterioration has created some confusion."
"Clearly, we need to hold an in-depth debate on this matter in order to define and establish a strong common position."
"We must hold such a debate during our presidency."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we must keep to the terms of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"Member States stated this commitment during the informal meeting of ECOFIN at Liège on 21 and 22 September."
"Therefore, there can be no question of Member States being faced with deficits in excess of the convergence criteria of 3%."
"The Extraordinary European Council of 21 September also reaffirmed its commitment to the framework, regulations and full implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"However, budgetary balances do not necessarily have to be set in stone."
"Instead of a purely nominal approach, there should be the ability to make adjustments in relation to changes in economic circumstances."
"The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001, adopted at Gothenburg last June, are very clear on this point."
"The principle is accepted without discussion in a favourable economic climate."
"Hence, better than expected economic growth inevitably leads to a greater improvement in nominal budgetary figures. For this reason also, a pro-cyclical budgetary policy, together with a decrease in spending which could lead to overheating, is not permitted."
"The question that now arises is to establish whether this allowance for cyclical variation can be implemented in a similar way in periods of poor growth or recession."
"The Belgian Presidency is convinced that this is indeed possible. The broad guidelines of economic policy for 2001 confirm our belief."
"In a less favourable economic climate, the balances already taken into consideration within the framework of the Pact, should also be adjusted in line with changed economic circumstances."
"Nominal balances can therefore be affected by worsening economic conditions. However, they can only fluctuate according to those same economic conditions."
"In these circumstances, a pro-cyclical policy should not be used."
"Consequently, a decrease in revenue should not be then compensated for by an equivalent reduction in spending."
"Cyclical adjustments must be reliable in order to assess the budgetary positions correctly."
"The agenda of the Belgian Presidency therefore allows some time for us to refine effective methods to calculate the disparity between production and potential growth."
"These methods should be used in future stability programmes."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, all these issues will doubtless lead to some long but interesting discussions at the next meeting of the euro area."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to offer a warm welcome to the Moroccan delegation with us today. I shall also endeavour to analyse two issues confronting us, namely the Growth and Stability Pact and the informal ECOFIN Council and shall attempt to report on both during my first speech."
"The Liege Council on 22 and 23 September 2001 focused on the economic impact of the terrorist attacks on the United States."
"I should like to refer to three aspects of this impact discussed at ECOFIN. Firstly, the economic situation."
"Secondly, the financing of terrorism."
"Thirdly, the problems airlines are experiencing with regard to insurance."
"I shall also comment on two other important matters raised at Liege, namely preparations for transition to the euro and issues related to globalisation."
"Concerning the first point, I should emphasise that the attacks on the United States have strengthened our conviction that international cooperation on financial and political issues is essential. Further, coordination of economic policies within the European Union must be strengthened."
"As from last year, the slowdown of economic activity in the United States and the rest of the world has been having a greater impact on the European Union than was originally anticipated."
"The tragic events in the United States have increased uncertainty and the negative risks for anticipated general growth."
"We cannot act as if nothing had happened, but at the same time it is very difficult to produce an accurate estimate of the potential impact of those acts."
"Within the European Union, growth will be well below 2% this year. We are however still hoping for a gradual recovery of internal demand in the coming quarters."
"There are a number of reasons for this: lower inflation, recent tax reductions and more favourable monetary conditions."
"The risks should therefore be manageable. We must, of course, monitor economic changes very closely so as to adjust economic policies as necessary, both in the Union and in each of the Member States."
"Following the events on 11 September, political leaders showed their determination to act swiftly and appropriately to eliminate the risks of a lengthier slowdown. To this end, we must also maintain our medium-term objectives, and move through our agenda more swiftly."
"As I stated earlier, the declaration following the informal ECOFIN confirmed the commitment of Member States to the framework, rules and implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"As the presidency has pointed out, slower growth will affect the nominal value of budgetary positions. Departure from the objectives ought, however, to be limited."
"The Growth and Stability Pact is a suitable framework for budgetary policy in times when the economy is developing well and in less good times."
"It makes it possible to implement the most appropriate budgetary policy for each set of circumstances."
"It is possible to resort to all the possibilities provided in the pact."
"The automatic stabilisers will be more effective if the slowdown is greater than anticipated."
"The manner and extent to which these stabilisers operate will depend on the situation of each Member State."
"Those states closer to balancing their budget will obviously have more room for manoeuvre."
"Current budgetary situations result from compliance with existing budgetary rules, and have enabled the European Central Bank to adopt a flexible monetary policy. In particular, they have made it possible for the Bank to take the right decision quickly and reduce interest rates by fifty basic points on 17 September."
"An increase in deficits over and above what can be justified by the operation of the stabilisers would reduce the options open to the Central Bank as regards possible future cuts in rates of interest."
"The European Council requested the Commission to submit a study of the likely evolution of the economic situation together with the recommendations it envisages to the forthcoming European Council at Ghent."
"The report will have to be viewed as an ongoing systematic exercise allowing for adjustment of the assessment of the evolution of risks and the possible consequences."
"My second comment concerns action to combat the financing of terrorism."
"The ECOFIN statement gives prominence to a number of specific actions."
"Firstly, the matter of the review of the directive on money laundering. This is currently under negotiation, as you are aware."
"I should like to emphasise once again, on behalf of the Commission and in line with the ECOFIN statement at Liege, that we attach great political significance to the swift conclusion of this process."
"It will send out a clear signal of the Union' s commitment to stamping out criminal activity supported by money laundering."
"I should also like to highlight the Commission' s approval of the draft regulation on specific measures to freeze the assets of individuals or entities involved in the financing of terrorist activities. We hope the Council and Parliament will deal with this as a matter of urgency so that it can be implemented immediately."
"It gives a clear indication of our political determination to grant no respite to those who attack political coexistence and the freedoms of all citizens."
"The ECOFIN Council also agreed general guidelines on government intervention concerning the insurance problems facing airline companies."
"The ECOFIN statement invites the Commission to broaden the remit of the ad hoc group set up in the framework of the Transport Council to include insurance problems."
"The statement also specifies that the Commission must be notified of any measure taken by governments, including financial amounts."
"This will enable the Commission to discharge its responsibility of ensuring that such measures are compatible with Community legislation and to ensure consistency between the responses by the various Member States."
"The Commission is drafting a report on the impact of the attacks on 11 September on the air transport industry."
"There was also an opportunity at the informal ECOFIN to pursue the discussion on preparations for the introduction of the euro. Such discussions have been held at regular intervals."
"The Commission is drafting a report on the subject for the forthcoming European Council at Ghent on 19 October."
"At Liege I appealed to the Member States to pay particular attention to three aspects which seem to me crucial at this juncture. Firstly, the problem of supplying small traders in advance."
"They need to be informed and convinced of the commercial advantages of advance supply."
"It is also important however to find ways of helping them to work with the banks. The latter should offer fair debit conditions for the amounts in euro received by small traders before 31 December 2001."
"In addition, it is essential to provide specific training for small traders and for all those working on the tills in any kind of business."
"The third issue causing us concern is monitoring of the prices of goods and services over the period of the changeover to the euro."
"We cannot go through the process of calculating the harmonised consumer price index every week, nor would it make sense to do so. Nonetheless, we can however provide the citizens with information on the evolution of certain key prices in a transparent manner."
"As this exercise is to be undertaken by government agencies, transparency and objectivity will be guaranteed, and the sample chosen will be appropriate."
"The informal ECOFIN also agreed with the Commission' s proposal to establish a common European network to organise exchange of information during the period when notes and coins are to be introduced."
"This network will start to operate at the beginning of December in close cooperation with the European Central Bank' s Cash Changeover Committee."
"The last issue I would like to deal with is the debate on globalisation."
"The Commission has followed the public debate on globalisation closely, including the debate on the so-called Tobin levy or tax."
"We have taken note of ECOFINs interest in receiving a report on these issues."
"This debate focuses on two clearly relevant objectives on which we share the concerns expressed by many of the participants in the debate on globalisation."
"Firstly, to avoid excessive fluctuation in the rates of interest which could prevent the hoped-for economic development of developing countries. Secondly, to find sources of additional finance to combat poverty."
"There is no single instrument allowing us to attain both these objectives at once."
"The Union and other countries, international institutions and other groups have developed a range of instruments and policies in an attempt to work towards these objectives."
"More and better action could of course be taken, and the Commission is prepared to explore new possibilities."
"As originally defined, Professor Tobin' s idea of imposing a tax on foreign currency transactions was intended to put a damper on international monetary markets."
"It was put forward as a second best solution to put the brakes on short-term speculative movements."
"The Commission has already made its point of view clear on a number of occasions."
"A tax on monetary transactions is not an effective way of dealing with the problems arising from excessive volatility of financial flows or with inequalities between countries."
"A wide range of instruments should be drawn upon."
"The Tobin levy or tax is not the magic wand allowing us to deal with all the challenges which have arisen."
"We need to consider a wide range of instruments in our efforts to attain financial and monetary stability."
"A global approach to the financial edifice is called for, both at internal European Union level and at international level. This should include regulatory frameworks, institutions and the problem of money laundering."
"A wide-ranging approach to the financing of development is also required."
"Different instruments can be used to deal with poverty, debt reduction, the supply of international public goods and the protection of the environment."
"The Commission is prepared to make an active contribution to the debate on the instruments to ensure coherence between globalisation, sustainable development and world governance. I am sure we can also count on support from Parliament and the Council."
"These issues are of course beyond the Union' s strict sphere of competence. We should tackle them together with other countries and institutions."
"The Commission is ready to respond to the Council' s invitation to continue working on how best to respond to the key objectives I referred to. In any case, part of this work is already under way within the Commission."
"We are currently preparing a report on the external dimension of sustainable development. This is due next January and is aimed at the Río+10 conference to be held in Johannesburg next year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, these are the key issues I wanted to share with you."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, why did my group demand this afternoon's debate on the Stability and Growth Pact? The reason given was that we were disturbed by certain utterances we have heard emanating from the ranks of socialist governments in the past weeks and months."
"The statements made by Mr Eichel, Mr Jospin, Mr Fabius, and other things that were said, all went along the same lines."
"For a start, they asserted that it was necessary in the present situation to soften the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. That was the first demand."
"The second was that the Heads of State and of Government must be accorded the right to prescribe annual stability objectives to the European Central Bank."
"We take the view that both these proposals are extraordinarily dangerous, for the Stability and Growth Pact and the independence of the European Central Bank are the twin pillars on which rests the European Union's monetary system."
"These pillars must not be shaken."
"My group will always speak up in favour of maintaining the independent European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact in their present forms."
"Let us turn now to the resolutions on the table before us."
"Jointly with the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party, we have submitted a motion for a resolution."
"We negotiated with the Group of the Party of European Socialists, which stated that it was unable to agree to our resolution."
"What, though, is so bad about our resolution?"
"It states that the Stability and Growth Pact should, in quite simple words, be 'retained'."
"Why can they not agree to that?"
"Then they said: We want to put its principles fully into practice."
"Why not just agree to it then?"
"We need measures against money laundering."
"You spoke about that, Commissioner."
"We need measures to destroy the financial background for terrorist acts."
"Why not agree to that?"
"We must also be consistent in reducing monopolies in order to strengthen the competitiveness of our European economy."
"Why can they not agree to that?"
"Now for the second question: what counter-proposal does the other side have to offer?"
"They put forward essentially the same ones over and over again: that the European Central Bank should cut interest rates."
"Or, on the other hand, that the Stability and Growth Pact, or the Member States' budget policies, should be relaxed."
"That is the Socialist policy mix."
"That is the potion concocted by druids to cure all the ills of our economy at a stroke and without effort."
"It would be nice if things worked like that, my dear Christa!"
"But in reality they do not."
"Take a look at Japan, where this policy was applied and where it does not work."
"Consider the stock exchanges in the United States today, where it can be seen that it does not work."
"Look at economic history, where we see from the past that it has never yet worked."
"So I would like to urge you to reject these demands and support our resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the light of the grave global situation, I have no desire to enter into a puerile argument with my fellow Member, Mr von Wogau."
"Mr von Wogau has just accused the Socialist Group of having the worst of intentions."
"This is certainly not the policy we are defending here."
"We must bear in mind that the attacks of 11 September have not only caused great human suffering. They may also have far-reaching consequences for civil liberties and for the global economy."
"Before 11 September, the United States was clearly already experiencing a slowdown and Japan was already in a bad way. However, before 11 September a slowdown was already evident in Europe."
"It had proved necessary to revise some forecasts downwards. Furthermore, it is clear that the situation in Europe and worldwide will be worse during the third quarter than it was during the second quarter."
"What we need to do now is prevent a recession."
"As we are all aware, a recession is defined as negative growth for two consecutive six-month periods. According to Mr von Wogau, we must now wait six months to see if we are really in a recession."
"However, I believe that we must respond by pursuing a pragmatic policy. I think that Europe owes it to herself to respond to this threat of a recessionary spiral with a proactive economic policy."
"This should be achieved within the European Union by improving the coordination of economic policies."
"The Council representative said just this to the House. The European Union should also increase political cooperation with all its economic partners, including developing countries."
"We would like to establish a pragmatic policy like that of the United States, although, as far as I know, the United States does not have a Socialist government..."
"We should of course take account of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"We should not encourage Member States to exceed budgetary deficit limits, especially the 3% threshold."
"Nevertheless, as the Council representative has said, we must assess the long-term viability of public finances. The Growth and Stability Pact states that public finances should be balanced, or almost balanced."
"We must also respond in the short term."
"Economic stabilisers can have a role to play."
"We are experiencing the consequences of a negative external event. The Growth and Stability Pact allows for us to respond to negative external events."
"I do not wish to engage in ideological debate."
"Mr von Wogau' s interpretation of the Growth and Stability Pact is merely theological. We are not calling for state aid."
"Nor are we calling for quick-fix solutions. We are calling for selective measures to support sectors badly affected by the current economic situation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, lastly, I would like to stress that we are not facing a war between different civilisations."
"Terrorism does not represent any civilisation. Terrorism negates everything that is human."
"We need a coalition against terrorism, but we also need a coalition against poverty."
"The World Bank has recently published information on the consequences of the attacks on New York for developing countries."
"We must not only deplore the loss of thousands of lives in New York and Washington. We must also lament the fact that there are tens of thousands of other victims amongst the children of the poorest countries in the world."
"These are the people we must respond to."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Liberal Group, I wish to say that we believe the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential pillar of economic stability in the euro area and in the Union more widely, and should be respected in letter and spirit."
"We do not recognise the view, apparently emanating from the Socialist Group, that the SGP currently incorporates unnecessarily restrictive fiscal rules."
"For the 11 countries whose budgets are in a sustainable position - those which, in other words, can face a normal recession with a fall in tax revenue and continue to respect the 3% limit on budget deficits - there is no need to raise taxes or cut public spending and the automatic stabilisers can and should be allowed to play."
"Moreover, for many of these countries, this is the first slowdown since the first oil shock in 1973 in which the automatic stabilisers have been able to work fully."
"Previously, financial market worries have been a serious constraint on governments."
"So monetary union, the Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal consolidation have given back to Member States a useful policy lever which has been out of the policy box for too long."
"For the four euro-area Member States whose budgets are not yet fully compatible with the Stability and Growth Pact - France, Germany, Italy and Portugal - it is wholly reasonable that they should continue the process of putting their underlying budget positions right."
"This means allowing some effects of the slowdown on the deficit, but certainly not all."
"In our joint motion with the PPE-DE Group we urge the proper respect of the SGP."
"We point out that it would be particularly useful in a year like this one - in which many stability programmes were drafted in expectation of 3% growth, but the out-turn is likely to be less than 2%, as the Commission has said - if there were a commonly agreed measure between the ECB, Ecofin and the Commission of the underlying budget balance, stripping out the impact of the slowdown on taxes and cyclically determined spending and, perhaps, interest rates as well."
"Such an underlying budget balance would allow better between-years monitoring of the fiscal position, underpinning the discipline of the Stability and Growth Pact and reassuring the financial markets that the fiscal stance is not being eased, even if the nominal deficits are inevitably somewhat larger."
"Similarly, such an underlying budget balance would discourage finance ministers from fiscal easing in upturns, merely on account of cyclically buoyant revenue."
"I urge us to respect the Stability and Growth Pact and add to its ability to check finance ministers' discipline."
"Mr President, Madam President, Commissioner, much has already been said about the issue of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"I think that the main difference between the two joint motions for resolution submitted to the House is the fact that the motion for resolution signed both by my group and the Socialist Group lays greater stress on the possibility of implementing a contracyclical policy. This policy would promote growth, while keeping within the limits of the Growth and Stability Pact."
"If I understand the declaration made by the presidency correctly, it seems that the presidency supports this idea that the Growth and Stability Pact should allow the European Union to implement a contracyclical policy to promote growth."
"There is relatively little room for manoeuvre within the terms of the monetary and budgetary policies. I would now like to comment on one aspect of the debate."
"This has not yet been mentioned but I, at least, am concerned about it. As you know Commissioner, Madam President, practically all Member States have engaged in a structural reduction of government revenue (as a percentage of GDP) through fiscal reductions."
"This is being done within the context of fiscal harmony between Member States, especially through corporation tax, and within the context of weak growth. This type of policy entails the risk of downward pressure towards a structural reduction of public spending."
"This could lead to insufficient spending, given the solidarity mechanism we endorse. Alternatively, it could lead to inequitable public spending."
"This is why it is important to debate the development of other tax bases. It seems that the presidency has alluded to and taken heed of this possibility."
"In this regard, the Tobin tax may also contribute to widening the range of tax bases. However, Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to find out from you about the progress of work within the Prima Renault group, and about the state of discussion on the issue of corporation tax."
"I believe that it is urgent for the fifteen Member States to find a way out of the impasse they have got themselves into. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is no longer informed on how this work is progressing."
"When we do hear rumours on this subject, all we hear is that no progress has been made. When growth is slowing down, I believe that, as a matter of urgency, the European Union should pull itself together and coordinate work on the development of corporation tax."
"Secondly, I would like to comment on the problems of terrorism and money laundering."
"The principal elements concerned are the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) and the issue of the directive on money laundering."
"Experts in this field judge progress made so far on international cooperation on this area to be limited and not very effective. Signatory countries are not obliged to implement the series of recommendations the FATF has produced."
"In October 1996, European magistrates signed the Geneva Appeal, which called for certain international conventions to be ratified, and for banking secrecy to be lifted when proceedings have to be started."
"One of these magistrates has recently repeated this appeal, calling for an international conference to consider these matters. The conference would define the rules on economic transparency, including lifting banking secrecy and abolishing tax havens."
"It would also increase judicial cooperation between states and set up a system of sanctions to be imposed on countries that failed to comply with these provisions. I urge the President and the Commission to see that the Belgian Presidency acts upon these requests magistrates are making."
"Indeed, the head of FATF has reiterated these same demands, as I have read in the press this morning. Work on these issues should proceed more quickly and FATF recommendations should be made binding."
"This would be a very useful role for the European Union to play, both in its capacity as the Chair and a key member of the FATF."
"I believe that we will be able to turn words into actions."
"I also believe that, as regards the fiscal package, which includes binding provisions to regulate tax havens and low-tax areas (some of which can be found within the European Union), we can combine the fight against financial crime and the European tax on savings programme. I believe that we must seize this political opportunity to step up work on these issues."
"Unfortunately, the informal meeting of ECOFIN had to announce, yet again, that no progress had been made in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the dogmatism and apathy dominating the economic policy of the European Union are causing great concern."
"Unemployment is rising once again, there is a threat of recession and the conditions for lasting growth are not in place. However, so far, the Council, the Commission and the European Central Bank have come up with platitudes and have convinced themselves that everything is fine."
"The euro does provide protection against currency speculation but it offers no protection whatsoever from financial crises. We are involved in financial globalisation up to our necks."
"The main cause of the current apathy is the fundamentalist approach of those opposed to state intervention."
"Those who subscribe to this view try desperately to promote fiscal competition, as Pierre Jonckheer reminded us. They reduce public spending but welcome turgidity on the stock exchange and its requirements to produce financial returns."
"This results in a lack of public and private investment."
"Another reason for this apathy is that social-democratic visions for Europe are somewhat lacking."
"I think it is time we recognise this."
"You advocate strengthening coordination between national policies."
"I am in favour of this, but we must recognise that basically this has come to be equated with the Growth and Stability Pact."
"I am sure you will confirm this. The debate must not remain polarised between the 'fundamentalists' and those who want to make the Growth and Stability Pact more flexible."
"We advocate an action plan to get us out of this rut."
"Firstly, as elected representatives at a European and national level, we must come to a consensus and call for a revival of the European economies. We must send a message along these lines to a meeting of the European Council in Ghent and to the Commission."
"In order to achieve economic revival, we must favour public spending and credit as opposed to tax cuts. Funds to promote investment should also be established."
"Secondly, we believe that we must carry out an in-depth revision of the Growth and Stability Pact. This Pact has remained unchanged since 1992, although the global situation is now very different and the euro has appeared."
"I appreciate the idea of starting to make it more flexible, as mentioned by Mrs Neyts. However, we want something more than this."
"We want reform."
"Two principles should guide us in this. Public or mixed economy choices should balance market forces."
"Must I point out that President Bush used Keynesian policies to revive the American economy, after President Clinton refused to cut taxes to increase his popularity?"
"Furthermore, the criteria of state intervention should allow for decision-making at national level and for solidarity."
"Restricting public deficit to a maximum of 3% in no way succeeded in preventing the exacerbation of differences."
"Consequently, the new Growth and Stability Pact would be based on common criteria for effectiveness, relating both to taxation and public spending."
"Taxation should combat the volatility of the financial markets and government stocks by taxing financial products and revenues."
"Spending should create the necessary conditions for lasting growth, employment, security and solidarity."
"We also want the Pact to include taxation and budgetary tools appropriate to the European Union. Fortunately, the Belgian Presidency has suggested this."
"Thirdly, the Laeken declaration must include a commitment to establishing Community powers in relation to macro-economic policy."
"Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to make a few, but important, points on the Stability and Growth Pact."
"There is a role for economic policy coordination, but it must be applied in a sensible and balanced manner in all Member States."
"There are, however, serious policy differences between what the Commission is now proposing and what was agreed at the Ecofin Council in Helsinki in 1999, when it was agreed that Member States 'determine their budgetary policies in consistency with the Treaty' , but that this commitment leaves room for domestic policy choices."
"This week the Commission published a welcome White Paper on European governance, the thrust of which reflects the need for EU institutions to listen, rather than dictate."
"There is a clear signal coming from EU citizens that while they continue to support the thrust of EU integration, they want it to happen in a manner which reflects the independence and the integrity of each Member State and its citizens."
"There are those in this House, and indeed within the administration, who are blindly rushing towards the creation of a federalist Europe."
"They are in my mind doing a disservice to the vision of Europe's founding fathers and will, I predict, be stopped in their tracks by citizen reaction."
"Events in the real world can rarely be dealt with by means of a predetermined, prescriptive set of rules."
"Over-regulation stifles initiative and, therefore, progress and prosperity."
"Mr President, yet again the European Union is not keeping pace with the situation in Europe, as it wishes to keep European economies within the shackles of the Growth and Stability Pact. We all know that the criteria of this Pact are now completely obsolete."
"The Growth and Stability Pact is dead, Mr Von Wogau; it did not die in New York. It was killed off by the European Central Bank."
"The Bank' s policies were always out of line with reality. Its forecasting errors are now legendary, and it has an irrational fear of inflation."
"We are all aware of the results. We have to contend with the highest interest rates in the world, a consistently weak euro and the threat of recession."
"The outcome of pursuing monetary policy in the manner of a frightened old man is clear. Sooner or later, governments will be forced towards budgetary expansion."
"It would be ridiculous now to blame them for doing this. Many members of the committee have made this abundantly clear in all our conversations (if you can call them that) with Mr Duisenberg."
"Once again, the European Union is unworthy of the powers it has assumed from legitimate governments. It has proved this by failing to order (this is a euphemism) the European Central Bank to make available to the countries of the euro area the resources entrusted to it by Member States."
"As far as we know, the ECB does not own Europe' s currency and should not act like Scrooge."
"I would also like to point out in passing that it is unacceptable for the ECB to decide whether or not to issue euro notes and coins before 1 January."
"I have to say that I really cannot understand why some governments do not wish to take the initiative and bring the date of distribution forward."
"Yet again the European Union cannot keep pace with its ambitions and assertions. It has failed to take up a position at the forefront of the drive to promote economic growth and employment."
"Lastly, Commissioner, Madam President, let me add that the hypocrisy surrounding the issue of the Tobin tax added nothing to the intellectual standing of the European Union. For once, the European Union had the opportunity to show that it intended to have an effect on world affairs, to become more than what it actually is, simply one more piece of the jigsaw of liberal globalisation."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Italian Radicals supported the resolution of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party because they consider it of vital importance that Parliament confirms the validity of the Stability and Growth Pact and its principles."
"I feel that rigorous budgetary and monetary policies are not incompatible with growth, provided that we have the courage to act in the areas of structural reform, privatisation, liberalisation of the markets - particularly the labour market - and public spending, and provided that we have the courage to resolve the complex issue of pensions expenditure, which is an excessive burden on the budgets of many European countries and, because of the way these systems are organised, creates situations which are extremely unfair towards the young generations of workers."
"I am quite aware that the European countries - I refer to my own country, Italy, in particular, but also to others such as Germany - rested on their laurels during the economic boom, putting off reforms which were necessary in order to consolidate public finances and make businesses competitive and giving way to pressure from trade unions and employers' associations demanding more State aid."
"Thus, they failed to prepare the European economies for the inevitable subsequent slowdown, which will be particularly severe in the wake of the events of 11 September."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the fiscal burden in Europe is still too high: although it has fallen somewhat, it is true, the figures show that the fiscal burden in Europe is still significantly higher than it was in the early nineties, for example."
"Derogating from the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact now and resorting to deficit spending means storing up fresh tax increases for the coming years which, in my opinion, the European economy, the European workers and the European unemployed can on no account afford."
"There is one danger which must be highlighted - Mr Goebbels mentioned the confusion following the events of 11 September - and that is that Europe will use the current economic crisis and the crisis in the United States as an excuse to go back to expansionist, deficit spending policies such as those experienced by Europe and its citizens in previous decades."
"This is not the right response to the situation."
"The argument that the United States is also reacting with an expansionist policy and that it is going to spend an additional 1% of its GDP disregards the fact that the United States is supported by healthy, buoyant public finances and therefore has the capacity to do so reasonably effectively."
"The same would not be true if we were to implement similar policies in Europe or to support State airlines which have drained public resources and hampered the liberalisation of the European markets."
"I would like to stress one last point relating to the fight against terrorism and its funding."
"Something which is now increasingly being emphasised by expert analysts - recently even by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Economics, Gary Becker - is the fact that the multinational terrorist organisations are financed by drug trafficking, particularly where Afghanistan and Pakistan are concerned."
"We must also explore the possibility of cutting off this channel of terrorist funding at source through drugs policies not based on prohibition."
"Mr President, the debate taking place today on the supposed choice between the Growth and Stability Pact and budgetary expansion seems somewhat bizarre. In fact, we do not have a choice between these two alternatives."
"On the one hand, the Growth and Stability Pact is too rigid an instrument, despite offering some opportunities for derogation, because it does not make proper provision for the time-lags between the economic cycles of the various Member States."
"We have consistently pointed this out."
"However, the Council has just suggested that it might eventually be possible to make adjustments according to the economic climate, and using a bit of skill and the excuse of the attacks, we can therefore expect the Pact to be more flexible."
"On the other hand, budgetary expansion in countries that have suffered the biggest slowdown, like France and Germany, has had three main effects."
"Firstly, these countries already have significant budgetary deficits."
"This limits their margin for manoeuvre and has already acted as a stimulus. As is the case with drugs, a greater stimulus is needed to achieve the maximum effect."
"However, eventually the dose will have to be reduced."
"The second effect of this expansion is that the excessive undervaluing of the euro has led to an increase in exports. This is due to the fact that the euro is an artificial currency."
"This has been unfair on our partners but has boosted internal growth. However, I am not sure that this might not have contributed, to a very small degree, to the slowdown in the United States over recent months."
"The third effect of budgetary expansion is the dispersal of cash people have been hoarding, prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January next year. No one ever mentions this, but it is nevertheless happening."
"This laundered money has been reinvested in the economy in very significant amounts. The figures for France total FRF 50 billion this year."
"This is already causing revival. Further budgetary expansion would have no purpose."
"It would only lead to the eventual introduction of new taxes which would make the situation even more difficult in future."
"The real question we should be asking ourselves is: given the three linked elements necessary for economic revival I have mentioned, why are we not experiencing an economic boom?"
"Apart from the unexpected effects of the attacks in America, which have yet to be firmly established, I think there are two reasons for this."
"The first reason is that the economies of Europe are overburdened with many different taxes and rigid regulations. The policies of the Socialist French government, especially the absurdity of the 35-hour working week, made these problems particularly acute in France."
"The second reason relates to the perverse effect of the euro. I have said this before, but I will mention it again."
"The euro may to some extent prevent some fluctuation in internal exchange rates, as supporters of the currency take great pleasure in explaining time and again."
"However, on the other hand, it imposes a single monetary policy on countries which find themselves in very different situations."
"This 'one-size-fits-all' policy, to quote one economist, is not suited to the present situation of France and Germany. It is having a recessionary effect in these countries."
"It seems clear that the recessionary effect of standardisation today rather outweighs the benefits of eliminating internal exchange rates."
"If we consider the situation as a whole, the euro is not protecting us from recession but rather encouraging it."
"Should we put up with greater budgetary deficits to compensate for the euro?"
"That would be truly paradoxical!"
"In any case, Mr President, given the direction Europe has taken, we will have to endure several more years of problems and tension before governments recognise this essential truth: all countries fare better if each can benefit from an economic policy suited to its individual requirements."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, the present political situation in the world, and the war against terrorism that has begun, have a host of features that are creating long-term uncertainty for the EU economy."
"That is why economic policies to create confidence will perhaps have an unparalleled impact on the behaviour of consumers and investors, and, hence, on how long the period of slower growth will last."
"There are also certain positive signs, from the point of view of restraint and the stability of currency values. The price of crude oil is falling rather than rising and the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have, since 11 September, been taking prompt action and acting in accord with one another."
"Now, after the Federal Reserve' s drop in interest rates yesterday, all eyes are on the ECB."
"It is no good waiting."
"May the approach to the solution remain in the hands of the independent ECB, but the future of the policy on interest rates in Europe must also be made clear quickly."
"Firm commitment on the part of every country to the Stability and Growth Pact will create just the sort of confidence the pact itself seeks and the economy now needs."
"Budgetary discipline must not be allowed to slacken in the EU countries on any pretext, not even on account of any possible expenditure to increase internal and external security."
"Equivalent savings will have to be found: we cannot rely on some hoped-for continued growth of income."
"Switching to the euro will mean slightly increased costs for all points in the production chain."
"There is no denying that."
"However, they will be one-off increases and will only raise prices slightly."
"They should not be used for scaremongering and thereby increase inflationary pressures."
"The best long-term policy for stability and growth now is to adhere closely to the decisions of the Lisbon Summit and make the European Union the world' s most competitive area, removing internal barriers to competition and giving encouragement to innovation and research and development."
"The commencement of a new round of WTO talks is now vital for international cooperation in matters of the economy to steadily gain strength."
"Mr President, representative of the Council, Commissioner, in my view, our economic policy is a combination of success and failure."
"The success, of course, is the euro, the failure is the actual economy, where there are two, interconnected problems. The low rate of growth and the high rate of unemployment."
"The reason for both is the same and lies in the low rate of investment in capital equipment during the last decade of the last century, accompanied by the collapse of public investment."
"Some people maintain that this collapse is a virtual collapse because it is due to a simple change of name, in that the private sector is investing where the public sector used to invest."
"But how are we to believe this when overall investments have fallen so low?"
"Did public investment have to be throttled in order to support the euro?"
"Did unemployment have to reach its present rate, albeit not as high as just two years ago, although it will no doubt rise again, Commissioner, in order to support the euro?"
"I do not think so, but although no one admits it, this was the official policy up to the European Council in Lisbon."
"That was where the line was taken to adopt the new economy which is supposed to find a modern solution to Europe's economic problem and bring back full employment on the new basis of more advanced technology, the most advanced technology in the world."
"Nice words, nice ambitions, nice vision."
"Unfortunately it failed because this was when the bubble burst on the American stock exchange, especially in the new technology and telecommunications sector, which was supposed to lead us into a new era and which is now threatening to drag us into one of the biggest slumps of the twentieth century."
"It seems to me that these events have drawn a line under the Lisbon vision and that we need to go back to the drawing board."
"There is no way someone can have a full plan to present to you, not when all our study institutes deny the need for us to change our economic policy."
"But some things seem to be self-explanatory."
"The European economy needs investment, the private sector is not investing enough because we insist on preventing the public sector from supplementing its investments - is that how we are going to revive the private sector's interest?"
"By refusing to make use of the possibilities offered by the Treaty and exempt investments from the definition of deficit in the Stability Pact?"
"I heard Mr Della Vedova refer in trepidation to 'deficit spending' ."
"Things may have got out of hand in the era of 'deficit spending' but, let us not forget that, in that era, the rate of growth was 5% and unemployment never exceeded 1 to 1.5%, while our current economic policy, based as it is on a high degree of liberalisation of the markets, is a long way from being such a success."
"America came close in the last five years of the last century in a climate of excessive speculation and look where that has got us now."
"Also, I should like to ask you, Commissioner, as you did me the honour of allowing me to ask you in private: what is the scientific criterion for refuting your position that will make you tell us that our position has been refuted and that we need to change economic policy?"
"As I am sure you know, without refutability there can be no scientific standpoint."
"We keep getting caught in a huge tautology and I am afraid that this is precisely the economic policy which you support."
"Mr President, so as to appease the Commissioner and the other honourable Members, may I state for the record that I am not a fan of deficits, of increasing public debt or of inflation."
"However, that is not the issue."
"Are we forecasting a slump, yes or no?"
"Some say, wait and see what happens."
"But if it does happen, then it will be too late."
"Others say, wait and the problem will resolve itself."
"Some take cold comfort in the belief that our economy will rally once the economy rallies in the United States and totally ignore the fact that, with globalisation, if that happens, others will benefit from the recovery."
"All the wrangling, as a number of honourable members have already said, is about avoiding the notion of public intervention in the economy."
"I fail to understand why."
"What is the point in being dogmatic, when you have specific problems and, more to the point, the problem of a slump in front of you?"
"Some of us can imagine various scenarios which marry public intervention with economic stability, that is, increased earnings, without creating the alarming fiscal competition which some people are projecting?"
"The problem is, we need public expenditure, we have the potential to generate public earnings which do not affect the productive structure or development of the economy or its competitiveness."
"Surely you do not mean to tell me that you would have a problem if someone somewhere did something about annuities or the international speculators throwing hot money around on the stock exchange, or even about the excessive wealth and the frantic consumption of our inflated upper middle classes."
"We have no scientific answer."
"We are dogmatic."
"No to the public sector and no to a Europe which, if it did all this - because only Europe can do all this - would be a federalist Europe."
"Well, I have never heard such dogmatism in my life!"
"Mr President, the tragic events in America have sent severe economic shock waves through the world."
"No country will remain immune to the economic impact of the horrendous terrorist attacks in America."
"Those attacks were so severe that it will be some time before the extent of the economic fallout is fully known."
"We are already seeing the first economic ramifications of 11 September, a day that will be etched on the memory of us all for evermore."
"Job losses are mounting in the airline industry."
"The jobs shed at many European airlines will never be filled again."
"These job losses in turn affect nearly every aspect of an economy."
"Consumer and investor confidence is waning, the value of global and stock markets is down too."
"The one encouraging sign is that the euro currency is surviving strongly."
"We can now all see the importance of the single European currency and the fact that there are 12 currencies participating within the single European currency regime is lending stability to the European economy."
"There could be nothing worse than having 15 independent floating currencies operating within the European Union at the moment."
"This would be a recipe for international speculators to come in and play one currency off against another."
"We all recall the devaluations which took place in 1992, when the international currency speculators played havoc with the European stock markets."
"Thankfully they are not in a position to do so again now, because we have a stable currency operating in Europe and surviving the recent economic shocks."
"The terrorist attacks will not affect the timetable for the introduction of euro notes and coins, which will proceed as planned."
"It is also clear that the European Central Bank and the various national euro changeover boards have done an excellent job in marketing the new euro economy."
"While I have no doubt that there will be some teething problems, we shall overcome them and by the end of the changeover period the citizens of Europe will be fully cognizant of the value of the new euro notes and coins."
"Mr President, the resolution by the ELDR Group and the PPE-DE Group has received my backing."
"I have always been in favour of strict compliance with the criteria of the Stability Pact."
"In this time of uncertainty, extra alertness is called for."
"Various Member States are entering the danger zone."
"A major advantage of budgetary discipline is manifesting itself: room for automatic stabilisers."
"I would like to note in this connection that increasing expenditure is no solution."
"What will prove decisive is the quality of the Stability Pact in combination with the necessary reforms in the economy as a whole."
"The resolution mentions that the distribution of authority between the Member States and the Union leads to negative action at Member State level."
"The reverse is also true."
"The Union' s monetary decisions can adversely affect a Member State, for example, in the form of high inflation due to an unwelcome drop in interest rates."
"I welcome the attention that this area of tension is receiving."
"Thanks to the EMU' s favourable effect, the European economy can become more stable."
"Time will tell whether this is proportionate to the loss of custom-made solutions for the Member States."
"Budgetary discipline will be crucial in obtaining this stability."
"- (ES) Mr President, by this stage in the debate it seems to me that three things must already be clear to us."
"Firstly, we know that the European industrial sector is currently experiencing a graver crisis than the one it went through as a result of the 1998 financial crisis."
"Secondly, we know that the crisis currently afflicting the world economy is far more serious than the one it underwent in 1993, after the Gulf War. This is because for the first time since 1929, the three largest economies are affected, namely the economies of the United States, Europe and Japan."
"Thirdly, except for Mr Abitbol we all know that nowadays the European economy is far better prepared to cope with such a crisis."
"We also have a policy to protect us from exorbitant price rises. In addition, we have a Stability Pact to safeguard us against the munificence of public administrations."
"We do not know for certain but we suspect that this crisis is not demand led, like the post-war crisis. Nor is it a supply driven crisis like the one following the Yom Kippur war."
"Rather, it is a crisis of confidence. As such, what distinguishes our motion for a resolution from the one put forward by the left is not that they wish to grow while we do not."
"Obviously, we all want to grow."
"Nevertheless, some recipes will move us forward whilst others will put us into reverse."
"We believe that our recipes will move us forward."
"Allow me to explain the reasons why I think as I do."
"If this is a crisis of confidence, it would be a fundamental error to relax monetary policy and allow price rises. That would hole consumer confidence below the water line."
"Secondly, because revising the Stability Pact would amount to indicating that we wish to pass this burden on to future generations, and that is certainly not a confidence booster."
"Thirdly, if we relax the budgetary policy enshrined in the Stability Pact we shall prevent interest rates from being lowered, as the Americans are doing."
"A vessel is not assessed according to whether there is a storm around or not, but according to how it weathers a storm."
"In my view, it is now clear that we should change the way we navigate."
"The European Central Bank may be driven to reduce interest rates, but it must bear in mind that its ultimate aim is to maintain the dogma of price stability to maintain consumer confidence."
"It is likely that some governments who have done their homework will be able to allow the automatic stabilisers to operate. They will not need to compensate for fiscal reduction by increasing taxes or reducing expenditure."
"Unfortunately, governments who have failed to do their homework and behaved like prodigal sons will not find themselves in such a fortunate position."
"Thirdly, as the Commissioner has said, though previous speakers failed to mention it, it is time for Europe to move ahead and take a determined step forward to get the Lisbon process under way. This process aims to create a modern, innovative and competitive society."
"Regarding the Tobin tax, the Commissioner was far more convincing in the interview he granted the Vanguardia Digital, when he said it was a useless tool, than in his speech today. Today the Commissioner stated it was one more potential tool."
"Previously the Commissioner stated it was not possible. Now it begins to appear probable."
"I endorse what he said to the newspaper but not what he said in the House."
"Mr President, all possible measures must be taken to ensure that Europe can provide a real answer to the consequences of the horrendous terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, and a part of that, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, has in fact already been done, namely a joint response from the EU finance ministers."
"I think this symbolises Europe's ability to close ranks when the chips are really down."
"I believe that this policy should also be pursued further in relation to aid policy."
"However, it should also give us the flexibility we need, so as to demonstrate that Europe does not want the economic downturn to be further exacerbated."
"We do in fact have a Stability and Growth Pact that gives us many possibilities, because on the one hand we wish Europe to be a Community of stability, and on the other hand we also want to promote growth and employment."
"It is no accident that when applying the convergence criteria, exceptional circumstances have sometimes been applied and approved which allow the definition of an excessive deficit to be deviated from."
"I do not mean by that to speak in favour of a 'Community of instability' ."
"Just the opposite in fact, I wish to call on the Belgian Presidency and the Commission to contribute to further coordination in this area, by taking advantage of the fact that stability programmes can be updated."
"I would like to see updated stability programmes for the euro countries which make it clear that the data has significantly changed."
"What is needed in this context, as you quite rightly said yourself, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, is for us to avoid procyclical policies in Europe, in both the expansionist and restrictive senses. However, we can only do that if we can compare cyclically neutral budget data with structural deficits in updated budget figures."
"I think that it would be helpful if the excitement that this debate has generated in this House led to further progress being made both in economic policy and in stability policy."
"I say that because the European Union needs both monetary stability and employment and social stability."
"Firstly, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor."
"Unfortunately, I cannot remain in the House for very long as I have a meeting at 4.30 p.m. with your contact group to debate the development of the Members' Statute. I regard this as an important subject and this is an important meeting."
"I requested it myself. I will be back here in the House at 5.30 p.m. to respond to the many questions you wish to put to me."
"I would therefore like to thank you very much for listening to what I have to say now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that you all appreciated the importance attached to every word of my speech, and the significance of every adjective I used when I spoke on behalf of the Presidency of the Council and the Council itself. Please excuse me if I do not now try to interpret my previous speech further."
"Consequently, I think I explained clearly how our thinking is developing. I also defined the limits ECOFIN and the ministers themselves have already set."
"I then described the nature of the ongoing debate. Those of you, you are all here, will certainly wish to have experts available to monitor the development of this debate closely."
"Of course, the conclusions of this debate are considerably more important."
"I believe that we are, at last, more or less in agreement with the objectives we wish to achieve, even if there is less agreement on the best means of achieving them."
"I am sure that this debate will continue."
"However, I would like to make two brief observations of my own."
"Mr Berthu, a longstanding colleague of mine, said that everything was so much better when each country had full control of its financial and economic instruments."
"However, I must disagree with you on this point, Mr Berthu."
"I have been around long enough to know that the reality was very different, and it was at that time too. Europe has experienced very serious financial and economic crises, and has found it extremely difficult to overcome them."
"This is my first point."
"I shall not quickly forget the time in the 1970s when people sang the praises of the deficit spending policy. This was a time of economic slowdown in my country, and those in positions of responsibility praised the policy of deficit spending to high heaven."
"It took us fifteen years to recover from the effects of this policy. I do not wish this policy to be implemented in the European Union."
"However, everything I have heard here goes quite in the opposite direction. I am sure that you will make it your business to monitor this situation very closely and will be extremely vigilant."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"Thank you for informing the House of the reason for your absence, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck."
"Be assured that we wish you every success with such a sensitive matter."
"Mr President, we are living at a time when it is becoming clearer that the Stability Pact functions as an obstacle to development and to economic and social cohesion: by considering monetary and nominal convergence as a priority, by making restrictive budgets mandatory, it prevents those countries with major difficulties from being able to engage in a policy of investment, particularly public investment, in a period such as the present one of slowdown in economic activity and the threat of international recession."
"In various countries and from different sources warnings are being issued regarding the need to amend the Stability Pact and the priority being given to the monetarist policies of neo-liberalism."
"This situation is being felt both in the more developed countries and in those where situations of the greatest inequality prevail and/or where threats of social tension are emerging."
"In a country like Portugal, which has the lowest salaries, pensions and reforms in the European Union and the highest rates of premature school-leaving, accidents at work and poverty, the application of rigid timetables and deadlines and major restrictions on public spending and investment is unacceptable, because this will impede the country' s development and obstruct the way to economic and social cohesion."
"The need for the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact is, therefore, very topical."
"In a European Union that claims to be concerned with social problems, committed to the creation of jobs and the fight against social exclusion and poverty, maintaining monetary stability at any cost cannot continue to be considered as a priority, when we know that the consequences will be more unemployment, more salary restrictions and more poverty."
"It is not a question of merely calling for some flexibility in the criteria of the Stability Pact and the implementation of the growth and stability programmes, which each country has had to present."
"It is essential to engage in an in-depth revision of the objectives, criteria and foundations of the Stability Pact, starting from the premise that the budgets of the Member States must reflect the needs of each people and each country and not the interests of the financial groups that the European Central Bank is seeking to convey."
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes, we need more Europe, and the Stability Pact is a tool for building Europe."
"It is a complex and anomalous tool, not found in textbooks and universities; in fact, it replaces a true economic and budget balance policy on a federal scale."
"But in order to be effective, such a tool must be credible and based on definite rules and obligations that are respected by all."
"Changing the rules during the difficult process of convergence, less than one hundred days before the birth of the euro proper, would therefore be a serious mistake."
"The Stability Pact must not, therefore, be relaxed or have its deadlines or targets changed; any such approach would be merely short-sighted opportunism and disastrous for the building of Europe."
"The Stability Pact should, rather, be strengthened, improved and made more efficient; targets that only refer to budget balances are no longer enough."
"Budget balances are a necessary but not sufficient objective, because there will be a growing need to aim at quality in public spending and the medium to long-term sustainability of public finances in the individual euro countries; in this connection, it is sufficient to think of the pension deficit."
"Commissioner, even a Stability Pact interpreted in the most responsible, far-sighted manner possible would do nothing for the credibility of our currency if there were not a massive acceleration in the process of completing economic union at the same time, with greater genuine convergence, greater social cohesion, greater development, greater liberalisation, and a greater market for services and energy."
"Though we need therefore to comply with and value the Stability and Growth Pact, as much attention should also be devoted to the subject of the Lisbon agenda."
"Unfortunately, the Stockholm European Council was a step backwards in this respect."
"Commissioner, Minister, for the sake of the euro and our Europe, let us avoid similar steps backwards in future."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Europe is not technically in recession, but it is clearly experiencing a situation of slower growth, and we cannot yet predict all the economic, political and social consequences that this will have."
"Within this framework, many people are questioning the validity of the restrictive and fundamentalist way in which the Growth and Stability Pact has been interpreted and the consequences that this interpretation may have on the very process of development and cohesion in Europe."
"The Stability Pact is a global commitment, which combines the realism of a specific macro-economic scenario with a healthy concern for the consolidation of public finances."
"The Pact should be interpreted in its entirety and, obviously, if one of the terms of the equation is altered, the other term must be adjusted and made flexible."
"I do not want to get into an argument with the followers of the school of single thought, who have, unfortunately, come to play a leading role on the European economic policy scene. But I cannot refrain from stating that any true defence of the Growth and Stability Pact requires, first and foremost, an understanding of it."
"Now, understanding it means that it is correct to agree, in an unfavourable international situation, to accommodate the unavoidable loss of income and the consequent increase in the public deficit, provided it does not exceed 3%, as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck rightly stated."
"This cannot and must not be confused with any laxity or inefficiency by the revenue authorities, much less with relinquishing in the medium term a policy of adjustment supported by budgetary procedures and a serious and ongoing effort to control public spending and improve administrative efficiency at every level."
"Controlling and streamlining public spending are worthy objectives."
"We are not, therefore, talking about a revision or cancellation of the Stability Pact."
"Consolidating spending does not mean irrationally demanding a linear reduction of deficits. It does mean considering that in the medium term budgetary balances from one year should be balanced with those of the next."
"Mr President, stability and growth are objectives of economic activity that everyone wants, whichever party or group in the European Parliament they belong to."
"However, when it comes to defining these concepts and in particular when it comes to how we should achieve these objectives, then there are considerable differences between us."
"A purely fiscal interpretation will not help us to solve the present problems, which are reflected in falling economic growth and consistently high unemployment."
"The market economy as an economic concept is fine, but it is unacceptable as a social policy tool."
"Or to put it another way, the market can and should regulate the economy, but not society."
"We see the priority as being not a supply-oriented economic policy, but a demand-oriented one."
"We do not believe that liberalisation is a panacea."
"We need not only commercial competition, but also a linkage with economic and social criteria, in order to achieve the highest possible level of social security, sustainability and justice."
"Balancing budgets is fine, but not at any price."
"In contrast to the President-in-Office, I wish to call for an anticyclical economic policy."
"In times of recession, increasing public expenditure on investment in new capacity and in education and training are essential."
"We have the euro area, but we do not have a European economic, fiscal and social policy."
"That cannot work."
"It is not just a matter of achieving price stability alone, which is the ECB's remit, we also need to achieve socio-economic stability."
"A more flexible approach to the existing convergence criteria will not solve the problem, it will just shift the burden to those who meet the criteria."
"We need a new version that takes into account additional parameters such as the employment rate, the value-added ratio and the investment ratio, because these indicators reflect economic strength and development."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the dark clouds of recession are looming in the west, in part due to the piercing of the asset bubble of the US stock market, but further exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September."
"The US Federal Reserve has now dropped the federal funds rate to 2.5% - a 39-year low."
"This is the ninth rate cut this year."
"The ECB may respond shortly, but almost two years since the euro's launch, there is as yet little enthusiasm for its future role as the major international reserve currency."
"This is in part the result of exchange-rate weakness and, in part, because the notes and coins are not yet in circulation, so it cannot yet be heralded as an unqualified success."
"It remains to be seen if the one-size-fits-all model of interest rates will work in all the countries of the Union, in particular countries like Ireland."
"These concerns and the added concerns about constitutional implications and loss of sovereignty leave my country, the UK, happy to remain outside for the time being."
"Although clearly we all wish the project well, it has frankly confounded many pessimists including our former Prime Minister John Major."
"Some years ago, the Commission in its McDougal report concluded that central tax-raising powers of at least 7% of GDP would be needed to allow counter-cyclical spending and transfer payments to make a single-currency zone function properly."
"This would, of course, have been anathema to Member States, so they decided instead on strict spending, borrowing and inflation limits in Dublin in 1996 as an alternative."
"Recently, there have been calls to make these Stability and Growth Pact ceilings more flexible."
"This is unwise in my opinion, as I believe firmly that a prudent approach to public finance and borrowing is a good thing."
"Furthermore, the British economy is linked to and becoming more convergent with the euro zone, so we all have an incentive to stick to the guidelines and we must not allow the US crisis to be an excuse for new, big government tax-and-spend policies."
"The Stability Pact includes mechanisms designed to operate in recession and Article 2.1 on the excessive deficit procedure could be used in exceptional circumstances to justify higher military or security spending."
"But Member States should concentrate on structural reforms, particularly in their labour markets, as the way ahead."
"Otherwise, we would only have high inflation and massive increases in the mountain of national debt."
"Mr President, by a diabolical coincidence, it is aeroplanes that illustrate what sort of a world we are living in today."
"There was the tragedy in New York and there were the events yesterday in another dimension, at another level, in the airports around Switzerland."
"It may have been Swissair but it could equally easily have been Sabena or Olympic Airways or another airline."
"You could say that we are dogmatic in the European Union about refusing to see what is going on around us."
"That is our right."
"But I think that to be dogmatic to the point where you refuse to see what even Mr Bush's government with its ultra-conservative economic philosophy and Mr O'Nill in the United States can see is taking things too far."
"To refuse to see the 15 billion given to the airlines, to refuse to see that, for both political and economic reasons, international movements of funds need to be controlled somewhere along the line if we are to have both economic and political stability, to refuse to see that governments need to stop being petty and to take things in hand."
"In this sense, I think that to abide dogmatically by a Stability Pact decided under different circumstances ten years ago is a big mistake."
"Mr President, in the spring, the Council took a clear stance in favour of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Around the summer recess, a few finance ministers considered it necessary to express as their own personal opinion the fact that more scope was required in the Pact as a result of a declining economy."
"This was apparently not an official government view because the requirements were not repeated on the platforms eminently placed to deal with this, including the ECOFIN Council. Quite the reverse, in fact."
"On those occasions, warm words were spoken about the Pact."
"Despite these fine words, President Duisenberg considered the talk of relaxing the rules very worrying."
"Commissioner Solbes Mira even addressed Italy, France, Germany and Portugal in a stern manner and urged them to translate the agreements into action. And he is right."
"It is not acceptable for governments repeatedly to adopt a high tone and demand reductions in the interest rate from the Central Bank when they have failed to do their own homework."
"If all Member States, when economic growth allowed for this, had taken the required structural measures, the Central Bank would now be able to be more flexible in its interest policy."
"After all, there is a direct link between the budgetary policy and the interest policy in the policy mix."
"Various MEPs have spoken about 11 September and Mr Herzog even went so far as to claim that the euro does not protect us against financial crises."
"I think he is very much mistaken."
"After 11 September, the Central Bank took action in an admirable manner and has most definitely shielded us from a financial cash crisis."
"Some time ago, Ireland was severely punished when it gave another stimulus to an almost overheated economy, contributing further to high inflation."
"As far as I am concerned, Ireland might serve as an example, but we should also be courageous, and level criticism at large countries. We should especially target those countries that fully deserve the criticism."
"And let us be aware of the fact that the financial markets are closely monitoring the way in which the Member States are currently handling their government budgets in a declining economy."
"The current situation is a test of how sound the euro construction really is."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have had a very in-depth discussion of this subject today."
"I have gradually been sensing that this debate has made it clearer and clearer how justified the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats was in taking the initiative to table this motion, and how important that was."
"There are 89 days to go until the euro notes and coins come into circulation, and on top of that challenge we are living in very uncertain times."
"At the same time there have been reactions in some governments around making the Stability and Growth Pact an issue. We have already heard the names of certain people in some governments who have not done their homework properly when it comes to the Stability and Growth Pact."
"For that reason it is particularly important in these uncertain times and with 89 days to go before the euro comes in, to convey a sense of clarity and calm to the markets and also to consumers."
"Europe's Stability and Growth Pact will not be shaken."
"That is why it is necessary to counter the idea that weakening the Stability and Growth Pact is a way of acting to prevent a recession."
"It is simply not true that inflation can create jobs."
"And it is not true that the Stability and Growth Pact did not allow enough leeway for hard times."
"The Member States that have the greatest leeway are the ones that have done most of their homework."
"So I can only urge you not to play with fire."
"It is irresponsible to add to uncertainty at a time when things are already uncertain, and the Stability Pact is a requirement for the stability of the euro."
"Mr President, the object of the Stability and Growth Pact is to achieve lasting stability in the financial markets, which have remained a national responsibility since the beginning of the single currency."
"This means that the Stability Pact is a necessary counterpart in financial policy terms to the policy of monetary union and it is a financial policy substitute for political union, which did not come into being at the same time as monetary union."
"The objective of the pact is to ensure that there is sufficient leeway in budgets when times are good and to make provision for bad times."
"Some Member States, including Germany, have failed to do this recently."
"However, no sooner have the first difficulties appeared than people have started talking about how the criteria are interpreted."
"The usual criticism is that although the pact promotes stability, it also acts as a fiscal straitjacket and thus exacerbates weakness in monetary growth."
"This criticism fails to take account of the facts."
"The commitment made is to balance budgets in the medium term and to limit deficits, and it cannot therefore be thrown up in the air as soon as growth subsides."
"That is why a clear signal is needed from ECOFIN, especially after the discussions that have taken place."
"With just three months to go before the euro comes into circulation, as Mr Karas mentioned, we need a sign of stability."
"The problem is that we have failed to achieve the Lisbon objective of becoming the region with the strongest growth in the world."
"But we can only achieve that objective if the Member States do their homework."
"They cannot blame this on the European Central Bank."
"I would also like to take issue with Mr Tannock for suggesting that the ECB has not met its objectives during this period of crisis."
"The ECB in particular has reacted very well since 11 September, and the euro has held up."
"However, the fact that we were already discussing the Stability and Growth Pact before 11 September meant that we were playing with fire, as Mr Karas put it, and causing uncertainty."
"If we had not done that we would be able to debate the future of the euro in a far calmer way now."
"Mr President, with only a few days before the introduction of the euro, I believe we should most of all avoid the risk of confirming a contradiction between convergence and stability policies on the one hand and, on the other, policies aiming at sustaining the processes of growth and lasting development, in accordance with the objectives of the Lisbon Summit."
"Bearing in mind the implementation of planned and existing automatic stabilisers, I think the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact should not be presented or seen as obstacles to growth or the need to respond - politically too - to the consequences of a downturn in the economic climate like the one we are now going through."
"Furthermore, I believe it would be just as wrong to present compliance with the Stability Pact objectives as being a sufficient or, worse still, the only possible reaction to a context with a clear risk of recession."
"I believe that in such circumstances there is once again a need especially to speed up progress towards two goals."
"The first is to specify and perfect tools of analysis and control, to ensure that public finances are used consistently and concomitantly in support of selective investment programmes that are strictly targeted and as such useful in an absolute sense - and even more necessary when compensating for the economic downturn."
"The second goal, confirming the positive nature of the Stability and Growth Pact, is to adapt and consolidate it so it remains in operation beyond the time when it should have reached its objectives, thus improving the conditions and strengthening the tools for an effective Community economic policy."
"Mr President, rather than talk about the Stability and Growth Pact I want to comment on another subject which was raised at the informal ECOFIN and with which this debate deals, and that is the Member States' ministers' call for Parliament's agreement on the Money Laundering directive."
"I would like to echo that call for both colleagues across the European Parliament and governments across Europe to reach an agreement on this directive as soon as possible."
"This has been made all the more crucial by the tragic events of 11 September."
"Terror that day struck at the heart of the global financial system."
"The terrorists were clearly prepared to use all the mechanisms and tools that the global financial system gave them in planning that attack."
"Let us turn those tools against them."
"Many bankers and finance workers died in that attack."
"Let us enlist the help of those bankers and finance workers in responding to it and preventing a repetition thereof, because this is a concrete step that we can take in the war against terrorism."
"No-one is going to ask us to go and die on an Afghan hillside, though others will be asked to pay that price."
"But we too can - and should - make a contribution, because the bankers, brokers, cleaners, IT technicians, investment advisers, lawyers and caterers who spill off our trains into city centres in Frankfurt, Paris, London and Brussels are just the same as those 5000 or 6000 people who turned up for work in New York one day and will never ever come home."
"The time has come to stop quibbling about lawyer confidentiality."
"I call on this Parliament to agree to a directive which will help starve the terrorists of funds."
"I call on it to agree to the freezing of assets of terrorist organisations, because someone, somewhere, is banking bin Laden's money."
"We can help starve him of funds, which is as important a task as the military operation which we know will soon follow."
"Mr President, Commissioner Solbes, ladies and gentlemen, at a time of particular international tension, I believe I can state that the Stability and Growth Pact is like a guarantee of our will to uphold all the restructuring plans and growth programmes that underlie the building of an economically strong, cohesive and genuinely competitive Europe."
"Any idea of waiving or relaxing established plans would undermine the future development of the whole of Europe."
"There is now an aspect that should also be given due consideration: the massaging of budget balance data so as not to reveal any anomalies that may still persist in certain public accounts."
"Unfortunately, in this respect, we in Italy have had to face a sad legacy from the centre-left."
"This is not the right attitude, certainly worse than that of failing to bring the economy into line with the required parameters. While the former case involves fraudulence, the latter is, it is hoped, just a momentary, temporary difficulty."
"Such massaging of data should be clamped down on with no half measures and penalties can be imposed where appropriate."
"In the context of the Pact and the general awareness that it should be observed, it cannot be ignored that certain areas or even entire regions - southern Italy, southern Spain, southern and part of northern France, and eastern Germany - are certainly behind the rest."
"While the Member State as a whole must observe the pacts it has signed, it is also true that special relief measures for these areas - I refer to differential taxation, the use of unused Structural Funds for tax credits, new types of aid after 2006 for countries excluded from Objective 1 - should not only not be considered censurable but should be seen as desirable by all."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all those who took part in the debate for their comments and contributions."
"I shall start by pointing out that our economic situation is different from that of the United States. The European Union' s point of departure is quite other from the United States' : our balances are not the same either, what has taken place in the United States has not taken place in Europe and, furthermore, our institutional framework is not the same."
"In my view it would be unrealistic and undesirable to try to apply the American model to Europe."
"It has emerged from the debate that some of you feel our main concern is to prevent public sector involvement."
"That is not at all the case."
"We have never conceived of this issue in terms of a public sector versus private sector debate."
"There is scope for more public investment. There can be more public involvement, always of course within the rules laid down in the system we have created for ourselves to ensure more effective operation of the balance between monetary and fiscal policy."
"The ECOFIN decision on airlines and insurance cover as a result of the political risks involved is a good example of the swift effect of public action."
"The debate then moved on to focus on the Growth and Stability Pact."
"Some of you are of the opinion that those of us in favour of the pact are adopting a fundamentalist position, others find it dogmatic. Some of you have even mooted the possibility of doing away with the pact altogether."
"I would be inclined to side with the presidency and with those of you who have referred to something I consider crucial."
"The Growth and Stability Pact is intended to serve as an instrument to facilitate anticyclical action by the public finances."
"That was its original aim and remains its essential nature."
"Hence there is no question of dogmatism or fundamentalism."
"We could discuss whether our past experience, gained from implementing the pact during periods of growth, has led us to the conclusion that it is only applicable to that end."
"True, in times of growth we were not particularly dogmatic as far as exhausting the possibilities of the pact with regard to reducing the public deficit in certain Member States. We may well be regretting that just now."
"Returning to the logic enshrined in the pact, the pact does allow anticyclical actions."
"There is no doubt that the pact' s flexibility is due to two fundamental elements."
"The first concerns exceptional circumstances and it is not relevant to analyse these now, as exceptional circumstances are only invoked in times of deep recession or when growth has fallen below certain levels. The second element concerns the normal implementation of the pact through the operation of the automatic stabilisers."
"In the specific case of the automatic stabilisers, the element of flexibility is contained in the pact itself. I can state quite clearly that in no way are we amending any position."
"In the code of conduct adopted by ECOFIN last July it was already stated that one of the fundamental elements of the Growth and Stability Pact is the medium-term objective for the fiscal position. It is made quite clear that assessment of the objective for the various countries should take explicit account of the cyclical position and its implications for the budget."
"Clearly, as some of you have pointed out, this element will therefore have to be taken into account when adjusting Member States' stability programmes."
"On occasion, the Commission has insisted that the cyclically adjusted deficit position should be included in information on the stability programmes. You are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that we are experiencing technical difficulties."
"Obviously, rather than making us more flexible, this will allow us to apply the pact to a reality different from that which prevailed when the various stability programmes were defined."
"It further implies as I said in my first speech, that in the Commission' s interpretation nominal objectives must not be considered set in stone."
"The nominal objectives are linked to certain assumptions on growth."
"Consequently, as I stated, there are no problems, there is flexibility and no dogmatism. Rather, we have moved on to a different stage as far as implementation of the Growth and Stability Pact is concerned."
"Would an approach involving greater spending resolve the problems?"
"I do not believe it would."
"Our position is that given the European experience in recent years, involving a rather procyclical approach to this type of decision, and having observed the difficulty experienced in regaining balance, it is not a wise option."
"As I said in my opening speech, we therefore remain of the opinion that the best choice is to opt for more Europe. Some of you have argued along the same lines."
"In the context of Lisbon, more Europe means increasing our potential growth. More Europe means more efficient systems."
"More Europe also means taking greater account of the impact of the crisis on the international markets. It also means taking into account factors as significant as international commercial negotiations on development aid, and all those related factors which will doubtless allow us to improve the context."
"In conclusion, more Europe can also mean progress on issues linked to fiscal competence which some of you have referred to, ladies and gentlemen. There is no doubt about that."
"More Europe will certainly mean progress in the fight against money laundering. All this is undoubtedly essential if we are to cope successfully with the tasks we have set ourselves."
"A debate such as today' s warranted a much longer reply. Unfortunately however, we are running out of time."
"Nonetheless, I was anxious to comment quickly on these ideas to make the Commission' s position on this final item quite clear."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"I have received seven motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Television without frontiers"
"The next item is the report (A5-0286/2001) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the third report of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee, on the application of Directive 89/552/CEE 'Television without frontiers' (COM(2001)9 - C5-0190/2001 - 2001/2086(COS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of the Television without frontiers directive is to establish an EU legal framework to promote the free circulation of audio-visual broadcasting services and to guarantee certain particularly important interests, such as pluralism, cultural diversity, and the protection of consumers and minors."
"We have before us today the Commission's report on the application of the directive for the period 1997 to 2000."
"The key points to emerge from this report are as follows."
"The main objectives of the directive have been achieved, but a thoroughgoing revision of the directive is needed."
"The five main points of the report, very briefly, are these: firstly, the directive has been implemented in 12 Member States, with three yet to follow suit."
"Secondly, the television sector experienced an overall phase of continuous growth between 1997 and 2000."
"This applies both to the number of television channels and also to the total turnover of radio and television broadcasters and to the advertising turnover of both state-owned and private broadcasters."
"Nevertheless, the report indicates that when it comes to trade in television programmes, Europe has a deficit with the United States of some USD 2.9 billion, while the overall deficit of the audio-visual sector is some USD 6.6 billion."
"Thirdly, the 50% quota for European works was clearly exceeded, except in Portugal, falling in a range between 53% and 81%."
"Fourthly, although the provisions on the protection of minors were complied with overall, there needs to be better coordination in future."
"Fifthly, four countries have so far made use of the new provisions under Article 3a about broadcasting events of particular importance to the community, and four others are planning to take advantage of those provisions, particularly for sporting events."
"The committee noted shortcomings in the report with regard to implementation in the candidate countries and in the analysis of trends in media concentration."
"The digital era is now on the way, and the integration of television, PCs and the Internet requires a fundamental revision of the TWF directive so as to create a European legal framework for broadcasting audio-visual material with various degrees of regulation."
"The cornerstones of this should be as follows: first, the rules on advertising should be reviewed and made more flexible; second, the quota arrangements should be reviewed to see if they can continue to be a suitable instrument for promoting European works; third, we must guarantee open and compatible standards for various systems covering rights of access; fourth, there is a need for stronger and more effective self-regulation, particularly as regards the protection of minors; fifth, the trends in vertical and horizontal integration of the media should be analysed, and sixth, a review of the arrangements under Article 3a and how they are to be dealt within future is required."
"I can therefore give my full support to Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 which have been tabled here."
"The preparations for this review process should take into account the exceptional impact of television and new technology on democracy and society, particularly in the digital era."
"The process of gauging public opinion therefore needs to be carried out openly, in a way that takes account of both experts in the audio-visual sector and the views of the public."
"So I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has provided for a broad communication process, and we hope, Commissioner, that in view of the speed with which digital technology is developing you will bring forward your proposed review as soon as possible."
"However, I would like to make an appeal to everyone: we must take advantage of the opportunities for dialogue over the next 18 months to demonstrate that the European Parliament cares about what matters to the public, especially when cultural issues are involved."
"Mr President, I declare an interest as a director of a television documentary company, in which I am now not very active; but I retain my concern for the quality of our broadcasting and television."
"I welcome Mrs Hieronymi's report and salute her for it."
"It goes to the heart of the cultural diversity that we prize in Europe."
"We defend public service obligations - however the service concerned may be financed - and the principles of universal access, which constantly come back in all of our debates now about technology."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken heed of the imbalance in the European audio-visual market place, and I hope the Commissioner will be able speak on this."
"Since 1999 the revenues of European television companies have grown by an average of 46.3%."
"In that time, public-service broadcasting hardly grew at all and creative television production in the five major producing countries of the European Union was sluggish or, in some cases, falling."
"At the same time, US programme sales to Europe - programmes which, as we know, are reaping their tertiary reward, having already cleared their primary and secondary rewards in the US market directly and by satellite and cable - grew massively."
"That is not a healthy situation."
"The protection of the diverse market in Europe remains crucial."
"The imperatives of the technology should be linked to what consumers need, as well as what the production empires want to sell."
"Article 3a, referred to earlier by the rapporteur, shows what can be done to keep the widest audience for special events."
"I too support Mrs Junker's amendments and others on the same point."
"It was a major change for the better and it showed that we can intervene here and in the European Union."
"We need to return to the issue of media concentration and how that relates to the public good, not just in terms of diversity but also in terms of raw political power."
"Finally, we ought to be able to say to the applicant countries: do as we do and not merely as we say."
"That means having rules that are observed, for them as well as for us."
"Mr President, this directive, which was devised in 1989, bears the highly suggestive title 'Television without frontiers' , but one could not really have imagined that it would also be without time limits."
"This area, which was subject to innovative legislation thirteen years ago, has clearly changed radically and to an amazing extent."
"The same even applies to the update we passed in 1997: everything has been left behind by the driving force of new technologies and also fashion."
"We are thus increasingly sure that the review of this directive, until now expected for 2002, will be brought forward to the beginning of next year, without waiting for too many months to go by."
"The last five years have, in fact seen a veritable revolution in the television sector; the old TV has now become a supporting actor, a technical tool in the service of digital innovation, the webcasting invasion, the Internet and interactive relationships between user and broadcaster."
"A global, up-to-date review is also needed because of all the other problems that directly or indirectly surround the world of television, such as the increase in turnover of the networks, the steady and increasingly disturbing invasion by advertising, the explosion of private broadcasters, and the growing social and moral implications of certain programming."
"The scope of the directive needs to be broadened to embrace not only the subjects mentioned above but also others that are already included but are insufficiently developed, such as the problems of intellectual property, respect for children as often unsupervised users, the cultural levels of programmes - taking into account not only the interests and requirements of those who make them but especially the feelings of those at whom these products are targeted - and lastly the confrontation with American productions, a subject on which there was quite a harsh confrontation in 1997 but which remained to a great extent unresolved."
"Lastly, on this subject, I also hope we can again discuss the so-called 'right to information' , a right which, because of equal opportunities, should clearly concern not only the citizens of the European Union but also all those living outside who receive programmes produced inside the EU."
"It is not enough just to guarantee the great sporting events, as we did in 1997, since man does not live on football alone - if you will forgive the pun."
"We must distribute constantly updated information, based on culture and constantly updated, not only to those who live within the European Union but especially to those less favoured by geographical location or social and economic status."
"Everybody' s 'right to a satellite dish' is not enough: you need the money to get one."
"Imagine what can come into houses through a dish in the remotest parts of the world."
"The most precious aid is that reserved for the production of programmes designed to report, safeguard and make proposals, in the sense of safeguarding regional and local cultures."
"Finally, let me renew an invitation to the Member States."
"The rapporteur, whom I congratulate, and whose amendments and positions I support, reminded us that only twelve Member States have so far implemented the directive."
"Well, Commissioner, let us take this opportunity to give the Member States this message again: believe in this directive, because it will become increasingly urgent, current and important, and if you believe us you must first of all implement it!"
"Mr President, we agree that revision of the Television without frontiers directive is urgently needed."
"Firstly, it is needed because the context in which the televisual market operates, as it has been described, is so different from what it was when the directive was last revised that it does not seem feasible to retain the latter for a further two or three years."
"As an estimate, we could say that at most, the directive only covers some 50% of the problems currently experienced in the sector."
"Secondly, revision is required because we need to come up with solutions which were not provided at the time. Television remains the main source of information and entertainment for most Europeans."
"In my view, apart from the issue of the low quality of content, it is beset by three main problems. Too much advertising is broadcast, with no thought for its suitability or the ages and timings involved."
"Doubtless these problems already existed in 1996, but the situation is now critical. This suggests that although the directive has been successful as far as the free circulation of television services within the Community is concerned, it has failed in other important areas."
"The Commission' s communication does not allow us to assess the efforts Member States made to redress the situation in the three years under scrutiny."
"Suffice it to say that three Member States did not even transpose the directive into their legislation."
"Most probably, the results for the remaining Member States were not identical, but the Commission has not made such a comparative study available."
"There is little detail on the situation in the candidate countries. This should feature prominently in the new directive."
"For all these reasons, Mrs Hieronymi has refrained from launching an in-depth debate in her report. I believe she was wise to do so."
"A number of guidelines to inform the process have been laid down. I should like to refer to just a few of these, namely the urgent need to introduce new services based on new technologies, the need to stimulate and accelerate the transition to digital technology and the coordination of the new directive with the revision of the directive on electronic commerce."
"The Socialist Group will therefore vote in favour of the report and endorse two amendments tabled by Mrs Junker. Regarding these amendments, I would like to highlight the need for Community legislation to ensure that events or shows of great interest to the citizens should be protected from digitalisation so that they can be made available to all social classes free of charge."
"Mr President, Commissioner, while I would like, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, to thank the rapporteur for this report, I would also like to echo the previous speaker in drawing attention to the future."
"The Commission' s report states that the next report on the directive must also address issues which are important to the consumer, such as operational compatibility, conditional access and how the transition to digital broadcast technology will take place, but the world may already have moved on by the time the next report is drawn up."
"I would like to remind everyone that, when debating the 'telecom package' , Parliament approved by a large majority the fact that we should demand an open, common standard for TV transmitters and receivers, the only one so far approved in Europe and known as the MHP standard."
"This standard would guarantee a situation in which all consumers knew what applied and one in which they had the confidence to acquire the necessary equipment. It would also guarantee that vertically divided markets did not arise."
"A large majority of Parliament backed this view."
"But what has happened since then?"
"The Commission does not support this decision, and the Council has entirely ignored the issue, which I believe is of immense importance if we are to achieve what is known as Digital Update and promote digital technology in all TV markets."
"I therefore hope that the Commission in its entirety can start to support the demands which have been made by Parliament and which we in the ELDR Group would like to clarify a little."
"The rapporteur has already pointed out this requirement, but I would like to repeat it in order to make it clear to all the services of the Commission."
"Some have said that 'Television without Frontiers' is a loaded title for the directive."
"There is also a special set of problems in this context."
"In many cases we see that the directive has not functioned in the intended manner with regard to opinion-formers or individual consumers who wish to view TV from another country."
"The Commission has found that the way in which copyright is handled prevents it from doing so."
"I hope that this issue too will be debated in greater depth in the future."
"Mr President, there are many who believe that this report does not go far enough in analysing the potential problems facing us as we embark on the revision of the Television without frontiers directive, expected in 2002 as we are all aware."
"However, it raises some very important issues and it is important to start that dialogue now."
"My personal concern is the role of public service broadcasters in this important agenda."
"It is important to recognise that today's public service broadcasting needs to adapt to the changes."
"Today's radio and TV sector is a competitive one and the market forces which largely govern it cannot be ignored. Public service broadcasters have a crucial role to play in the digital world."
"Public service broadcasters make programmes of high quality in indigenous languages reflecting indigenous cultures."
"They also have a crucial role to play in encouraging people to use and understand the new digital media."
"I agree with the Commissioner's statement in a recent communication that broadcasting and culture should remain within the WTO's services category and that this arrangement should be respected."
"Having established that, we then need to be absolutely certain that there is sufficient scope for national and EU legislation to protect public services and cultural entities."
"Robust and determined early regulatory action will be needed to create the open environment we all seek, and one which is in the real interests of all citizens and economies of Europe."
"Europe has to compete in the digital world where consumers and citizens can wander freely and where competition delivers diversity and choice."
"With its complementary mix then of private and public service broadcasters, the European audiovisual model guarantees pluralism of information, cultural diversity and access for all to information, education, entertainment and the arts."
"I will be voting in favour of the report and look forward very much to the forthcoming debates as we look to the future."
"Mr President, I would first of all like to congratulate the rapporteur on the work she has done and also the Commission on such an appropriate initiative."
"Nevertheless, I would like to highlight three aspects which seem to me very important."
"The first is the importance of the audiovisual sector in promoting sport."
"We must not forget that sport contributes to forging an identity and bringing people together, as well as uniting sportspeople and spectators by offering the latter the opportunity to identify with their nation."
"Furthermore, sport is one of the fields of activity which most affects and touches on the citizens of the European Union regardless of their age or social origin, and therefore sport cannot and must not be discriminatory and all the citizens of the European Union must be able to see sporting events."
"They must not be a privilege for the few, since these events are of great importance to our society."
"The second issue is the need to control advertising slots, and I therefore fully support the rapporteur when she backs the Commission' s strategy of carrying out a study on the repercussions of television advertising and TV shopping techniques on minors."
"And the third issue I would like to highlight is my total support for the rapporteur' s request that the Member States strengthen dialogue and cooperation on all issues relating to the protection of minors and young people."
"We cannot aspire to a world without violence when our future adults spend the day watching increasingly violent animated cartoons, films and news items."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in 2000 there were 152 households in the European Union with television sets able to receive over 580 different channels."
"That implies a growth of around 180% in just four years."
"These figures alone should be enough to illustrate that the conventional television market, which only covers a small part of the overall audio-visual sector, is a major growth sector."
"The Commission report shows that the Television without frontiers directive, which was originally highly controversial in my own country in particular, has proved its worth."
"It provides sensible conditions for international broadcasting."
"In the period covered by the report, 50 channels were already aiming chiefly at markets outside their local area."
"The TWF directive closed various regional legal gaps and created binding standards for areas including advertising and the protection of minors, thus creating a level playing field in terms of equal opportunities and competitiveness."
"I welcome the way the Hieronymi report sets all this out."
"However, it also makes it clear that we need to embark as quickly as possible on a new review of the TWF directive, if we are to keep pace with the fast-moving developments in the audio-visual sector in a time of increasing digitalisation."
"That applies not only to the provision of all kinds of multimedia services, it also involves an appropriate approach to the trend in concentration of the media, which is also progressing at a pace that is hard to follow."
"The other side of the coin is the need to ensure freedom of information, diversity of opinion and pluralism, and to establish an essential multimedia foundation to promote European cultural diversity."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate Ruth Hieronymi on her excellent work on this issue."
"Her achievement has been demonstrated by the wide consensus she has obtained on this important but extremely sensitive subject."
"I agree with the general philosophy of her report and with the proposals it contains."
"As regards the method used, I think it is regrettable that the results obtained were not evaluated in relation to the set objectives."
"This would have produced a better picture of the real cultural and economic implications of this directive for each of the Member States and candidate countries."
"On the other hand, I support the wish of the rapporteur and the Commission to propose a revision of the directive, and to do this in parallel with the revision of other directives, after initiating three in-depth studies."
"Only an overall approach will lead in the medium term to the development of a coherent and forceful policy. Please note I am talking about an approach."
"This is something that the directive does not at present provide. The audiovisual sector has undergone profound changes."
"New services have necessitated new technologies and have also led to an increase in the number of broadcasters. As a result, the sector has been completely transformed."
"Consequently, if we want to ensure the continuity of our audiovisual sector, we must now widen the scope of the directive. I have a number of concerns on this matter."
"There continues to be an imbalance between European cinema production and imports from the United States."
"European films rarely reach a European Union audience outside the country where they are produced. Six per cent of European films are shown outside their country of origin."
"Of the total volume of programs, 74% are fictional works imported from America and only 14% are European in origin. As well as simply exporting programmes, major industry players are promoting the export of American thematic television channels to Europe."
"These are sold both to digital grouping operators and cable satellite channels. In addition, Europe lags considerably behind the United States in the development of the digital sector."
"These are the difficult issues confronting us."
"This is why I believe that the only possible response is global and proactive action by the European Union. Over and above the economic and financial issues, which are clearly very important, is the key issue of our cultures, identities and the values we hold dear."
"Mr President, in a previous life you also held the important position of Deputy Mayor of Madrid, so I am sure you and this House in general will be interested to know that we have a high-level deputation from Germany's cities in the public gallery."
"We should offer them a warm welcome."
"We agree with you."
"I see that you are very well informed by a Spanish compatriot of mine."
"Mrs Reding has the floor on behalf of the Commission."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Reding."
"We are also grateful for this impetus you are giving to the revision of directives."
"I am sure that the Commission and the European Parliament will work together to bring us up to date."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Questions to the Council (B5-0333/2001)."
"The Council will be represented by Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, President-in-Office of the Council."
"Question No 1 by (H-0689/01):"
"Subject: The 'Republika Srpska' What policy is the Council Presidency pursuing towards the so-called 'Republika Srpska' in Bosnia-Herzegovina, with particular regard to cooperation with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague and to the return of expellees?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has repeatedly and consistently stressed the great importance the European Union attaches to compliance by the countries participating in the stabilisation and association process with the international obligations relating to the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia and to establishing a lasting settlement on the issue of refugees and displaced persons."
"This forms part of the European Union conditions of the stabilisation and association process. The countries of the Former Yugoslavia subscribed to these conditions at the Zagreb Summit."
"On 11 June the Council approved a report assessing the progress achieved by the countries of the region in relation to these conditions for European integration. The report also contained specific proposals detailing how the countries can continue working towards this aim."
"On that occasion, the Council concluded that Bosnia-Herzegovina had not cooperated sufficiently with the International Criminal Court for the Former Yugoslavia, especially as regards Republika Srpska."
"None of those indicted for war crimes had been arrested by the authorities of Republika Srpska."
"The Council therefore ordered Bosnia-Herzegovina to take further measures to ensure that it complies in full with the Dayton-Paris agreement and collaborates fully with the International Court."
"On that same occasion, the European Union expressed its view that the process of the return of refugees and displaced people throughout the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be speeded up. It was also stated that measures to create the proper conditions to enable people to return should be strengthened."
"The European Union also expressed its hope to see the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska implement all the recommendations that have been made."
"The Council will ensure these matters are monitored."
"This monitoring process will also allow the European Union periodically to assess compliance with the criteria established as part of the stabilisation and association process. This will enable us to assess the level of the relations established, and to decide if the level of technical and economic assistance can still be justified."
"We could certainly use this tool to apply pressure on the governments of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Republika Srpska, should it prove necessary to do so."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I have two short additional questions."
"First, I would like to know if Council has asked the Republica Srpska how many expellees and refugees have now returned to the Republica Srpska."
"Are any figures available on this?"
"Secondly, I would like to ask if cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has had any repercussions on the finances of the Republica Srpska."
"As regards your first question, I am unable to answer this at present but we shall check and see if more accurate figures are available."
"I believe I have already given the beginning of an answer to your second question, in that the Council has clearly indicated that, if the situation does not improve, it may consider revising the funds placed at the disposal of the authorities, both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republika Srpska."
"Question No 2 by (H-0690/01):"
"Subject: European regions, subsidiarity and reform of the treaties Under the weight of so many treaties (the first being Rome and the latest Nice), Europe can no longer be regarded (as far as either individuals or the public as a whole are concerned) as something 'international' ; it is now something 'internal' , not just in economic or market terms but from all points of view."
"The Flemings and the Walloons cannot look upon us Basques (nor the Catalans upon the Finns, the Scots or the Welsh) as foreigners."
"We are all citizens and peoples who belong to Europe."
"Does the Council therefore support the idea put forward some time ago in Belgium by Mr Dreze concerning the setting up within Europe of Euro-entities, that is, non-state political bodies which would be granted EU legal personality so that they could establish and maintain direct relations with the Committee of the Regions, the Commission, the Court of Justice, etc., and conclude valid agreements with other public authorities anywhere in the EU, as an extension of European law?"
"Does the Council not think that this issue should be specifically pursued as an initiative relating to the future of the Union, to be considered under the procedure for debating the reform of the treaties which is to be established at the Laeken European Council?"
"On behalf of the Council, I would remind you that the Union, in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Treaty on European Union, respects the national identity of the Member States, while Article 48 of the same Treaty stipulates that the Intergovernmental Conference has the task of establishing by mutual agreement the amendments to be included in the Treaties."
"During Question Time in July, I was given the opportunity to reply to a number of questions - I believe there were ten in all - about the possible added value which an active and institutionalised participation of so-called sub-state groups would give to the debates at Union level."
"I then said that the Council, without denying the incontrovertible political impact of the Committee of the Regions, was at the time unable to give a detailed response to questions concerning the role of the regional units in the Union' s structures."
"The Council obviously knows the different viewpoints and is carefully following the developments around topics directly related to the balance of power within the European structures, starting with the concept of subsidiarity itself."
"At this stage, on behalf of the Council, all I can do is look to the very near future, that is to say to the forthcoming meeting in Laeken, where the European Council intends to adopt a declaration which will form the basis for creating conditions to guarantee the Union' s future."
"And at that meeting, I have no doubt that the tone will be set for the way in which the preparation of the IGC 2004 will have to be structured and how participation will need to be extended."
"Moreover, I would like to refer you to the very thorough explanation and reply which Minister Michel gave this morning on behalf of the Council, and in which he has already given a few quite specific indications in this connection."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in the Councils of Ministers, decisions are often adopted which affect the exclusive legislative competences of historic nations such as the Basque Country, Catalonia or Scotland, of regions such as Flanders or Wallonia, of federal states such as Bavaria, Baden-Baden, Rhineland, etc."
"Do you not believe that, in the event of a conflict of competences resulting from decisions adopted in the Council without the presence or acquiescence of the historic nations, regions or federal states affected, the latter constitutional entities should be empowered to present their case to the European Court of Justice, since that Court has the power under the Treaty to hear and pass judgment on these conflicts?"
"Do you not believe that the European Council at Laeken should include these issues in the future debate on the Union and the distribution of competences between the Union, the Member States and the other institutional bodies?"
"Mr President, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, although this is an issue about which I am extremely passionate, I do not feel that it would be advisable for us to resume the debate which took place in this House last July."
"I did, I believe, at that point in time answer in a comprehensive manner, partly on behalf of the Council where possible, and partly in my own name."
"Allow me therefore to refer you to the Minutes of that sitting in which you will find all the replies to the questions you have just asked."
"Question No 3 by (H-0691/01):"
"Subject: Working languages in the European Patent Office On Thursday, 31 May 2001, the Council published a common position on the Community patent."
"With regard to the language regime used at the European Patent Office, the text simply notes that translation costs must be limited."
"It is a fundamental principle of the European Union that everybody should be able to address the institutions in any of the eleven official languages."
"Does the Council agree that it must be possible for an application for a patent to be submitted to the European Patent Office in any of the eleven official languages of the EU?"
"If so, how does the Council guarantee that individuals and businesses may submit applications for a patent in any of the eleven official languages?"
"If not, how can the Council justify a position which is so at odds with the official line?"
"Does the Council support the Greek government' s plan to lodge a complaint against the language regime used by the Community Trade Mark Office in Alicante?"
"It is correct that on 31 May 2001, the Council adopted a common position on the Community patent with the aim of furthering future discussions on this subject."
"With regard to the language regime used at the European Patent Office, the common position posits that it must be based on a number of principles which apply universally, including the principle of non-discrimination."
"In order to curb the cost of translation, further consideration must be given to the various suggestions made in this connection, including technical translation aids, without ruling out other options a priori."
"Having regard to these guidelines, the Council recently started discussing the provisions presented in the Commission proposal for a regulation on the Community patent, as well as the other solutions which have been provided for consideration by various Member States."
"In any case, the honourable Member will understand that the Council is not prepared at this time to adopt a clearer position concerning this motion for a resolution, including the linguistic aspects involved, as long as the European Parliament, consulted in accordance with Article 308 of the Treaty, has not issued a recommendation on the matter."
"The Council would remind the honourable MEP that the language regime of the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market is established by the Regulation on the Community Trade Mark. This regulation was adopted unanimously by the Council following the agreement reached at the Conference of government representatives at the level of Heads of State and Government on 29 October 1993."
"Moreover, with regard to the steps taken by the Greek government in case T-120/99, the Council is taking note of the judgment pronounced in this case by the Court of First Instance. This judgment rejects the appeal, as well as the arguments, of the requesting party against the language regime of that office."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, as we have come to expect of you, you are being extremely polite to the European Parliament."
"It is very considerate of you to refer to Article 308."
"We all know that Article 308 concerns a unanimous decision taken by the Council following a recommendation from Parliament."
"So that is why you are waiting before adopting a clear stance."
"I can understand that, but despite this, we must all realise that there appears to be only a few Member States, including Portugal, Spain, Greece, Finland and Italy, which are strongly opposed to the exclusive use of French, English and German."
"All the other Member States, including my own country, unfortunately, agree to the very limited application of this language regime."
"I would now like to ask you whether it would not be preferable to guarantee that the key elements of such a patent, namely the conclusions, which hardly take up two to three pages, are at least made available in all the languages."
"That would considerably enhance the legal certainty of the citizens and business people in the European Union."
"There would then be no need to translate twenty or thirty pages, rather only the conclusions."
"I believe that we would thus bring Europe a little closer to the citizen."
"Some time ago, I was given the opportunity to look into this matter more deeply."
"The suggestion by Mr Staes is one of the suggestions which are currently being tabled."
"President-in-Office, European industry is losing its competitive edge in regard to reaching the targets that you and the Council set for it at Lisbon by the extreme cost and time delays involved in obtaining patents in Europe."
"I believe the Belgian presidency undertook to make a special effort to have the Community patent installed and implemented during its presidency."
"I would be interested to know what progress is being made and whether you really are resolving the language issue in the European Patent Office."
"Efforts are under way."
"The Council Presidency has decided to consult each government individually and confidentially in what is called in French la procédure du confessional, in order to see whether it is possible to proceed, and with the firm desire to reach an agreement by the end of the year if at all possible."
"Of course this matter does not rest with us alone."
"There has to be agreement across the board, and we are working on this."
"I should just like to underline Mr Staes's point on the importance of the language regime, while not ignoring the importance of the point my colleague, Mr Purvis, has made about the need for speed."
"Nevertheless, the whole business of taking research on to the development stage is important."
"If we are to have good research in all the universities and all the areas of the Community, it is really important for people to be able to work in their own language, even though, of course, most scientists work in English much of the time."
"We take note of your statement, which is not a question."
"Mr MacCormick, did you want to add anything?"
"My question was implicit: does the Minister agree?"
"Yes!"
"We say in Castilian 'lo bueno, si breve, dos veces bueno' [the good, if brief, is twice as good]."
"That is clearly the case here."
"As the author is not present, Question No 4 lapses."
"Question No 5 by , which has been taken over by Mr Bautista Ojeda (H-0696/01):"
"Subject: European Maritime Safety Agency Has the Spanish government submitted a proposal for the siting of the European Maritime Safety Agency?"
"Has the government suggested that the Agency be sited in Galicia, in view of Galicia's strategic location as far as Atlantic traffic is concerned and its importance as a maritime centre?"
"The Commission' s proposal concerning the establishment of a European Maritime Safety Agency, presented at the end of last year within the context of the 'Erika II' package, is still under consideration by the Council authorities, and the question of where this future agency is to be based remains unanswered."
"To date, the Council has not received an official proposal from the Spanish government concerning the agency' s headquarters."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have not commented because clearly, as you said, the Spanish State has still not made any formal proposal."
"I would like to refer to an objective fact: Spain has always had a great maritime vocation and enjoys a privileged situation in terms of both Atlantic and Mediterranean maritime traffic, and I believe that some of those Spanish coastal territories meet all the appropriate conditions for being the location for the headquarters of this European agency."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bautista Ojeda."
"I would remind Members that this is Question Time and not a time to make statements or advocate certain proposals."
"So in the future please try to ask questions."
"At least give the impression of asking a question."
"Mrs Korhola has the floor for a supplementary question."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the representative of the Council what the general timetable is for deciding to establish planned agencies such as the Maritime Safety Agency and, in particular, the Food Safety Agency, and is the intention to take the decision on all of them in one go or separately for each agency?"
"As I have pointed out, this question is still under discussion."
"As you know, this question relates to decisions concerning several agencies."
"On this extremely sensitive issue, as you can well imagine, we aim to reach agreement on all the unanswered questions by the end of the year, and I hope that we are successful in achieving this aim."
"Question No 6 by (H-0699/01):"
"Subject: Illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco What action is the Council planning to take in order to control illegal immigration into the European Union through Morocco, with a view to preventing any recurrence of the tragic events which have occurred this summer, involving the loss of human life in Community waters?"
"Illegal immigration into the European Union via Morocco is permanently on the Council' s agenda."
"For that reason, the Council set up a High-Level Group in December 1998 to deal with asylum and migration issues. This group is responsible for drawing up action plans for a number of countries of origin of asylum seekers and/or illegal immigrants."
"With a view to drafting these action plans, the group has pursued a cross-pillar approach which takes account of a number of aspects related to foreign policy, economic development and the management of migration flows."
"One of the countries that has been earmarked for such an action plan is Morocco."
"In October 1999, the Council adopted an action plan which provides for measures that pertain, inter alia, to the fight against illegal immigration."
"The European Council of Tampere subsequently approved the action plans and expressed the wish that the measures it contains be carried out in the framework of a partnership with the countries involved."
"At the initial session of the Moroccan-European Union Association Committee in Rabat in February 2001, it was agreed to set up a working party on social issues and migration."
"This working party, established by decision of the Association Council of 4 April 2001, met for the first time in July and has indeed set up an informal group for migration between the European Union and Morocco."
"At that meeting, three topics were flagged as priority topics for cooperation in the field of immigration."
"The first topic was socio-economic cooperation and, in particular, assistance for micro- enterprises and for small and medium-sized companies."
"Secondly, there was the topic of guidance concerning legal migration to the European Union and the fight against illegal immigration networks, including transit-migration from countries south of the Sahara."
"For each of those topics from the High-Level Group' s action plan, a dossier will be drawn up concerning the projects to be carried out jointly."
"Each dossier will contain a description of the project, an indicative description of the resources to be deployed, the budget line which will be required and a timeframe for the implementation of the project."
"Each dossier will be communicated through diplomatic channels to the other party, which may then add its own proposals."
"The Association Council which meets on 9 October will exchange ideas on migration and will add renewed momentum to the cooperation efforts in that field."
"In the light of the particularly tragic events which have unfolded in recent weeks in Morocco and the EU countries, this is a weighty matter indeed."
"Finally, Morocco will, in the person of its Minister for Justice, Mr Azziman, also be taking part in the Ministerial Conference on migration, which will take place on 16 and 17 October at the European Parliament in Brussels, an event which I will be attending as well."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I thank you for your detailed reply, but I would like to ask a couple of supplementary questions because I put this question before the tragic events of 11 September."
"The Council is aware of the current security problems on our continent."
"So I would firstly like to ask whether the Council is aware that we have an open border across which the European Union' s security cannot be guaranteed?"
"And in this regard, whether the Council is aware that every day hundreds, and every month thousands, of people are losing their lives as a result of maintaining this deceptively open border, because many of those who try to cross it die in the process?"
"That is to say, what can the Council do to prevent this human tragedy from continuing and to guarantee the security of the citizens of the European Union?"
"Mr President, I can only say to Mr Medina Ortega that we are of course aware of all the aspects, both on a human scale and in terms of security, which contribute to the gravity of the situation."
"As I mentioned just now, I myself was only recently in Morocco, in Tangier, where I really saw the extent of the problem caused by illegal immigration across the strait, which in certain places really earns its name as it is barely 12 or 14 kilometres wide at its narrowest point."
"Of course, we are aware of this problem and this is why all these initiatives have been implemented."
"I also know from the contacts I made whilst on my trip to Morocco, which was not on behalf of the European Union but in my role as Belgian Minister, that the Moroccan authorities are also acutely aware of this problem."
"They too do not watch with a light heart as members of the population embark on such perilous missions."
"What does, however, occasionally upset the Moroccan authorities, and this I can understand, is that we sometimes tend to establish a little too easily a link between people from Morocco and security risks."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, in 1998 this House adopted my proposal for a common European border police."
"However, by the beginning of this year neither the old Italian government nor the German government had adopted this."
"I would like to ask you if the Council has made any further progress with this issue of a common European border police or if anything is planned in this area under the Belgian Presidency."
"What I can tell Mr Posselt is that the question of border security concerns us intensely and that this is actually one of the priority areas on which our presidency is to take action, certainly in view of the fact that enlargement of the European Union will mean a corresponding extension of these borders."
"This is therefore an extremely significant goal to which we attach a great deal of importance and progress towards which we are monitoring extremely closely."
"The same sort of illegal immigration is taking place on a huge scale via Turkey to the Aegean and the Greek islands."
"First, do these plans for Morocco include Turkey?"
"Secondly, has the Council taken any action vis-à-vis Turkey, which has been granted candidate status and therefore has an additional obligation towards the European Union to guard its borders properly?"
"Hordes of illegal immigrants can hardly pass by unnoticed."
"What has the Council done about this?"
"I can only repeat what I have just said."
"This is an issue of very great concern to us, the more so because my country is one of the preferred countries of destination for illegal migration."
"We are fully aware of the problem in all its aspects and we are working very hard on it and addressing all third parties on the subject."
"Question No 7 by (H-0705/01):"
"Subject: Illegal conferral of Greek citizenship and a large number of violations of Community law established by a formal administrative inquiry A formal administrative inquiry held in the Greek Embassy in Moscow has uncovered not only a number of breaches of discipline, but also evidence that offences were committed with the purpose of illegally granting Greek citizenship."
"In view of both the large number of 'repatriations' (some 150 000 processed by the Moscow Embassy) and the fact that significant information was concealed by officials of this Embassy, a further judicial inquiry is now being sought to shed light on this matter."
"It should be pointed out that all these violations have taken place despite Greece's full participation in the Schengen acquis."
"Given that in the elections in the Year 2000 votes were cast by persons who were not entitled to do so, which creates a serious political problem, will the Council say:"
"What is its position on the illegal naturalisations in question and the large number of illegal 'repatriations' on the basis of the Schengen acquis?"
"Will it bear these findings in mind, given that, according to the answer to my Written Question E-1438/01, the Greek government has not so far provided any information about the number of illegal naturalisations and 'repatriations' for 1999 and 2000? What measures does it intend to take to prevail upon the Greek government to provide these figures and to put an end to the practices in question, to ensure transparency and to annul all the illegal naturalisations?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised by Mr Trakatellis concern the naturalisation of citizens in a Member State of the European Union and the repatriation of these citizens."
"Mention is made of suspicions surrounding practices which are currently the subject of an inquiry that the public prosecutor has been asked to carry out."
"Lastly, the question conjures up a presumed link between these practices and the Schengen Agreements."
"I must point out that the Council is not qualified to comment on the circumstances in which Member States may or may not grant citizenship."
"In fact, naturalisation policy falls within the competence of the Member States."
"Therefore, in the case in question, the application of these provisions falls within the competence of the Greek government, which Mr Trakatellis should address directly for the answers to the questions he has raised."
"Finally, the Council feels that, for details of immigration and statistics concerning the number of naturalisations, Mr Trakatellis could usefully refer to the reply given to him in July by the Commission in response to question E-1438/01 concerning the years prior to that mentioned here and ask the Commission to provide him with the figures for 1999 and 2000 as soon as these are available."
"Thank you for your reply."
"I shall take your advice as regards the figures for 1999 and 2000 which, I should point out, the Commission was unable to give me even yesterday because it did not yet have them, even though it is 2001 and the Member States naturally have a duty under the Schengen Agreement."
"I should like to ask you specifically: if and insofar as a Member State naturalises a person or persons, can that person, once they have obtained a passport or an identity card from the Member State, live anywhere in the European Union?"
"If it later emerges that they should not have been naturalised, is the Member State which naturalised them obliged to pass this information on to the other Member States so that the person who has no right to live in the European Union can be located?"
"And if it has this duty towards Europol and the other Member States, my question is this: has the Greek government provided this information?"
"We have proof that there are people who have obtained Greek nationality but were not entitled to do so."
"I can only repeat what I have just said."
"The granting of nationality is an exclusive competence of the Member States."
"That does not answer my question."
"I do not dispute the fact that nationality is granted by the Member States, my question is: what happens when it should not have been granted and the person is living in another Member State?"
"How will that person later be located?"
"What practical method do we have for locating him or her?"
"Again, as the granting of nationality falls within the competence of the Member States, it is up to the judiciary of the Member State concerned to decide whether the obtaining of nationality by illegal means, if proven, warrants any given action."
"That is a matter for the Member State."
"It is not for the Council or the European Union to decide what should happen."
"If one holds a passport, one can use it."
"Question No 8 by (H-0715/01):"
"Subject: The EU's most federalist country According to press reports, the Belgian Prime Minister, Guy Verhofstadt, has called Finland Europe' s most federalist country."
"Does the representative of the country holding the presidency stand by this definition, and on what measure of familiarity with Finnish affairs can it possibly be based?"
"Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I invite you to answer the question by Mr Esko Olavi Seppänen."
"I believe that it refers to Finland."
"I am sorry I missed that one."
"I understand quite a lot of Spanish but not everything."
"Sometimes I think I am fortunate not to understand everything."
"I thank the honourable Member for his question, but as the quoted statements were not made by Prime Minister Verhofstadt in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council, it is difficult for me to comment on them on behalf of the Council, which I represent here today."
"Mr President, Minister, when Sweden held the presidency, the custom was that if the Minister did not answer the question asked him or her in this session the possibility of providing a written reply also existed."
"I remember Sweden' s European Minister very often replying in writing to questions on which he or she, as President-in-Office of the Council, did not want to take a stand."
"I would therefore ask Belgium' s representative if she could continue the policy adopted by Sweden in this matter and reply to me in writing, in her capacity as Belgian Minister, stating the answer to this question, and also which country Belgium considers to be the most federalist state in Europe; the totally unfounded claim has been put forward that this country would be Finland."
"This claim was made by the Belgian Prime Minister, at a press conference during the Belgian presidential term, to be exact."
"I can only repeat what I said."
"The statement was made by Mr Verhofstadt in his capacity as Prime Minister of Belgium, not as President-in-Office of the Council."
"Therefore I cannot, on behalf of the Council, comment on those statements."
"Question No 9 by (H-0717/01):"
"Subject: Cooperation agreement with Iran and legislative reforms in respect of women With reference to the political dialogue between the European Union and Iran and to the most recent meeting (in September) of the Troika in Tehran, will such cooperation and dialogue lead to any improvement in the legal situation of Iranian women?"
"What progress is expected to be made?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the main aim of the European Union's policy towards Iran is to encourage internal reforms in that country."
"The issue of human rights is an important point in the political dialogue with Iran."
"Any future trade and cooperation agreement with this country must also include human rights clauses."
"During the recent round of political dialogue which took place in Tehran on 3 September, the European Union raised the topic of human rights along with the issues of judicial reforms and democratic rights, including freedom of expression and the press, the death penalty and recent cases involving the stoning of women."
"As regards the situation of Iranian women, improvement not only of their legal status but also of the concrete reality of their situation is a specific aim of the dialogue."
"The European Union noted with interest the efforts of the Iranian government and Parliament to introduce new legislation geared towards women and girls."
"I am referring, for example, to the draft law designed to raise the legal age of marriage for girls to 15 and to the draft law giving women the right to unconditional divorce."
"Unfortunately, the Council can, to date, only regret that these efforts have still not come to anything due to opposition from other Iranian bodies, most notably the Council of Guardians."
"At the last session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the European Union took the initiative of tabling a resolution on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran."
"The Swedish Presidency submitted a draft resolution on behalf of the European Union at this session."
"This resolution was adopted on 20 April this year."
"The Commission on Human Rights, according to the terms of this resolution, welcomes the improvement seen in the area of women' s education and health and their participation in democratic life in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as the efforts made to improve the situation of women and girls, particularly by means of laws designed to raise the legal age of marriage and lift the ban barring unmarried women from studying abroad. However, the Commission is also gravely concerned by the fact that these drafts have yet to be enacted in law."
"Enactment would be a way of putting an end to the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice and a way of removing the obstacles preventing women and girls from exercising their fundamental rights fully and equally."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply, which I believe offers hope in an area in which there are serious difficulties."
"I would like to ask the Council whether it would be in favour of carrying out monitoring, even of agreeing a timetable on the progress made in relation to the situation of women in terms of laws, because the Council is aware, like us, that if these improvements are not introduced into laws, they will not be consolidated."
"I therefore believe that the Council is working very seriously and in agreement with the European Parliament in this area, but does the Council not believe that at some point it would be good to agree a timetable for introducing this progress and these improvements into laws since that is the only way to consolidate them?"
"Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would like to reply by saying that you have of course made an interesting suggestion."
"I believe that the main thing as regards the development of the situation is that the political dialogue now seems to be well under way and, moreover, in a serious fashion, and I believe that we must all, each at our own level, endeavour to keep this dialogue going, to broaden it and, above all, to continue and maintain it in order to encourage those among the authorities who are working for progress to continue to make headway in this direction."
"Question No 10 by (H-0719/01):"
"Subject: Repatriating Mobotu funds While welcoming the Belgian law allowing individuals to seek the arrest of suspected war criminals visiting Belgium, would the President-in-Office of the Council indicate who had been tried for the crimes committed in the former Congo and will he indicate what measures have been taken to repatriate funds lodged in Belgian and other banks in the name of the former 'President' Mobotu of Zaire and the steps that have been taken in order to confiscate former family assets in Brussels?"
"The response is as follows : the question that was put by the honourable MEP falls outside of the Council' s competence."
"The Belgian Presidency has probably been the best presidency I have witnessed in the 18 years I have been a Member of this House."
"It is making an impact with the citizens."
"My question does not just refer to the Mobotu funds that are spread throughout Europe and lying dormant in banks or are perhaps being used by undesirable types."
"It also deals with the law in Belgium which apparently allows the arrest of people suspected of war crimes."
"There was the recent case of the Israeli Prime Minister being threatened with legal action."
"My question also relates to the historical responsibility of the European Union, including the presidency, for colonialism and for the atrocities committed in various states."
"For instance, would the President-in-Office tell me who so far has been charged with complicity in the murder of President Lumumba and the installation of the psychopath Mobotu, which resulted in great pain for the former colony of the Congo?"
"I would like to tell the honourable Member that, when I told him his questions concerned matters not within the competence of the Council, I was referring to his questions as a whole."
"Questions concerning the Belgian government should be addressed to the latter."
"I am here to represent the Presidency of the Council of the entire European Union, as you very well know."
"(Protests from Mr Andrews)"
"The reply of the President-in-Office is clear."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you have the floor if you wish."
"That is rather a personal point."
"I am not afraid to answer but this morning Minister Michel was here."
"He spoke at length about the way the Durban Conference went."
"If you had questions about your and my and other people's colonial past, then that was the moment to ask them, to make your remarks and to formulate your criticisms."
"Question No 12 by (H-0724/01):"
"Subject: Registration in the SIS Large-scale demonstrations and major clashes between certain groups of demonstrators and the police occurred in connection with the European Council meeting in Gothenburg and the G8 meeting in Genoa."
"In both Gothenburg and Genoa, the police used excessive force and abusive tactics, including assaults on and the arbitrary arrest and improper treatment of non-violent demonstrators."
"Most of those arrested during the two demonstrations have since not been charged with any offence."
"Can the Council guarantee that demonstrators who were arrested and identified, but are not suspected of any criminal offence, will not be registered in the SIS?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the questions raised by Messrs Papayannakis and Sjöstedt concern, on the one hand, the conditions surrounding the reinstatement of internal border controls in a Member State which applies the Schengen acquis and, on the other hand, the conditions for the entry of an alert in the 'Schengen Information System' in relation to the events at the G8 meeting in Genoa."
"As regards the first point, this situation does not in fact correspond to what the two Members have referred to in their question as, and I quote, ""an abolition of the validity of the Schengen Convention"" ."
"The reinstatement of border controls is a measure which is explicitly laid down in Article 2 item 2 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement."
"And this article, along with the method of applying this article adopted in 1995 by the governments of those Member States applying the Schengen acquis, is part of the Schengen acquis, incorporated into European Union law."
"The Italian authorities felt that public order or national security required that national border checks appropriate to the situation be carried out at internal borders for the duration of the G8 Summit in Genoa, more specifically from 14 to 21 July 2001."
"This was admittedly an exceptional measure, but a measure that other Member States have used in the past during political or sporting events or during events which could have involved a threat to public order."
"Turning now to the second point, I refer the two Members to the answer that we gave on the same subject at the June 2001 part-session, namely that the Council is not qualified to answer the question as to whether an alert was issued in the 'Schengen Information System' for certain individuals involved in these events."
"Entry of an alert in the SIS actually falls within the competence of the Member States."
"Let me point out that, according to Article 94 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement, and I quote: 'The Schengen Information System shall contain only the categories of data which are supplied by each of the Contracting Parties, as required for the purposes laid down in Articles 95 to 100."
"The Contracting Party issuing an alert shall determine whether the case is important enough to warrant entry of the alert in the Schengen Information System."
"Furthermore, Article 104 stipulates that, and I quote: 'Alerts shall be governed by the national law of the Contracting Party issuing the alert unless more stringent conditions are laid down in this Convention' ."
"Finally, may I remind Mr Sjöstedt that the Schengen acquis was published in Official Gazette L 239 on 22 September 2000."
"Mr President, I would like to speak in French, if I may, so that I can make myself understood more easily."
"Thank you for your answer, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, and for the information that you gave."
"I knew the details regarding the Schengen Agreement but it is useful to have confirmation of them."
"My first point, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is that I am not talking about abolition."
"Your translation services have made a mistake - I am talking about suspension."
"This is a different concept altogether and this is the correct word."
"I sincerely apologise for writing in Greek."
"My second point, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, is that you spoke of the reinstatement of checks."
"In the case that I mention in my question, however, involving the 150 young people from Greece who were banned before they even left their ship in the port of Ancona, they did not undergo any checks at all."
"That is why I put to you the following question - when the Schengen Agreement is suspended, which legal status is applicable?"
"I would guess that it is the status laid down generally by the treaty, in other words, free movement with passport control."
"The passports of the Greek citizens were not checked, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck."
"This, forgive me for saying so, is totally illegal, it is deplorable and what is more, this is a matter for the European courts."
"And, in my view, it is a matter for you, the Council or the Commission."
"Once again, Mr Papayannakis, I can only repeat what I said."
"I apologise if there has been a mistake in translation."
"You have rectified the situation."
"As for your other points, I have taken note of the comments that you made and I shall pass these on."
"I think it is incredibly serious that the Council of Ministers is unable to answer the question of whether people who are neither suspected of a crime nor have committed a crime are registered in the EU data system, SIS."
"The issue is that of whether the SIS can fulfil the most fundamental requirements of the rule of law."
"I nonetheless interpret the Council' s reply as indicating that it is possible for a Member State, unsupervised, to choose to place a person on the SIS register without the person in question being suspected of, or convicted of, a crime, but with him or her having simply taken part in a demonstration and been identified by the police."
"This is entirely unacceptable in such cases and in breach of normal legal practice."
"Perhaps you can confirm that if a state registers someone who has not committed a crime, then that person will remain on the SIS register, and it will be possible to obtain information about the fact when the person concerned passes external border controls and when an internal Schengen check is carried out."
"The only thing I can confirm is that it is the responsibility of the Member States to enter personal data into the Schengen Information System."
"Under the Convention they are obliged to see to it that the importance of the situation justifies any such input into the system."
"This is, then, the responsibility of the Member States."
"This is a genuine point of order, Mr President."
"In her answer, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated that she has taken my question into account and that she will pass it on."
"Does that mean that I will, at a later date, at some point receive a reply?"
"What I said was that we shall look into your questions in greater detail beforehand, and if it appears that they refer to matters that fall within the Council' s remit, we will be able to give you an answer."
"If it appears, however, that one or more Member States are solely responsible for the issue as a whole, I shall be unable to give you an answer on behalf of the Council."
"Thank you very much, Madam President-in-Office of the Council."
"The President-in-Office has replied and, depending on what happens, Mr Papayannakis will have the appropriate mechanisms to address the Council."
"As they deal with the same subject, Questions No 13 and 14 will be taken together."
"Question No 13 by (H-0721/01):"
"Subject: Priorities for the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children On 5 July 2001, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the European Union's positions in the UNGA Special Session on Children, which is being held at the end of September."
"In its resolution, Parliament called on the Council to report to it on EU efforts and priorities for the Special Session and on EU actions during the Special Session."
"Where is that report?"
"In what way has the Council taken account of Parliament's call for support for the view that the family is the fundamental unit of society and that the theme of the Session 'A World Fit for Children' has to be at the same time 'A World Fit for Families'?"
"Question No 14 by (H-0722/01):"
"Subject: EU position on the UN World Summit for Children As it was voted on 5 July 2001, the resolution on the EU position for the UNGASS for Children states that 'the Family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children'."
"Can the Council inform us why the EU delegation at the UN promotes the term, 'the Family in its various forms' as the fundamental unit of society, and who agreed this re-interpretation since the July vote?"
"Also, in the light of the fact that the term 'reproductive health services' has been publicly defined at the UN as including abortion, can the Council explain why the EU delegation at the UN supports 'universally accessible health care and services, including sexual and reproductive health' and how this can be reconciled with the Council's answer of 14 March 2001 in which it states that 'on the specific issue of abortion, the Council recalls that national abortion legislation does not fall under Community competence'."
"First of all, I would remind you that the European Union as such has no official status with, nor is it accredited to the United Nations."
"Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international conferences and that they shall uphold the EU' s common positions."
"The EU' s common positions, also on matters which concern the questions put by the honourable Members, are coordinated and agreed upon in the framework of the common foreign and security policy and require unanimity from all EU Member States."
"As soon as an EU position has been adopted by the Member States, it is included in the negotiating process with other members of the United Nations community."
"Since it is the international community' s wish to reach consensus on the draft documents for the United Nations Special Assembly on children, the respective positions and wordings pertaining to the draft documents are the subject of constant negotiation and adaptation with a view to reaching agreement on the draft action plan which might receive full UN backing."
"In addition, reference is once again made to Article 152(5) of the Treaty which stipulates that ""Community action in the field of public health shall fully respect the responsibilities of the Member States for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care."""
"With regard to the concepts 'family' and 'reproductive health care' , the Member States have drawn on the language that was agreed upon during several previous UN world conferences, namely those of Cairo, Beijing and Copenhagen."
"The Special Session on Children has, as a result of the terrorist attacks in the United States, been put on the back-burner."
"The presidency will report to the European Parliament on the European Union' s efforts and priorities within the context of regular information on the development of the common foreign and security policy, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Treaty."
"However, I can inform you now that the European Union, during preparations of this special session, has expressed the resolve to do everything in its power to bring about a world which really pays attention to children."
"Our actions in this field must be based on the International Convention on the Rights of the Child."
"It remains the reference instrument par excellence."
"The countries that have ratified the Convention - and I am referring to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child - must implement it in full, and those countries that have not yet ratified it, should do so as a matter of urgency."
"The document that will be approved by the special General Assembly must be geared towards action and must pursue the following objectives."
"First of all, we must invest in our children."
"Forgive me for using an economic term."
"A great deal of attention and care must be devoted to sound upbringing, one that is worthy of children, to their health, their well-being and their development, and resources must be set aside for that purpose."
"In addition, children must be protected."
"They must be protected from the effects of conflicts, abuse, violence and all forms of discrimination, exploitation, conscription into the armed forces, as well as from anti-personnel mines, epidemics and HIV/AIDS, in particular."
"These are all scourges which affect them particularly cruelly."
"Finally, children must also be heard, and they must be able to take part in the decisions that affect them."
"Children must indeed be considered key figures in the mapping out of the course of their own development."
"I would like to express my thanks for the reply, but I should nonetheless like to say that, in all the important comments made towards the end of your reply, you did not actually mention the family among those initiatives you emphasised as being in the best interests of the child."
"Was this pure coincidence?"
"In Paragraph 1 of the European Parliament resolution of 5 July 2001 on the EU positions at the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children, we state the following: 'family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection, upbringing and development of children' ."
"In other words, it says 'family' , not 'family in its various forms' ."
"How do you interpret the position of the European Parliament, and how do you value a mother and a father supporting their children in their development?"
"Why has the EU acted in a way which means that the concept of family has in fact been changed?"
"That is a very philosophical question, Mr Sacrédeus. I am not going to interpret what you have said, but that is the impression I have as President."
"We must ask specific questions, but I accept your question and the President-in-Office will answer it."
"If you wish to add anything, you have the floor."
"That is your own assessment, Mr President."
"You are Vice-President for me and all the other Members too."
"I asked specific questions about the concept of family."
"The last time I asked a question too, you also chose to believe that I was presenting philosophical questions and comments."
"I asked the Belgian Presidency specific questions."
"I request that you, as a competent Vice-President, show respect for all Members, including Swedish Christian Democrats."
"I am assuming that this will be the last time you offend a Member in this way."
"Philosophy and ethics are important issues even for you."
"Mr Sacrédeus, I have enormous respect for all Members."
"I have accepted your question."
"But as legal administrator for this Question Time, sometimes I can and must express the opinion that they are very general."
"Your question is in order and I have not criticised it at all."
"I have said that it seems very general, but the President-in-Office will reply to it."
"There is no problem."
"Please be assured that the Christian Democrats warrant my absolute respect."
"Mr President, if I may, I shall answer all three at the same time."
"Two other Members also wanted to speak."
"I can answer all three together, or do I have to answer each question individually?"
"We usually reply question by question."
"Furthermore, for Mr Sacrédeus' s benefit, it is better that you reply to him directly."
"Unless the interpreters have omitted some of what I said, which would surprise me, I think that I have given a general answer."
"My personal views on the family are of no relevance at all to the debate that we are having."
"I have the greatest respect for the family, but that has no relevance to the debate underway here."
"The question is what is the position of Member States, since it is the Member States who must unanimously adopt and define their position regarding the work of the United Nations General Assembly on Children."
"I have given you some information on this issue."
"I stated that Member States are using the same terminology as that used at the United Nations global conferences, in other words at the conferences in Cairo, Peking and Copenhagen."
"This is a political indication of the way in which Member States are working to define a unanimous position concerning the United Nations conference on Children."
"I thank the President-in-Office for her answer."
"It took a great deal of time to establish how Parliament's position would be presented at the UN Special Session."
"A general meeting was held where candidate countries and, indeed, the Commissioner were present."
"He made the very concrete statement that the child cannot be dealt with in isolation but in the context of the family and community."
"We took a general vote and there was an overwhelming desire to make a special reference to the child in the context of the family."
"We then debated a proposed position for Parliament, which was voted on in this Chamber."
"It is our responsibility therefore to ensure that the wishes, not just of Parliament but also of the candidate countries who had travelled here and of the Member State representatives who came, concerning the position on the family are accurately presented, otherwise our time has been wasted."
"As the UN definition of reproductive health services is so much in conflict with our position as stated in the Treaties - in particular with the protocol of my country - does the Council intend to challenge this publicly stated definition or to change the definition of reproductive health services within the institutions of the EU?"
"Whatever our personal feelings on this or other subjects, we need to work within the existing legal frameworks."
"I started my answer by reminding you that the European Union as such is not a member of the United Nations and enjoys no special status in its relations with the United Nations."
"I reminded you further that the Member States have undertaken to coordinate their positions in the international organisations of which they are members or the international fora in which they act or participate."
"This is the legal framework in which such conferences are prepared."
"Thus the European Parliament resolution is certainly of interest to the different Member States, but cannot possibly - with all due respect - be considered binding on them."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, you gave the issue of public health a special mention."
"I would be interested to know how you see the division of responsibilities between the United Nations and the World Health Organisation."
"What are your priorities here?"
"I apologise for not being able to speak German well enough to be able to give you an answer in German, especially using specialised vocabulary, but I do understand it."
"The questions regarding the structure of the various international - even world-wide - institutions are all very interesting, but will lead us nowhere."
"Moreover, the Council, as it stands, has no position on this subject that I could communicate to you on its behalf."
"I can express my personal views, which may be of interest to you, but they will not make the slightest difference because they do not convey the position of the Council."
"My personal view is that it is high time for all the international institutions, wherever they are based, to cooperate more closely and to coordinate their respective policies more effectively than they have done so far."
"I am not going to make any judgment. I am simply going to ask you, when you have time, to reread Annex II (point A: Guidelines) in relation to the procedure for Question Time laid down in Rule 43."
"Simply that: we should all read it when we have time."
"As the author is not present, Question No 15 lapses."
"Question No 16 by (H-0727/01):"
"Subject: Further judgments of the European Court of Human Rights against Turkey in the case of Leyla Zana and three other Members of Parliament Ruling on 17 July 2001 in cases 29900/96 - 29903/96, the European Court of Human Rights fined Turkey 110 000 dollars for continuing to detain the Sacharov prize-winner Leyla Zana and three other Members of Parliament in Turkish prisons."
"In view of the fact that Turkey systematically ignores the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, can the Council provide evidence that Turkey intends to comply with the above judgments of the Court?"
"Can the Council provide a list of ECHR judgments which Turkey continues to ignore?"
"What measures does it intend to take?"
"The Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that the judgments quoted by him have been passed by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg."
"In other words, the Court established by the Council of Europe and not by the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg."
"At the moment, the European Union has no specific reason to believe that Turkey will not be falling in with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in this instance."
"On a wider scale, neither does the European Union have a list of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights with which Turkey is said to have failed to conform."
"The Council of the European Union would remind you that it has no authority whatsoever to implement the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights."
"However, on behalf of the Council, I would like to emphasise that the Union, particularly within the framework of the strengthened dialogue with Turkey, seizes every opportunity to stress the obligation resting on that country to observe all international agreements it has entered into; particularly in the field of human rights, obviously including the decisions by the European Court of Human Rights."
"Within the framework of the partnership for the accession of Turkey, the European Union has stipulated that Turkey must respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and guarantee that it will ensure that these are also translated into practice."
"The Council will follow Turkey' s progress from close range once the Commission has submitted its report on this matter."
"I can therefore only reiterate that the Council does not have a list of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights which are said to have been ignored by Turkey."
"I understand how tired the representative of the Council must be, she has been here since this morning, she has intervened on numerous issues, and I can only ascribe her disdain for the European Court of Human Rights to that."
"Why else would a representative of the Council of Ministers of the European Union say that we have no knowledge of the rulings by the European Court of Human Rights, especially here in Strasbourg?"
"It is a disgrace, an absolute disgrace!"
"Besides, the European Parliament, in its recent resolutions on Turkey, has called on Turkey, among other things, to respect the rulings and to obey the rulings of the European Court."
"But that is by the by."
"My question concerns Leyla Zanna."
"A Sacharov prizewinner, one of us."
"You are a member of the Belgian Parliament."
"She is a member of the Turkish national assembly."
"She is a woman, she is your age and she is in prison."
"Can we just ignore this issue in a candidate country, is this our response?"
"Perhaps simultaneous interpretation problems are to blame here."
"I did not say that we do not have the list of European Court rulings;"
"I said that we do not have a list of the rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe."
"That is what I said, and it is different."
"I was in the former Chamber when the prize was awarded to Mrs Zana and as a Member of this Parliament I associated myself with many of the positions taken by this Parliament in respect of Turkey."
"You are well aware that the Council's position on Turkey is very clear."
"We have made that position clear to Turkey repeatedly and will continue to do so."
"The Minister has pointed out that this is a court of the Council of Europe, not a court of the European Union."
"However, we are all well aware of the relations between the European Parliament and the supreme court of the Council of Europe."
"Secondly, she said, and she repeated, that she does not have a list of the Court rulings which Turkey may have failed to observe."
"Apart from the rulings on Leyla Zana and the other three Members of Parliament in prison, there is the famous ruling on Titina Loizidou, the Greek Cypriot still waiting for Turkey to pay the compensation awarded to her in a ruling by the supreme court, which Turkey has provocatively said it has no intention of observing."
"I repeat I am surprised because the Minister has served as a Member of the European Parliament and as a member of her national parliament and she should at least have thought about it and if she did not have a list, she had all the time in the world to ask for one rather than coming here today, if I may say so, without having done her homework."
"I sometimes wonder whether the tone adopted by some of the Members has anything to do with my sex, age or something else."
"I have been very clear in my answers."
"There is a distinction between the Court of Human Rights and our own Court of Justice in Luxembourg, as you very well know."
"We hold Turkey to its responsibility of respecting all the international obligations that country has undertaken and among them, of course, is the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights."
"This is one of the permanent elements of the political dialogue we are having with Turkey."
"We are doing our homework."
"It might not always produce the results that you would like to see or produce them as quickly as you would like, but we are doing our homework."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of Parliament, I thank you for your dedication this evening and all the answers you have given us."
"We like some of your answers more than others, but we are grateful for your dedication."
"As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 17 to 23, 25 and 26 will be replied to in writing."
"Question No 24 by Mr Van Lancker is not admissible since it refers to an item included on the agenda for the present part-session."
"That concludes Questions to the Council."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area - Contribution of public finances to growth and employment"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A5-0307/2001 by Mrs Berès on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication on strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area;"
"A5-0306/2001 by Mrs Peijs on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission communication to the Council and Parliament on the contribution of public finances to growth and employment: improving quality and sustainability (COM(2000) 846 - C5-0172/2001 - 2001/2082(COS))."
"Mr President, before I give my comments as rapporteur, I would like to make an objection and ask you to refer it to the Conference of Presidents."
"In my view, it is absurd to have this debate now, when we had the debate on the Stability Pact this afternoon, and in the meantime, the Conference of Presidents thought it would be worthwhile to find time for a debate on television without frontiers."
"This does not help to make our work more coherent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are about to debate has come at a crucial moment."
"On 21 September 2001, the European Council acknowledged the importance of the subjects we discuss and assisted us by requesting, for the first time, that the Commission prepare a recommendation on the economic situation of the euro area following the events of 11 September."
"Some people might believe that it has been easier to organise economic policy coordination during a period of growth."
"This was not intentional, even though there have been many fortunate coincidences, such as tax cuts in various Member States, which we can now welcome."
"Today, however, we are faced with genuine external shocks, even though the consequences of the slowdown in the United States were already challenging us on the basis of our growth, economic policy coordination is becoming even more difficult, and even more necessary, because, at the other end of the spectrum, European policy now amounts to monetary policy and also because Mr Duisenberg, in the wake of the events of 11 September, made a commitment with his US counterpart to coordinate economic areas."
"As the changeover to euro notes and coins draws near, we must make economic and monetary union manage on its own two feet."
"This is what we invited the Commission to do with its communication, which we welcome."
"A great deal has already been done and there is still a great deal to do."
"Member States must conduct their policy in a responsible and autonomous manner."
"Coordination, however, must help to make this policy as consistent as possible and mutually beneficial."
"This is what the changeover to the euro represents."
"The report that I am commending to Parliament echoes the Commission communication and indicates a number of options, which we believe are essential."
"First of all, this coordination depends on the Eurogroup and its president, who, we must be able to believe, speaks on behalf of the whole group."
"Next, the Commission must have an essential role but it cannot approach this as if it were one of its, say, conventional areas of competence."
"In some ways, this role is more political, in which the Commission must display its ability to make innovative proposals, to develop medium-term prospects."
"And the European Parliament must be the public forum for debate on economic policy coordination."
"In order to achieve this, three courses of action are needed."
"First of all, we need indicators, harmonised statistics and barometers for the euro area."
"An economic policy for the euro area is impossible unless we have good instruments to navigate by."
"I am also aware that some Member States are having a debate on the cost-effectiveness of the indicators."
"We are clearly in favour of spending a small amount of money so that the indicators can be more effective."
"In our view, the second crucial point is the exchange of information, on which Eurogroup members have made a start."
"We believe it is essential to go further, to take advantage of everything that could enable peer evaluation, with the option of asking the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of measures proposed by a Member State as part of its budgetary, fiscal or structural policy."
"Lastly, Mr President, we must improve the quality and the coherence of all aspects of the debate."
"Economic policy coordination in the national parliaments must be integrated."
"This means integrating the broad economic policy guidelines into the debate on national budgets."
"It also means that a national debate must be based on the stability programmes."
"This also means that before we discuss the broad economic policy guidelines in the European Parliament, we want to hear the views of our colleagues in the national parliaments."
"I shall conclude, Mr President, by saying that this also means we hope to see the President of the Eurogroup come before the relevant parliamentary committee as often as is necessary."
"Mr President, the Commission Communication on public finances is now, some time after its publication, particularly topical."
"The economy is slowing down, partly of its own accord, partly through laxity on the part of major Member States, and on top of this there are the after-effects of the tragic events of 11 September."
"These things have again, for the first time in a while, put pressure on the public finances of the Member States."
"History has taught us that considerable public expenditure can lead to major inefficiency, to too high a claim on the capital market and to excessive taxation, and very rarely to higher employment."
"All these aspects can seriously hinder the healthy development of the private sector and consequently hamper growth in employment grounded in supply and demand."
"Almost ten years ago, the European Heads of State and Government acknowledged this development, and agreed in Maastricht to work on a sustainable budgetary position."
"If Member States join together in a large monetary zone, albeit with coordination of economic policy, but without real political union, they must adhere to their agreements."
"Thanks to instruments made available to the ECB, the latter can influence the stability of prices and, along with this, the living conditions of people in the Euro area."
"Further to a discussion in the Preparatory Committee, I would once again like to underline that price stability, along with controlled inflation, contributes to a sustained purchasing power at the bottom of the wage structure and to an incentive to return to work."
"Price stability prevents the purchasing power of those of pensionable age from being eroded."
"It also ensures that wage increases within the labour market actually translate into more financial scope for families in Europe, and do not merely enable people to keep up with price increases, as is the case in my own country."
"Some countries give tax cuts with one hand and take them back, in the form of VAT hikes and higher local taxes, with the other."
"This instils in the public a sense of distrust in politics."
"And the instruction to the Central Bank to monitor prices is the most effective social measure I can remember for a good few years."
"In addition to the Central Bank' s pursuit of stability, the Member States' investment and budgetary policy is critical to the living and working conditions of Europeans and to confidence in the single currency."
"According to President Duisenberg, the watering down of the budgetary objectives is of huge concern."
"You yourself, Commissioner, called key countries including Germany, France, Italy and Portugal to account and reminded them of their duties. And in those same countries, the idea of extending the Stability Pact is being mooted."
"Let one thing be clear, however: the financial markets are closely watching the Member States in terms of how they are dealing with their budgets in a declining economy."
"The countries which did nothing when it was economically possible, are now, of course, struggling the most to observe the Stability Pact."
"Needless to say, it is unrealistic to expect that they will now increase taxes or curb spending, but I consider an increase in spending to be an irresponsible burden in the face of an uncertain future."
"Our generation must pay for its own bills, rather than pass them on to the next."
"The current situation is a test of how sound the euro system actually is, and it is patently clear to the financial market that the public budgets are the weak link in the entire euro cycle."
"Governments must not be allowed to think that the euro belongs to all of us but that their budgets are purely a national matter."
"Furthermore, nobody has managed to explain to me what the use is of a Stability Pact which only applies to buoyant times."
"It is precisely in an economy that is slowing down that it is important to translate agreements into practice."
"The European Commission devotes an important proportion of its communication to future demographic developments."
"It is a crucial component, because an ageing population will have a great impact on future budgetary positions."
"And an ageing population is another reason to look after the Stability Pact."
"It will also mean that we will be obliged to work much more on lifelong learning in order to sustain our own professional profile. What is more, people will probably need to work well beyond the age of fifty-seven and a half, as is now mostly the case, for example in the Netherlands."
"In my report, I am asking for an individual path to be sketched for every Member State, so that the political tendency to indulge in short-term thinking will not prejudice the just pension and care expectations of people."
"Mr President, in my report, it is certainly not my intention to create the impression that public investments should not be allowed, but in the Stability Pact, 60% of the GDP has already been earmarked to meet the needs for public investments."
"That offers ample scope for in-depth investment in education, R&D and healthcare."
"Finally, I would like to note that I am pleased that constructive consultation with the Group of the Party of European Socialists was possible in order to come to an acceptable compromise."
"Tomorrow, I will ask you whether it is possible to table an oral compromise amendment during the vote."
"Mr President, given that this is a joint debate, I will point out that my mandate is restricted to the report by Mrs Peijs."
"Mr President, it is customary for draftspeople of the opinion to congratulate the rapporteur of the committee responsible, to express their agreement and satisfaction, and to try to highlight their contributions and/or to at least expand on a few points."
"Unfortunately, I will not be able to continue that practice today."
"On behalf of the Committee on Budgets, which I have the honour of representing institutionally, I must express the profound disappointment of my committee at the treatment by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of our amendments, and please do not interpret this as in any way a personal opinion."
"The Committee on Budgets adopted its opinion unanimously while I was absent through illness."
"I was not even there at the final moment to defend my proposals and the opinion was therefore adopted without interference."
"There was not a single vote against and there was therefore no distinction of a party political nature."
"This is in no way a party political issue for us."
"The majority of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, however, has rejected our amendments en masse. Unless I am mistaken, not a single one of our amendments has warranted the approval of that majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"And we in the Committee on Budgets have the feeling, Mr President, that constructive and purely institutional contributions have been thoroughly spurned and scorned."
"To be frank, we can find no explanation for this systematic negative vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is true that the Commission document which is the basis of our discussion focused, shall we say, on national budgets."
"But when the Committee on Budgets added the Community dimension, the Commission, in particular the Commissioner present, thanked us for it and expressed its appreciation of this widening of the perspective of the Communication."
"Well, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has refused to open its eyes to this additional dimension."
"Why?"
"Why does the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs deny that the European Union' s meagre budget, 1.07% of Community GDP, has been applied just as rigorously as that of the Member States?"
"By rejecting Amendment No 7, this is what they have done."
"It is also difficult for we budgeteers in this House to understand why, two days from the first reading of the 2001 budget, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs denies, by rejecting Amendments Nos 5 and 6, the multiplier effect of Community expenditure and the fact that it frequently acts as an example for national, regional and local authorities."
"If that is the economic thinking of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the coherent thing for it to do would be to withdraw all the amendments it has presented to the draft budget."
"That would be the most logical thing for it to do."
"Ladies and gentlemen, 90 days from the physical introduction of the euro, any inkling of fiscal policy in relation to the Community budget is being sidestepped."
"From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets, the obvious thing to do would be to gradually strengthen the European budget and go beyond mere - necessary, but mere - coordination of the economic policies of the Member States."
"Some day, just as we now have a 'Mr' CFSP, we are convinced that we will need a 'Mrs' Euro, perhaps Mrs Peijs herself, and a greater European budget, in exchange for a reduction of national budgets."
"And in the Committee on Budgets we wonder how the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs thinks economic cycles, symmetrical and asymmetrical shocks, should be confronted, each one as it comes or all of them in a coordinated and cooperative fashion, to a certain extent using the Community budget to this end."
"We in the Committee on Budgets, which I would remind you approved the opinion unanimously, have the impression that for the majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ideological prejudices carried more weight than the objective assessment of the economic options available."
"Please allow me to remind you, as a teacher of public economy, Milton Freedman, said, that we are all Post-Keynesians."
"He forgot about that majority of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament."
"The motion for a resolution is only Post-Keynesian in a chronological sense, but the basis of its thinking is pre-Keynesian."
"It takes up elements of the monetarism of the 80s and 90s without taking account of its background."
"When the Maastricht Treaty was signed, perhaps all politicians, and certainly the economists, knew that we should get rid of the systematic deficit, that we needed a policy of financial rationalisation, but we also knew, since the 60s, that budgetary balance is only advisable in certain circumstances and conditions and that, in general, strict budgetary balance tends to be procyclic, that is to say that it tends to aggravate the cyclic tendency of the economy."
"Kennedy' s advisers, if I may go back that far, illustrated, by means of the so-called budget surplus of full employment, how a balanced budget, even in certain cases of deficit, can create recession."
"I would therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my committee, to take a more open perspective, as contained in our amendments, and to include them tomorrow in the text of the resolution."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Berès, Mrs Peijs, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say a few words about each of the reports, and also something about the previous speaker's comments of course."
"No matter what political group he or she might belong to, I would never insinuate that a fellow Member had let himself or herself be guided by anything but objective policy considerations in reaching a decision or deciding how to vote."
"The majorities that prevail may vary, but since I have been following its activities, the hallmark of the work of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has been a very objective atmosphere and one very much geared to the Community's economic and monetary policy, so that the suggestion that has been made here is one that I cannot agree with and would like to refute."
"Nevertheless, I agree with you of course that within the euro area and also as regards our common foreign and security policy we need to speak with one voice, both internally and externally."
"However, and this point concerns both reports, competition is becoming an increasingly global matter."
"The euro will come into circulation in 89 days, and it is already the second most important currency in the world."
"The euro coins and notes will make the importance of this single European currency on the world market very clear."
"This is a very important aspect, and we must at all times be very disciplined about keeping Europe's presence on the world financial stage in mind."
"Global competition does of course require that in addition to the single market and economic and monetary union the necessary coordination needs to take place within the euro area and within the European Union as a whole."
"What does this mean?"
"On the one hand it means coordination so that a strong internal market is created in the euro area and Europe becomes more competitive."
"On the other hand, you need to understand that it also involves maintaining freedom as the basis of competition within the framework agreed between the Member States."
"We are, of course, not all convinced that coordination in itself is a panacea, because we also need to consider where coordination starts. What mechanisms does coordination involve, and what are the limits of coordination?"
"Does coordination inhibit the functioning of the market or support it?"
"This is undisputedly a debate that we need to hold, as decisions cannot simply be taken under the heading of coordination."
"That is why we are in favour of more debates on European issues in national parliaments, in favour of coordination by the Statistical Office of the European Communities and enhanced links with national statistical bodies, and in favour of mutual exchange of information as a means of achieving joint tasks."
"However, we naturally oppose increased bureaucracy, the setting up of new bodies and higher expenditure on bureaucracy masquerading as coordination."
"We need more efficiency and professionalism in the structures that already exist in order to improve what we do jointly."
"That does not mean reducing freedom of action and freedom of decision making in the Member States."
"And we also oppose the information that has leaked out about tax collection or the use of tax income, because we believe that there is no legal basis for that either."
"I have simply highlighted two issues that we need to debate further."
"We will be voting for the report, but not all the details about what is meant and what mechanisms are necessary have been clarified."
"I would like to say one more thing to Mrs Berès: it is important that you have tackled the issue of the link between public finances and reducing inflation, and thus touched on the subject of assessing the financial markets."
"We need to give public finances a clean bill of health again, so that we increase the investment capital at our disposal, and I therefore call on everyone mentioned in the report to do their homework properly and not just take cosmetic measures!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Karas, I cannot resist commenting on your speech."
"In all instances where we already have sensible coordination of our economic policies in the European Union, we have chalked up enormous successes."
"Government budgets over the last year have for the first time in decades shown a surplus, and that still holds good, Mrs Peijs, if we exclude exceptional income from the sale of mobile telephone licences."
"I do not think that we should play this down in today's debate."
"The success stories in the current year will not be so great."
"That is because growth in the European Union has slowed down, but that is no reason to start harping on about inflation."
"Nor is it any reason to start panicking."
"No one can calm down our friends in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats."
"No one - not in this House anyway - wants to print money. No one wants to print money as a way of solving finance policy problems."
"We only want to print money to provide the public with our new currency, the euro, on time, but nobody here is talking about an inadequate budgetary policy."
"However, you know that too."
"That is not what is at stake here!"
"Essentially, it is about something quite different."
"You know very well that, in the past, these budget consolidation successes that I have been talking about were not achieved by increasing income but by cutting expenditure."
"Those expenditure cuts led to a positive result, but also had negative affects."
"In many areas, public infrastructure is in a state of decay."
"In many places social networks are under great pressure and our investment patterns both in the private sector and in the public sector have led to key strategic deficiencies in comparison with our competitors on the world scene."
"We now find ourselves in a situation in which government receipts will decline for cyclical reasons."
"So the vital question is this: what should we do in that situation?"
"Are you really seriously envisaging further global cuts in public sector income and expenditure?"
"Do you really want to freeze budgets so that we fail to make the investment necessary for our future?"
"Do you want the European Union to enter a further procyclical phase which will prevent us from benefiting from long-term growth overall?"
"I cannot imagine that that is what you want."
"Mr von Wogau asked me at lunchtime today what the Socialists really want."
"I can give him an answer: we want to stop these scare tactics!"
"We want to put an end to talk that recovery in Europe is always just short-term, because if the central banks or governments are running scared, we will lose long-term opportunities."
"We have tabled amendments that we think are sensible."
"If you can agree to compromise with us, then we can find a common path."
"And if that is not possible, we will go our separate ways!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my intervention by agreeing with Mrs Berès' s complaint, because it really makes no sense to have held a debate, which is otherwise very interesting, on the Growth and Stability Pact and on the conclusions of the ECOFIN in Liège, to have debated 'television without frontiers' in the middle and now to hold what I believe to be a logical continuation of the first debate, the reports by Mrs Berès and Mrs Peijs, to whom I would like to say, on behalf of the Liberal Group, that they have our support and favourable vote."
"I feel compelled to relate this afternoon' s debate to the subjects of these reports, above all by referring to the current economic situation."
"It is clear that over the first few months of this year, the slow-down of the American economy has had more influence than was initially expected, and that the terrible terrorist attacks on New York and Washington have further worsened these prospects through needs for economic intervention which are truly new, urgent and no doubt justified."
"The strain of the situation, however, should not lead us to justify greater public intervention or, as the President-in-Office of the Council has said very correctly, to abandon or lose sight of the need to continue with the structural reforms which the European economy still needs if it is really going to be competitive on an international level."
"I trust that confidence will be recovered in the economic field as soon as possible and that the current special situation will be overcome, and we will shortly find that we have the same requirements that we had three months ago, that is, to consolidate the European economy, to make it more competitive in accordance with the Lisbon criteria, to strengthen coordination and, as we have often said to Commissioner Solbes, to have a genuine economic and monetary approach and policy, as the existence of the euro and monetary union demands."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this is my basic point, although there are other detailed matters which are sufficiently well-expressed in the respective reports by Mrs Berès and Mrs Peijs."
"Mr President, I want to deal particularly with the issue of public expenditure, quality and employment."
"The explanatory statement of Mrs Peijs' report is very interesting because it explains the background."
"We have to beware of chasing the American economic model."
"One of the things that has made many people within the European Union hostile to the euro is that they have seen its introduction as linked to cuts in public expenditure."
"We have seen, with the American economic model, the prioritising of the private and the cutting of the public."
"The result has been a tremendous disparity between rich and poor and high levels of child poverty - unlike in countries which invest in social expenditure and reduce the wealth gap."
"We know that child poverty is linked to poorer educational attainment, poorer job prospects and so on."
"We have also seen in that economy a reduction of job security and longer working hours, with the introduction of a flexible contract culture."
"In the UK, contracting out at lower cost quite often means compensatory tax measures at the lower end of pay, a public subsidy to poor wages from poor employers."
"The American model also represents an unsustainable pattern of consumption, which will have an economic impact in the longer term."
"My group believes that Mrs Peijs' report does not look sufficiently at the quality of the contribution of public finances."
"So we cannot support the report in its current form."
"Hence the amendments we have tabled."
"I know that it is very difficult to measure the benefits of public expenditure in the same way we look at the balance sheet of a private health care company for example."
"Public expenditure is an investment in social cohesion and we are gradually coming to recognise the costs of not investing in that."
"Indeed, a priority for the European Union now is combating social exclusion."
"We count as an economic success private spending to compensate for the lack of public expenditure."
"Every burglar alarm bought, for example, is because we feel we are not safe."
"We agree that we need to reduce the cost of employing people and to focus on lifting taxation costs for the poorer paid, many of whom are women."
"But we also need to reduce working hours as part of increasing employment opportunities."
"It is clear to us that a knowledge-based society which tackles social exclusion - we have to remember that Lisbon also said that - needs greater investment."
"And where will that come from if there is no significant public expenditure?"
"Employers increasingly want ready-trained employees as part of the flexible contract culture."
"We consider that public investments can have a very positive value and can help to shift the direction of our economy, as we recognise our ecological responsibilities."
"Mr President, the Peijs report states that, over 20 years, government expenditure has increased from 35% to 50% of the GNP."
"What has caused this increase in government expenditure?"
"Is it because public services have been improved, the number of hospitals has increased, additional hospital staff have been hired, public transport and national education have been developed, sufficient social housing has been built?"
"No, it certainly is not!"
"Over the past 20 years, many governments have, on the contrary, privatised services that used to be public."
"All these governments have pursued money-saving policies with regard to essential public services, have got rid of railway lines, local post offices or hospitals, which are not considered to be profitable."
"The reason that government expenditure has increased is because of the extravagant sums of money given to employers on a multitude of pretexts, ranging from direct subsidies for reducing taxes and social contributions to giving all types of support - all government authorities seem to excel at making these up."
"Mrs Peijs cynically proposes making this policy worse by further reducing employers' social burdens and increasing VAT."
"The poorest people are being made to pay in order to give money to the richest - if this is not brutal and direct class politics then it is hard to imagine what else it can be."
"I shall of course be voting against this report."
"Mr President, at the outset I would like to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation of their reports."
"In recent months the global economic climate has been the cause of some concern."
"We in Europe are certainly not immune to economic downturns in the United States."
"The tragic events that took place in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on 11 September have undoubtedly further shaken economic confidence."
"In Ireland, as in all Member States, we remain committed to maintaining current budgetary levels."
"The reaffirmation of this commitment at Liège will allow the EU to better address cyclical fluctuations."
"I welcome also the statement by the Commissioner that governments will be able to use automatic stabilisers in the context of a slow-down in growth."
"Indeed, in Ireland, we continue to run a budget surplus which affords us some room for manoeuvre."
"The Irish stability programme is central to the budgetary process in Ireland."
"It is discussed in Daíl Éireann and is a key component of our annual budget."
"The primary objective of the Irish budget and stability programme is the continuation of sustainable economic growth, supported by moderate inflation and competitive wage developments, reflecting our national agreement with the social partners known as the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness."
"As the House knows, the Ecofin Council this year, on a proposal from Commissioner Solbes, issued a recommendation to Ireland stating that she did not comply with last year's EU broad economic guidelines on fiscal policy."
"The Irish government contends that its budgetary policy seeks to achieve economic stability by securing the continuation of social partnership and also by taking action to reduce price inflation, including indirect tax reductions."
"We must look to the future."
"Our immediate concern is the successful launch of the euro on 1 January."
"But the single currency is not an end in itself."
"It is conceived to facilitate a true single market for goods and services."
"The grand project requires a high level of cooperation and coordination."
"National governments must retain the prerogative to formulate a budget which best addresses the particular and specific economic situation of their country at that time."
"Mr President, as usual, I am in full agreement with Mrs Peijs."
"That is why I shall mainly confine myself to the report by Mrs Berès."
"The European Monetary Union is accompanied by a certain level of coordination in the field of budgets."
"However, coordination which goes beyond what is necessary for the EMU deserves to be questioned."
"Further coordination can only be justified through sound reasoning, but this is lacking in both the Commission communication and in the Berès report."
"There are, however, situations which require coordination."
"The Commission mentions resistance to shocks as an example."
"A recent illustration is the granting of subsidies to airline companies following the attack in the United States. This is an excellent example of decisive action on the part of the Council of Ministers."
"Coordination which goes beyond what is required will even prove counterproductive."
"Labour participation, company policy, taxes - these are all matters which should fall within the remit of the Member States."
"In substance, they give little reason for more coordination at European level."
"Coordination of economic policy should not be used as a red herring."
"After all, it is evident that times of economic adversity make it more difficult for the Member States to adhere to the EMU' s underlying principle: the Stability Pact."
"The much-needed structural reforms should help meet the budgetary criteria."
"Member States cannot afford to postpone using this instrument in order to obtain more permanent and responsible growth."
"This growth is vital in order to secure the Stability Pact."
"The need for reform is therefore all the more pressing."
"It is, therefore, with good reason that the report does not nominate many concrete matters for coordination."
"It is always useful to exchange information on economic policy decisions."
"More important, however, is the quality of the decisions per se."
"The report does not comment on the motives for closer cooperation."
"This does nothing to help the case for coordination."
"With the EMU, the European economies should not lose their own economic policies, tailored to their specific dynamics and character."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like first to thank my friend, Karla Peijs, for her excellent report, in which she aptly describes the vital importance structural reform measures have for the prosperity of our societies."
"Rarely does one see such excellent reports."
"I wish to focus on two matters."
"The public finances of a State in the euro area are no longer the private affairs of that State."
"Any budgetary imbalances in an individual State, particularly a large one, may have an impact on the stability of the entire euro area."
"For this reason, recent attempts to water down measures to reform state economies are worrying."
"Many governments in recent years have relaxed their budgetary efforts, relying mainly on cyclical receipts, such as the proceeds from mobile telecommunications system auctions."
"The consolidation process is still far from being complete, however."
"The future objective is for a 'close to balance' or 'in surplus' budgetary position."
"Member States must honour the commitments of the stability and convergence programmes unconditionally."
"It will take perseverance and determination to balance public finances."
"It will make us susceptible to populist criticisms of thinking of the economy like an accountant or balancing the economy one-sidedly."
"Nevertheless, this is what we have to focus on."
"Politicians have to take a few blows after all, but our economy will not be able to take a left hook."
"Secondly, the rise in public expenditure in the last few decades has caused the governments of several of the Member States to increase taxation and social welfare contributions, which were already at an unendurably high level in Europe."
"Simultaneously, the potential for economic growth has been weakening throughout this period."
"That Last Mohican of orthodox communism, my colleague Mrs Bordes, could also stop talking about class war in this, the third millennium, and admit that the contribution of each and every European to the economy is important."
"For that reason, work must be financially motivating and the benefits of different social welfare schemes at such a level that they safeguard the basic necessities of a normal, decent life, but provide an incentive for becoming active in all situations."
"Only in this way can we achieve the ambitious aims of Lisbon."
"Mr President, the challenges of globalisation make it clear to us just how important coordination of economic policies is for Europe, and also the integration of financial, employment and social policies, because little Europe is demonstrating to the world that it is possible to make progress in a region if regional cooperation does not just mean intergovernmental cooperation and is not just a free trade area."
"I believe that the combination of the single market on the one hand and certain possibilities for giving political direction on the other is what makes the European Union what it is."
"I therefore very much welcome the Commission communication and Mrs Berès's report, as they make it very clear that we need to make further progress with the coordination process."
"We all know that the challenges and demands on us are now even greater than ever."
"ECOFIN has quite rightly made sure that more integrated approaches are now being adopted, especially in the field of capital movements."
"It is certainly important that we should not just act in unison and improve the quality of coordination, but that we should also agree on guidelines."
"Fortunately, the Lisbon process, which was taken further in Stockholm, has given us both quantitative and qualitative objectives."
"Of course these still need to be extended and refined, but it enables us to demonstrate to the public that the coordination process can lead to positive outcomes."
"If you could not say that, who would be interested in checking if all the Member States have actually met the requirements to which they have committed themselves?"
"One aspect of the commitments that they have entered into is the consolidation of their budgets."
"Mr Bullmann was quite right to point out the progress made in this area."
"It is certainly true that there is still more to be done in reducing debt in some Member States, but we should not forget that the Stability and Growth Pact exists as an instrument to prevent us ever exceeding a deficit of 3% of GNP."
"That is at the heart of the convergence criteria and this deficit is intended to help us to achieve a favourable monetary policy that promotes development."
"I believe that coordination can be enhanced still further, and that all those policies which can mutually or reciprocally support each other should be brought into this coordination process."
"I also think that it is a particularly good thing that the European Parliament can call on the national parliaments to take part in the coordination process and I really wish to emphasise that point."
"We, as a committee, have attempted to constantly highlight this cooperation with national parliaments."
"Mr President, I would like to make one final comment."
"We should not see the coordination of policies as an end in itself."
"We, in Europe, have missed out on growth because over the last few decades coordination has been lacking."
"We lost out because we did not adopt a coordinated approach to the UMTS auction."
"We could have achieved a totally different outcome."
"Nor did we react jointly when the OPEC countries raised oil prices."
"There is no doubt that we could have achieved a more favourable starting point for economic development if we had acted in a more coordinated way."
"Mr President, Commissioner, in recent decades the per capita GDP in Europe has been reduced in comparison with that of America, increasing the gap or distance between our prosperity and development and that of the United States, while our levels of employment are also worsening."
"The conclusion is drawn from this that the Americans do not hinder the activities of private companies through taxation as much as Europeans do and, in accordance with low levels of public expenditure, they have not, like us, promoted action plans, introduced bureaucratic systems or tried to guide their economic operators, who have therefore been able to dedicate themselves purely to working and generating wealth."
"It seems to me that this analysis does not take account of the very important fact that, over the last 30 years, levels of public investment in the European Union have been reduced to 2% of our GDP in 2000, while in the United States they have maintained a sustainable level and represent 3% of their GDP."
"If we add to this the fact that our per capita GDP stands at 65% of American GDP, it turns out that their average investment per citizen each year is 2.3 times greater than ours, and this is a more than notable difference which explains the differing developments of our respective economies."
"I believe that the short-term solution for Europe is not to reduce taxes, but rather, while achieving balanced budgets and no deficit, we must adjust our current public expenditure and increase public investment in viable projects, modernising our infrastructures, supporting technological research and development, involving research institutes and universities in private initiative and promoting training and knowledge in our society."
"What is completely unacceptable is the policy of the Spanish central government of Mr Aznar, which covers up its real budgetary deficit by financing it with revenue, with the monthly contributions of workers integrated into the state social security system, which compromises even further the uncertain future of pensions, and the workers who are currently contributing do not know whether they will receive those pensions on retirement."
"This is unacceptable and must be condemned."
"Mr President, two weeks ago, I was in the Netherlands on 'Prince' s Day' , the opening of the new parliamentary year, when the government budget is presented."
"Not only because of the events in the US did I sit that day with mixed feelings, but also with a feeling of: what is this all about?"
"With the ever growing internationalisation of the economy, certainly in a country like the Netherlands, it is noticeable that at national level, there is, in fact, little room for economic manoeuvre."
"It is, of course, possible to place accents, and I welcome the Dutch government' s proposal to step up investment in the public sector."
"However, the scope remaining to make a real difference is relatively limited and is determined at entirely different levels. One feels far closer to this in Brussels."
"On the other hand, I felt completely at home as regards the way in which such a budget is prepared in the Netherlands."
"It is based on sound analyses and prognoses issued by what we still term the Central Planning Bureau, and broad, medium-term recommendations by the Socio-Economic Council in which independent experts, social partners and the Dutch Bank work in harmony."
"In this way, a government can make plans which receive broad support and which can be effective."
"The paradox of the phase which we are at with European cooperation, is that, although the political control of the socio-economic policy has been moved onto a European plane, the instruments and procedures for this are still located at national level."
"Neither the European political structure, nor the European actors are prepared for this."
"Unfortunately, for I am convinced that Europe is in need of such sound and broad socio-economic coordination."
"I am therefore pleased with Mrs Berès' report."
"She makes proposals for improved coordination within the euro countries, for greater involvement of national policy-makers and parliaments and for better harmonisation among the various actors at European level."
"I would particularly like to underline the role of the macro-economic dialogue which must be afforded a far higher profile, also in the preparation of the broad economic guidelines."
"A broader debate thereafter, also involving national parliaments, is important."
"This concludes my comments on the Berès report."
"I would once again invite Mrs Peijs to deal with the amendments which we tabled so as to reach a compromise after all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the report by Mrs Berès on the Commission communication on the prospects for monetary union."
"I think, however, that after the tragic events of 11 September the proposed measures and experiments should be implemented much sooner if we want the monetary union to fully perform the role that awaits it in fighting terrorism, maintaining economic growth and the competitiveness of Europe, and affirming a policy of peace and international cooperation that will isolate terrorism in developing countries."
"I refer first of all to the need to face the slow-down in economic growth by means of coordination of our economic and social policies, countering the economic cycle. This can be achieved through enhanced cooperation measures between Eurogroup members, resulting in a real government by agreement of the monetary union, able to question decisions by the European Central Bank with an authority at least as great as that shown a few weeks ago by the United States Federal Reserve."
"I also refer to the urgent need within the monetary union above all to achieve the greatest transparency and a reciprocal information system on movements of capital, overcoming the restrictions of bank secrecy so as to be able, Mr Karas, to strike at the transfer of resources linked to terrorist funding, the laundering of dirty money from organised crime, and the offence of tax evasion."
"I shall close, Mr President, by also mentioning an international cooperation policy which will allow long-term contracts for supplying Europe with raw materials to be drawn up also in euro."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs very much."
"There is no doubt that what has been said this evening is going to help us in our subsequent work."
"I will begin by commenting on the Bères report and I would like to express my satisfaction with Parliament' s motion for a resolution which supports the strengthening of economic policy coordination within the euro area."
"We must not forget that economic policy coordination is an obligation laid down in the Treaty."
"The Treaty makes it very clear that our model is based on a single monetary policy and on national, but coordinated, economic policies."
"This is a key element of our model."
"It is true that coordination is still going through a learning phase."
"It is also true that we have increasingly greater interdependence - especially in the euro area but also in the Union in general - and this requires that the content, the systems and the instruments we use are constantly being reviewed."
"That is why I must especially welcome the report which Parliament has produced and salute Mrs Bères and all of those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who have participated in her magnificent work."
"I believe that this work, in many respects, goes further than the Commission' s proposal, particularly with regard to one fundamental aspect, the increase in national participation in economic policy coordination."
"I would like to highlight two essential elements of the report - and I will comment on the various interventions in relation to them."
"The first is the need to strengthen coordination, the second the need to increase the democratic debate and national participation."
"With regard to the content of the coordination, I think it is worth expanding on certain points."
"The report supports the Commission' s proposals on the production of periodic reports on the economy of the euro area."
"Today I can tell you that our idea - we have continued to work on this issue - is that we must have detailed economic analyses but also relevant proposals on economic policy."
"We must go further than specific analysis."
"In her speech, Mrs Bères raised the need to improve statistics and the assessment of policies."
"It is true that we have made progress with the statistical plans for the Union' s monetary area, however, we must go further."
"It is partly a problem of bringing national statistics into line with new realities, it is partly a problem of money, but, in some cases, it is neither of these problems, but rather the problem of acquiring the data necessary for a good definition of economic policy more quickly."
"This perhaps means that in the future we will have to consider the need for our own statistical information which is not an aggregate of national statistics."
"This would certainly be a key element if we are to be able to act within a time frame similar to that available to other economic authorities."
"She makes a reference in her report which I believe to be fundamental in relation to trying to achieve a common vision of the impact of economic cycles on public finances."
"We have held part of this debate today - I will comment later when I talk about the report by Mrs Peijs - but we believe it is essential for the ECOFIN Council to produce a methodology as soon as possible, allowing us to examine the concept of structural deficit by means of the same criteria."
"And we are working on this, which seems to us essential, precisely to allow these automatic stabilisers to come into play depending on the extent to which the budgetary situation of each of the Member States allow it, but applying the same criteria in all cases."
"A further point relating to the first element I mentioned, the content of coordination, is that of prior information."
"This is a point which always gives rise to a degree of debate and discussion."
"When we talk about prior information, we are talking about two different things."
"We are talking firstly about the other partners of the Eurogroup knowing the broad guidelines for those essential elements of a national economic policy which may eventually have an affect on the rest."
"Let us take one case: the tax reduction measures adopted last year as a result of the oil crisis."
"There is no doubt that if we had acted as we have acted this year on the issue of insurance cover for airlines, we would have achieved a better result and a better approach from the point of view of the Union' s position."
"The same can be said of the UMTSs."
"If we had debated, before taking the decision, how to deal with the possibilities and difficulties which one or other option with regard to licences for third-generation mobiles could pose, there is no doubt that we could have prevented some of the subsequent problems."
"We are not saying that we should all do the same. We are saying that we can hold discussions together in order to try to decide on a framework, which includes the different national decisions and allows us to take a more coherent position."
"I said that there is a second aspect to prior information and that is that ministers should take Community elements into consideration when defining their national policy."
"And I relate this reference to the one made by Mrs Bères in relation to increasing national participation in the broad guidelines for economic policy."
"Until now, it has more or less been considered that we had two processes which did not necessarily converge."
"On the one hand, reaching an agreement on the broad guidelines for economic policy in Brussels, in Luxembourg; on the other, defining our national economic and budgetary policies."
"And each process took a different route."
"It was also believed that compliance with the Stability Pact was sufficient to satisfy the coherence and consistency of the system which we have implemented for economic policy coordination."
"It is becoming increasingly clear to us that the two instruments we have, the Stability Pact and the broad guidelines for economic policy, are key elements."
"And the broad guidelines for economic policy, if they are actually approved by the ministers as a real commitment to be applied in each of the Member States, must reflect the budgetary policy which each minister wants and must present to their national Parliament."
"I believe that this would help us enormously in terms of a better interrelationship between the decisions adopted at Community level and the decisions adopted by national Parliaments."
"In this respect, the Commission believes that this idea of the debate is essential and we will fully support it."
"However - and this is a point which I also wanted to comment on - it is true that we should not overly complicate the procedures."
"Therefore, we are more cautious about certain ideas considered on the issue of macroeconomic dialogue."
"It is absolutely clear that we have to improve its efficiency on the level of political dialogue, but we believe that we also have to maintain its character of frank and confidential exchange and, in this respect, it is essential to maintain this informal framework for debate and not formalise its process too much by complicating it and making the whole process of debate relating to this point less productive."
"I would therefore like to end my comments on this first report by pointing out that the services of the Commission are currently looking into the implementation of some of the proposals included in the resolution, I have taken note of a series of suggestions that have been made this evening and we are naturally going to pay particular attention to them when producing our final proposal."
"In relation to the report by Mrs Peijs, I would firstly also like to thank her for her suggestions and comments, but I would like to focus on just three or four points that I think are important."
"Firstly, I fully agree with the idea that, in the context of the introduction of the euro, the credibility of a healthy public finance policy which is compatible with the euro is essential."
"It is true that, in our view, public finances - we have said this clearly this evening - must be adequate for both crisis situations and for good economic situations."
"In your report you refer to automatic stabilisers - and I do not believe that there is any great divergence between us on the analysis of this point."
"We believe, like you, that they must play a fundamental role, both at times of growth and at times of slow-down of the economy."
"We are grateful for your reference to tax reductions."
"The Commission has been arguing that all tax reductions must respond to certain criteria, which are contained in your report, and which we believe are essential to maintaining the idea of quality of public finances."
"No doubt if we were to debate tax reductions now, elements such as the promotion of consumption would be of more importance than would have been the case a few months ago, given that that is one of the issues we are concerned about."
"But the idea of tax reductions can certainly be included in practice, in all cases, in the criteria contained in the document and which you support."
"Finally, a comment on the sustainability of public finances in the long term."
"There have been other comments on the labour market, on how we must move ahead, on coherence in relation to work, pensions, etc. In my opinion, all these elements will be dealt with within a broader vision of the labour market, while the finance ministers must pay particular attention to public finances and, in this respect, to the difficulties which may arise in the funding of social security given the global budgetary deficits of all public administrations."
"The idea we are working with at the moment - and on the basis of your report, as you know, progress has already been made on some points - is not that reference be made by means of a short paragraph on the stability programmes, but that the stability programmes annually take up the necessary data to carry out an adequate evaluation of the evolution of public finances in relation to problems of ageing."
"Nevertheless, in our view, the idea of including this information in the stability programmes is not because we believe they are problems which must be resolved through annual decisions - they need more long-term decisions - but because we felt it was appropriate to introduce new processes for approaching, analysing and monitoring the evolution of public finances."
"Our idea is that, every four or five years, in each country, a more in-depth analysis should be carried out - it may be a supplement to the documents from the stability programme - on long-term public finances with the obvious fundamental problem of the ageing of the population and from which, nevertheless, when updating the annual programmes we only take the most necessary basic information."
"I would like to end by thanking you all once again for your cooperation and the useful ideas you have offered us, which we will take into account as far as possible."
"Mr President, I owe Mrs Van den Burg an explanation with regard to the amendments."
"I did not bring the amendment numbers, so I will have to quote from memory, but Mr Bullmann will undoubtedly correct me if he thinks I am quoting the incorrect numbers."
"Mrs Van den Burg, in order to reach a workable compromise, we will agree on Amendment Nos 4 and 5. Amendment No 7 will be based on the text by Mr Bullmann to which a sentence will be added."
"That is the oral amendment I was referring to. We will also agree on the second part of Amendment No 9 which starts with 'calls on the Member States' , Amendment No 10 by way of supplement and Amendment No 12."
"I would now like to respond to Mr Colom i Naval."
"He has probably been waiting for this all evening."
"Mr Colom i Naval, I would like to make this quite clear: content was not the issue."
"The reason why we were unable to talk about this before we voted on the amendments is that I was firstly in the United States with the delegation - you will have noticed my absence in the committee at the time - and then I was in Rome with my group."
"It was a slightly hectic month."
"It was not a matter of content."
"The fact is that the European Commission took the Member States as its point of departure in its communication."
"I did the same in my report."
"If, in your report, you were to write about the effects of the European budgetary policy on employment, then I would gladly vote in favour of all your amendments, but they did not feature in the framework of my report."
"I apologise for the fact that we did not have an opportunity to talk about this."
"That was a personal statement and was helpfully reconciliatory."
"I would like to thank you too, Commissioner Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"Competition policy (2000)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0299/2001) by Mr Agag Longo on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the Commission's XXXth Report on competition policy 2000 (SEC(2001) 694 - C5-0312/2001 - 2001/2130(COS))."
"Mr President, I am honoured to have been asked by my colleague, Mr Agag Longo, to present his excellent and detailed report to Parliament on the Commission's XXXth report on competition policy."
"The report draws together several important areas of competition policy."
"The rapporteur restates Parliament's strong support for Commissioner Monti in spelling out that effective competition is not only an important engine of economic growth but also works to the advantage of consumers, through greater variety, better quality and lower prices for both goods and services."
"We congratulate the Commissioner on the success of European competition policy, but we recognise that such success can only be maintained by constant and rigorous monitoring."
"Our rapporteur has highlighted further measures to which Parliament will be giving its attention in the coming months."
"The future of car distribution is one area where we eagerly await the Commission's proposals."
"I believe that our initial evaluations suggest that consumers are missing out under the current exemption, with unjustifiable price variations between Member States."
"We also await the consultation on Merger Regulation No 4064/89."
"We welcome Commissioner Monti's positive approach to consultation with our committee, but we repeat our call for major constitutional change which gives Parliament real codecision power with the Commission."
"Commissioner Monti has played the central role in fostering a global approach to competition policy and enforcement issues."
"Our committee supports efforts to build an international competition system in the framework of the WTO, whilst recognising that Europe's credibility in this area will depend on efficient and effective cooperation between the EU's own national competition authorities."
"We are also looking to the outcome of negotiations between the Commission and the Council on the Commission's proposals for reform of the enforcement regime under Articles 81 and 82 which we approved last month."
"Mr Agag Longo draws attention in his report to other important elements of Parliament's position on the reform, our strong support for Article 3 and our real concern over issues of legal certainty, as well as separation of powers."
"I know that Commissioner Monti is aware of this, but we have consistently argued that the Commission must guard against the danger that the reform may lead to inconsistent application or even to a renationalisation of competition policy, thereby destroying the single market."
"In continuing to raise these issues we reflect the concerns of many in the business community in Europe."
"Our committee has also underlined other competition concerns."
"We look to further market liberalisation, but we want effective enforcement of already agreed policy areas in the gas and the electricity sectors."
"The Commissioner is aware of the complaints which have been made about some acquisitions by companies which do not appear to operate in a liberalised home market and we look to the Commission to investigate whether state-aid rules have been breached in such cases."
"Mr Agag Longo also urges further progress on liberalisation in areas such as energy, transport and the postal services."
"We welcome the progress which the Commissioner has made on state aid control."
"We also support his work in ensuring that candidate countries for membership fully understand the requirements of EU competition policy, particularly the application and relevance of such rules in terms of market distortion."
"Our committee will shortly respond in fuller detail to the Commission's ninth state aid survey, but this report also touches on this area."
"We applaud progress on implementation of a public register of state aid and a scoreboard as important tools for promoting transparency and democratic control, even if I embarrass Commissioner Monti by saying that his practical demonstration of the scoreboard to our committee was frustrated by technical problems."
"We view such widespread public access to information as essential."
"In the same light we welcome the continuing commitment to hold competition day seminars under each Council presidency, although we are keen to see wider public knowledge of, and participation in, such events."
"Finally, on an entirely personal note, I would like to express my concern that the Commission has made particularly slow progress over complaints concerning the Spanish government's treatment of Gibraltar citizens in relation to telecoms matters."
"These complaints have been outstanding with the Commission for over five years, whilst the Commission has itself recently initiated a state aids investigation of Gibraltar's investment schemes, ordering it to cease forthwith until the Commission investigation is concluded."
"I am bound to say that this hardly seems to me to be an even-handed approach and I hope Commissioner Monti will agree to look into this."
"Otherwise I commend Mr Agag Longo's excellent report to the House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in recent times, especially since the Stockholm European Council, the European Union has reached a turning point in competition policy."
"That can be seen in the increasing conservation of structures."
"The Agag Longo report rightly mentions this."
"Following the successful liberalisations of the 1990s, postal services, electricity and gas are now trying to escape the annoyance of competition again."
"First liberalisation, then regulation again, and the heading for this scenario is self-preservation."
"The agenda for the Heads of State and Government in Laeken expressly provides for a discussion of the tension between competition and the preservation of existing interests."
"We are all anxious to see whether competition can win through there."
"If we ask about the difference between our modern, open society and another society marked by classes and castes, the answer is clear: in our open society competition has become the order, the principle on which our culture is based."
"General acceptance of the principle of competition is therefore a tremendous cultural achievement."
"But the state has never submitted itself to this principle."
"It has always sheltered its education system, its banks, its railway, its airlines, its postal service, its telephone networks and its housing associations from the cold wind of competition."
"Many sectors of the economy, too, claim that competition cannot work for them or that exposure to competition could be detrimental to the objectives they pursue.."
"There are plenty of examples."
"Coal is valued because supplies are secure."
"The market is said to be harmful to the health service because patients would be unable to assess the services provided."
"In agriculture, the market is said to be inappropriate because farmers allegedly produce even more if prices are lower."
"The postal service cannot be set free to compete - not completely, at any rate - because it has social functions to fulfil."
"So we could go on."
"But all these paltry excuses have one thing in common: they all recognise competition in principle, but simply claim that the principle is not applicable in their most particular case."
"The situation in Europe has without a doubt become more difficult again for competition policy."
"That is why it is important - and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is calling for this - that EU competition policy should now finally be extended to energy, transport and pharmaceuticals."
"Let us therefore continue together to plan, campaign and argue for freedom."
"Mr President, I must say firstly that I am truly perplexed."
"I am perplexed by the fact that a British Member, though talking in place of a Spanish Member, has raised an issue that in no way relates to the rules on competition, that in no way relates to the reports on competition, but which relates to the unacceptable existence of the only territory in the European Union still to be decolonised."
"It seems to me that to use the speaking time of a Spanish Member to raise these issues is, to say the very least, a discourtesy."
"Anyway, leaving that aside, I believe that the discussion of the annual report on competition policy is a good opportunity to consider a debate on the progress and guidelines relating to this important European policy."
"If we are to be self-critical, I would like to ask you whether we are really holding this debate or whether we are simply restricting ourselves to voting on a resolution which, if we are going to be honest, is more a cause for pity than for glory."
"Please do not interpret this as a criticism of the Commissioner, Mr Monti, since I am more than happy to acknowledge his work in the area of competition and he has always been prepared to hold any necessary debates with this Parliament and has always been in favour of informing us promptly of the positions of his department."
"Neither do I have any intention of criticising the rapporteur, who has produced a report of high quality and has also done so with flexibility and tolerance, accepting the positions of various political groups."
"I therefore believe that my comments relate more to the behaviour of this Parliament and, fundamentally, to the vestiges of an era when its was simply a consultative assembly and did not have the co-legislative role which it has now."
"We therefore have a tendency to issue documents, this document on the annual report on competition, and then go back to considering other issues on which we have already contributed as legislators, although unfortunately competition rules are excluded from the codecision procedure."
"Furthermore, there is not always coherence between what we say at one moment and what we say at another."
"Returning to the report, I would like to congratulate Mr Agag once again on its content, most of which we agree with, and to make a comment."
"Once the Commission has taken its decision, I believe that there is no need for, and we should remove, the section relating to the prohibition of public companies investing capital in companies from the liberalised sectors - think of the conflict between Electricité de France and Hidrocantábrico - which Mr Agag introduces in his desire to stick up for and assist certain positions of the Spanish government."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur - who is now represented by Mr Evans - for a really sound report."
"I should like to express my gratitude for the cooperation I have received from Mr Longo in preparing the report."
"I should also like to thank Commissioner Monti for his strong commitment to competition policy in the EU."
"I should also like to take the opportunity to emphasise that the fight for free competition is a fight that must be engaged in ceaselessly."
"There are at present quite a few good examples of free competition' s being threatened as soon as the opportunity arises for disrupting it."
"The first, very telling example is the proposal tabled by the Commission to introduce an interim subsidy arrangement for certain types of shipbuilding."
"The background to the proposal is that we in Europe believe we are exposed to unfair competition from South Korea."
"Obviously, many interested parties try to exploit the situation in order to introduce a much higher level of subsidy than is justified by the realities of the situation."
"Where this matter is concerned, I therefore wish to call upon the European Parliament and my fellow MEPs here in the House to stand by the Council' s resolution from last year to abolish all direct subsidies for shipbuilding."
"The next example of an attempt to exploit the situation is provided by the aviation industry which is experiencing a lot of turbulence in these very days and weeks."
"This has led many to campaign for the introduction of subsidies."
"I should like to remind you that the problems experienced by a number of carriers are not primarily due to the tragic events of 11 September, but rather to the fact that the airline companies are now facing the harsh realities earlier than expected."
"The whole sector has for a long time been in need of radical restructuring and, as politicians, we must ensure that the present frenzied and tumultuous situation is not used to introduce a mass of subsidies that are to be paid for by ourselves as taxpayers and that are designed to bail out a host of unprofitable companies and routes for which, as consumers, we shall have to pay the excess price over and above what we have paid in tax."
"To conclude, I should like to return to a couple of specific points in the report."
"I think it important that we should hold the Commission to its assurance that the new competition rules do not mean a renationalisation of competition policy."
"It is also important that the Commission should continue to produce its annual report on State subsidies, even though it has now introduced the scoreboard for which I myself, for example, have for a long time been pressing and which I am very pleased about."
"It is also my hope that the Commission will be attentive to the desire for a start to be made as soon as possible on looking into the rules for the repayment of unlawfully allocated State subsidies - an area which leaves a lot to be desired."
"Finally, I hope that the Commission will follow up the request to look more closely into the possibility of improving the legal position of companies hit by losses and of involving third parties more extensively whenever the Commission deals with practical matters."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Agag Longo, and to Mr Evans for his speech."
"I admire the quality of Mr Agag Longo' s report and appreciate the many constructive observations that have been made."
"It does not escape me that the report also contains critical notes, and I assure you that, although it is impossible in this House to take a definite stand on all the observations made in the report, I can guarantee that all of them will be very carefully examined."
"I am also grateful to the other speakers in this sitting - Messrs Konrad and Berenguer Fuster and Ms Riis-Jørgensen - for their political and, I must add, their cultural support for the European Union' s competition policy."
"The thirtieth annual report summarises the developments that have occurred during 2000."
"A quick glance is enough to realise that the competition sector has continued to show intense activity, with a total of 1206 new files, 564 cases of State aid, 345 mergers and acquisitions and 297 cases of monopolies."
"Work in the legislative field has focused on reform of our basic rules and regulations."
"This activity has led to approval of new regulations on block exemptions in horizontal agreement issues."
"New guidelines on vertical restraints have been adopted, in addition to the new 1999 block exemption regulation."
"You will know that these new formulations give greater weight to economic guidance."
"The fact that the number of cases of monopolies has fallen may be due to these new rules on vertical restraints, which have substantially reduced the obligation to notify this kind of agreement, and this gives the offices more room to concentrate on the more serious and difficult cases."
"Considerable progress has been made towards a reform of the competition rules, to which Parliament gave decisive support a month ago, adopting Mr Evans' s report by such a large majority."
"On the issue of mergers, a communication on corrective provisions has been adopted, as has a simplified procedure for certain straightforward types of operation, so that now about 40 per cent of merger cases can be dealt with in this way."
"On the issue of controlling State aid, the Commission has introduced, for the first time, three groups of exemption regulations: on the application of the de minimis rule, on aid to small and medium-sized enterprises, and on aid for training."
"I accept Ms Riis-Jørgensen' s point about recovering illegal State aid, because I too believe it to be very important for overall credibility."
"As regards aid levels, the general trend that they are falling is confirmed, although this does not alter the fact that they remain very high."
"Allow me, Mr President, to highlight the fact that, in relation to State aid and contrary to what paragraph 2 of your motion for a resolution would suggest, the Commission has effectively already instigated proceedings against State aid in the form of tax facilities and, on 11 July, the number of them had risen to 15."
"We are also intensifying our efforts to recover the sums wrongly paid out in the form of State aid."
"Let me now point out three aspects to which we are devoting special attention, not only in the last annual report but also in our everyday operations."
"The first and most important is the impact of competition policy on consumers."
"I know that Parliament shares our opinion that the consumer should be the final beneficiary of competition policy."
"It is certainly necessary to make consumers more aware of the benefits of competition policy and to inform citizens about our activity and the effects it has for them."
"As you will have noticed, the report gives examples of certain decisions, showing the benefits resulting from them for consumers."
"A good example is the decision against OPEL Nederland to defend the right of consumers to buy a car without hindrance in a Member State in which prices are lower; other, more recent examples are an analogous decision against Volkswagen and the setting-up of an enquiry into mobile telecommunications prices charged by roaming operators."
"On the subject of cars, I accept what Mr Evans said: the Commission is working hard to draw up a proposal for the period subsequent to 30 September 2002, when the regulation for block exemption from the motor vehicle distribution agreement comes to an end."
"I intend to present a new draft regulation by the end of the year, and I am sure you will be glad to express your opinion on it, given the extreme interest Parliament has so far shown in this subject."
"With regard to consumer information, may I remind you of the initiative of the European Competition Days, which grew out of discussions in this Parliament."
"After Lisbon, Paris and Stockholm, the next will be held under the Belgian Presidency in Antwerp on 11 October, and will focus on competition in the pharmaceutical sector."
"A second priority we are working on - one which several people have mentioned this evening - concerns State aid, not only to make control stricter but also to make this subject more transparent through initiatives like the public register and the scoreboard, which is, in fact, readily available on the Internet."
"The third priority area of work concerns globalisation: how competition policy, by seeking greater coordination among the various parts of the world, can make its contribution to the governance of globalisation."
"In this respect - apart, of course, from the highly intense relationships within the European Union with the national competition authorities - outside the European Union we have set up close bilateral working relationships and begun most welcome and far-reaching cooperation in particular with the competition authorities of the United States, and last week we held an intense session of work in Washington, at which we planned further development of such bilateral cooperation."
"I think, however, that the bilateral dimension is not enough, and we are proceeding, with all the weight of conviction that the European Union has in this area, to develop two forms of multilateral cooperation."
"One is the proposal to introduce some basic, binding competition standards within the World Trade Organisation. The other is the recent initiative to launch a global competition forum to provide a venue for world-level discussions among competition authorities."
"Among our short-term priorities is the work now under way of modernising the competition rules, which we have been carrying out with even greater conviction - if that is possible - ever since Parliament gave us that vote by such a decisive majority."
"Within the year we intend to conclude the revision of the de minimis communication, which, by specifying which agreements between companies are not forbidden under Article 81, Paragraph 1, will reduce the burden on companies, especially smaller ones, of conforming to the rules."
"Having already mentioned the exemption regulation on cars, I should also like to refer to the policy against cartels, which is a basic pillar of any competition authority. By the end of this year we shall have further developed and updated the policy of indulgence, based on non-prosecution or reduced fines for those who collaborate in disclosing cartels."
"This is yet another area of convergence between the American and European approaches."
"In the matter of controlling mergers, the Commission' s priority for 2001 will be to continue to re-examine the mergers regulation."
"In this respect, during the year I intend to draw up a formal consultation document on this subject."
"As for the way new cases are dealt with, our work is focusing particularly on the recently liberalised markets, which were mentioned particularly by Messrs Konrad, Evans and others, such as energy, air transport, telecommunications and postal services, in an attempt to prevent the former monopoly holders from abusing the positions of strength that they traditionally enjoyed."
"I thank you all once again for the expressions of support and encouragement you have given to the Commission in matters of competition: you know how important it is for the Commission and for me personally to have the support of Parliament in our everyday work, and how seriously we take your critical comments, which we value highly."
"Thank you very much, Mr Monti."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"E-commerce and financial services"
"Mr President, financial services should be the big winner from e-commerce, because the sector does not have the problems of physical delivery, unlike booksellers or grocery supermarkets."
"A financial service, whether a savings vehicle like a pension or a mutual fund or just a simple bank account, is by its nature ethereal and intangible."
"Many transactions in banking and stockbrokerage are already taking place online."
"UNICE, the EU employers' organisation, estimates that nearly one-fifth of banking transactions in Europe are now executed through the Internet, direct dial, mobile phone, or digital television, nearly double the proportion in the US."
"In the Nordic countries of the Union, the overall proportion is more than a third."
"However, the vast majority of those transactions happen within an EU Member State."
"Cross-border e-commerce in financial services is in its infancy and it has not chased prices down to the level of the cheapest Member State."
"Indeed, the most recent survey suggests that bank charges vary more widely around the average than they did in the mid-80s at the beginning of the single market programme."
"There is a lot still to do."
"The e-commerce directive past last year was designed to encourage cross-border trade by enshrining the country-of-origin principle."
"This is one of the essential market-opening principles of the internal market."
"If harmonising rules is too difficult, at least recognise the right of any company to do business anywhere in the Union once authorised by one Member State."
"The key judgment was that consumers would benefit more from increased competition than they might lose from the greater difficulty of seeking legal redress from a far-flung and delinquent supplier."
"That is simply because the country-of-origin principle ensures the maximum amount of extra competition and extra competition is ultimately the consumer's best friend."
"True, the e-commerce directive allows exceptions still subject to national regulation of incoming services, notably insurance in unit trusts."
"In general, most of the liberally-minded market-opening fraternity were pleased to get it on the statute book."
"As its full implications have sunk in, some Member States have been quietly attempting to restrict the scope of its application and backpedal on its implications."
"This is the real significance of the Commission's White Paper on e-commerce and financial services."
"It is designed to clear up the bits left out of the e-commerce directive and the report we are debating tonight is designed to support the Commission's resolve to open up the single market; if necessary, by insisting on the provisions of the e-commerce directive despite the reservations of some Member States."
"We must maintain the liberal thrust of the e-commerce directive."
"That means also setting a clear timetable to include both insurance and advertising of unit trusts in the general country-of-origin approach."
"Insurance services, for example, are particularly suited to e-commerce provision."
"It also means basing any guidance from the Commission to Member States about consumer protection on real documented problems, not on imagined ones."
"Of course, there are real difficulties."
"The Commission needs to look at these difficulties carefully and attempt to set out a clear road map to allow e-commerce and financial services to flourish."
"Consumers are concerned about security, particularly with cross-border transactions."
"Soft law provisions, alternative dispute procedures, should be made effective so that they can deal with the vast majority of problematic cases and we have asked for a regular report on that."
"Some convergence of national rules on consumer contracts is clearly desirable, though this should not be used as an excuse to delay the single market."
"Some standard features of terrestrial banking, like applying the money-laundering provisions by looking your depositor in the eye to ask where her or his money came from, require fresh thought in an e-depositing world."
"It is also the case that financial services transactions are rarely entirely online without any offline elements, so we need to work as far as possible to ensure coherence."
"The prize for getting this framework right is very great."
"E-commerce and the euro can make a reality of cross-border financial services, not just for business but also for savers and the extra competition will, as it always does, bring long-lasting and real benefits."
"So, I urge the House to stick to the line that we have set in the past in asking for opening up of this market."
", draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"Mr President, it gives me great pleasure this evening, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, to give our opinion on what is an excellent report."
"We started work having the benefit of the full text of the rapporteur, Mr Huhne's report, and so our role was very much to improve on what we felt was already an excellent text."
"From the perspective of the legal Affairs Committee, which was responsible for the E-commerce directive, we feel that the rapporteur's thrust - as he emphasised just now and in relation to the country-of-origin principle - is in line with our own opinion."
"We would add our voice very strongly to that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in encouraging the Commission to move down this line."
"I want to pick up a couple of points on our amendments."
"We are very grateful to the rapporteur for accepting all of the amendments of the Legal Affairs Committee and to the committee for voting them into the final report."
"We lay particular emphasis on the question of a payment and payment systems."
"It is quite clear from recent studies across the European Union that one of the things that is deterring consumers from shopping in the electronic age is worry about the security of their payments."
"This will be absolutely crucial if financial services are to move forward."
"So we have suggested a number of methods for improving the security of electronic payments."
"We have encouraged the Commission, particularly, to take a look at emerging forms of electronic payment."
"While at the moment a very high level of consumer transactions are made by credit cards, we think that new formats will emerge and that the Commission needs to take that into account."
"In conclusion, legislation has to enable contracts to be concluded by means of electronic signatures in financial services transactions."
"We pointed that out as a specific area to be addressed."
"This is a very good report."
"I encourage the House to give it its full support when we vote on it tomorrow."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Huhne, I, too, would like to add my congratulations to those of the previous speaker, Mr Harbour."
"This is an excellent report and it was a pleasure to work with you."
"I can already say that tomorrow we shall be fully supporting the line taken by this report."
"There are at present two developments running in parallel that are very important for this field."
"The Internet is growing in importance."
"Trade over the Internet is growing more and more."
"And on the other hand we are in the process of completing the internal market for financial services in Europe."
"Our target is the year 2005."
"Financial services in particular, because they are not material, are pre-eminently suitable to be offered internationally on the Internet."
"I believe we will in the foreseeable future have a situation where customers buy insurance or banking services over the Internet not from a local bank but across the border in a neighbouring country and that the Internet is an excellent way of making comparisons in this field."
"It is also important, however, that we win consumers over for this kind of commerce."
"It is consumer protection that I am addressing here; competition has already been discussed."
"But consumers will make e-commerce in financial services a success only if they have confidence in it, if the contractual or non-contractual provisions are in place to safeguard their rights and to give them appropriate help if they have complaints in cross-border business."
"I support the Commission' s initiative here of setting up extra-judicial arbitration procedures such as FIN-NET."
"Only if consumers are convinced that any problems they have in future will be sorted out will they make use of the net in future."
"The third thing was mentioned by the previous speaker: technical systems."
"Many people are still afraid and have misgivings about using the Internet."
"I still have myself."
"I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that."
"There are still reservations and inhibitions about that sort of thing."
"Online and offline commerce are moving closer and closer together and we therefore need to harmonise the legal provisions here, too."
"I can only back what the previous speaker has said, that we must abide firmly by the country-of-origin principle, that the Commission must stand firm."
"Parliament will also be making its position known tomorrow."
"In smaller areas, too, however, like the abolition of national marketing and competition rules that stand in the way of the development of the Internet - fortunately, this was included in the report - we need to move forwards in order not to hinder development."
"I would like to say in conclusion that e-commerce in this area will take a turn for the better, even if we may have gained a different impression from the stock markets in the last few months, but it will take off, it will continue to develop positively."
"We need to make Europe fit for global competition, ensuring that in Europe, too, financial services can be offered in this way."
"I therefore believe that this report shows the way and is a good step forwards, as is the Commission's support for it."
"Mr President, I too congratulate the rapporteur on the report which he will present to us tomorrow."
"We know he has worked extremely hard on this report and very closely with others in this Chamber to ensure its success."
"Clearly the changing industry of financial services lends itself very well to the new technologies which have emerged and continue to emerge across the world."
"The ability of consumers, confusing as it can be, to pick such technologies, to choose a variety of financial services within the individual Member States, has been with us now for some little time."
"But the choice of financial products across borders inside Europe is even more recent an affair."
"This means that services, rather than physical products - and the rights of consumers to have confidence in the performance of those services - is as vital here as it is for manufactured products."
"The marketing and advertising of services, the claims and boasts of providers, must be checked against the need to allay the fears of risk to consumers, to safeguard their purchases and exchanges by electronic means."
"This is why my group has so high a regard for the element of consumer safety."
"The country-of-origin principle is simply the best agreed way of approaching the process of harmonising the standards for attaining an EU-wide application of the guidance for those standards which are to be expected in those nations."
"At the same time Brussels, too, is clearly more than just an element for consideration by the Commission in this process."
"The amendments before the House allow for the flexibility required to pursue the exciting new medium of technology, as does the text."
"In particular I would like to recognise Mr Herzog's concerns, where he rightly points out in his amendments that we need to keep pace with technological change in order to reduce the possibility of criminality, of fraud and of money laundering."
"My group believes that so long as consumer interests can be asserted and maintained as an essential element of the provisions of this report, then it is obviously going to be willing to withdraw any amendments that might suggest derogations or deletions to the country- of-origin principle."
"The liberation of e-commerce is the element of any dynamic European economy of the future; the counterbalance that has to be struck and which has to be fully realised is the effects it has on those who would use it as consumers."
"I commend this report to the House."
"Mr President, the country-of-origin principle should meet the challenge of offering financial services electronically."
"I have one comment to make."
"First of all the scope for national policy."
"The country-of-origin principle respects national legislation."
"In addition, it is possible for Member States to deviate from the country-of-origin principle, but only on the basis of well-defined reasons."
"That is why, in the report, the rapporteur might have provided more extensive reasoning with regard to the effect the principle has on national policy."
"This would probably have prevented a number of unfortunate, socialist amendments from being tabled."
"Furthermore, the report is based on the assumption that more competition can only benefit the consumer."
"He should know the rules with which the supplier complies. Otherwise, confidence in e-trade will not grow."
"That is why the rapporteur might have been more specific in explaining consumer protection at European level."
"If bottlenecks occur, it can become difficult to allow for exceptions because not all Member States will agree that there is a need for these to be made."
"It is therefore useful to continue to monitor closely whether e-trade will be satisfactory to suppliers and consumers alike."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur very warmly on his report."
"My colleague Mr Skinner has already indicated that our group will be able to withdraw most of our amendments if we can get clarification on one point that is very important for us and which is also concerned with consumer protection - and the rapporteur has already indicated a willingness to accommodate."
"I am also willing to accept that members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have a responsibility for financial services in particular, naturally have a slightly different focus than so many members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market."
"As a lawyer specialising in European law I do still often consult the EU Treaties."
"Perhaps we should no longer do that so often."
"Because when I turn to Article 50, which is about services that have not been harmonised, I read something about a market location principle, not a country-of-origin principle."
"We are all aware that these provisions are creating a lot of problems today."
"That is why Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has introduced the proposal to amend the Treaty."
"If we are lucky, we will be able to do that by 2006 at the earliest."
"But until then we shall have to come up with something to cope with this problem."
"I think we have found the e-commerce directive to be very well balanced in its conception."
"I was myself shadow rapporteur for my group at the time and I hold fast to the belief that by combining harmonisation, country-of-origin principle and a few exceptions, we have found a very well balanced solution that we should probably try to use in other areas, too."
"I am not a believer in magic formulas or cure-alls."
"We are now at last getting the Council' s Common Position on the distance marketing of financial services."
"We shall all have to put our thinking caps on to find a sensible solution for dealing with the problems that the Member States have also seen."
"I think we will make it easier for ourselves if we go for pragmatic legislation rather than fight over principles and stay high and dry."
"The Commission takes heart from the broad support for the Commission's objectives in the field of e-commerce and financial services - support evidenced by the report of your Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee."
"I welcome that report as being most balanced and constructive."
"I draw strength from Parliament's clear commitment to the country-of-origin approach which, if I am not mistaken, has been supported by all who spoke on this subject this evening."
"In particular I welcome the report's rejection of any attempt to roll-back the e-commerce directive in the area of financial services."
"That is a position very much shared by the Commission and strongly defended during the negotiations on the distance marketing directive which, as Members may or may not know, resulted in a political agreement at last Thursday's Internal Market Council."
"We will follow that line in future proposals and negotiations."
"I should like to pick up on a few key points made in the report."
"They are points which were also raised by various Members in the debate."
"On the need for a road map setting out what needs to be done and when, in May the Commission published a financial services policy group report to the Ecofin Council."
"That contains just such a road map and hopefully brings greater clarity about the way forward."
"Amongst other things that road map sets out the concrete steps that must now be taken to enable the country-of-origin approach to apply across the board to cover those financial services currently derogated and to be applied to other traditional distance training modes."
"In broad terms, that would involve further convergence in national consumer protection rules, in particular by updating EU legislation which predates the e-commerce directive."
"On the Commission's guidance, where it is our aim to add transparency to situations under which Article 3(4) might be invoked, I should like to inform Parliament that this exercise was launched in July."
"We are now in the process of receiving the first replies from Member States."
"I should like to assure Parliament that it is not the Commission's intention for the guidance to represent a de facto additional derogation to the country-of-origin approach and that the guidance will be reviewed to take account of progress and further harmonisation of consumer protection rules, with the aim that it should become redundant by the 2005 Lisbon deadline for an integrated European market in financial services."
"In respect of this point I would particularly like to say to Mr Radwan that earlier this year the Commission helped to put in place a network for the handling of cross-border complaints in financial services which ought to serve to raise still further the level of confidence of consumers who venture onto the Internet."
"I hope that is to the liking of Mr Radwan."
"May I further welcome Parliament's call for a single payments area in which it would be easy and cheap to transfer money across borders."
"I should like to recall that in July the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation to align the costs of cross-border payments with those made at national level."
"I can also inform Parliament that with a view to making payments more secure, the Commission in February adopted a communication on the prevention of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, which set out a three-year action plan."
"This point was also raised by Mr Harbour and I should like to add that the Commission is looking into the possibility of refunds."
"I will inform Mr Harbour later of the progress in this respect."
"Finally, I take note of Parliament's interesting suggestions that the Commission should seek to negotiate mutual recognition agreements with third countries, at least with those third countries that provide similar levels of prudential supervision and investor protection."
"The Commission finds that a very valuable suggestion and we should like to consider it further."
"In conclusion, I very much welcome the draft report as its stands."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, for his strong support for the country-of-origin principle."
"Indeed all speakers this evening have echoed this strong support."
"I nonetheless express concern about a number of the amendments which were recently tabled by some honourable Members."
"Several of the amendments, unfortunately, are not acceptable to the Commission."
"They would shift the balance of this report unfavourably and undermine the strong support which Parliament has shown for the Commission's e-commerce strategy in the past."
"That support was so manifest and so vital at the time of the adoption of the electronic commerce directive last year, when Members voted unanimously in favour of the directive and the underlying country-of-origin approach. That is precisely the approach which the Commission, with the support of Parliament, would like to continue."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Internal market strategy for services"
"Mr President, I would like to begin by taking the opportunity to reassure Commissioner Bolkestein."
"We have already said in the two interventions on the Huhne Report that most of our amendments have already been withdrawn."
"Both of us have emphasised that here."
"So far as I know, there are two amendments remaining."
"The Commission can easily live with that and I hope the rapporteur can, too."
"A vote will be taken on the amendments tomorrow."
"Now to my own report, however."
"We know from experience in this House that the agenda is very often changed."
"We are often glad about that to a greater or lesser extent."
"This time there is a real point to it - my report was deferred so that the debate on the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan could be held yesterday."
"That is certainly more important than the further refinements we want to make to the internal market."
"It also allows us to hold a kind of joint debate today."
"The field of financial services, services generally and also Mr Radwan' s report, which will be debated next, go together very well."
"I am sure we all agree that services generally as well as financial services and information services deserve our special attention."
"They are rightly described as the key area of the European economy today."
"Two thirds of Europe' s workforce are already employed in the service sector."
"Above all, the dynamism and innovation that make this sector so important will enable us to achieve the objective set in Lisbon."
"If my report has given rise to some differences of opinion, they are never about the objective, only about what we consider to be the most appropriate means of achieving that objective."
"I am sure we can support the Commission' s approach of identifying all the barriers in a first phase, listing all the obstacles encountered by service providers, and then in a second phase proposing suitable remedies."
"But we have no time to lose."
"We now have the remedy of treaty infringement proceedings."
"In many cases, better information from authorities, professional bodies and similar institutions about the law as it currently stands could perhaps help to remove some unjustified obstacles."
"In all but one of the urgent legislative measures listed by the Commission - I have to admit it is the reform of public contracting - Parliament has not been responsible for any undue delay on any other points."
"The call for certain legislative measures to be speeded up should therefore be addressed primarily to the Council."
"I have already mentioned that we have now at last received the common position on the distance marketing of financial services."
"Discussions in the Council took a very long time."
"I hope we can make up some of the lost ground in Parliament and make rapid progress."
"Something else that has already been before the Council for a very long time is the two directives on the situation of third country citizens when it comes to providing services - employees on the one hand and self-employed on the other, where the introduction of a service provision card could make a major contribution to achieving freedom in the provision of services."
"I am also sorry that the Commission itself no longer lists these measures as priority measures in this communication today."
"Essentially, our differences of opinion are over which legal instruments will be suitable."
"We should not rule any instrument out."
"We will need further harmonisation."
"I am sure we will be able to implement the country-of-origin principle on the basis of harmonised, coordinated, largely approximated laws in our Member States."
"Article 50 of the EC Treaty will probably also continue to be used in a number of remaining areas."
"I do, of course have a problem when harmonisation is automatically described as over-regulation and when the country-of-origin principle is to be used as a magic bullet, the cure all to solve every problem at a stroke."
"Unfortunately, things are not like that."
"We have to go this laborious way of finding the appropriate instrument for every problem that arises."
"I would again like to point out that even in the e-commerce directive - important as the role of the country-of-origin principle is there, and I fully support the content of that directive - the regulating principle is not the only one to apply."
"The amendments that have been tabled for tomorrow follow two principles: preserving freedom of choice of legal instruments, not confining ourselves to one instrument, and not making any sector-specific changes."
"That is also in line with the Commission' s wishes, since it deliberately wanted to present a document applicable to all sectors."
"Mr President, I would first like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and my colleagues Messrs Harbour and Beysen who, in the responsible committee, have done an excellent job of including and taking into account the views expressed by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on this matter."
"I am very glad that the European Parliament is now about to take a decision on supporting the Commission' s proposed strategy for creating an internal market for services."
"The need for this is enormous - for economic growth, for the advancement of companies, for employment and for consumers."
"An internal market for services has for a long time been a missing element in a European growth policy, a policy which must also be supplemented by measures to speed up the liberalisation process in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy - something which cannot be said too often."
"The Commission' s overall course of action is good."
"We cannot continue with sectoral regulation of services, something which has so far proved to hinder, rather than facilitate, the creation of an internal market."
"Ninety-nine per cent of European companies are small and medium-sized."
"These employ 66 per cent of workers and generate 55 per cent of turnover."
"Bearing in mind the significance of these companies for the European economy, it is necessary for them to be able to benefit fully from the internal market for services - a market which quite simply cannot function well without them."
"It is also important that the candidate countries should be involved as soon as possible."
"What is known as the enlarged internal market for services must also be well prepared."
"Finally, in order for this work to be a success, the Commission must not be left alone."
"We have a major responsibility here in Parliament, but the Member States too have a great responsibility to involve themselves in the process and to work at political, legislative and administrative levels to remove obstacles to the exchange of services."
"Without political will at all levels, the goal cannot be achieved."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Berger very much for her clear statement of support for this proposal this evening."
"Those of you who have looked at the report will know that she withdrew her original explanatory statement."
"I was delighted to hear this evening that she had confirmed her full support."
"This report, with the support of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and my colleague, Mr Beysen, and with Mrs Berger's assistance also, now strikes the right balance by giving the Commission a clear indication of the support of our committee and others for this important initiative."
"I am delighted that Mrs Berger is going with the flow of that for many of us felt that her initial report really did not do full justice to what we regard as an imaginative proposal, a wide-ranging proposal, and one that is of crucial economic importance to the future of the European Union."
"We must not ignore the continual structural change in the world economies, in particular in developed economies like the European Union."
"We are seeing services and manufacturing business starting to converge."
"We are seeing more integration of traditional service providers, with their manufacturing arms looking to focus on customers in a very different way."
"Therefore, opening up the single market for services is going to be of great importance."
"One thing I particularly welcome from the Commission's analysis - something it has indicated in the report that it will now do more work on - is that it highlights the importance of a highly competitive service infrastructure in the overall competitiveness of European industry."
"So many businesses depend on high-quality, effective, low-cost, efficient services to deliver their businesses."
"Indeed the whole of the electronic commerce area, which we talked about in financial services earlier on, is facilitating and opening up these sorts of markets."
"Therefore, this communication is extremely welcome."
"We look forward, in the Legal Affairs Committee as well as in the Industry Committee, to working with the Commission and to moving forward with the necessary legal framework and the other actions that will be necessary to achieve it."
"I want to reinforce what Mrs Grönfeldt Bergman said about the role of the small- and medium-sized enterprises in this sector."
"Again we are seeing the combination of increasing importance of services combined with electronic commerce and the electronic means of delivering those services."
"That is an area, particularly crucial in the business-to-business sector, where small- and medium-sized enterprises have a crucial role to play in the European economy."
"Again, these provisions will help."
"I refer back to the country-of-origin principle."
"I share Mrs Berger's view that by a happy coincidence we have a set of reports tonight with a common thread running through them."
"I do not regard the country-of-origin principle as a magic bullet to achieve market integration at a single stroke."
"Clearly there is a lot of work to be done."
"Yet, by operating the country-of-origin principle vigorously and consistently we will actually achieve competition and higher standards for consumers more quickly than by any other means."
"Consumers are going to be well-informed and intelligent enough to know where the best standards of consumer protection are."
"They are going to demand them from other countries."
"This is not a question of harmonising down."
"It is an effective means of making the market operate in the interests of consumers, which is exactly what Commissioner Monti told us in addressing the competition report earlier on."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the attainment of a real internal market for services will afford the small and medium-sized enterprises added incentive for innovation - as was already underlined in the debate, in fact. It will also improve the competitiveness of European industry and will provide more benefits to the consumers who will be offered a whole series of high-quality competitive services."
"I am therefore of the opinion that it is of crucial importance for the internal market strategy to build on the strength of the e-commerce directive and the principle of mutual recognition."
"Mutual recognition forms the keystone of the European Union and the European internal market, in particular."
"Mutual recognition is only possible if the consumer enjoys equivalent protection right across the Union."
"This means that harmonisation is only required if this equivalent protection does not exist."
"Furthermore, a business based in the Union is guaranteed completely free cross-border trade in services."
"I therefore believe that the report, as it has now been approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, after inserting, inter alia, a number of amendments which I myself tabled, reflects and supports the Commission' s balanced approach."
"Finally, I am delighted to find out that the Commission adopted a regulation on sales stimulation yesterday."
"This shows that the Commission is really serious about further developing the internal market."
"In the current economic climate, we cannot afford to lose momentum in the direction of a real internal market."
"Mr President, firstly the Commission would like to emphasise the economic and political importance of its communication on a new internal market strategy for services, which I hope, will henceforth enjoy the European Parliament's full support."
"A functioning internal market in services, far from being a reality, remains an objective to be achieved."
"It is an objective which ought to be considered a priority if we really want the European economy to become the most competitive in the world by the end of this decade - the ambition we set ourselves in March 2000 in Lisbon."
"Just to quote a single fact, services account for two-thirds of the European economy and, therefore, any progress we make on that front will greatly benefit the citizens of this continent."
"Achieving that goal is rendered all the important by the growing dynamic of the information society, with all its potential for cross-border trade, and by the imminent introduction of the euro, which will increase the transparency of costs and encourage businesses and consumers to look beyond national boundaries for the provision of services."
"Unfortunately, at present there are still too many legal and administrative obstacles preventing our businesses and consumers from considering the whole of the European Community as their true domestic market."
"That means that we are failing to realise the enormous potential for growth and establish a framework in which millions of new jobs can be created."
"At no other time in our recent history has it been more important to encourage entrepreneurship, innovation and opportunity."
"Just as the 1992 campaign enabled us to focus on - and to a large extent achieve - an internal market in goods, it is now crucial for us to concentrate on dismantling the barriers to trade and services."
"This new strategy seeks, above all to enable two groups - namely small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers - to reap the full benefits of the internal market."
"In many instances, small and medium-sized enterprises - which Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen have mentioned also evening - will not have the means to establish themselves in all or several Member States."
"If they try to do so, they will be faced with the need to expand their infrastructure and with extra financial and administrative burdens."
"Therefore, they must be allowed to offer their services freely throughout the Community from their establishment."
"As far as consumers are concerned, this strategy is designed above all for them."
"We shall not have succeeded until European consumers have greater access to and a wider choice of, safe and reliable services at more competitive prices, and that means there must be more competition between service providers."
"The strategy is the first attempt to apply, at Community level, a horizontal approach to trade and services since the General Programme for the removal of barriers to services of 1962 was introduced almost forty years ago."
"It calls for the cooperation and support of national authorities, the participation of all interested parties and the active engagement of the Community institutions."
"The report by Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has highlighted many of the difficult issues preventing an effective internal market in services from functioning."
"I am delighted that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market shares the Commission's philosophy and supports its ambitious approach."
"I also hope to be able to count on the full support of the European Parliament in implementing both the first and second phases of the strategy."
"The first phase is now being carried out."
"This means that existing restrictions to the freedom to provide services and the freedom of establishment are being identified and evaluated."
"In the second phase, legal and operational instruments for the elimination of barriers will be put in place and our approach will be based on harmonisation, assuring a high level of consumer protection combined with the principles of country of origin and mutual recognition enshrined in the Treaty."
"Accordingly, the Commission would not welcome the newly tabled amendments."
"Those amendments appear to run counter to the principles of mutual recognition and country of origin and, in the Commission's view, would undermine the positive and well-balanced approach of the report, for which the Commission is duly grateful."
"I should like to thank Mrs Berger on behalf of the Commission for having drafted that report."
"The Commission feels that the newly tabled amendments would significantly weaken the support of the European Parliament for the proposed internal market approach."
"In conclusion, I refer to the earlier discussion between Mrs Berger, Mr Harbour and Mr Beysen on the various merits and demerits of harmonisation, mutual recognition and the country of origin."
"Large-scale harmonisation may waste time, prove unnecessarily bureaucratic and divert political goodwill and attention away from the key issues that Member States should agree on."
"It may also contravene the subsidiarity principle in the Treaty."
"On the other hand, it must be admitted that harmonisation may be necessary where there is a need to establish a high level of protection, notably for consumers."
"Mutual recognition, on the other hand, can be made to work more satisfactorily if it is implemented through secondary Community legislation which clearly identifies the areas in which mutual recognition must be accepted."
"Both principles have their merits and demerits, but by and large I am inclined to agree with Mr Harbour's view that the quickest way of achieving an adequate level of protection for the consumer is to adopt the country-of-origin principle."
"In conclusion, may I thank Mr Beysen for his kind remarks on the sales promotion directive adopted by the Commission this week."
"Lastly may I apologise to Mrs Berger for having omitted previously to thank her on the Commission's behalf for having withdrawn almost all of the amendments tabled on the previous matter."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Pre-contractual information on home loans"
"Mr President, Commissioner, we have now reached the last item on the agenda and I hope that the crush of Members will not now be too much."
"What is this report about?"
"It is about the question of precontractual information on home loans."
"We are in the process of creating an EU internal market by 2005, and one of the objectives is that in future cross-border home loans should be offered and taken up by customers."
"An agreement in the matter has been reached at European level between consumer associations and banking associations."
"We need that to be put into effect relatively quickly."
"It would be gratifying if that were to happen in less than twelve months."
"I would like at this point to expressly highlight the positive role played by the Commission, which managed to bring the two sides together repeatedly and in the end achieve a result in this difficult moderation process."
"This may become the first positive example of self-regulation in the European Union."
"But there are still things that need to be done."
"First, we must look at the moderation process itself."
"It took about four years and according to some participants was not always very transparent."
"We call on the Commission to report to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the experience gained from this moderation process and the conclusions to be drawn for future self-regulation processes."
"As I have already said, it may be a positive example."
"But if it proves not to be a positive example of self-regulation, the Commission really will have to put forward its own proposal for a directive."
"A few points are still outstanding here."
"Firstly, of course, we need a commitment not only from the banking associations, but we need a Europe-wide commitment from the banks themselves."
"The extent to which the banks will participate is an open question here."
"Secondly, the register that is published must of course also be posted on the Internet."
"We also need similar forms throughout Europe."
"It is already foreseeable that some Member States that were very keen on producing a standard form, especially at the outset, will want to go their own way and may take a different route in future."
"At all events, comparability must be preserved here, in the interests of the customer."
"We ought to try to extend this agreement to the candidate countries."
"We should also extend the mediation body you have just mentioned, Commissioner, to this field."
"We should not retain the internal mediation body proposed in the agreements, but follow the Commission' s initiative here."
"We also need comparability of data."
"The effective annual interest rate in particular is highly important for the consumer."
"The figure at the end is not the only important thing, but the basis on which it is calculated, too."
"The effective annual interest rate is still calculated in different ways in Europe."
"We should work towards getting a uniform method of calculation."
"I would very much welcome it if this did not have to come from the Commission, but if the banks themselves could manage to agree on a method within a very short space of time."
"We should then also apply all this to services offered over the Internet."
"We have, after all, just had the Huhne report, which also said we wanted to press forward with this."
"We should have this information there in future, too."
"And finally, as the Huhne report recommends, future legislation should be harmonised with the legal terms used in this code."
"In conclusion I would like to stress that I very much welcome this voluntary code of conduct."
"It now requires critical appraisal and monitoring."
"We hope the Commission will before long present the Committee with a report on how successful the code has been and whether we can continue along that road or whether we must introduce legislation."
"Mr President, I express my sincere appreciation of Mr Radwan' s motion for a resolution regarding pre-contractual information for home loans."
"There is no doubt that work to reorganise and tidy up this rather confused sector has now begun. Unfortunately, some debatable if not downright censurable behaviour has been seen on the part of European lenders."
"The importance of the work that has been done lies essentially in the fact that for the first time a collection of indications and regulations is not the result of self-regulation, as has often happened in the past."
"I refer to the inter-bank agreements on conditions, in which the banks dictated the rules more so as not to have to face fierce competition within the sector rather than to set up transparent contractual schemes to supply to the end-customers, but by means of an agreement, even though a voluntary one, between banks and consumers' associations."
"Also important is the choice of transparency and publicity laid down in Articles 21, 22, 23 and 24 of the Code itself, and especially Article 25, which states that an offer made over the Internet should be made in accordance with the European scheme and in compliance with all the provisions and indications that are laid down."
"In conclusion, I should like to point out that this code will require further additions and corrections."
"The practical stage will be to give the necessary indications."
"I am just troubled by the fact that the committee did not accept an amendment I tabled to set a limit - the total amount - on the loan to be registered."
"My reason for this amendment was the fact that in some Member States the credit institutions triple the loan figure registered compared with the amount actually lent, which is doubly harmful to the consumer: first, there is a question of image, in that, to an inexperienced person the debt might appear to be three times as large as it really is; and secondly, a matter of costs, particularly notarial costs, which are calculated on the registered amount of the loan."
"I hope that in future this aspect can be reconsidered."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and thank him for his cooperation."
"Completing the internal market for financial services and affording consumers a high level of protection is a Community priority."
"Signing a home loan agreement is often the most important and the biggest financial obligation a consumer takes on in his working life."
"We must therefore welcome the fact that a voluntary agreement has been reached at European level between banking and consumer associations on the duty to provide precontractual information."
"That the code of conduct and the register of home loan providers to be kept by the Commission will also be made available on the Internet is also a positive move."
"In this connection, in order to improve the comparability of consumer information, a precise definition of a common effective annual interest rate for home loans should be included in the European Standardised Information Sheet; it should be calculated in the same way throughout the Community and be consistent with the consumer protection directive."
"The information sheet should be designed to include all the data needed to check how the loan is calculated."
"This means, in particular, the manner in which advance and deferred interest is calculated."
"That is one of the most important consumer policy concerns in this sector."
"It is also desirable for Parliament to be included in talks about voluntary agreements in future so that absolute transparency can be guaranteed in drawing up the code of conduct."
"I hope that this example of a voluntary agreement between market participants and consumer associations will prove successful so that it can be extended to other areas of financial services."
"This will be a major contribution to the swift creation of the internal market in financial services."
"But since the consumer side has relatively few resources available, concrete measures must be taken if the voluntary agreement is not kept."
"Otherwise, the instrument of the voluntary agreement - a very good instrument in itself - might prove to be inexpedient because in the end the agreement is only kept by those who cause no problems anyway."
"That alone would not be enough and would be of no benefit."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by saying that the Commission is in a very comfortable position because it agrees entirely with the content of the resolution adopted almost unanimously on 28 August of this year by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The voluntary code of conduct which underpins the Commission's recommendation is the very first example of an agreement reached between banking and consumer associations on the standardisation of information which must be made available to consumers before a contract is concluded."
"Its existence proves, as has rightly been pointed out in the resolution, that market participants are best placed to negotiate proper solutions and to ensure an appropriate balance of interests between contractual parties."
"But however well placed they might be, market participants need a neutral and indefatigable broker to accompany, and sometimes remotivate them, during the long and difficult negotiations of this code."
"Tribute has been paid by the rapporteur to the Commission's role and the Commission is duly appreciative and grateful to the rapporteur for that acknowledgement."
"As agreed between and called for by all parties, the broker, that is, the Commission, will now transform itself into a notary and, if need be, into a referee."
"As a notary, the Commission will, in line with the resolution, keep a register of home-loan lenders who adhere to the code."
"That register will be kept up-to-date and made available online."
"I say this in particular to Mr Radwan who wanted this code to be on the Internet and it will be."
"It will be made available online on the Commission's website and appropriate transparency will therefore be ensured."
"During the negotiation phase the lack of appropriate transparency was deplored in the report."
"It is a point well taken by the Commission, but at least when the register is on the net then that transparency will be restored."
"That is with the Commission as a notary."
"As a referee the Commission will monitor compliance with its recommendation and assess its effectiveness."
"The Commission made it clear in its recommendation that it will consider presenting binding legislation should the terms of its recommendation not be fully complied with."
"Parliament will, as is rightly called for in the resolution, be closely informed - that also is a point that was raised tonight - about our monitoring and compliance-assessment work."
"I am convinced that the code and our related recommendation will play a very significant role in the completion of the internal market for financial services to which Parliament regularly reiterates its support."
"I am also hopeful, like the rapporteur, that this pioneer initiative, once again the first of its kind, will not be a one-off experience."
"Its success will, however, depend on the commitment of all parties - and I am pleased to inform this Parliament that the number of companies having notified their adherence to the code is now already significant, although not entirely satisfactory in some Member States."
"I can assure Parliament that the Commission will work hard in order to ensure adherence of the entire sector."
"In conclusion, Mr Ettl has put forward certain wishes."
"The Commission takes note of those wishes but would like to point out that this affair is restricted to precontractual information and therefore information on interest rates and so on is beyond the scope of this instrument."
"So the Commission takes note of what Mr Ettl has just said but it does not see its way to complying with those wishes."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bolkestein, for your dedication to Parliament this evening."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I would like to make a personal statement pursuant to Rule 122, which allows the speaker three minutes."
"I shall not abuse the Rule."
"Yesterday, an Italian news agency reported a letter sent to President Fontaine by Mr Tajani regarding the speeches made during the debate of the Extraordinary Council of 21 September by Mr Barón Crespo and myself."
"First of all, I would ask you to check and find out whether the President received this letter."
"In addition, I gather from the agency - because I have not read the letter - that our President is being asked to do something improper, which is to take an initiative in defence of the Italian Parliament."
"I do not know with what prerogative the President of the European Parliament could do so."
"I also assume that the Presidents of the Italian Parliament should be perfectly able to defend their own institutions."
"I should like to make it clear, then, that neither Mr Barón Crespo nor I made any attack on that Parliament."
"We did, however, point out what seemed to be extremely inconsistent behaviour on the part of the Italian Government, for, at Brussels, it did not submit any reservation when signing the action plan against terrorism at the close of the Extraordinary Council, nor did it raise any objection of the kind in the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and yet Italy is promoting a law which makes judicial cooperation much more difficult."
"The latter fact has been noted by prominent jurists, the international press and also, today, by the American judge, Mr Calabresi, head of the Court of Appeal in New York, who says that Italy is setting out in the opposite direction to that taken by the United States and the whole international community."
"In any case, we freely expressed an opinion."
"In the debate, Mr Tajani did the same, refuting these arguments with arguments of his own."
"At this point, I frankly cannot see what our President should do other than uphold the prerogative of this Parliament, which, pursuant to Rule 2, guarantees the independence of the parliamentary mandate, and as neither I nor Mr Barón Crespo have violated any rule of behaviour laid down in the Rules of Procedure, I think Mrs Fontaine should do nothing."
"It also seems odd to me that Mr Tajani should complain about alleged interference and then ask the President to do the same."
"Having said that, I should like you, Mr President, to inform Mrs Fontaine that, before the end of this part-session, we would like to know if and how she intends to respond to Mr Tajani' s letter."
"I shall, of course, inform the President of your request."
"I am sure Mrs Fontaine will respond as soon as possible."
"Mr President, a further personal statement."
"I do not believe Mrs Fontaine needs lessons in parliamentary law to know what to do."
"I refer to the letter that I sent to the President yesterday."
"The agencies are not the source of the information, but rather the text of the letter that I sent to Mrs Fontaine to ask her if she thought it appropriate to intervene following certain statements made in this House by the President of the Socialist Group, Mr Barón Crespo and other members of the same Group."
"I do not think I mentioned Mrs Napoletano in the letter, but I do not mind contesting some of her statements."
"The problem is not one of interference of the European Parliament in the Italian Parliament; it is that yesterday and the day before, that is since the beginning of this part-session, we have heard statements repeated in this House that interfere with the Italian Parliament."
"Indeed, when someone asks repeatedly to check whether the laws that are passed are in accordance with the decisions of the Council of Ministers, and nobody questions the assessment of that Council, I repeat and continue to repeat, and I said so yesterday to Mrs Napoletano and the Socialist Group, who had spoken on an issue that concerns Italy' s internal affairs - the Italian Parliament, thank God, is still sovereign and must not be subjected to guardianship - that, in connection with the rules on international letters rogatory, the issue in question is about a verification of a law ratifying the agreement between Italy and Switzerland, and the basic law is that which implements Article 3 of the European Convention on Legal Assistance signed in Strasbourg by all the European countries and which has been in force in Italy since 1961."
"Article 3 lays down the obligation of the country that receives a letter rogatory asking for legal assistance to send the petitioning country the originals of the documents having evidential value or, failing that, a copy with a certificate of authenticity."
"This is not a matter of failing to combat terrorism: we have always been, as a political grouping and as the national government, the expression of this political movement with its Prime Minister strongly committed to fighting terrorism."
"I would not like it to be said, wrongly, in this House, that the law being adopted implementing Article 3 of the European Convention on Legal Assistance, which has all too often been violated by magistrates in Italy, is actually a law favouring terrorism, because it is not."
"Hence my request for Mrs Fontaine' s intervention, if she thinks fit."
"The matter is now closed."
"General product safety"
"The next item is the report (A5-0313/2001) by Mrs González Álvarez, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive on general product safety [3644/2001 - C5-0298/2001 - 2000/0073(COD)]."
"Mr President, I do not think I will take up the whole five minutes."
"This is a third reading and it is a conciliation procedure that we have been following for a long time."
"I would like to welcome the dialogue that has existed between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament, which has been very helpful."
"Naturally, the result of a conciliation is never entirely good for all parties."
"It is usually fairly good, but with a few drawbacks."
"I believe that of the first amendments presented by the European Parliament at first reading, the other two institutions have accepted some important amendments."
"For example, taking into account in product safety not only the producers' liability but also that of the distributors; clear information on the possible risks in the languages of the different States of the Union; faster exchange of information; greater cooperation between Member States to prevent dangerous products from reaching the market; and also, the withdrawal of products which are considered dangerous, even if they are already being marketed."
"Furthermore, although not in the form that our colleagues from the United Kingdom wanted, an amendment aimed at including the special nature of several charities in the United Kingdom was accepted."
"I believe that a major part of the European Parliament' s proposals were included."
"However, not all of them were included, and at second reading we presented only seven amendments which intended to include what had not been accepted by the other institutions."
"These amendments referred to something very important for us: the inclusion of the services in a proposal on which the Commission is working, the results of which it is committed to producing in 2003."
"I believe this is a very important proposal for us, because safety of services should rank on the same level as the directive we are reviewing today."
"We also need to take account of the precautionary principle; this means that when there is a well-founded suspicion that a product is not safe, we should apply this principle of precaution which people talk so much about and which is seldom applied in reality."
"And the possibility that there is an external certificate which supplements the official certification."
"There is also an agreement on comitology which in this case is not what Parliament wanted either, but there is a proposal of continued and regular information to the European Parliament and the Council."
"Some matters which caused us concern in the final proposal were also clearly accepted."
"I would just like to emphasise a matter proposed by the Commission itself at the beginning, which is the ban on exports to Third World countries of products which are not considered safe in Europe."
"This proposal was not accepted by Parliament by a few votes, and is naturally not included in the final document."
"I have to say, as rapporteur, that this is perhaps what concerns me most."
"I believe that we run a real risk that, as we are seeing daily, unscrupulous people export to Third World countries products that are not safe."
"This is an issue that is of enormous concern to me."
"We have the verbal undertaking of the European Commission that there will be very strict controls to ensure that this does not occur, but it would have been safer for it to be included in the proposal and for there to be no risk of exporting products which we Europeans consider dangerous to Third World countries."
"Therefore, Mr President, despite the rapporteur' s great regret that the express ban on the export of unsafe products to the Third World has not been included in the directive, I believe, as I said in the beginning, that it is not the best proposal for the Council and the Commission, perhaps it is not the best one for Parliament either, but it is the result of a conciliation procedure in which a very fruitful dialogue has indeed taken place between all the institutions and with which I am very satisfied."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the operation of the internal market is only guaranteed if, in an area without internal borders, appropriate and sensible measures are put in place and consumer safety is safeguarded."
"We need uniform safety standards, not a range of different standards."
"The proposal before us is intended to create these uniform standards."
"In recent years, consumer confidence has been badly dented, firstly by various acts of fraud against consumers, and secondly by the very welcome research in this area."
"This has repeatedly revealed that some consumer goods on the market no longer complied with current safety criteria."
"It is therefore even more important and necessary that this report is before us today."
"Our thanks are due to the rapporteur, whose efforts have made this possible."
"It is very important that this general product safety directive should apply irrespective of the type of marketing undertaken, and that a decision is taken which reflects developments in the market place and therefore also includes distance marketing and electronic commerce."
"As regards the issue of consumer safety, the task is not only to protect children and older persons as the weaker groups in our societies, which is always emphasised; safety standards must apply to everyone."
"It is therefore only right and proper that we should seek to ensure that goods which no longer meet our safety standards and have to be withdrawn from sale do not end up by circuitous routes in third countries where they could pose a risk to health."
"I think that one of the most important points arising in this context is the involvement of the trade."
"Ensuring compliance with these current safety criteria cannot take place solely via the public authorities; the dealers themselves must play their part in ensuring that this relationship of trust between dealer and consumer is enhanced and improved in future."
"However, this will still require appropriate controls, and the directive is only as good as its regulation."
"Monitoring measures will therefore be very important."
"This network of regulatory bodies in the Member States is essential, and we hope that it will come into operation as quickly as possible."
"Let me add one final point, namely the speed of response by the European Parliament and the European institutions to this type of emergency and the consumer protection which had become necessary in the wake of the BSE crisis, foot and mouth disease, and other types of consumer fraud."
"We have been discussing this issue for nearly a year now, and I think we should consider how we can respond to emergencies more quickly and introduce urgently-needed measures, and perhaps also how we can improve and, above all, speed up our internal processes and inter-institutional processes in this context."
"Mr President, for those of us who have sat through the discussions in this conciliation, Mr Ebner's comments have come as a welcome and positive contribution to our deliberations."
"For those of us who have to explain back home how this Parliament influences legislation, the timetable and content of the general product safety directive could be something of a model."
"Progress here has been relatively swift; the Commission proposal submitted 15 months ago has now gone through every stage, with all of the three parts which make up the triangle of forces involved now having made their own distinctive contributions."
"Secondly, as regards Parliament, there is the rapporteur."
"Mrs González Álvarez has taken a consistent, thorough and dedicated line throughout the passage of this legislation through Parliament."
"She has known when to hold firm and when to make concessions."
"Those of us who have felt that occasionally we did not prevail when we should, owe it to her that the door is open for further and better changes after these initial steps."
"Twenty-one of our thirty amendments have been accepted by the Council."
"I am particularly grateful, in respect of the UK, for the clarified exemption for charity shops and street markets from the obligation to provide information on origin, which would have been beyond them."
"This was not a Community-wide problem, but in countries like the Irish Republic and Britain it mattered very greatly, and much good has been done by the clarification provided."
"We have the clear recognition now of the precautionary principle itself."
"There was an uncommon delay before the other institutions were prepared even to write this into the preambles, but they have done so and it is now one of the markers which will guide us as we look at how product safety legislation develops."
"We were not as successful as I would have wanted on withdrawal and recall, and we shall return to that and other matters later."
"It is important that we should be required to consider the safety of services and to examine proposals to this end in reasonably quick time."
"In this we were simply holding the Commission to a principle which it supported in theory, but must now deliver in practice by 2003."
"At the same time, we shall have to look hard at the failure to ban the export of unsafe products to the rest of the world, as the rapporteur has said, and the nature of the safety indications which imported products have to carry. One has only to look at the CE mark to see the imperfections there."
"This was one step forward, but an important one."
"I congratulate the rapporteur."
"She has certainly earned our quality mark in these debates."
"Mr President, I would like to express my support and that of my Group for the report from the Conciliation Committee."
"I also congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, who has done an excellent job."
"The report before us makes for a significant improvement on current legislation governing the safety of products."
"Of the points agreed, I particularly welcome the fact that stronger action can now be taken at Community level under the rapid alert system where there is a serious risk to consumers, so that dangerous products can be taken off the market."
"It is important that we have adequate and independent certification to comply with the relevant product safety criteria and clear labelling for consumers."
"The fact that the Commission will be reporting regularly to Parliament is significant, as is the reference to the precautionary principle and the duty of the relevant authorities in Member States to interpret this in relation to all products."
"My Group believes that all consumers, both within and outside the European Union, should be treated equally."
"As the rapporteur has stressed several times during discussions on this directive, safety should be assured for all consumers."
"I am also glad that agreement has been reached on antique and charity shops and car boot sales, as by their nature they cannot provide information about second-hand goods but do provide a very valuable service."
"Overall, we need a good balance between ensuring that products put on the market are safe and seeing to it that the measures proposed to that end can be implemented in practice."
"This report partially achieves that and the consumer organisations which have welcomed earlier drafts of this directive will welcome this one, too."
"Our top priority is to ensure that consumers are protected and that they have the right to know which products are dangerous and what is being done about them."
"This report makes significant improvements to existing legislation and hopefully will have the support of Parliament."
"Mr President, strong competition, increasing concentration and globalisation are now key features of manufacturing industry around the world."
"This creates great advantages, but also disadvantages, for the consumer."
"Although there are numerous institutions in the EU Member States which are responsible for quality assurance and consumer product regulation, product recall is unfortunately becoming far more common."
"The purpose of this report is to enforce the precautionary principle in respect of any product placed on the market, and identify suitable approaches."
"I myself am a producer of consumer goods and so I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur for her proposed solutions, for the task is to protect producers as well as consumers."
"One option is to harmonise the regulations governing the authorities responsible for product safety."
"The network of information which will be required in this context will be broad."
"It is therefore appropriate to expand the existing directive first of all and revise it after a thorough appraisal of the situation."
"The market cannot be regulated."
"This is why preventive safety and health measures are especially important."
"The report contains numerous references to the fact that in the Member States, operators' and producers' rights take precedence over the rights of consumers."
"The purpose of the report is to change this situation."
"I fully support this objective."
"Due to the wide range of products available and the resulting risks to consumer safety and health, a new legislative approach is required."
"The report makes no secret of this fact."
"It also makes it clear that an export ban must be adopted for dangerous products."
"This issue has yet to be considered in detail, and in my view, the proposed period until 2003 is not too long for this process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate the spirit in which Members have spoken in this House today, and also on previous occasions, over months and even longer, in addressing this issue. It is surely one of the issues which European and, I might say, world public opinion cares about most, as well as being one of the most important for Europe' s identity."
"There are arguments on which Europe has intervened effectively but which do not receive the general support of public opinion and the citizens."
"There are other, more specific and sector-based topics, on the other hand, which have received approval."
"This, however, is a general topic which has received the general support of the citizens."
"On reading the documentation relating to this procedure as a whole, on how it developed and how it is concluded today, I find a vagueness in many chapters and recitals, as well as in many expressions that are or will be binding on this subject."
"It is a vagueness that is quite common in acts of the European Parliament, the Commission or the Council, but which, in this case, could perhaps have been more fully corrected."
"My concern is not the delay in reaching the position that is emerging today in the report, but rather that more specific detail should be given regarding interventions, the form these take, controls and the procedures by which they are enforced, and the flexibility and dignity of the controls - in other words they should not be humiliating for the producer or the consumer."
"I think that, in this sense, we could have been more specific and, at the same time, more respectful of the rights of producers and distributors, but always, of course, in the consumer' s interest."
"For instance, I find that expressions such as 'dangerous' and 'serious risk' are insufficient; they could certainly be used in a standard or a regulation - at national or other levels - but, as these arguments are so delicate and liable to affect the daily lives of consumers and thus of society and the community, we could, perhaps, have been more explicit."
"As for the future, bearing in mind what I have said regarding controls, I think that the three-yearly report required of the Commission should be drawn up at shorter intervals, without waiting three years, so as to prevent situations from arising over the three years that need to be remedied with specific provisions."
"That is why I believe that this point may warrant further consideration."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate the Commission's endorsement of the outcome of the Conciliation Committee."
"This directive recasts an existing directive of 1992, which has now been updated, reinforced and completed."
"The overall aim of this directive is to impose a general obligation to market only safe products and to ensure both a consistent and a high level of protection of consumer health and safety throughout the EC and the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Improvements in consumer health and safety represent one of the political priorities announced by this Commission."
"The directive before you today is framed within the actions intended to achieve this objective."
"Before us lies now the important task to ensure that the new provisions have full effect in practice."
"Finally, let me again express my appreciation for your support and confidence in ensuring the rapid adoption of this important directive."
"I hope it will be seen in coming years as a keystone of our efforts to ensure the safety of the European citizens."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Poverty reduction (combating the major transmissible diseases)"
"Mr President, a family in a mud hut in rural Africa without access to clean water, electricity, hospital or community centre is simply devastated when it discovers that a member of the family is suffering from any one of the three diseases HIV/AIDS, TB or malaria."
"The patient has no access to a clinic nearby that can test, diagnose and treat him and, even if there is one, he cannot afford the treatment."
"The patient's family is in crisis, not only because of illness but also because it has to find the money for treatment that will include the cost of transport and additional nutritional requirements."
"This is the reality!"
"Therefore, my objective was to produce a report with recommendations that would support a programme of action that is possible to fund, practical to implement, and most beneficial to those who are the poor victims of such infections."
"Such a report requires wide consultation with colleagues from all political groups, the European Commission, the pharmaceutical industry, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society, so that a consensus based on facts can be achieved and appropriate action taken to target the problem, making most efficient use of limited resources."
"I had that wide consultation, and I want to thank all colleagues who were so helpful, in particular Dr Fransen and her team and Commissioner Nielson's department."
"Dr Fransen has worked in Africa herself, so she was a mine of information."
"I also want to thank all colleagues from all political parties, especially in the Committee on Development and Cooperation, related committees and, of course, the secretariats, who were extremely helpful."
"The report promotes the following: a global fund financed by G8, the EU, oil-rich nations and others to finance access to and supply of medication and treatment; a global strategy to implement a programme of action to treat and prevent communicable diseases; tiered pricing of medicines from the pharmaceutical industry to ensure wide access to treatment; support for health infrastructure to scan, diagnose, treat and monitor patients, as supply of medicines in itself is inadequate; use of incentives - both financial and legislative - to enhance research and development to produce new medicines and vaccines by both industry and the public sector; the European Commission to work closely with the governments of developing countries, UN agencies, NGOs and civil society to implement the programme."
"It promotes appropriate future legislation to give more flexibility in the implementation of TRIPS to encourage transfer of technology for local manufacture of essential medicines wherever this is viable."
"There are four paragraphs in the report which require minor changes because of errors or difficulty in implementation."
"My intention in paragraph 14 was to ensure that if we are to find the lowest prices for medicines for poor countries and for the patients in these countries, we must ensure that the developing countries do not impose import duty and taxes on imports of essential medicines."
"Developed countries - the EU and the USA - do not impose export taxes when they export medicines from their countries."
"So there is a mistake in paragraph 14."
"I want to make an oral amendment, which I hope colleagues will accept."
"It should read: ""Calls on developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on imports of essential drugs and equipment in order to make health care more affordable;""."
"This paragraph really refers to import taxes in developing countries."
"I also want to make an oral amendment to paragraph 9 to replace ""10%"" with the word ""appropriate"", because you cannot dictate to the European Commission and the Committee on Budgets what exact percentage of money should be spent - there are budget lines, which are already agreed in other committees and in other reports."
"So ""appropriate"" is the word, rather than ""10%""."
"In paragraph 20, I would like to propose an oral amendment, which I hope Members of this House will support, to delete the second part which begins ""in which a doubling of the budget ....""."
"Again, the same problem applies: you cannot in a report like this put a fixed percentage when other committees have agreed budget lines and the Commission has budget appropriations fixed by the Council of Ministers for doing the job it is doing."
"These are minor changes."
"Finally, I wish to clarify the issue of the patent life of medicines, as some colleagues have expressed concern."
"A new drug costs about USD 500 m to research, test and bring to market."
"Unless this sum is recoverable, nobody will invest in research and the development of drugs for diseases of the poor."
"No government can finance such investment so we must encourage the pharmaceutical industry to continue to finance research."
"Their patent is in any case irrelevant after seven or ten years as new drugs are developed and doctors will change a treatment regime, thereby precipitating the fall in price of that medicine still under patent."
"The real trick - and this is what I have been trying to do in this report - is to secure tiered pricing for all medication - new and old - so that the poor patients benefit whilst the industry continues to pay for research and development."
"My Amendment No 1 addresses this problem and I have inserted the word ""review"" to replace the word ""reduce"", in order to cooperate with colleagues concerned about this issue."
"So I am not throwing it out of the window, I am asking us to review it in WTO."
"If there is justification for amending it, so be it."
"I hope that this House will give me full support for this report, which I did not try to make political."
"It concerns something that we must do for the poor so that we can tell the world, especially the poor, that the European Union is concerned about their problems and will take the lead in fighting disease and poverty throughout the world."
"Mr President, five million people die each year of AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in developing countries."
"One of the reasons for this is that medicines are for the most part too expensive for the people of those countries. And medicines are often unavailable altogether."
"Of the more than 1 450 new medicines which have come onto the market in the last twenty years, only thirteen are intended for tropical diseases."
"There is a severe lack of effective medicines in developing countries."
"They are either non-existent or too expensive."
"It would appear that investment in treatment of tropical diseases is not profitable enough for pharmaceutical companies."
"A more tragic example of the failure of the market is hard to imagine."
"These sad facts give the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy cause to propose drastic measures."
"Firstly, we propose a system of differentiated pricing."
"Medications should be made available free of charge or at affordable prices."
"For this, it will be necessary to prevent re-importation, and the industry' s cooperation will be essential in this."
"Secondly, there is the matter of patents."
"Rapporteur Khanbhai mentioned the great importance of these."
"Nevertheless, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy proposes to shorten the period of patent protection for essential medicines in developing countries."
"This is important, since in 2005 and 2006, the TRIPS Agreement is to be implemented in developing countries."
"By then, there will be major problems in combating AIDS and also tuberculosis."
"If the system of differentiated pricing works, this measure will not be necessary. But should it not succeed completely, it would be an important weapon in the battle against disease in developing countries."
"A third point which is also of extreme importance to the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy is an extensive European research programme."
"This is necessary to tailor pharmaceutical research more to existing needs."
"Therefore more research into, and investment in, treatment of tropical diseases, but also investment in remedies which can be used in developing countries."
"Remedies which, for example, do not require refrigerated storage."
"Cooperation with the developing countries is essential, and a substantial increase in the budget to go along with this."
"I thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and for his willingness to listen to other committees."
"Mr President, the Commission' s initiative from last year to play a leading role in efforts to halt the spread of HIV, malaria and TB came not a day too soon - on the contrary."
"The international community should long before have taken the HIV epidemic more seriously and generally gone to much more effort, through research and preventive measures, to reduce the spread of malaria in particular."
"Lack of funds, especially in the area of research, has long been acute."
"Of course, we welcome initiatives of the type which Bill Gates carried out, but this type of preventive work cannot, and must not, depend on the efforts of single individuals."
"It must primarily be a task for public bodies."
"The resolution under discussion today constitutes Parliament' s rather late response to the Commission' s initiative of last year."
"The resolution should be seen in the context of the work we are currently carrying out with regard to the budget for next year, in which we propose, at least on a preliminary basis, considerable increases compared with the proposals of the Commission and the Council."
"We believe there is a need for more capacity within the Commission in order for it to be able to play a leading role in this area."
"There is also a need for more money for operational initiatives."
"The situation with regard to the diseases we are discussing here today is critical."
"More resources are needed, but there is also a need for new and innovative forms of partnership - especially between the public and private sectors."
"We must ensure that incentives are created for increased research."
"Partnership between the public and private sectors is vital, as too of course is partnership with non-governmental organisations."
"I hope the Commission, and especially Mr Nielson, will see this resolution, as well as our efforts in other contexts to increase budget resources, as a strong incentive and support for the Commission with a view to the latter' s playing the leading role in the fight against HIV, malaria and TB, a fight which I believe we all feel is so important."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we should indeed welcome the Khanbhai report, which is the result of some excellent work in reaching a compromise between the various political groups and the rapporteur, and I would like to thank him for his effort."
"This report reflects a twofold realisation, both of the extent of the scourge and that of the financial and human resources necessary to combat it."
"It enables us to take several steps forward in a debate that is essential for the very survival of part of the world."
"It also clarifies Parliament' s position on many crucial points such as the need to significantly increase resources assigned to improving health systems and to fighting communicable diseases in developing countries, the will to overcome the opposition between prevention and treatment, which are two essential and complementary aspects of the fight against disease, and the emergence of a new concept of public health as a global public asset."
"In addition, it clarifies and provides an interpretation of the safeguard clauses in the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property. It also confirms the fact that the issue of the price of drugs is at the heart of the debates on access to treatment and the importance of research and development and, above all, it stresses the need to focus efforts on diseases that particularly affect the South, as well as forgotten illnesses."
"The European Parliament' s position is therefore now clear and coherent, but, above all, it is just and fair."
"There is the feeling that we are finally beginning to ask the right questions and, from now on, we need to provide the right answers."
"It is now time, ladies and gentlemen, to make the move from good intentions to positive action."
"In the immediate future, there are two main areas of action in which we need to intervene."
"The first involves interpreting agreements on intellectual property in a way that is more favourable to the health of the developing world."
"Public opinion is ready for such progress to take place and the withdrawal of actions brought against South Africa and Brazil has created a very distinct psychological climate."
"Many ambiguities still remain, however."
"The fourth WTO ministerial conference in Doha should enable us to go further in officially and formally proposing guarantees on recourse to all the components of the safeguard clauses established in the TRIPS agreement, confirming in particular that in the case of compulsory licences, drugs can be produced in third countries."
"The second front on which we should expect short-term progress is the global AIDS and health fund that was launched in New York and Genoa."
"An interim working group has been implemented. It will make proposals in the next few days."
"The principle is therefore now established."
"We must insist, however, that this fund should start to operate in the coming weeks so that treatment gets to patients as soon as possible, and we must ensure that its statute and procedures are fair."
"What does this mean in specific terms?"
"It means that the fund should be operational before 15 December, the deadline, so that the Commission can make its contribution to the 2001 budget, and so that the definitive structure of these funds and the composition of its statutory bodies respect the rule of equality between representatives from Northern and Southern States and also between the NGOs from these two areas."
"It also involves, and I will end here, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, clarifications on the contribution of the European Union."
"The Union committed itself in Genoa, as stated by Mr Prodi, to allocating a budget of EUR 120 million to the global health fund."
"This amount is not currently entered under any budget item."
"The Commission must confirm to us today that this amount will not come from and will not be deducted from other funds earmarked for development and that it is indeed an annual contribution that will be entered in the budget on the specific line from 2002."
"I thank you in advance for including these particular details."
"Mr President, what happened on 11 September does not reduce the need for development aid. On the contrary."
"There is reason for calling upon all the EU countries to live up to their pledges in Gothenburg to increase their aid to the promised 0.7%."
"The EU is most certainly the world' s largest donor region, but that does not say as much about our own efforts as about the deficiencies of others."
"Even if we are not at present supposed to be criticising the United States but instead continuing to support them, it has to be said that the United States' role in this context has not been particularly distinguished, to put it mildly."
"There is both their deficient contribution to the UN and the insufficient development aid they have provided."
"The issue of their contribution to the UN has now been sorted out, so we can hope that the issue of development aid will also be sorted out."
"Prevention is, of course, better than cure, and development aid is an effort at prevention."
"It is sad that it is so easy to get expenditure on military systems authorised and that it is so difficult to get expenditure on the preventative work of development aid authorised."
"We must be clear that, in our contemporary world with its TV channels, the very poorest people also know that there are very large inequalities in the world."
"In reality, it is amazing that they do not react more strongly than they in fact do."
"There is no doubt that the refugee ship we heard about this summer is only the first small portent of what is to come."
"Following this introduction, I wish to turn to the rapporteur' s report and thank him for all the work he has put into this matter."
"Crisis conditions, to put it mildly, prevail in a long list of developing countries."
"A huge effort is therefore necessary when it comes to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria."
"Anyone who has been in any doubt as to whether this can simply be left to private companies can no longer, after the debate that has been conducted in recent years, be in any doubt that an effort is required, partly from the donor countries."
"We cannot leave this to the free market."
"It has actually been rather humiliating to discuss this matter, but that is why it is all the more gratifying that the EU has now done something in this area and, for example, totally untied the funds, which means that developing countries can buy wherever it is best and cheapest to do so."
"We must not only concentrate on medicine. We must, of course, also concentrate on restructuring."
"It is incredibly important that we should ensure that people are helped to help themselves and that we should see to it that systems are devised for which developing countries themselves can take responsibility and which they can, above all, manage, including when we are not there to support them."
"Both medicines and infrastructure are required in this matter, and I would urge us to continue to make a major effort to help developing countries to help themselves."
"Mr President, given the millions of deaths in developing countries, the European Commission' s proposal for an action programme against communicable diseases in developing countries is a strong initiative that contributes to affirming the right to health on the international stage."
"If the European Union wishes to play a distinguished role in this fight and to make its action have a real impact, public health must become a priority for its cooperation in developing countries, and therefore be actually reflected in its budget."
"This is why we are opposed on this point to the rapporteur' s oral amendments."
"This is a shame, because we have done a great deal of preparatory work with Mr Khanbhai, in order to strengthen his initial resolution, and the votes of the Committee on Development and Cooperation enabled us to achieve a broad consensus."
"At the same time, the media coverage of the actions brought by the pharmaceutical industry and the United States against South Africa and Brazil, which produce or import generic anti-AIDS drugs, lifted the veil on the economic stakes and pushed the European Union to specifically commit itself to the side of those poor populations needing access to treatment."
"Although it makes sense to tackle the fight against tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS in a single programme, we do, however, need to distinguish between the specific problems posed by these three diseases."
"In the case of tuberculosis, although there is a vaccine for the prevention of this disease, its effectiveness is highly disputed and there is an ever-increasing amount of resistance to treatment."
"There is no vaccine for malaria and although drugs to treat the disease are inexpensive, they are decreasingly effective due to increased incidences of resistance."
"There is no vaccine for AIDS nor any treatment that is accessible to the people from the South, as the pharmaceutical laboratories that own the patents keep the prices at an exorbitant level."
"Moreover, we regret that diseases such as filariasis, trypanosomiasis, sleeping sickness, the Ebola virus or various forms of diarrhoea are not the subject of the Commission' s communication as they are causing an ever-increasing number of deaths."
"Effective and coherent action against these diseases should therefore offer different solutions depending on the case, but also combine measures on several levels."
"First of all, prevention involves education and information campaigns, particularly aimed at at-risk groups, such as women and young people, conducted on the ground by influential local figures."
"For the prevention of AIDS, therefore, promoting the use of condoms is a public health duty."
"The best form of prevention remains the guarantee of good housing and working conditions, nutrition and health."
"Development policy as a whole and all Community policies should therefore contribute to the key objective of improving public health."
"In the same way, we need a more general discussion about the environment."
"For example, by increasing the amount of stagnant water surfaces, damming policy has caused the number of parasite diseases to rocket."
"Secondly, it is essential that we improve or even create health structures and train the staff required for the detection, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of these diseases."
"The European Community development aid programme, specifically within the framework of the EDF, should be focused on health services, which have been neglected for too long due to budgetary restrictions imposed by structural adjustment."
"The local health NGOs should be able to receive funds in order to carry out their day-to-day work of prevention and of supporting patients."
"They should be involved in drawing up aid programmes in this field and be incorporated into public health action."
"Thirdly, everyone should have access to treatment. This means that medication should be sold at cost price to people in developing countries."
"Another solution would be for these countries to have licences that authorise them to produce generic drugs."
"In fact, the only way to free the people of the South from the grip of the multinational firms on price fixing for drugs in the long term is to establish a regional or local pharmaceutical industry."
"The TRIP agreements should be interpreted in the same fashion, and should reaffirm the right of developing countries to use compulsory licences in the event of a health emergency."
"Pharmaceutical firms need to be made to respect human rights."
"In fact, following the media pressure over recent months, some of them are taking a greater interest and have promised to reduce their prices."
"These measures are isolated, however, limited to a few products for a few countries and will take time."
"Moreover, they are still rejecting the principle of compulsory licences."
"This rejection of compulsory licences forces us to question the duration of the protection of patents."
"We could also ask ourselves whether a reduction in the duration of patents is not, after all, an excellent stimulant for research."
"Fourthly, we need to give new impetus to research, and this is a fundamental point."
"We need to find new preventive and curative treatments that are more effective, and more importantly better adapted to local populations."
"For this purpose, an international research centre on Southern diseases, financed by public and private funds, would enable us to completely free research from the purely mercenary interests of certain manufacturers."
"Finally, and this is what I believe to be the most important point in this debate, is the fact that we know that the very people in the South who are dying from these diseases are urgently waiting for our help, and have been for a long time."
"I think that we should broadly develop all of these structures."
"All these concerns have been largely incorporated into Mr Khanbhai' s report."
"This is why we call on you to vote in favour of the report, and we hope that all of these speeches will for once not go unheeded, because the people of the South need us."
"Mr President, as Mr Khanbhai' s report indicates very clearly, five million people die each year basically from these three contagious diseases and ten thousand people die each day in Africa."
"This seems to me to be a silent genocide that is hardly mentioned in the international press."
"It seems to me that some of the proposals in the report are very good, in the sense that these deaths will not be eradicated unless basic health services are available in each one of those countries and unless, as other Members have said, there is access to the treatments, to the medicines which can put an end to these illnesses."
"At present, they are not available."
"Therefore, the proposal for a Commission plan and also the proposal that we contribute to an international fund to fight against these diseases seems right to us."
"However, I believe that we have to look into the deeper causes."
"The rapporteur rightly indicates in paragraph 13 of the resolution the fact that demanding structural changes of these countries sometimes prevents them from using sufficient public funds for the health services."
"It is an infernal vicious circle, because unless there are sufficient resources for these basic health services, for improving the people' s quality of life, for them to have access to housing, food and work, it will be difficult to eradicate these diseases."
"It is a vicious circle that causes a very large part of the population of the Third World countries to be in this situation."
"I believe, Mr President, that prevention, better quality of life for these people, access to medicines and access to a basic health service, as the report proposes, are essential elements for a solution."
"The rapporteur also points out very clearly that it is necessary to increase development aid."
"It is already more than twenty years since the United Nations proposed that 0.7% of the GDP should be allocated to development."
"Today, only a few Nordic countries in Europe attain that 0.7%."
"The majority of European countries do not reach 0.7%."
"Some, like mine, do not give 0.25%."
"It is deplorable, because this development aid is vital precisely for these populations to be able to access basic health services."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by recalling the multiplier effect that the participation of women may have in each of these programmes."
"As a member of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and Mexico, I was involved in projects financed by the European Union and I could see how the participation of native women in that zone had a multiplier effect, because women can help their daughters and their fellow women to learn."
"Therefore, the participation of women in these plans to eradicate these diseases is fundamental."
"Mr President, it is now already a year since I took part in the round-table conference on 29 September, in which everyone agreed that no time was to be wasted in obtaining practical results in the fight against transmissible diseases. Since then, however, nothing much has happened."
"The Commission has acknowledged the right of poor countries to issue compulsory licences, but what does the Commission intend to do to bring about the necessary transfer of technology so that poor countries themselves can produce medicine?"
"Why have we not yet seen initiatives to enable African technicians in African factories to produce medicines to combat tuberculosis, malaria and HIV?"
"Economically speaking, this is possible."
"We are not talking in terms of huge investments to start up local production."
"The necessary transfer of technology might, in addition, be envisaged in terms of allowing those employed in the medical sector in the EU to spend a couple of years in developing countries, working on such technology transfer programmes."
"It is crucial to improve the skills of doctors, scientists, nurses and technicians in the poorest countries."
"They must be involved in research and development, not by inviting them to European conferences - where they are likely to receive subsistence allowances - but by providing the institutions in which they work with equipment, training and communication facilities so that well-educated people living and working under incredibly difficult conditions are motivated to remain in their own countries."
"Five malaria vaccines have now been developed - an extremely important step, given the fact that malaria is the disease that kills most people."
"And what is the EU doing?"
"True, we have plans to set up a European platform to test the vaccine, even if there is already a fully developed African platform."
"Does it not make sense for the vaccine to be tested by Africans in Africa, or are Africans only good enough to act as subjects of experiments by European scientists?"
"Let us forget all about setting up this European Clinical Trials Platform and instead support the pan-African network, AMVTN, which is just about to be converted into a fund."
"It would save a huge amount of time and thus save millions of human lives, and it would save money."
"It would also show that we recognise other people' s right to take charge of their own destinies, and it would provide them with the necessary transfer of technology."
"It would be a fantastic first step on the way to taking action."
"We have heard enough fine, but empty, words."
"I should like, then, to thank Mr Khanbhai."
"Mr President, despite global growth over recent decades, progress remains inadequate and unequally distributed."
"Poverty, injustice and appalling conditions, from both a social and a health point of view, are still the bitter reality for many developing countries."
"Thirty per cent of the world' s population live in conditions of extreme poverty, a situation exacerbated by continuous population growth and the inadequacy - or, rather, the decline - of policies for development aid, assistance and cooperation."
"Europe is a relative exception, but not to the extent of correcting a worldwide downward trend."
"New challenges in the developing world, such as urbanisation, environmental degradation and pollution, local warfare and the scourge of AIDS, together with the previously unthinkable resurgence of malaria and TB, threaten to drive us back."
"In general, I am suspicious of statistics, which all differ, anyway, between the various Directorates-General of the Commission, as we have seen, and not uncommonly seem subservient to ideological prejudices."
"There is no doubt, however, that the explosive growth of the richest countries has left the poorest countries even farther behind."
"Among the indicators of poverty, that of women' s poverty stands out: the majority of poor people, the poorest of the poor, are women, just as most illiterate people are women and women continue to work more and to earn and count for less."
"It would be difficult to deny or underestimate the importance of the link that still persists between poverty, disease, illiteracy and population growth, a link which has its most obvious proof in the scale of women' s poverty, the suffering of women and gender inequalities."
"On the other hand, the reports of both the Commission and Parliament seem to me to be evasive, not to say reticent, on the subject of population."
"The reports concentrate on the fight against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, going at length into sophisticated technical analyses and proposals for reforms, which may serve to improve our measures for combating poverty - especially on the question of drugs and health services - but do not propose any measures to improve the effectiveness of policies on population control, healthy and sustainable fertility, or free and informed maternity, as if this subject had disappeared from our view."
"Yet this is still the crucial issue."
"Let us consider the facts: in purely numerical terms, never have so many people been torn by poverty as this year."
"Yet, because of the continuing population growth, today there are more poor people in the world than all those that have ever lived throughout history."
"Since the end of the last century, the world population has grown fourfold, from one and a half billion to six billion."
"The greatest growth has been in Asia: India, China, Indochina and, in particular, Indonesia."
"The population trend in the rich countries is, conversely, now stationary, but the balance achieved depends on a longer life expectancy, which makes up for the slump in the birth rate."
"Africa, in turn, has seen a population explosion, mainly due to the fall in infant mortality."
"This trend seems today to be more contained, not because population policies have been successful but because of epidemics, especially, as has been said, of AIDS, TB and malaria."
"Africa challenges us and moves us, but Africa is not the whole world and is itself diverse in its various parts."
"It certainly has more need than any other region of a population policy more concerned with the condition of women."
"Throughout the rest of the world, not only in the rich countries, population growth has slowed down somewhat over recent decades, but if you look more closely you will see both that the birth rate has fallen and that life expectancy has increased, and that means a population that is continuing to grow and which, in most situations, is ageing, as well as cases of overpopulation in certain regional and local areas."
"In conclusion, if we want to be more effective in fighting poverty, we cannot avoid or ignore the matter of population control. It is true that it is linked to economic and cultural growth, but we are not without suitable tools and appropriate experience in the field of prevention and contraception."
"History teaches us that there has never been so much growth and so much poverty."
"Experience shows that it is no use trying to dry out a flooded room without turning off the taps."
"Mr President, Mr Khanbhai has produced a balanced report, whose proposals we gladly lend our support to."
"The report draws specific attention to the triangle of poverty, health and education, no part of which can be ignored without action in the other two areas coming to nothing."
"Poverty has sometimes been compared to war: it takes prisoners and it kills."
"The only difference is that death from poverty is slow and the victim him/herself is branded as the culprit."
"I therefore also want to remind our Member States of the 0.7% target, to give some credibility to our calls for altruism in the pharmaceutical industry."
"I would particularly support the establishment of a global infectious disease fund and the introduction of compulsory licences to improve the availability of medicines."
"Both will take great initiative on the part of the EU and their successful implementation will require the goodwill of key global movers and shakers as well as institutions."
"In any action taken, however, it has to be borne in mind that, without viable basic health care, no other developments are possible."
"Good basic health in itself also prevents more dangerous infections, and it makes it easier to identify infections early on and stop them if basic health care has been provided for."
"We must not forget the importance of people' s attitudes: if there is not even any functional basic health care in place, apathy grows and then people cannot in all fairness be asked to take seriously infection risks that might develop into fatal illnesses in the years to come."
"No matter how fearful the prospects of communicable disease are, making us feel a spontaneous need to take specific action as a consequence, it should never be done at the expense of basic health care."
"It can, therefore, be said with some justification that EU aid with regard to basic health care has been totally inadequate for a long time now."
"For that reason, doubling the EU' s financial aid resources for basic health care can be considered to be the most essential matter from the point of view of all the other objectives."
"We should bear in mind the Copenhagen Social Summit pledge to attain universal and equitable access to primary health care."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by commending both the Commission communication and Mr Khanbhai's report."
"Access to medicines will be a key issue at Doha in a few weeks' time simply because developing countries feel hugely disadvantaged by rules which are applied universally, even though countries are of unequal strength, both economically and institutionally."
"They will be calling clearly for the TRIPS Agreement to be applied fairly."
"The global spotlight, therefore, will be firmly on the role played by pharmaceutical companies in the HIV/AIDS catastrophe."
"Only 0.1% of the 25 million people living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa have access to lifesaving drugs or indeed for the drugs for the opportunistic infections such as meningitis, drug-resistant diarrhoea, oral thrush and those other infections."
"There are now alternatives - cheap copies of life-saving medicines."
"In Brazil, Thailand and India their laws allow them to ignore drug patents."
"In India for instance, companies are marketing a drug for the treatment of that drug-resistant diarrhoea, at 1.8% of the price charged in Pakistan where only the patented version can be bought."
"Four years ago Brazil waived the patent rights on HIV drugs and allowed local companies to produce cheap versions."
"Prices in Brazil have fallen by 80% and they have halved the number of deaths from HIV/AIDS."
"I come to the point made by Mr Khanbhai on research and development."
"If so much commitment is made by the pharmaceutical companies to R&D, how come they actually spend twice as much on marketing as they do on research and development?"
"According to the UNDP's recent figures less than 10% of global spending on health research addresses 90% of the global disease burden."
"Of the 1223 new drugs marketed between 1975 and 1996, only 13 of those drugs were developed to treat tropical diseases and only 4 of those 13 were the result of the pharmaceutical industry's research."
"And why is it that they charge more for the same drugs in Africa, than they charge in the northern hemisphere?"
"I would argue that these facts very clearly speak for themselves."
"They have - and this is a very important point to make and it will be made in Doha - a virtual monopoly which means that they can control prices."
"They are virtually saying ""no"" to cheap, affordable generics for very sick people in poor countries."
"Globalisation is meant to be about freer markets and about increased competition."
"The big four pharmaceutical companies act like a cartel: they bully developing countries and they deny them their rights to those drugs."
"During the Uruguay Round they secured agreement on patent rights for 20 years."
"The TRIPS Agreement was a clear example of the powerful vested interests of the developed world at this time."
"All this threatens the whole credibility of the World Trade Organisation and any chance we have of believing in the developments at Doha, or if we ever have a new round of fair, multilateral trading systems."
"There is now a clear need for a clear and new interpretation of TRIPS allowing for the flexibility which clearly exists in that agreement."
"We need to ensure that it is the interests of poor countries that are put first."
"This is an issue of fundamental social justice."
"Mr President, it is unacceptable that millions of people continue to die unnecessarily from AIDS, malaria and TB."
"We have here a global problem of the highest order."
"Our own citizens who are HIV positive are able to access long-term treatment with effective medication."
"For patients in developing countries, the medicines are too expensive and the medical infrastructure to provide care for them is lacking."
"Also, if a patient is not disciplined in taking his medicines regularly and in the correct dosage, they lose their effect."
"The pharmaceutical industry only lowered its prices under the heavy pressure of global public opinion, and those prices are still far too high."
"A further lowering of prices must be realised through industrial and government cooperation."
"Only a very broadly established, very expensive and dogged international campaign can effectively tackle this large-scale problem."
"Mr Khanbhai' s excellent report provides a clear overview of all the important aspects of the transmittable disease."
"We join him in welcoming the European Union' s campaign programme."
"It is well thought out and deserves to be carried out with the greatest urgency."
"May I ask the Commissioner whether he has sufficient personnel resources available for this?"
"I advocate a very substantial provision in the budget over the coming years for the AIDS fund, without detriment to present provision for poverty relief."
"Does the Commissioner consider this feasible and can he also tell us the situation regarding the setting up of the fund?"
"It is also a requirement that the twenty-year patent protection term specified in the TRIPS Agreement be considerably reduced for essential medicines."
"The pharmaceutical industry must, of course, be able to continue investing in research into vaccines and cheap medicines, but must gain its profits in the rich countries and not in the epidemic-ridden Third World."
"Results will not be achieved without large-scale information campaigns."
"Sexual behaviour and attitudes towards women, in particular, will have to change dramatically."
"Women' s right of self-determination is fundamentally at issue here."
"A great responsibility also rests with the developing countries themselves, not only with the governments and the NGOs, but especially with the religious leaders who can wield moral authority."
"If they refuse to cooperate, they will be partly responsible for the misery."
"Only a collective effort can end the situation whereby millions of our fellow humans die, countless children are orphaned and economies are ruined needlessly."
"Members of the Lutte Ouvrière party will vote in favour of this report, despite its shortcomings, due to the realistic account it gives of the catastrophic situation in poor countries and the few limited, yet positive, measures that it proposes."
"It is appalling when we take account of the fact that three communicable diseases are killing five million people per year in poor countries and ten thousand people per day in Africa alone and that, moreover, the number of victims is increasing."
"This is very true in the case of AIDS, where there is no known cure, whereas there are cures available for tuberculosis and malaria."
"Despite this, malaria, which a few years ago appeared to be on course for total eradication has, as the report highlights, become the main cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, whilst tuberculosis, for which there are simple and effective treatments, continues to be the disease most widespread throughout the world."
"The cause of this situation is simple."
"Drug manufacturing is monopolised by large pharmaceutical corporations, whose prime concern is not public health, but profit."
"The recent ignominious action brought by certain pharmaceutical corporations against South Africa is characteristic of this intolerable situation, even though public opinion did, to a certain extent, cause these corporations to back off."
"The report' s proposal that aims for the European Union to recognise on the international level the right of developing countries to produce and sell generic drugs within their countries, without costs resulting from intellectual property rights, is the least we can do."
"Another example of this would be to impose specifications on the pharmaceutical corporations obliging them to produce drugs for these diseases, which the report says are neglected by the industry because they are not profitable enough."
"The report limits itself to mentioning a reduction in prices."
"Millions of people in poor countries will only be able to have access to minimum treatment if certain drugs, particularly malaria drugs, are free of charge."
"The report tries to reconcile the protection of patents with access to healthcare in developing countries; we reaffirm that industrial patents, and more specifically those patents involving the pharmaceutical industry, should be completely abolished."
"They do nothing to protect the intellectual property of the inventor, they only serve to guarantee the corporations a monopoly position and therefore the enormous profits that they earn to the detriment of public health and life itself."
"The heading of the report says that the fight against infectious diseases contributes to poverty reduction."
"In fact, most of these diseases are diseases related to poverty, even to malnutrition."
"Only an improvement in people' s standard of living would be effective in eradicating most of them."
"Having said this, however, for the benefit of the advocates of the market economy and capitalism, the simple fact that it is organically incapable of providing the most basic treatment and daily food for a considerable proportion of humanity in the twenty-first century, even though it has scientific and material possibilities like never before, irreparably condemns it."
"President, in many European countries, at any rate in the Netherlands, there have been drastic changes in healthcare in recent years."
"More differentiation, more individual care, increased personal choice and especially improved efficiency have been the most important aims."
"Often these changes give rise to criticism, especially where the general availability of healthcare is concerned."
"To many of us, it is unacceptable on principle that a higher place on the waiting list should be for sale."
"This would mean that a person' s health would be governed by his income. And we do not want that."
"It is all the more remarkable that the above situation is simply the harsh reality throughout the world."
"Indeed, the Commission proposals under discussion today demonstrate that the availability of adequate medicines to the poorest, despite repeated promises, still leaves much to be desired."
"There is much less indignation in the West concerning this. In a world of increasing globalisation, however, we cannot shirk our international responsibility."
"Our own healthcare problems are dwarfed by those of the majority of the world' s population."
"I therefore support the measures proposed."
"We will have to operate on two levels to combat these diseases."
"In the first place, by participating on a micro level in healthcare improvement projects."
"As far as I am concerned, these projects could be funded and executed via bilateral channels."
"The European Union could play an important role with larger infra-structural projects which involve NGOs from several Member States."
"In the second place, by creating on a macro level the necessary conditions to facilitate those projects on a micro level."
"Policy direction is an important instrument here."
"I particularly welcome, therefore, the paragraphs on the TRIPS and the WTO in the European Parliament' s resolution."
"Especially since they provide the European Union with an important task."
"I only need to see a concrete reference to the forthcoming meetings in Qatar."
"I hope that the Commissioner responsible will nevertheless carry out our recommendations at that conference."
"Mr President, in the North people think it is all over where AIDS is concerned."
"It is not, of course, but changing lifestyles and the arrival of effective drug regimes have, at least, helped us turn a corner on the long road that we walk."
"The forecasts when I was health minister fighting these issues were not the same as the forecasts now."
"But in the South the picture is very different."
"Ninety-five per cent of the five million new cases every year are in low-income countries in the South."
"There are 25 million people living with AIDS in Africa and 6 million in the new-growth area in Asia - South and Southeast Asia in particular."
"Where AIDS is concerned we face a vicious cycle of infection, incapacity and poverty alongside the 16 million deaths we have already seen: two million deaths a year in Africa, a quarter of all Africa's deaths."
"Ten per cent of people between fifteen and fifty years of age are living with AIDS, and there are 10 million orphans."
"The people who expected to be looked after in their old age are now unable to have that care and support because their children are dead."
"That is the scene confronting us."
"When The Economist went to Zambia and looked at a particular hospital, it saw two-thirds of the patients there dying of AIDS."
"People's limbs, they reported, looked like broken broomsticks."
"When they were asked what they were desperate for, they did not say retroviral drugs, they said food, because they were too poor to be able to afford either."
"Poverty hastens death, and deaths accelerate the survivors' descent into poverty."
"In Zambia the department of health then estimated that half the population would die of AIDS."
"That is a human disaster."
"We are facing human disasters in America now."
"The world is looking at the headlines, the world is taking action, governments are coming together, people are demanding and subscribing to solutions."
"But they are not doing that where AIDS, TB and malaria are concerned."
"It is not terrorism, but it is a health terror and horror that is preventable."
"That is why the honourable Member's report is so important and fundamental."
"I congratulate him and the Commission on the work that has been done on this matter and everyone who has participated."
"Poverty reduction goes hand in hand with the war against disease, disability and death."
"We desperately need more resources for drugs and vaccines, but must also ensure their adequate distribution to people, so that drugs do not sit in storage deteriorating."
"We must have adequate education, monitoring and research."
"It has rightly been said that research should be conducted in Africa, by Africans, for Africans and, where appropriate, with the support, cooperation and partnership of the Western world, along the lines of the IAVI initiative between Oxford and Nairobi."
"TB too, of course, is a killer."
"It accounts for two million deaths a year, 95% of them in developing countries; it is the leading cause of HIV deaths; one infected person can pass it on to ten others."
"Malaria is the third killer; 90% of deaths from Malaria occur in Africa - one death every 30 seconds."
"In the past four minutes, eight people have died from malaria."
"I want us and the Commissioner to keep those people who are dying of these diseases in mind and see what we can do."
"The honourable Member has provided the words in this report; now it is time for the Commission to act."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the common feature of all the statements made in this debate so far is the belief that investment in healthcare is extremely worthwhile and is an important way of achieving sustainable development and combating poverty, which are two objectives of European development policy."
"It is a proven fact that countries with a high standard of health and generous investment in this area achieve higher levels of development, including economic development."
"Some of us have already observed that we must persuade the governments in these countries to spend more on this area of healthcare and education, and I naturally underline this political demand as well."
"Yet it would be cynical in the extreme if we failed to point out that the structural adjustment programmes which must be undertaken by these countries to secure loans and funding from the international financial institutions now require them to spend less on prevention, public health and education."
"One point which is very important, in my view, is the involvement of women in devising birth control programmes and other reproductive health campaigns."
"Women - and I am not saying anything new - are extremely vulnerable to poverty."
"Furthermore, as the HIV/AIDS infection rates in southern Africa show, women are also affected by this disease to a far greater extent than men."
"Finally, I should like to say a few words about one of the most pressing issues addressed in the Khanbhai report, namely the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)."
"I believe that in future, too, the European Union must assist the developing countries to benefit from the opportunities already afforded by the TRIPS agreement."
"Naturally, this is set forth in the provisions of the TRIPS agreement, but has not always been accepted by the pharmaceutical industry, as the case of South Africa shows."
"In my view, the proposal outlined in paragraph 41 of the Khanbhai report on reducing the period of patent protection is essential."
"I believe that when we talk about poverty, we must also identify tangible measures for the reform of the WTO."
"Otherwise, we will also lose credibility."
"As many of the previous speakers have pointed out, it is high time we took practical steps in this direction."
"Mr President, in 1979, Willy Brandt presented his famous ""North-South Report, a programme for survival"", in which he warned of the risk that in the year 2000 a large part of the population would continue to live in poverty."
"Shortly after that pronouncement some frightening statistics were published; every 24 hours, 35 000 human beings died of hunger in the world."
"In two years, hunger caused more deaths than the two world wars put together."
"The year 2000 arrived and the situation has only got worse."
"According to the World Health Organisation, extreme poverty - misery - is the chief cause of suffering in the world and is also the one which each year claims the greatest number of human lives and yet we are still talking about poverty and how we are going to remedy it."
"A few months ago, before the summer, at our Brussels headquarters, the United Nations together with the EU organised the Third Conference on the Least-developed Countries dedicated in particular to analysing the causes, consequences and solutions of poverty."
"We also set an ambitious target: to reduce poverty by half by the year 2005."
"Some studies lead to the conclusion, Mr President, that by what we are doing, with the plans and projects we intend to carry out and above all, with the resources we allocate and those which are intended to be allocated, that objective cannot be met."
"Our concern now is to combat the international terrorism fostered by some notorious fanatics."
"True, that is the problem of the moment but, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the root of the problem."
"The problem is poverty throughout a large part of the world."
"Until we solve the problem of poverty, especially the extreme poverty - misery - in which hundreds of millions, around 1 500 million human beings, and I am using cautious figures, live, we will continue to be exposed to situations such as those we are experiencing now."
"Between 13 and 19 September some of us were visiting some of the poorest regions of the planet, in the south of the African continent."
"Mozambique today has 19 million inhabitants but within 9 years only 13 million will still be alive; the remaining 6 will have died of Aids."
"Today Mr Khanbhai in his report proposes a series of measures to combat Aids, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of reducing poverty."
"During a visit to a field hospital way out in the middle of the African savannah, my colleagues and I witnessed how victims of a cholera epidemic are dying - believe me, right now - in a Dante-esque spectacle such as occurred in Europe in the Middle Ages."
"This is also happening at other hospitals which are not in the middle of nowhere."
"In Mocuba, there is a provincial hospital where women give birth next to patients with Aids, tuberculosis, leprosy, meningitis, and infectious diarrhoeas of all kinds."
"For all these diseases which today can be cured and eradicated, there are drugs."
"It is a problem of resources, and above all, it is a problem of political will."
"Mr Khanbhai, I congratulate you and thank you for the important contribution you have made in your report."
"But, Mr Bashir, you know your native Africa better than I do."
"Let us make no mistake, the problems of poverty in the world are today of such magnitude that these measures, with the present resources, are like a drop in the ocean."
"Some day we will realise this."
"Either we fight against poverty with all our energy and all our resources until we conquer it, or poverty with its many faces - now taking the form of terrorism - will conquer us."
"Mr President, others have established the need for action."
"I should just like to add one fact: in the UK and Europe drugs cocktails have decreased AIDS deaths by 75%, in sub-Saharan Africa, where two-thirds of all people infected with HIV live, only one person in a thousand receives drug treatment."
"Education is crucial to prevent people being infected with HIV in the first place, but access to drugs really does make a difference."
"The drug companies are our partners."
"But it is crucial that they act with integrity."
"I will never forget the representative for SmithKline Beecham sitting in our EU/ACP Joint Assembly in Brussels, banging the table and saying that they had lowered the prices of essential medicines."
"And then later in the year Mr Nielson was told they were going to lower them all over again."
"Which is the lowest price - the one they told us in the spring, or the one they told us in the autumn?"
"I went to Gabon and South Africa and met doctors who are desperate to use those drugs, who have read the Internet press releases saying that the prices have been brought down; yet when they ring up they cannot actually acquire the drugs to treat those patients."
"I have asked SmithKline Beecham what is the genuine, long-term cost of production of these drugs."
"They will not say."
"I have asked them how long they will commit themselves to these lower prices."
"They will not commit themselves."
"I have asked them why, if they are seeking a partnership with developing country governments, they face legal action, not just in South Africa but in India, Brazil and elsewhere."
"They just will not answer."
"We send a clear message to the drugs companies in this resolution: prices are too high and legislative action, including compulsory licensing in cases of national emergency, is needed to deal with it."
"Finally, to Mr Khanbhai, it is no good claiming that you are seeking consensus, including NGOs for example, and then putting forward your Amendment No 1, opposing a reduction in patent protection."
"Name one NGO which supports that position."
"I will always remember that SmithKline Beecham's key anti-retroviral drug was not brought onto the market because of privately-funded research."
"It was publicly-funded research."
"They used a dormant patent to acquire that protection for their own commercial gain."
"Let us have some clear speaking in this debate."
"(Applause from the left)"
"Mr President, 7000 people died in the wake of terrorist atrocities in New York and Washington and the global response was one of shock and horror, followed by a flurry of diplomatic activity and detailed planning for an adequate response."
"In Africa, 10 000 people die every day from AIDS, malaria or tuberculosis."
"Why is there not a similar response?"
"Regrettably, the harsh truth is that the developed world does not place the same value on human life in Africa."
"It is a terrible indictment on all of us who live in the world's richest countries that this scale of human tragedy continues to occur into the 21st century."
"Several years ago malaria seemed close to being eliminated, today it is the most common cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa."
"Tuberculosis is the most prevalent disease in the world, and 35 million people are infected with AIDS, with half of all new HIV infections occurring in the 15-24 year-old age group."
"I acknowledge that the EU Commission contributed EUR 4.2 billion for health assistance during the 1990s."
"However, as the rapporteur pointed out, although EUR 700 million were allocated for health in 1998, the amount for 1996-1998 was only 4% of the total EU development budget."
"This indicates how low down it has been on the list of our political priorities."
"I hope this will now change with the publication of the new policy framework by the Commission and its proposed programme of action for the years 2001-2006."
"Its three-prong strategy of better deployment of existing resources, increasing the affordability to people in poorer countries of key drugs, and support for more research is indeed welcome."
"However, the proposals need to be developed further and underpinned by a greater financial commitment, indicative of a greater political priority."
"The best means of achieving this is by taking on board the excellent proposals put forward by the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai."
"His call for the EU to devote 10% of our development aid to tackling this problem, his emphasis on preventative action with the 15-24 year-old age group in relation to AIDS, and his proposal for a global fund for infectious diseases and the establishment of an EU research agency should be the cornerstone of any new EU policy in this area."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, HIV and AIDS are not only a health policy problem, but a general social problem. This has been made quite clear during today's debate."
"A holistic strategy is therefore required to combat them."
"Tackling poverty is one approach, but I would like to focus on other priorities which I believe are equally important: information and education, prevention, and of course treatment."
"These are the three areas which must be considered if we want to make progress, particularly in Africa, where the problem is most acute."
"This means providing information and sex education for children and young people, for without a change in sexual behaviour, the problem cannot be mastered."
"A proportion of the available resources must therefore be allocated for this purpose too."
"The sexually active population must have the opportunity to practise prevention."
"I should particularly like to mention Senegal as a positive example, where religious and political leaders have worked together to halt the spread of AIDS through prevention."
"A similar approach has also been adopted in Uganda."
"If politicians and a country's spiritual leaders work together on this issue, a great deal can be achieved."
"The Côte d'Ivoire, for example, has therefore appointed a Minister for AIDS and HIV."
"I believe that these are models which deserve our support."
"There is another important problem, which is how to prevent the sick from being ostracized."
"This is a major problem."
"We must dismantle social taboos and not only ensure that those who are living with infection receive the medication they need, but also encourage their positive integration into society."
"This is the only way to create a climate which ultimately halts the spread of disease in a holistic way."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to express my appreciation for the work of the rapporteur, Mr Khanbhai."
"In the eight months since the Commission adopted an ambitious programme for action targeting the major communicable diseases, a number of events have reconfirmed the need for action, for the global mobilisation of efforts and financing, and for the political will to achieve our aims."
"Health is fully on our agenda now, and the same is true of our own Member States."
"Health in developing countries is, together with education, one of the six priorities for the Commission for 2002."
"Investing in health is a key strategy for economic development and poverty reduction, and hence a crucial component of a sound development strategy."
"I wish to highlight and express my strong agreement with the remarks made by Mrs Korhola and Mr Bowis on the need to organise basic health care in a manner that actually works."
"In this regard we should bear in mind that annual per capita spending on public health services in sub-Saharan Africa is between USD 2 and USD 6."
"This is the economic framework before us."
"Reconciling the low capacity of health systems with, in particular, care and work on administering anti-retroviral drugs to AIDS and HIV-positive patients is an extremely difficult task."
"I should like to mention one case that illustrates this."
"In Botswana USD 100 million has been mobilised jointly by Merck, one of the big pharmaceutical companies, and the Bill Gates Foundation."
"They are doing everything they can to organise their work on the ground and use these advanced types of medicine in ongoing treatment."
"Their experience is that very little has been possible."
"The absence of infrastructure in this area, of educated nurses and of the conditions required for these types of advanced medicine, which are very difficult to administer, to work, shows that even concentrated, well-funded efforts spanning one-and-a-half years in a place that is better organised than most others in Africa has not done the trick."
"This is also why the pharmaceutical companies are warning against highlighting too uncritically the use of anti-retroviral drugs as the solution."
"That warning has to be taken seriously."
"Our programme for action has been moving forward."
"We are speeding up the actual disbursement rate in the field of health."
"I would not go as far as to express satisfaction at this, but the situation is improving."
"We are disbanding dormant projects and improving projects that need to be improved."
"All this work is taking place."
"Now a few remarks on financial allocations."
"Firstly, I appreciate the remarks made today by Mr Khanbhai concerning the mechanics of how we allocate this money."
"We would like to get away from input-related targets."
"They are advantageous in being easier to communicate regularly; however, we are seeking to focus on output and processes rather than on input."
"An important aspect of this debate is the fact that the budget does not reveal directly how much we are actually doing in areas such as health and education."
"It must be borne in mind that macroeconomic support, our budget support, is in fact linked to health and education."
"That link provides the answer as to how much - or how little - we are doing."
"At present it is extremely difficult to quantify this specifically but we are working on this."
"Mr Khanbhai also referred to a change relating to the import of drugs and the need to abolish tariffs in this regard."
"This is definitely something that must be done."
"It should be borne in mind that liberalisation on a regional basis, which we are urging our partners to move forward on, is also an answer to this problem."
"Furthermore it can solve the problem of creating a better basis for starting up medicine production in developing countries."
"If you cannot access a neighbouring market from a given African country investing there in order to do something in this area is not a good idea."
"The question of access to medicines, an issue brought up by many, is currently being discussed at the TRIPS Council in Geneva."
"The discussions have sought to strike a balance between the need to pursue access to affordable medicines and the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement."
"A declaration for the ministerial meeting in Doha is now being prepared."
"May I state most clearly that the EC has no intention of applying pressure on or criticising developing countries that invoke their rights under the TRIPS Agreement."
"It is in the interest of all WTO members that the TRIPS provisions be clear, so as to provide for lawful and correct implementation of the agreement."
"As to paragraph 41 on Mr Khanbhai's report, the current review process within the TRIPS Council of certain provisions does not include the patent periods, nor the so-called ""ever-greening"" of patents mentioned in the report."
"It is not the opinion of the Commission that the patent period needs to be amended."
"On the second issue, ""ever-greening"", there are no provisions in the TRIPS Agreement that could be applied here."
"The substance and level of invention for the granting of a patent is evaluated by national patent authorities."
"Allow me to make a few remarks on the other paragraphs."
"Ninety-five percent of drugs listed as essential drugs by WHO are off patents and may be produced freely."
"The remaining 5% are drugs patented in most countries."
"It is the Commission's view that compulsory licenses should be issued in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement."
"Tiered pricing, in the sense that pharmaceutical companies voluntarily offer their products at heavily discounted prices to developing poor markets, is something the Commission strongly supports."
"It was one of the sticking points in the discussion of the guidelines for the health fund."
"We are working towards a global system of tiered pricing that will supply markets on a sustainable basis."
"Supplying poor markets at the lowest possible prices should be the rule."
"This should comprise all essential and key medicines."
"Of course, if large quantities of tiered price products are exported to developing countries, the risk of trade diversion becomes high."
"Therefore we are considering stronger measures to prevent the re-importation of tiered-price products into the Community."
"In paragraph 38 the report calls for the establishment of a fund for infectious diseases."
"You will all be aware that this Global AIDS and Health Fund was launched by the UN Secretary-General at the special session on HIV/Aids in June."
"On behalf of the Commission President Prodi pledged EUR 120 million to the fund."
"Total contributions have now reached USD 1.8 billion."
"We are actively involved in working out the operational modalities for the fund, its governance, legal basis and its focus."
"I agree with what a few of the speakers said concerning the situation of women."
"The whole agenda concerning reproductive and sexual health and rights needs to be kept in mind whenever we discuss these issues."
"Mrs Sandbæk mentioned the issue of testing."
"I want to clarify that we are working on testing in Africa ..."
"(The President called for order to allow the speaker to be heard )"
"I feel confident that those Members who really want to hear what I have to say are definitely trying to do so."
"I thank them from the bottom of my heart."
"Concerning the activity of the Commission in the area of research, the reality is that we are proving quite successful in the attempt to organise a big Africa-focused network and to carry out testing as part of the whole research and development process."
"This is progressing quite well."
"The subject of the Global AIDS and Health Fund was touched upon by many speakers."
"I want to give some additional information here."
"We are involved in discussions on the modalities of the fund and there are still a few differences that need to be resolved."
"They concern the balance between prevention and care, especially in relation to HIV/AIDS."
"They concern the question to what extent the fund should supply anti-retrovirals, whether the fund should also cover research activities, the structure of tendering in the fund, and its focus in terms of geography."
"Many issues are therefore, being discussed now."
"As a background to this discussion we also note that there is a section within the NGO community that sees the fund as a distraction from longer-term development processes, in particular support for strengthening the health systems."
"In my view, these words of warning have to be taken seriously."
"There are still many questions to resolve before it becomes clear what real added value the fund will create, especially in the most important area of improving delivery on the ground, which is still the biggest challenge."
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr Khanbai."
"We look forward to working - as we have done until now - hand-in-hand with Parliament and keeping up the pressure to move this agenda forward."
"Mr President, on a point of order, when the Commissioner quotes the WHO Essential Medicines' List he knows that includes not just essential medicines, but the affordability of those medicines."
"Therefore, the very medicines we are discussing are excluded from the list in question."
"Mr Howitt, you can communicate it in writing, thank you."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at noon."
"Madam President, I believe you have been told about the discussion which took place in the House this morning at the opening of the sitting."
"It is not my intention to reopen the discussion, because I am sure that Vice-President Imbeni will have mentioned the matter to you."
"We are looking forward to your answer, after voting time, if you prefer, because I imagine all the Members wish to vote."
"Mrs Napoletano, I was indeed told about your speech at the beginning of the plenary sitting this morning."
"However, you referred to a letter that Mr Tajani had sent to me."
"I have not yet been able to read the translation of his letter, which I received towards the end of the morning, as the letter had to be translated and that was difficult to do overnight."
"Of course, I will only be able to take a position when I have had the opportunity to read the letter that Mr Tajani sent to me."
"I therefore give him the same answer: I am sorry."
"It deals with a very delicate problem, that of the possible limitations on the freedom of expression of heads of State, Commissioners and Members of Parliament, which is a very serious problem."
"Be assured that I am going to give it all the attention that the problem deserves."
"VOTE"
"(Parliament adopted the draft protocol)"
"Draft regulation on specific restrictive measures against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism (COM(2001) 569 - C5-0455/2001 - 2001/0228(CNS)) (Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs)"
"Before the vote on the draft regulation"
"Wurtz (GUE/NGL)."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to know if it is possible for each group to very briefly explain how it voted on this draft regulation."
"I am sure you will understand."
"This is an agreement that has been reached between all the groups."
"Madam President, I would simply like to say that, of course, it goes without saying that my group is, completely and unequivocally, firmly opposed to terrorism and, therefore, in agreement with the principle of the Commission' s proposal of depriving these terrorist organisations of their funds."
"However, my group finds the method imposed on us unacceptable, in other words, having to decide urgently on a list that was sent to us by the United States without explanation..."
"... and which could be changed outside our control."
"This is why we cannot, unfortunately, approve this draft regulation as it is today."
"(Applause)"
"(Parliament approved the Commission proposal)"
"Report (A5-0313/2001) by Mr González Álvarez, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council Directive on general product safety (C5-0298/2001 - 2000/0073(COD))"
"(Parliament adopted the joint text)"
"Motion for a resolution (B5-0665/2001), tabled by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI group, on the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Brussels"

"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Joint motion for a resolution on the Stability and Growth Pact and the outcome of the informal meeting of the ""Economic and Financial Affairs"" Council held in Liège on 22 and 23 September 2001"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Report (A5-0286/2001) by Mrs Hieronymi, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, on the third report of the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee on the application of Directive 89/552/EEC ""Television without frontiers"" (COM(2001)9 - C5-0190/2001 - 2001/2086(COS))"
"Before the start of the vote."
"Madam President, I would like to declare an interest in the subject of this report."
"Before the vote on recital H"
"Madam President, I request that the rapporteur and all the Members accept the following oral amendment with a view to replacing the original text of recital H with the following:"
"Whereas an urgent review of the ""Television without frontiers"" Directive is necessary."
"It is more precise, more accurate and has the same meaning."
"I request your acceptance."
"Are there any objections to the inclusion of the oral amendment tabled by Mr Aparicio?"
"President, as a rights holder I have a financial interest in television."
"I will not partake in the vote today."
"Are there any other colleagues who wish to say this?"
"If so, I invite them to do so now."
"Madam President, there is a mistake in the Spanish text, paragraph 6, with reference to the word 'parents', which should come before primary and secondary schoolteachers."
"I hope that translation will be corrected in the Spanish text."
"Although there is widespread support for some other oral amendments which I was going to make, I understand there is opposition from the Greens so the only oral amendment that I wish to make now concerns paragraph 14."
"There is a genuine error and it should be amended to read, 'Calls on all developing countries to abolish tariffs and taxes on import of essential drugs and equipment in order to make healthcare more affordable.'"
"There is no tax when we export medicines from Europe or the United States, so the current paragraph is factually incorrect."
"I hope Members will support this."
"(Parliament indicated its agreement with the tabling of the oral amendment)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I was somewhat surprised that, prior to voting on the Council' s Regulation on the combating of international terrorism and the freezing of funds of terrorist organisations, we did not allow all the parties one minute' s speaking time to outline their standpoint."
"Indeed, it was agreed earlier with all the political parties that we would discuss this prior to voting in view of the urgency with which the material was presented and since we had no time for a debate."
"It is a very important matter."
"I therefore regret that we did not get that opportunity."
"For the rest, I will submit the substance of our contribution in writing. But what concerns us is that we think it very important, where this proposal is concerned, that a judicial review should take place."
"We are delighted with this proposal from the Committee. We are pleased that it is based on Article 308 of the Treaty."
"This means that there is a role for the Court of Justice and this means that there is a role for the European Parliament."
"We are very disappointed in the Council' s rejection yesterday of this legal basis."
"The Council has not understood the urgency of this proposal and has also failed to understand the need to base it on Article 308."
"By wishing to base it on various articles of the Third Pillar, the Council of course wants to exclude both the Court of Justice and the European Parliament."
"It is a serious matter that should most certainly have been discussed in Parliament."
"Mrs Buitenweg, I would like to answer you with regard to the way votes are conducted in this House."
"I did of course scrupulously apply the Rules of Procedure."
"I have to say that I was expecting every group to ask me for this minute of speaking time."
"It was not my job to grant it by virtue of an agreement made in the corridors."
"In fact, what should have happened and what I was expecting was for a number of Members, 32 to be precise, in order to comply with the Rules of Procedure, to request a debate, which in any case was not possible because we had voted on the topical and urgent debate and at that point the groups asked me for a minute each."
"Mr Wurtz was the only one to make this request."
"I was the most surprised of all, Mrs Buitenweg."
"EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE"
"To those colleagues who are asking for the floor for an oral explanation of vote on the procedures without report, I remind you that oral explanations of vote cannot be made for procedures without report."
"I am sorry, that is the rule."
"Does that come from the Rules of Procedure, Madam President?"
"Yes, it is in Rule 137:"
"""When a Commission proposal or report is on the agenda of Parliament pursuant to Rules 62, paragraph 5, or 114, Members may submit written explanations of vote pursuant to Rule 1."""
"International terrorism (C5-0455/2001)"
"President, I have supported the request for specific measures against terrorism in particular because the right of judicial challenge to the European Court of Justice is enshrined in the legal base."
"This has been clarified by the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Green Group in order to protect human rights."
"Civil liberties, the infringement of which some are fearful of, should be protected as all procedures are subject to challenge at the European Court of Justice."
"We cannot be neutral against terror."
"Europe should support the US in finding and suppressing the terrorists but we should also have a long-term plan to deal with conflict resolution and to put in infrastructural support in places like Afghanistan where humanitarian aid is needed but is only a stopgap to a fully functioning society."
"For years the European Parliament has called for the support of the civilian population in Afghanistan which has been the subject of terrorism from the Taliban."
"Women in particular have suffered."
"There have been increasing numbers of attacks on women throughout the region and in Kashmir by Islamic extremists who have thrown acid in their faces injuring them horribly in order to make them wear the burka, a full face covering."
"While reaffirming our complete opposition both to terrorist methods and to the reactionary objectives pursued by those responsible for these acts, we refuse to associate ourselves will all of the proposals from the Council of the European Union."
"The political leaders of the big imperial powers, both American and European, are trying to channel the legitimate emotions caused by the attacks in New York to serve a policy aimed solely at ensuring their domination over the world, and not at preserving the interests and the safety of the people."
"We reject any initiative, even a partial one, aimed towards military operations, which would inevitably make victims of the people, who have nothing to do with terrorism."
"Individual terrorism does not justify State terrorism or make it acceptable."
"We protest against the measures restricting individual freedoms that this climate of war is bringing about."
"As for the fight against the funding of terrorist groups, if the governments really want to conduct it they should immediately abolish banking secrecy and business secrecy."
"The prevarications and measures in this area which are as limited as they are ineffective only prove that we prefer to put up with terrorist money and money from organised crime than to ensure total transparency, which could unveil multiple trafficking and ignominies in the capitalist system itself and the considerable wastage that it costs society."
"We wish to once again affirm our complete and unequivocal condemnation of the terrorist acts witnessed in the United States of America, and the need to provide a response based on joint action and international cooperation within the UN that fully respects its Charter."
"We must, however, state our strong disagreement with the method that the Commission has sought to impose in presenting its ""draft regulation on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating international terrorism"" ."
"As part of the fight against terrorism, we feel it is necessary to adopt measures for combating organised crime, which specifically involve attacking money-laundering and the various forms of trafficking and abolishing tax havens."
"We feel it is unacceptable, however, that a list of organisations and individuals, possibly supplied by the government and intelligence services of the United States - a country which not so long ago opposed any monitoring of tax havens - should be submitted for the approval of the European Parliament, when no supporting evidence has been provided."
"Furthermore, it is our view that the necessary fight against terrorism must not be used as a pretext for influencing essential aspects of sovereignty of the Member States of the European Union."
"It cannot be repeated often enough that we support the fight against international terrorism and we approve of taking initiatives to freeze funds if it can be shown that they belong to, or come from, individuals or organisations that carry out acts of terrorism."
"We recognise the need to react quickly but believe, at the same time, that thorough reflection is important."
"The proposal for a regulation is an expression of the fact that the EU is in a position to take action, but not to reflect."
"If we are not voting against Parliament' s approval of the initiative, it is for the following reasons."
"First of all, we do not believe that Parliament should be consulted on this issue, on which it has no influence."
"We think it is completely unacceptable that Parliament should take a view on a regulation proposed by the Commission on the basis of the paper before us, which has been presented in a hurry and which Coreper criticises for lack of cohesion and consistency."
"We believe that the procedure whereby Parliament is asked to approve the hasty adoption of the Council proposal is being used by the Council to legitimise a regulation on which thorough work has not been done."
"The list attached to the proposal in Annex 1 is of organisations and individuals suspected of being directly or indirectly involved in acts of terrorism."
"In our view, the fact that a list prepared in the United States has been approved without hesitation is a matter for criticism."
"The proposal contains no guidelines as to how, or in accordance with which criteria, individuals or organisations are to be added to, or crossed off, the list, and it has not been specified which authorities are authorised to draw up the list and according to what principles."
"We would criticise the fact that the proposal invalidates fundamental principles of a society governed by law, principles that protect those who have been accused against unfair and unlawful treatment."
"It is a fact beneath contempt that the traditional, threefold division of power into legislative, judicial and executive authorities has been invalidated so that the EU can comply with the United States' desire for rapid intervention."
"At the same time, it must be emphasised that no infringement of these principles can justify acts of terrorism."
". (SV) Naturally, I agree without reservation with the total condemnation of terrorism which constitutes the stated motive for this regulation."
"However, both the decision process and content of the regulation constitute an insult to that very democracy and rule of law whose protection is claimed to be the aim of the proposal."
"The European Parliament has been forced into rushed action without any reports, debate or access to the text of the legislation in many languages, including Swedish."
"No positive reason has been given to explain why normal forms of democratic decision-making have to be bypassed."
"As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists' financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures."
"At the same time, the regulation is a legal rush job and a mockery of all the grand statements to the effect that the fight against terrorism should not be perceived as a war against Islam or the Arab world."
"The regulation contains no definition of terrorism, terrorists or terror organisations whatsoever."
"Instead of the legislating body operating in the normal legal way by formulating a general definition of the crime and leaving it to the judicial system to trace, arrest, prosecute and judge those whose actions correspond to the definition of the crime confirmed by law, the legislating body, i.e. the Commission as proposer, the Council as decision-maker and the European Parliament as the body considering the proposal, has pre-empted the application of the law and circumvented the need for a definition of the crime by instead directly announcing 27 'guilty' organisations and people."
"The origin of this list cannot be traced to any legal procedure whatsoever, but comes from the CIA."
"The list contains a number of names with no more specific information - names which probably belong to several people."
"In addition, all the names on the list are easily identifiable as Arabic/Muslim."
"The result has been a diversion which is not needed in order for necessary measures to be taken in EU countries against terrorists' financial assets, which breaches fundamental legal principles and which must also be perceived as a one-sided political attack on the Muslim/Arab world."
"Through its decision to adopt a number of amendments, the European Parliament has pointed to possible ways of partly, but far from entirely, reducing the deficiencies to which attention has been called."
"I believe it would have been more just of the European Parliament in this situation to have shown its dissatisfaction unambiguously by recommending the complete rejection of the Commission' s proposal. In this way, the Commission would have been able to return with a new proposal which would have genuinely increased the chances of fighting terrorism, would have been based on legal principles and would have ruled out any suspicion that the proposal is one-sidedly directed against the Arabic/Muslim world."
"Against this background, I, like a number of my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, voted against the proposal in the final vote."
"The Commission' s proposal is not only contrary to Article 308 of the Treaty, but it also disregards elementary legal principles and the basic laws of the Member States."
"The main reason why I cannot contribute to bringing about this legislation is that the effect of the Commission' s proposal would quite simply be to abolish any form of legal protection."
"Even suspected criminals are entitled to fair trials."
"It is this fundamental right that the Commission would have us abolish."
"The United States has issued the Commission with a list of 27 individuals and organisations."
"We have not been given any proof of the activities of these 27, not even the slightest explanation of why precisely these 27 should be judged without evidence and without trial."
"What is being required of us is that we undertake to judge these 27 with blindfolds on - definitively and with no recourse to appeal."
"We are to wield the rubber stamp here and now and, in classic Dr Strangelove style, shoot first and ask questions afterwards."
"Are not democratic principles of law precisely what we wish to defend?"
"What will be next in line if we give in now and accept that the end justifies the means?"
"We have voted against this draft regulation because we do not think that appalling terrorist acts such as those on the World Trade Center can be opposed by violating fundamental freedoms."
"This draft regulation quite simply asks us to trust the CIA in cutting off the means of subsistence from the 27 groups described, rightly or wrongly, as terrorists by the very agency which, more importantly, is behind some of them."
"We did not wait for Mr Bush to denounce tax havens, but under no circumstances will we give his secret services a blank cheque."
"The list, put forward with no explanation and which, we are warned, will be extended, no doubt in line with the interests of the USA and its allies, is only an alibi list when compared with the battle as a whole, against both tax havens and the perpetrators of death who profit from them."
"As we definitely do not have the same definition of terrorism as Mr Bush, and as the list of the guilty remains open, we propose that the company TotalFinaElf should be added to it as the 28th organisation, as it is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths around the world and is directly linked to terrorist activities, particularly in Africa."
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of the European Parliament' s amendment to the Council proposal for a regulation on specific arrangements placing restrictions upon certain persons and groups with a view to combating international terrorism."
"We agree that the EU must combat international terrorism in all areas."
"Nonetheless, we have general reservations about the proposal and, for example, reject the list of 27 terrorist organisations."
"These organisations all appear to be Muslim, which may be construed as discrimination when there are also non-Muslim terrorist organisations."
"These organisations ought, in the nature of the matter, to be included in the list, which cannot therefore be regarded as complete."
"Moreover, we have reservations as to whether such a list can in practice be used at all."
"I abstained on the final vote because although I agree with the principle behind this regulation, I cannot agree to the inclusion of Annex 1."
"This regulation speaks about International Terrorism generally and does not specifically refer to the events of September 11."
"Therefore it seems totally wrong for this Annex to be included which only refers to individuals and organisations who appear to be solely from the Islamic Community."
"I am also concerned that the evidence against the people and organisations listed in the Annex has not been seen by European Parliamentarians and therefore we have not been able to decide for ourselves whether those listed are guilty of terrorism or not."
"The European Parliament has been asked to act urgently and decisively to freeze funds that could be used for terrorists."
"We have risen to this challenge, and in doing so have made essential amendments to protect liberties of innocent people."
"I am personally proud of the amendment that demands action to give details that make persons named in the annex actually identifiable."
"It would be absurd to go forward with a list of names that could refer ambiguously to thousands of people in the Islamic world, rolling innocent people in with sinister ones."
"The Council of Ministers has called for speed and decisiveness."
"We have responded and underlined the need for judicial safeguards fully compatible with decisive and immediate action."
"We are effectively challenging the Council to keep faith with us and not delay matters by devising a new version without judicial safeguards."
"We voted against this draft regulation for a number of reasons."
"We strongly believe that granting such powers without proper debate and without a parliamentary report on the matter is legally questionable."
"The fact that the protection of civil liberties is not addressed in the regulation is appalling, and the invoking of Article 308 sets a dangerous precedent for rushing through emergency legislation without any open and transparent debate."
"It is also questionable whether the European Commission had the right to invoke this article in such circumstances and it could be in breach of some national constitutions."
"The European Parliament was asked to vote on a list of 27 organisations without any explanation as to the basis under which they were chosen, who or what they are, and without any mention of safeguards if one of these organisations or persons was wrongfully accused."
"We do not believe that the European Parliament has the right to act as judge and jury on such matters and most especially when the facts are not clearly explained in a transparent and open manner."
"We of course welcome any new measures to combat terrorism; however, such measures must be properly thought out and properly debated in a transparent and democratic manner, not, as happened this week, in a atmosphere of panic."
"Any new measures must enshrine human rights, protect civil liberties and recognise the assumption of innocence, if they are to be truly effective."
". (NL) It is an old custom to isolate political opponents by labelling them terrorists."
"When ex-terrorists became the leaders of South Africa, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and a very large number of former colonies, they suddenly became reasonable and respectable people in the eyes of many, and their former opponents were blamed - rightly so - for causing the violence."
"By nipping in the bud every prospect of peaceful means towards a better life, they had driven the opposition to desperation."
"That is why we must always draw a sharp distinction between opposition, in particular, campaigns resulting in socio-economic and administration changes, and irrational violence, which is only aimed at bringing about fear and destruction."
"The American list of 27 suspected organisations with an Islamic background raises in some cases the suspicion that the support of governments in the battle against international terrorism is being bought by labelling their internal opponents terrorists as well."
"We are, then, committing the same error as in making abortion, euthanasia and trading in soft drugs by inhabitants of Member States indictable offences where these are permitted by the legal administrations of other Member States."
"In the justified battle against real terrorism, not everything now being proposed is fair and appropriate - not by a long chalk."
"I do not agree with this ill-considered approach."
"I believe that it is sensible to freeze the bank accounts of organisations or individuals who perpetrate or support acts of terrorism such as those which took place on 11 September 2001."
"What has been submitted here, however, is a list of individuals and organisations who are merely assumed to have been involved in some way in the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington."
"However, it is possible to proceed against them, even without a judicial process or final proof."
"Such a measure would be comparable with being remanded in custody, when suspects have not yet been found guilty in a court of law."
"If no evidence of guilt is found, prisoners on remand are released and paid compensation."
"No such provision is envisaged here."
"Moreover, the clause contained in Article 2(2) enables other unpopular persons and organisations to be included on this legally dubious list."
"Given that the Justice and Home Affairs Council has already talked about urban violence in connection with terrorism, I fear that this will make it possible to freeze the bank accounts of individuals or organisations who demonstrate against the EU's policies at European Councils, for example."
"Had I voted in favour of this resolution, I would have given my support to a questionable and arbitrary act."
"I therefore voted against the resolution despite my sharp condemnation of terrorism."
"The members of the MPF group in this House have voted in favour of the Council regulation that makes provision for, following the Extraordinary European Council meeting in Brussels on 21 September, a number of measures to fight terrorism."
"It is not the case that we think these measures in themselves constitute a total, satisfactory and coherent response to the formidable threat we face."
"We simply think that it is a first step in the right direction and that we now need to tackle, without delay or taboos, the task of generally reviewing our legislation so that the intention expressed by the Presidency of the Council to conduct a policy against terrorism that is both 'global' and 'sustainable' does not remain some kind of mantra, but is something that can be translated into reality."
"In this respect, some of the proposals made here yesterday by Minister Michel concern us, because they reflect the persistence among some of our leaders, despite the events of 11 September, of the same 'old way of thinking' , to use Mr Gorbachev' s expression, of the same ideological vein which for years has inspired, at European level, lax and demagogical measures with regard to the movement of people, which have led to us giving up control of our territory and have made the European Union an epicentre for Islamic terrorism."
"When Mr Michel asserts that the wide-ranging legislative review advocated by our fellow member Mr Berthu that aims to make the safety of our people a priority 'leads straight towards a liberticidal society' , he is adding to this confusion that is the root of all of our shortcomings."
"Is it not as a result of seeing every removal of controls as a step towards freedom that we have paved the way for terrorists such as those who went on to attack the United States?"
"The fact that any serious measure of control, particularly if it is a national measure, is still seen as a liberticidal proposal, says a great deal about how far there is to go before the old libertarian ideology is abandoned and before the debate can rise to the challenges we are having to face as a result of current events."
"(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)."
"Extraordinary European Council (RC B5-0666/2001)"
"Calling an Extraordinary European Council meeting was undoubtedly the right move following the terrorist attack in the United States."
"Naturally the European Union is being cautious in its response, so far at least, but there a number of sensitive points which merit special attention:"
"a) the reference to Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, without specifying the country from which the attack has emanated, creates a particularly dangerous climate of war and reckoning;"
"b) police measures to combat terrorism must be limited by respect for citizens' freedoms;"
"c) a policy needs to be defined towards ""friendly"" countries such as Saudi Arabia, which have helped by funding the spread of fundamentalism;"
"d) resolving the Palestinian question, especially the problem of Jerusalem, will release huge numbers of Muslims from under the spell and control of Islam;"
"e) fundamental intervention in the global problem of poverty will free whole societies in Asia and Africa from the despair which feeds terrorism;"
"f) the European Union must avoid Mr Berlusconi's divisiveness and Mr Blair's sermonising and take a calm and friendly approach towards Islam."
"We wish, once again, to state our total condemnation of the terrorist acts witnessed in the United States and, once again, pay respect to the suffering and the struggle of the victims' families and of the American people and call for the fight against terrorism not to contribute to creating more victims."
"The fight against international terrorism will only be totally effective if it is carried out under the auspices of the United Nations and this is why we specifically reject the use of Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, which runs the risk of dragging the European Union and the international community into a spiral of violence with incalculable consequences."
"It is also our view that the fight against terrorism, which is, of course, necessary, must not be used as a pretext to undermine individuals' fundamental rights, freedoms and protection under the law, or affect essential aspects of the sovereignty of the European Union' s Member States, including militarisation."
"What we do feel is important is that, in parallel with the fight against international terrorism, we pursue the fight against money laundering, including the abolition of tax havens."
"Our vote, therefore, reflects our profound disagreement with some of the joint resolution' s main aspects, voted for by a majority in plenary, although we support most of the remaining points."
"I voted against the resolution for several reasons."
"I believe that bringing to justice those responsible for the terrorist attacks in the United States should not mean suffering and terror for other innocent people."
"It is vital that any action taken in response to these atrocities does not trigger more attacks like it or even worse."
"The international community has a duty to seek to understand what may have led to these terrible crimes."
"It must try to understand because to refuse to do so will contribute to the likelihood that much worse lies ahead."
"I believe that the United States, and the coalition of countries that has been formed, must be sensitive to global security as a whole."
"If the US responds with attacks on Afghanistan it too will be killing innocent people and two wrongs never make a right."
"I strongly feel that we, as politicians in the democratic world, have a great responsibility to uphold the principles of non-violence and to ensure that such unjustifiable violence does not escalate."
". (NL) The fact that people should kill themselves and many others in the terrible manner of 11 September in New York and Washington is a sign of hate and desperation."
"You can only combat terrorism by helping to remove the breeding ground for violence, not by causing yet more outrage."
"The way in which Israel seeks out and liquidates violent Palestinian opponents only appears to evoke more sympathy for violent resistance."
"There is now the threat of that very mistake being repeated on a global scale."
"When it comes to matters of climate, armament and racism, the US President sought isolation."
"The formation of a coalition of the rich and powerful, led by him, against the poor and rebellious will be counter-productive in the long run."
"I side with the only American politician who had the courage to vote against the warmongering, following in the footsteps of those few German socialist dissenters at the beginning of the First World War."
"The money we are about to waste on war would be better spent on prevention."
"Within Europe, this would involve making ourselves as secure as possible against attacks, something which would be possible if we did not privatise airport security and air traffic safety and if we paid closer attention to safety standards for very tall buildings."
"Outside of Europe, it would involve helping to solve the problems of poverty, neglect and injustice."
"British Conservatives strongly support measures which are specifically designed to combat terrorism in all its forms."
"In this spirit therefore, we have supported the motion for a resolution and the counter-terrorist legislative measures being adopted by Council."
"However, we do not support the proposition that 'combating international terrorism implies a distinct strengthening of the relevant EU competencies', or that the EU should have responsibility for negotiating agreements on judicial and police cooperation with the US, which are properly a national responsibility, given the very different constitutional, judicial and operational traditions of key Member States such as the United Kingdom."
"We see no connection between the need for a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the call for intensification of efforts to operationalise the European Security and Defence Policy."
"On the contrary, recent events underline the need for stronger transatlantic ties, and an enhancement of NATO, rather than the potentially divisive pursuit of some autonomous EU military capability."
"In addition, we wish to ensure that any new counter-terrorist legislation is also used to bear down on those terrorist organisations, such as the IRA in all its forms, and ETA, that have been conducting terrorist campaigns from and within EU Member States over the past several decades."
"Stability and Growth Pact (RC B5-0602/2001)"
"The collapse of liberal dogmas is becoming increasingly apparent."
"The 'stability pact' and the anti-democratic powers that the European Central Bank has been given operate in an extremely restrictive fashion, at a time when radical change in the direction of European integration is becoming particularly pressing."
"The demonstrations by trades unions and other organisations that arose as a result of the meeting of the Ecofin Council in Liège and debates at the European Citizens' Congress have highlighted the urgency of the social and democratic demands made by movements that are opposed to the prospect of globalisation in line with the current capitalist globalisation."
"The Ecofin Council, however, once again demonstrated its inability to communicate."
"It did not make any proposal in proportion to what is at stake."
"Its debates continue to be characterised by a total lack of transparency and responsibility, as illustrated by the fate of the Tobin tax."
"Ministers went back on their public commitments in referring the matter to the Commission, which we know is hostile to such a decision, no matter how elementary it may seem."
"In the same vein, the burning question of tax havens was only voluntarily broached from the specific angle of the fight against terrorism."
"The governments of the Union are not yet ready to change direction."
"This is the fundamental issue hidden behind the joint resolutions put forward for the vote."
"And this is the reason why we will vote against them."
"Japan is now experiencing a recession."
"The United States are not far behind, Europe is seeing considerably less growth and a recession is not completely out of the question."
"In order to prevent a global recession, it makes perfect sense to boost economic activity by means of coordinated action with Japan and the United States, through increasing public expenditure up to a limit of 3% of the public deficit of each EU Member State, on the condition that:"
"the purpose of increasing expenditure is to improve public investment and to encourage private investment; and"
"at the same time, efforts are redoubled to implement structural reforms that stimulate employment, investment and competitiveness."
"The Stability and Growth Programme must, therefore, be made more flexible, in addition to the flexibility resulting from 'automatic stabilisation' , and this is why I abstained on the motion for a resolution tabled by the PPE-DE Group."
"Hieronymi Report (A5-0286/2001)"
"The adoption of the ""Television without Frontiers"" directive was a milestone in Community legislation."
"Yet, here we are, over ten years on, and the editorial changes needed to protect viewers and European cultural productions have still not been made."
"Below are the three most important points:"
"a) viewers need to be protected from the flood of advertisements by strengthening the binding arrangements in the directive and controlling and punishing televisions stations which infringe them;"
"b) minors need general protection at Community level from advertising and from programmes which desensitise them to violence and anti-social behaviour; and"
"c) stricter, specific measures are needed to promote European productions and make it easier for producers in small countries to break into the wider European market."
", Färm, Hedkvist Petersen, Hulthén, Hans Karlsson, Theorin (PSE), in writing."
"(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats believe that it is vital that minors be protected from television advertising aimed at children , as this group is particularly susceptible and may have difficulty differentiating advertising from other programming."
"In Sweden, TV advertising aimed at children under 12 is totally forbidden under the Swedish Radio and Television Act."
"According to Directive 97/36/EC, advertising must be clearly identifiable as such."
"Children under a certain age cannot appreciate the difference between advertising aimed at children and normal children' s programmes."
"Slightly older children can appreciate the differences but not understand the purpose of the advertising. (Research report by Gunilla Jarlbro of Gothenburg University)."
"We therefore believe that this must not be promoted, which is why we are voting against this part (paragraph 1 aa) of the report."
"First and foremost, I must thank both our rapporteur in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, Mrs Hieronymi and the whole of the Committee for the high-quality work they put before us and their interesting reaction to the third report from the Commission to the Council, the EP and the ESC on the application of Directive 89/522/EEC ""Television without frontiers"" , whose main objective is to put a legal framework in place to promote the free movement of audiovisual broadcasting services within the single market and to guarantee certain general interests such as the promotion of cultural diversity and the protection of consumers and of minors."
"Many reasons can be given to justify my vote in favour of this report;"
"I shall simply mention them."
"Taking into account that 98% of homes have a television, the report firstly and quite rightly points out that the social impact of television is becoming increasingly significant, especially for children."
"Meanwhile, regarding the protection of minors, the report asks the Member States to step up their dialogue, to define common solutions without threatening their independence in terms of national restrictions for the protection of minors."
"This can be put in another way by saying that the audiovisual sector plays an essential role in democracy and informing the people, and is therefore emerging as a reflection of the level of freedom of expression and plurality of ideas that can be expressed and understood."
"Moreover, the report also highlights the extent to which the audiovisual sector is a leading sector both in the economy and for employment in the European Union: in 1997, the audiovisual sector employed more than a million people in Europe and its revenue should increase by 70% between now and 2005."
"(Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"Berès Report (A5-0307/2001)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on 1 January 2002, economic and monetary union will be completed."
"For each Member State, there will be a continued and binding obligation and need to consolidate public budgets on a sustained basis."
"This is set out not only in the Commission report but also by the rapporteur herself."
"I fully support this objective."
"I therefore welcome the report's proposal that the current requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact be expanded with new and individual objectives for each country."
"Consolidating the public budget is the main priority for every government in order to create the required scope for action."
"As a representative of Austria, I know what I am talking about."
"Despite all the difficulties and a mountain of debt, the new government is working to ensure that the ambitious goal of achieving a zero deficit remains in place."
"Färm, Hedkvist Petersen, Hans Karlsson (PSE), in writing."
"(SV) We Swedish Social Democrats have abstained from voting in the vote on paragraph 2 and recital B."
"Paragraph 2:"
"It is good that the Eurogroup is developing its cooperation on monetary issues."
"However, to transfer all cooperation on economic policy to the Eurogroup would be wrong."
"We do not, therefore, support a possible amendment to the Treaty in order to strengthen the Eurogroup' s powers in the economic area, in any case not until we have more concrete proposals."
"Against the background of EU enlargement, it is particularly important that Member States outside the Eurogroup have the opportunity to take part in economic cooperation."
"Recital B:"
"We do not wish to give our support to progressively binding legislation in the economic area, at least not until we know more about the specific implications."
"The report makes the indisputable observation that ""Economic Europe is not yet a reality""."
"The reasons for this are no mystery."
"Each national State is, more than anything else, concerned with protecting the interests of its own capitalist class and favours national policy most suited to that objective."
"The ruling classes have no need, however, for the European institutions to harmonise their policies, apart from settling national rivalries, in order to improve the profitability of their capital to the detriment of the working classes."
"In terms of freezing salaries, widespread lack of job security, mass redundancies, savings on public services and attacks against social protection, capitalist Europe has no need for institutional harmonisation in order to be united."
"The Bérès report considers that ""sound public finance"" is the prime condition for ""strengthening economic policy coordination within the euro area""."
"However, it does not say how that financial balance should be reached."
"Who should pay?"
"Capitalist companies or consumers through VAT?"
"Who should benefit more from budgetary spending?"
"Public services or private employers?"
"Without tax gifts to capitalist companies, budgets could be used more for public services without being in deficit as a result."
"This is clearly not the line taken in the report."
"Under these circumstances there was no question of us supporting it with our vote."
"The Berès report is interesting because it acknowledges the failure of a social liberalism that thought it could combine acceptance of the Treaty of Amsterdam with genuine social policies in Europe."
"The report advocates the coordination of economic policies, but realises that the institutions that could perform this do not exist."
"The ECB is obsessed with one single issue, Parliament is powerless, and the Eurogroup is semi-clandestine."
"The report simply begs it to please keep Parliament informed."
"The report does however contain a large amount of truth, as throughout there is concern about the institutional void and regressive policies that risk being implemented under the influence of neo-liberal dogma."
"But instead of saying out loud what is being discussed increasingly widely, that it would be reasonable not to apply the Stability Pact, the report is content to advocate coordination of 'their respective stability programmes' ."
"This quite pitiful desire to limit damage cannot make us forget that the shackles were put in place with the active support of liberal socialists, particularly in Italy and France."
"This is why we did not lend our support to vague and ill-conceived orders that, more than anything, serve to make us forget that we have in fact made a huge mistake."
". (EL) A single currency requires a single economic policy."
"This, basically, is the conclusion drawn by both the Commission report and the rapporteur's report."
"Member States are being further restricted in the exercise of economic policy to a framework of decisions taken in advance and national parliaments are required to do no more than observe or, even worse, execute decisions taken by the ÅU."
"This is an attempt to undermine the workers' facility to react, as they are doing more and more decisively, to the choices made by big business."
"The EC report welcomes the EU's anti-grass roots policy and includes proposals whose sole function is as an alibi for the rampantly neo-liberal economic and social policy of the ÅU and the tragic impact which it has on the lower classes, such as prior agreement on the allocation of fortuitous or exceptional tax revenue - just to make sure nothing is spent on the social security sector."
"Integrating the ""issue of the ageing population"" into national budgets is another move in the same direction."
"While the report posits that unemployment still affects 14 million Europeans and that the economic and social situation has not improved, it remains faithful to the policy of structural change and unemployment sharing."
"The involvement of the national parliaments in the form of an annual evaluation of the application of the broad economic policy guidelines decided in the European Council and the debate on the stability programmes approved by the Commission and the Council, are no more than a semblance of democracy, the aim of which is to entrap national representations in Community procedures, especially when it is proposed to strengthen the role of the Commission and impose sanctions on Member States which fail to apply the economic policy imposed by Brussels."
"It is an attempt to make national institutions accessories to a process which, on the pretext of coordinating economic policies within the broad economic policy guidelines, is further subjugating wage measures and social policy measures in general to the suffocatingly restrictive criteria for cohesion and of the Stability Pact."
"The Member States are expressly called on to ""coordinate their actions and refrain from adopting tax, budgetary or wage policies""."
"The break-up of the guaranteed national insurance system, in conjunction with wage cuts and the fact that working hours and costs are arranged to suit employers, are demonstrably increasing poverty and social exclusion among the working classes and reducing the quality and extent of services offered."
"Obviously, the more measures passed to restrict income and workers' rights, the greater the pressure for more structural measures, and the more the signs of slump in the economy increase, the stricter austerity policy becomes."
"Peijs report (A5-0306/2001)"
"I voted in favour of the excellent report presented to us by Mrs Peijs for the following reasons."
"As we all know, the last 30 years have seen an excessive increase in public spending in Europe, which has forced Member States to raise taxes to an unsustainable level."
"It is, therefore, crucial that we reduce the tax burden, by implementing the reforms necessary to achieve this, so as to improve incentives for employment and for business activity."
"The attempt that is being made to define a sustainable method of tax relief is, therefore, to be applauded."
"I hope that the Commission will continue in its efforts to guide national governments' approach to tax relief, specifically by establishing a 'code of conduct' ."
"With regard to the issue of trying to ensure that the largest possible proportion of the active population has access to the labour market, it is essential that we abolish the social, fiscal and administrative obstacles preventing women and older people from returning to work and/or from remaining in work."
"This is particularly important because features of demographic change have been - as the United Nations' report for 2000 quite rightly points out - a slowdown in the growth of the population of active age and the increase in the population over 65 years old, which raises the enormous concern of maintaining the social security system or even of trying to prevent potential economic hardship arising as a result of having an insufficiently large workforce for our labour markets."
"It is equally important that we give priority to the access of young people to the labour market as well as to lifelong learning, which will require an increase in public and private spending in the fields of education, research and development, along with, of course, the respective structural reforms, so that the effective transition to a knowledge-based society can go ahead."
"This report demonstrates little concern for the social and economic situation of certain Member States and dwells on the need to pursue budgetary consolidation and compliance with the Stability Pact."
"This is a very short-sighted position, which is why we propose it be removed."
"What is really required is the immediate suspension of the Stability Pact and a thorough review of its objectives, criteria and bases."
"We also disagree with the idea that public investment is not a solution to the crisis or that it is generally poorly managed and led, which is why we have tabled a proposal for an amendment that highlights the importance of public investment for economic growth and employment."
"A degree of commitment to solving social problems, job creation and combating social exclusion and poverty require no longer attaching priority to maintaining monetary stability at all costs, when we know that the consequences of this will be further unemployment, wage caps and more poverty."
"Deplorably, the various amendments we tabled on a thorough rewording of the report have not been adopted."
"The Peijs report is a true neo-liberal anthem that portrays public finances and social protection as the root of all evil."
"For example, the report contrasts inevitably ""ill-managed"" public investment with the private sector, which is, naturally, efficient."
"Its main function is to once again affirm the neo-liberal dogma codified in the ""Stability Pact"" signed in Amsterdam in 1997, and to condemn the adjustments suggested at the Gothenburg summit on automatic stabilisers."
"Now that the economic climate is changing due to a persistent wage moderation policy, the report affirms the right to inflict a fresh recession on Europe."
"It advocates blindly applying a policy that everyone will notice goes against the announced objectives for growth and employment."
"When the economy slows down, the Stability Pact contributes to the chaos by slowing business down, because in reality it aims to achieve an unemployment level that will bring salaries back down and increase profits."
"We must vote against this report, as applying it would pose a genuine danger to the workers of Europe."
". (NL) Fluctuations, with their peaks and troughs, are characteristic of a market economy."
"At times of economic stagnation of growth or when consumption levels fall, there is no sense in talking people into unrealistic optimism."
"This would be a form of deceit and would lead to recklessness in consumption and risk-bearing investment."
"It would be better to expand existing governmental provisions or to introduce new ones."
"This was the method successfully used in America under Roosevelt during the `30s crisis, and with which western Europe was successfully rebuilt after 1945."
"For that matter, it was also the method by which authoritarian states such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were able to build economies which were much stronger than outsiders had predicted."
"In all those cases, whether we agreed with them or not, the result was an unexpected number of satisfied people."
"Instead of learning from that, we now see a reversion to the primitive standpoints of the 19th and early 20th centuries preceding these successes."
"Tax reductions, in favour of high incomes and big business, are now considered to be positive, while government spending is considered to be very negative."
"The report by Mrs Peijs fits in with this now predominant trend."
"As I expect poverty and instability as a result, I am not in favour."
"Longo report (A5-0299/2001)"
"Prominent in this report is a whole set of demands for speeding up the process of liberalisation in various sectors."
"It even criticises the Stockholm European Council for not having fixed a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the gas and electricity markets, which is unacceptable."
"We also reject its call for Member States to move ahead rapidly and in a uniform way on opening up the energy, transport and postal services markets."
"It therefore comes as no surprise that it attacks the public monopolies, specifically in the field of electricity, that it calls for the local call market to be opened up or that it considers that the privatisation and liberalisation of public services will lead to lower prices and higher quality."
". (EL) The real world today is a world in which huge monopolies abuse dominant market position, where gigantic companies merge, consolidate or are taken over on a daily basis and where monopoly groups acquire terrifying power, invariably accompanied by thousands of redundancies, which have a huge impact on employment, and the monopolisation of wealth-creating resources, markets and consumers."
"There were 345 new mergers in 2000, to quote the report, thanks to increasingly flexible legislation which fosters the creation of large monopolies which acquire dominant market positions."
"However, this is of no concern to the ÅU. What does concern it is setting a timetable for the definitive liberalisation of the natural gas and electricity markets, speeding up the rate at which the energy, transport and postal services markets are liberalised and safeguarding universal access to services of general interest, in order to improve the competitiveness of the economy."
"It is also concerned with abolishing state aid."
"However, the desperate attempt to abolish state aid is really an attempt to increase the profits of the already strong players and to consolidate their market position by excluding new competitors and applying the law of the jungle, the law of might is right and the supremacy of monopoly interests."
"State intervention does not, of course, touch the heart of the capitalist system and it often strengthens companies and businesses on a selective basis."
"However, without state intervention, even with the tiny, balancing role which it can play, the gulf will widen constantly to the detriment of less developed areas and sectors and the poorest sections of society, given that structural measures and denationalisation are carried out not for their benefit but to strengthen the profitability of big business."
"That is why the constant pressure for measures such as the proposed register of state aid and the subsidy scoreboard is intolerable."
"All the choices made by big business illustrate how worried it is about the possible renationalisation of competition policy (i.e. control by the Member States, not the Commission of the European Union), which is why the report proposes an international competition system in the framework of the WTO."
"The competition policy applied has resulted in large branches of European industry dismissing workers and losing important shares of the global market and hundreds of thousands of jobs."
"The disgraceful concentration of power, in strategically important sectors, has put the economy of entire countries in the hands of speculative multinational groups, with everything that implies for the workers."
"The loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs has caused unemployment to spiral."
"The workers are facing the biggest attack yet on their employment and social rights, they are watching their standard of living being eroded, poverty spread and the public sector and productive base in most countries in the Union being restructured and dissolved in the name of rampant and catastrophic competition, in the name of an absolute market economy and in order to promote the monopoly aspirations of big business."
"That is why protests against globalisation and the prevalence of the uncontrolled rules of the market economy are growing day by day."
"We consider that the competition policy applied is responsible for all this and we intend to express our complete opposition to it by voting against the report."
"Huhne report (A5-0301/2001)"
"In spring last year, together with the Council, we adopted the Electronic Commerce Directive which is due to come into force on 17 January 2002."
"The pillar of this Directive is the country of origin approach."
"When the report before us was discussed in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for the first time, I was surprised to find that some members of the relevant Committee wanted to call this country of origin approach into question again for online financial services."
"Yet this is quite absurd."
"If the European Parliament and the Lisbon European Council have set a deadline of 2005 for establishing an integrated market in financial services, we cannot afford to adopt incoherent legislation or keep re-examining decisions which have already been taken, unless we have very good reason to do so."
"This applies not only to some Members of this House but also to the Council, whose vote last Thursday on the Directive on Distance Marketing of Financial Services I greatly regret."
"We opted for the country of origin approach - so we should now apply it in a targeted and coherent fashion."
"I would also like to join the rapporteur in congratulating the Commission on its initiative in establishing the European Extrajudicial Network (EEJ-NET) and the Financial Services Complaints Network (FIN-NET)."
"Simple, cost-effective, non-judicial procedures for cross-border redress can only enhance consumer confidence in the development of cross-border financial services."
"Naturally, consumers must be made aware of the existence of these networks, and I therefore also support the proposal that all websites providing online financial services should advertise these networks."
"Berger report (A5-0310/2001)"
"The services sector is of fundamental importance to the future development of the European Union' s economy and already accounts for the largest share of its GDP and more than two-thirds of employment. It therefore deserves our full attention to ensuring improvements in its quality and to maintaining employment."
"The main concerns of the Commission, however, as stated in its communication, focus on establishing an internal market for services, studying the obstacles to the free movement of services across national borders, proposing their removal, and working towards speeding up the liberalisation of postal services, the distance selling of financial services, acquisition proposals and value added tax on digital products."
"The rapporteur, as well as agreeing with the Commission proposal, highlights the need to speed up and complete the process of liberalisation in sectors such as postal services, electricity and energy, which we are bound to reject, since, in general, this is designed to demote the State to a role of merely regulating the activities of public services, establishing supposedly independent regulatory bodies, which are directly or indirectly controlled by economic and financial groups."
"By and large, the results of liberalisation are redundancies, increased prices for public service provision, a reduction in the quantity and quality of service provision and the rejection of the right of universal access to public services."
"Khanbai report (A5-0263/2001)"
"The Khanbhai report makes an extraordinary analysis of one of the most serious challenges facing the world today; the fight against the main communicable diseases in the context of poverty reduction."
"Communicable diseases kill around 10 000 people every day in Africa, with 35 million people throughout the world contaminated with Aids."
"HIV/Aids, malaria and tuberculosis are, therefore, a terrible threat to the social and economic development of the poorest communities, and as Mr Khanbhai argues, require a rapid, effective and wide-ranging response, in which the EU must take the lead."
"These diseases cause not only human suffering and an extremely high number of deaths, which are in themselves justification enough for such a response, but also cause a drastic reduction in life expectancy and in the labour force, with all the social and economic consequences that this entails They seriously disable large working populations, retard social and economic development and destabilise communities that are already weakened."
"I therefore agree with the rapporteur when he states the urgent need to create an Infectious Disease Fund, which is crucial to providing medical treatment for those affected, to identifying carriers, to prevention and research and to the development of new medicines and vaccines."
". (NL) In questions to the European Commission, I have already on a number of occasions strongly recommended measures to ensure that medicines to combat prevalent fatal diseases are available to inhabitants of the Third World."
"Remedies against tropical diseases are often available to foreign tourists from rich countries, but not to the large majority of the local population."
"Existing medicines, which have worked effectively for many years, are even being withdrawn from the market."
"The reason for this is the lack of spending power in those countries to buy these medicines."
"If we see medicines as mere commodities, protected by patent rights which ensure that the cost of earlier development expenditure is forever passed on, there will be no medicines available to poor countries and certainly not to their poorest inhabitants."
"Such medicines often cost more than the annual income of people living there."
"The proposals by Mr Khanbhai for international recognition by the EU of the right of developing countries to produce generic treatments for epidemic diseases without having to pay the costs of intellectual property rights, as well as the stimulation of production of treatments for diseases caused by poverty and the periodical review of the TRIPs agreement are essential to reach a solution."
"The report makes a number of good points."
"However, they pale before the sheer extent of the misery and shame suffered by millions of people throughout the world, especially in undeveloped countries, where they are still living in poverty, deprived of even basic access to health, and dying from infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS and so on. It is even more of a disgrace when there is the certain prospect - based on official studies and research - that the situation will get worse."
"The acceptance that health is a ""global public good"", as the report rightly points out, cannot be reconciled with the fact that a large proportion of the world's population is deprived of access to education, housing, employment, food, safe drinking water, conditions of hygiene and health services."
"More than 5 million people a year die from infectious diseases, mainly in underdeveloped countries, while a handful of multinational pharmaceutical monopolies continue to patent, profit from and speculate with drugs, even going so far as to withdraw drugs which, although they save lives, fall short of profit targets."
"It is not right to channel any additional resources for developing research to the private sector in the form of incentives rather than to public research centres."
"It is insulting and hypocritical to state that the ""global public good"" of health is being hit particularly hard in underdeveloped countries, while at the same time imposing structural changes on these countries by reducing expenditure on the public service sector, especially the health and education sectors."
"It is unacceptable to rely on the ""charity"" of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for action to safeguard this ""global good"" and to trust in ""better cooperation"" and ""partnership"" between the public sector, NGOs and the private sector."
"Health is a fundamental and inalienable human right, it is the most important factor of social justice and human dignity and it cannot be ruled by market regulations and the laws of profit."
"It is of prime and capital importance to use public-sector means to fight disease and secure the right to health."
"However, a radical approach to the problem involves hitting at the root of poverty, at what sustains and exacerbates it."
"The report hardly even touches on this sort of solution to the problem, making do with regurgitating constantly repeated ""analgesic"" announcements and proposals."
"Overturning the social policy system and policies which apply the established imperialist and monopoly interests which generate and spread poverty and misery, which have no hesitation in crushing and sacrificing entire populations and nations to their cause, is the only solution to the problem."
"TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Support for a framework agreement in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"
"The first item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0617/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group;"
"B5-0626/2001 by Mrs Pack and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group;"
"B5-0634/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group;"
"B5-0643/2001 by Mr Swoboda and Mr Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group;"
"B5-0653/2001 by Mrs Morgantini, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group;"
"B5-0660/2001 by Mr Lagendijk and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,"
"on support for a framework agreement in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"Mr President, I think that two messages must be sent to Macedonia today."
"The first should be to the government of Macedonia."
"Much gratitude should be conveyed, as well as admiration expressed, for the courage demonstrated by the Macedonian government in proposing amendments to the constitution and giving the Albanian minority the place required by a modern democracy."
"It has been difficult, and the European Union must express its heartfelt gratitude to the Macedonian government for what it has done."
"The second message I think we should convey to Macedonia should be addressed to the NLA, or what is known as the liberation movement."
"It will be appreciated that this originally emerged under Milosevic - I shall not go through the whole story - but now there is only one thing to say to the NLA and to its remnants in northern Macedonia, and that is: the struggle is over now; all weapons must be handed in now; there is now no reason at all for the NLA to continue with the activities of which it has been guilty - and I use the word 'guilty' advisedly, for the NLA is of course a very mixed organisation, certain aspects of which do not bear too close examination."
"Now, the Albanian population has been accorded its full civic rights."
"That is the way to solve problems involving minorities."
"I myself come from a border area between Denmark and Germany, in which we solved all the problems 45 years ago by according both minorities, north and south of the border, full rights in a modern democracy."
"That is what Macedonia has now also chosen to do."
"It is the right way, and both parties deserve our thanks."
"Mr President, although our views on the NLA might differ slightly, I endorse Mr Haarder's comments that the task now is to preserve peace."
"Peace is still a precarious commodity in Macedonia, perhaps because faith in a shared solution, a shared state and a shared society is not yet fully established."
"This is not surprising, for something like this takes longer than sitting at a negotiating table and engaging in negotiations."
"However, if we look at the Framework Agreement, I think it is very important that renouncing violence is the first priority."
"This is a democracy; it does not need violence to bring about change."
"In a democracy, it must be possible to talk about change, conduct negotiations and then bring forth legislation to achieve change."
"The second point is the country's integrity."
"We do not need new borders or new states painstakingly drawn along some sort of ethnic lines, but which can never be drawn precisely."
"We only need to look at the capital Skopje to see how impossible this is."
"I have never understood why both sides - even if only briefly - have actually talked about the option of dividing the country."
"Thirdly, this is a multiethnic state."
"Many countries are multicultural, but this is a multiethnic state with a significant Albanian minority which cannot treated in the same way as a five or six percent minority."
"Its status must be enhanced."
"Its status has been enhanced, and we think it is right that these minority rights are being expanded beyond the usual extent."
"I believe that overall, a good compromise has been found."
"We will be in Skopje in the next few days."
"We will stress the need for the remaining necessary measures to be put in place."
"For our point of view, this continual prevarication and threat that there will be no agreement and coordination after all, or that there may be recourse to violence once more, are incomprehensible and unacceptable."
"I hope that just as we are able to discuss Macedonia with a greater sense of satisfaction today, this prevarication will give way to a genuine feeling of satisfaction and acceptance within the next month or so."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the weapons have been collected, so it is claimed."
"The NLA has been dissolved, so it claims."
"We all know that there are still a great many weapons in Macedonia, and the issue of a criminal association is still on the agenda."
"It includes those who want it."
"I still assume that most Albanians want it."
"I also assume that most Macedonians want it."
"However, the problem in many Slav Macedonian heads has not yet been resolved - otherwise, we would never have had the problem in the first place."
"In recent years, nothing was done to enable the Albanian minority - a substantial 28 percent of the population - to participate genuinely as citizens on an equal footing."
"If this issue had been addressed seven or eight years ago, instead of just two years ago, and if progressive measures had been taken to make all citizens equal, the rebels would not have had such an easy ride, in my view."
"It is a pity - also for the Macedonian people - that it now looks as if there is only a response when criminal elements appear to be overrunning the country."
"It is a pity, but it is the fault of all the political parties on the ground."
"Ultimately, we have now achieved what this House has always asked for."
"As Mr Swoboda has said, I would also like to remind you that we do not want a divided country."
"Macedonia is a state."
"It should continue to be a state, and it should not be divided along ethnic or national lines."
"Anyone who considers this option puts the entire region at risk."
"That is something which is extremely dangerous."
"I very much hope that this new Parliament will also now try to implement the laws as quickly as possible."
"The problem is that we are now hearing that what they have already voted for is being called into question again, and that sessions of parliament are constantly being postponed."
"Obviously, there are reasons for this."
"In Tetovo, for example, repeated attacks are being carried out on the Macedonian police."
"We must ask ourselves why this is happening."
"We must therefore be very diplomatic but firm with all our colleagues in Macedonia and ask them to make genuine efforts to progress with the Ohrid Agreement."
"We must not allow any recourse to this dreadful idea of holding a referendum in order to put off these constitutional changes indefinitely."
"That must not happen."
"Hannes Swoboda, Joost Lagendijk and I will try to bring influence to bear on our Macedonian colleagues over the next two days."
"I also think it is very important for an amnesty to be granted in whichever way is appropriate under the laws of the country, but this should not apply to crimes to be investigated in The Hague."
"I think we should make a fine distinction here."
"Naturally, I very much hope that the parliament will now put in place the laws necessary to strengthen local autonomy and give the minorities - which, after all, are majorities in some regions of the country - the opportunity to take genuine responsibility for their fellow citizens."
"I think that if they pursue this course, as Johannes has said, we will have peaceful situations by the end of this year."
"Mr President, we support the motion for a resolution, but we find it all very optimistic and hard to believe."
"Did the August agreement really ensure that the multi-ethnic society and the single rule of law were in fact maintained?"
"We say and we hope that it did."
"But the only evidence we have at the moment is that weapons are being collected and the National Liberation Army has been disbanded."
"However, we do know that determining in advance how many weapons would be handed in was hardly conducive to being taken seriously."
"How were the numbers calculated?"
"Just as we also know that it is the easiest thing in the world for a resistance movement to say that it is disbanding and then to regroup without further ado."
"That is why we share the incredulity, the degree of difficulty which the Slav Macedonians appear to be having in making further progress."
"We hope they will make progress."
"We want to remain optimistic, but the only serious argument for being optimistic and supporting the line taken in the motion would be, first, a stable political line, not double and triple messages coming out of the European Union and ÍÁÔÏ, as has happened in the past, with catastrophic results at political level; secondly, real, generous financial assistance - and soon - and, thirdly, to give European prospects to all the Balkan states at long last, and to this particular country as quickly as possible, so that there is a way out of the crisis, hope and prospects."
"Mrs Pack has, I think, rightly pointed out that there are still many problems in front of us. But all in all, the peace process in Macedonia may still be considered a small miracle."
"I fully agree with the words of Mr Haarder in congratulating the Macedonian government and pointing to the courage that government has shown."
"Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, a Gordian knot has been cut."
"The minority rights of the Albanians are guaranteed, the operation 'Essential Harvest' has succeeded, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia remains secure."
"The multi-ethnic society is indeed being given another lease of life and dialogue is central to the parties. We must continue to pay attention to this region, to the whole of the Balkan region."
"The Afghan crisis, the war on terrorism, must not distract our attention from this part of the world."
"We must invest in the stability of the Balkans. We must invest in the stability of Macedonia."
"We must ensure that sufficient support for the execution of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is being granted."
"We must provide good guidance for refugees returning home. We must see to the re-building of that country."
"And I wish here to underline the words of Mrs Pack."
"The political history of my own country has demonstrated that only forgiveness, only reconciliation can guarantee real peace in a country. And so amnesty for the revolutionaries is indeed important."
"This does not mean the revolutionaries who may possibly be accused before the Court of Justice in The Hague."
"It concerns the others, for whom a regulation is required."
"I hope that our fellow MEPs who are departing tomorrow for Skopje will be able sufficiently to alert our counterparts over there to this problem."
"I also fully support extension of the mandate of the European Agency for Reconstruction in that region."
"Macedonia should be brought under the scope of that regulation, and I also hope that we as Members of the European Parliament will be paying enough attention to the work of the European Agency for Reconstruction, so that we may be sure that the European taxpayer' s money is well spent in an efficient and timely manner in that region."
"Mr President, if the constitutional changes and reform laws in Macedonia come into force - and we hope that this will happen soon - the country will have minority rights legislation which far outstrips the standards in the majority of European countries and most EU Member States."
"We always talk very pompously about European standards - which, in reality, do not exist in this form - and often demand that other countries meet criteria which many of our own EU Member States are not prepared to comply with themselves."
"Nonetheless, I am gratified by this positive development in Macedonia, not only in the wake of the most recent acts of violence but over the last two years since the Georgievski government embarked on a reform course in this area."
"Once again, the violence has jeopardised this process."
"I am pleased that the European Union and other international organisations, including NATO, have succeeded in shoring up the process, so that the reform course has not only continued but has actually improved and accelerated."
"However, this should not be a reason for us to fob off the Macedonians with mere thanks, as it were."
"Like Mr Haarder, I too believe that we owe them a debt of gratitude."
"However, this gratitude must be of a practical nature."
"We must finally take action in response to the scandalous handling of the issue of the country's name."
"We must finally take action on the financial resources for Macedonia, which must be used to benefit the country as a whole, including the very underdeveloped east and south and not just the capital or the few regions which were particularly affected by the crisis."
"What is very important is that we must finally begin to recognise that this country is our partner, based on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"We do not need any special instruments, we do not need a (pseudo) protectorate status, which is obviously still being mooted in some circles, also in connection with the idea of special agencies etc. I regard Macedonia as our partner."
"The Association Agreement is the instrument through which we can channel our cooperation."
"We must continue to work with Macedonia in partnership and assist it in its progression towards membership of the European Union."
"Mr President, if the Macedonian Parliament accepts the constitutional changes forced by rebellion and foreign intervention, this means that the large Albanian majority in the north-west regain their rights."
"Within the former Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia, the Albanian language was the language of administration and education."
"This right was suspended following the independence of Macedonia."
"The situation is comparable with the language rights of the Hungarian minority on the southern edge of the equally new state of Slovakia."
"National minorities which become a majority often appear to have no understanding for the other language groups within the territory of their state."
"In 50 years' time, the roles will be reversed as Albanians come to form the largest group in Macedonia."
"Only through an agreement based on equality can two peoples find a way to live peacefully as good neighbours."
"In that respect, much can be learned from the government structures of multi-lingual federal states such as Belgium, Switzerland and Spain."
"From that perspective I can now, in contrast to 3 May, consent to support for Macedonia."
"Mr President, the Commission fully shares Parliament's view that the Framework Agreement of 13 August is crucial to peace and stability in FYROM and that the Macedonian Parliament should be urged to adopt the measures recommended under the agreement."
"Commissioner Patten and EU High Representative Solana are in Skopje today to underline the importance of, and convey the urgent need for, constitutional changes and a revised law on local self-government, as foreseen under the agreement."
"We face truly formidable challenges over the next few weeks and months in FYROM."
"The EU is fully behind the Framework Agreement and is committed to providing financial assistance, including assistance for emergency aid and for measures in support of the agreement. We have provided over EUR 10 m in humanitarian assistance through ECHO since the crisis began;"
"EUR 54.5 m under CARDS in 2001, which includes a recent top-up of EUR 12 m for housing reconstruction, local infrastructure and support for host families; EUR 12.8 m under the Rapid Reaction Mechanism to repair and reconstruct houses, to repair electricity and to support confidence-building measures, such as mine clearance, election monitoring and police training; and EUR 50 m in macro-financial assistance still to be disbursed from a previous macro-financial package, which is being combined with an additional grant of EUR18 m to help FYROM cope with the specific needs arising from the crisis."
"This assistance is, of course, conditional on an IMF agreement with the Macedonian Government."
"The Commission and the World Bank are ready to organise a donor meeting on 15 October, provided that the Macedonian Parliament adopts the necessary constitutional changes set out in the Framework Agreement."
"It is not an overstatement to say that the effective delivery of EU assistance could be critical to the success of the Framework Agreement and, therefore, to peace."
"Our paramount concern is to ensure that we act quickly and flexibly."
"We have therefore decided to propose an extension of the European Agency for Reconstruction, which has an excellent track record in delivering assistance throughout the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The agency has people on the ground and direct experience in the region, notably in the sort of emergency reconstruction that we will need to deliver in FYROM this autumn, as well as in longer-term assistance of the type it is now overseeing, for example in Serbia."
"We therefore urge Parliament to give positive consideration to our proposal to extend the mandate of the agency."
"Beyond the Framework Agreement, we are determined to pursue a strategy of closer integration of FYROM into the European mainstream, simply, first of all, by implementing the new Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed in April."
"A lot has to be done in this area and FYROM must demonstrate that it can live up to international standards by respecting minority rights and show that its democratic structures are stable enough for it to pursue its path towards European integration - in simple terms, to become a member of the European family."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m."
"Human rights"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"United Nations World Day"
"B5-0616/2001 by Mr Lannoye and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group;"

"B5-0659/2001 by Mr Lipietz and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group,"
"on the situation in Columbia."
"United Nations World Day to overcome extreme poverty"
"Mr President, would dedicating a resolution from this House on extreme poverty on this occasion be giving in to opportunism?"
"I would like to remind you that on 17 October 1987 Father Wrezinski, with 100 000 people, talked about the life of the poorest families and people in our whole society and since that day, the World Day to overcome extreme poverty reminds us each year that it is our duty to unite in respecting human rights when they are violated."
"If we adopt this resolution today, we are paying tribute not only to the commitment of the families and people who face extreme poverty themselves, but also to the commitment of all the associations and citizens who stand beside them."
"Also, throughout the European Union, especially since the Lisbon summit, the public, national and European authorities are constantly highlighting the fight against exclusion and particularly the need for an integration policy."
"It is in this spirit that today, on behalf of my group, I am presenting this resolution, which asks the Member States to develop real strategies aimed at equal access for all to fundamental rights such as education, housing and healthcare as well as culture and sustainable employment."
"It is also in this spirit that we are asking the European authorities and, as far as we are concerned, our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, in cooperation with the Commission, to make an assessment of the policies conducted in the field every 17 October and thirdly, we ask, for the future of course, that a stone be laid in the square in front of the European Parliament in Brussels in honour of the victims of poverty like those laid in the squares at the Trocadero in Paris, the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, in Berlin, Rome and at the UN."
"It is a simple but nevertheless important tribute that we want to pay today by putting forward this resolution."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I start my speech proper, I wish to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Secretariat and the Bureau to the fact that, at least in the Portuguese version, paragraphs 2 and 11 of the Resolution are practically identical, probably as the result of a mistake in the drafting of the text."
"Perhaps it would be possible, following the vote, to merge the two texts, because they are practically the same."
"The purpose of celebrating this day is to discuss the serious nature of social problems as striking as extreme poverty, which affects more than one billion people across the world, who are forced to live on less than one dollar per day."
"We do so in the footsteps of the person who proclaimed this day in 1987 and following the decision of the United Nations in 1992, which enshrined it throughout the world."
"We must, of course, look at the programmes that we ourselves have put together to attack poverty and social exclusion."
"Here I would draw your attention to the resolutions of the Lisbon, Nice and Göteborg European Councils and to the work, on which consensus has already been obtained between Council and Parliament, on the programme of cooperation in the fight against social exclusion."
"I wish, once again, to pay tribute to the work of our fellow Member, Ilda de Figueiredo."
"Specifically, however, we must have an idea of the problems and of our strategy."
"We are facing very old problems that concern world development and we must think about the scandal that is war and corruption in so many countries that subject their citizens to the most abject poverty."
"Some things have been done in our countries to combat disease, need and profound social inequalities; there are new challenges that we are aware of, specifically in the context of the information society, but there are also new problems, affecting what we in Portugal call the 'new poor' ."
"This is a problem that greatly affects pensioners and the elderly and I am sorry that the compromise motion did not go further than it did."
"I think that there is a certain prejudice here against talking about the word 'family' , but we must be aware that the weakening of the family unit makes us all more vulnerable. It makes individuals lonelier, which is largely responsible for the contradiction we see today, which is that our societies are richer and, yet, we feel increasingly insecure."
"This is highly relevant to this problem, which we must look at seriously and with our eyes wide open."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, poverty in the world is a violation of human rights and an intolerable breach of human dignity."
"It affects hundreds of thousands of men, women and children."
"This poverty has increased in the last six years."
"In the European Union there are 65 million people living on less than 60% of the national average income, to say nothing of the differences within the Member States."
"It is thanks to social transfers and social assistance systems that the poverty level has remained at 18% in the Union."
"But with the slowdown in economic growth, we are in danger of exclusion and poverty being aggravated again."
"An analysis of the proposals from the associations and the work of the Intergroup on the European fourth world clearly indicate that the fight against poverty and exclusion should become a vital element of sustainable development."
"The objectives set should be pursued and integrated into all policies, with more resources."
"I regret that the financial provision for anti-poverty programmes is still inadequate."
"The Laeken European Council should adopt political measures on income, employment, housing, health, education, training and culture."
"Parliament should also have objectives guaranteeing the right to quality housing for all, against the constant withdrawal of employment and services and re-establishing citizenship and equal rights."
"This is also why, on the occasion of the World Day against poverty, which will take place on 17 October, the European Parliament, in cooperation with the associations concerned, should also promote initiatives to raise awareness and to mobilise people to eliminate poverty and destitution."
"I hope that this day will enable us to make a further commitment to implementing programmes against poverty, by developing economic and social policies that really deal with the underlying causes of that poverty."
"Violations of human rights in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam"
"Mr President, the prospect of economic reform in Vietnam has certainly improved over the past few years. However, there is still no progress as far as political reform is concerned."
"There is a constant flow of reports about the arrest, detention and ill-treatment of dissidents in Vietnam."
"Defenders of democracy, critics of the communist regime, religious communities and former refugees who want to invest in Vietnam are still at great risk."
"International human rights organisations are still not getting a hearing from the Vietnamese government."
"They are also banned from monitoring developments and carrying out inspections in the country."
"The central government is doing its level best to block any form of communication between the dissidents and the rest of the world."
"International donors must challenge human rights violations and must call for political reform in Vietnam in addition to economic reform."
"I am very much in favour of strengthening the economic ties between the European Union and Vietnam. However, as one of the country's biggest donors, the European Union must take a firmer stance and do more to ensure that human rights are respected there."
"I would also strongly advocate an independent investigation into the well-being of Mr Binh Vinh Trinh and other investors in Vietnam."
"Having made a fortune abroad by working extremely hard after fleeing from Vietnam, as many people did a few decades ago, Mr Trinh started investing in his native country again."
"However, he was arrested under the pretext of illegal investment, and brainwashed in solitary confinement, all of his possessions were seized and his investments were confiscated."
"This acts as a deterrent and naturally has an extremely negative impact on the decisions of other investors."
"There must be proper legal protection of foreign investments and investors in Vietnam and the corruption there must be brought to an end."
"This is an essential precondition for future economic and political development in Vietnam and her links to the world economy."
"In addition, Vietnam must protect, safeguard and guarantee human rights."
"There has been absolutely no progress in Mr Trinh's case over the past few months."
"He is still on the run and none of his or his family's unlawfully seized possessions have ever been returned to him."
"As soon as he sets foot in Vietnam, he will be put straight back into prison."
"I call on the government of Vietnam to make a gesture by respecting the rights of Mr Trinh and other investors and those of other political dissidents."
"Mr President, twelve years ago, a Czech human rights activist in Prague wanted to appeal to a Western head of government for help in the face of his impending imprisonment."
"This Western head of government did not receive him."
"A few months later, the human rights activist became President of Czechoslovakia. His name was Václav Havel."
"From then on, the Western head of government had a great deal of difficulty in getting an audience with the Czech President, who refused to receive him because he wanted to make it clear that this failure to respond to human rights violations and the flouting of human dignity was unacceptable."
"European Union states are pursuing a similar policy today with regard to Vietnam."
"It is a policy of autosuggestion."
"It is claimed that Vietnam is pursuing a reform course."
"It is also claimed that Vietnam no longer has such a repressive regime as before."
"Yet the reality sends out a very different message."
"Persecution of human rights activists has increased."
"Injustice and the suppression of press freedom have increased, as has the suppression of religious freedom."
"If we look at the reality of the situation, we must recognise that this regime cannot be set on a reform course without massive external pressure."
"Economic and geostrategic interests, too, cannot be sustained in the long term unless there is a stronger emphasis on the rule of law throughout South-East Asia, but especially in Vietnam."
"That is why it is in the European Union's interests to abandon its policies of autosuggestion at last and speak out about human rights violations in Vietnam."
"The European Parliament adopted this approach with regard to Central and Eastern Europe before 1989."
"It was fairly isolated at the time, but events proved that it was right."
"The European Parliament is pursuing the same course today on Vietnam, and I appeal to the Commission, and especially, of course, to the Council and Member States to adopt a more pro-active human rights policy with regard to Vietnam and genuinely send out a clear signal, for in this region of the world, we are dependent on this important country, with its great culture, returning to a more democratic course based on the rule of law."
"Only then can it be a real partner - also in the economic field - in the long term."
"Mr President, Vietnam has once again flouted its international commitments and its own Constitution."
"The conviction, following a botched trial, on 26 September, of 14 members of the mountain ethnic groups for having peacefully demonstrated in favour of freedom of religion and the establishment of an autonomous area in their province is a fresh illustration of this acknowledged contempt for human rights."
"They went to join the dozens of prisoners of conscience who are rotting in jail in atrocious conditions, while international human rights observers are unable to get into the country to do their job."
"The failure to respect individual freedoms should not be tolerated in a country that claims to be democratic and which we have ourselves supported in its fight for independence."
"The use of the death penalty - more than one hundred sentences passed in 2000 - is also unacceptable."
"Vietnam, which is an economic and trade partner of Europe, and which has also ratified the international convention on civil and political rights, must respect its international commitments and stop persecuting ethnic minorities."
"Political liberalisation must go hand in hand with economic liberalisation."
"Without that, the country cannot be considered by the European Parliament as a democratic State."
"Mr President, today I must join with the authors of the joint resolution in standing against the failure to respect human rights in Vietnam."
"The European Parliament has spoken out many times on this matter, the last time only three months ago, to condemn the violation of the freedom to practice religion."
"The country, which is still run by a Communist party, still represses, on a daily basis, any group or individual considered to be a threat by those in power."
"My fellow Members have already said that the freedom of the press, freedom of opinion, religion and association, rights of ownership and the right to vote are flouted."
"What is also serious is that no international organisation or independent observer is authorised to come and monitor the human rights situation in the country."
"Let us recall that in April, Vietnam celebrated the 25th anniversary of its reunification."
"The Vietnamese government, which has signed many international conventions on human rights, had an excellent opportunity on that occasion to reaffirm the commitments it had given in that respect."
"Vietnam is demanding a place on the international stage and has potentially everything in its favour to become a prosperous country."
"Reality, unfortunately, shows the situation to be quite different."
"The Vietnamese people live in poverty, their society is in decline and the country is still under-developed."
"By signing a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union in 1995, Vietnam gave a formal commitment to respect human rights and promote democracy."
"The joint EC/Vietnam Committee that met in September in Hanoi reconsidered all the aspects of relations with the European Union, including the joint agreement on democracy, good governance, human rights and the rule of law."
"I call on Parliament today to give its full support to the European Commission in implementing its partnership strategy in the region."
"We must all encourage the process of reform in Vietnam."
"Respect for fundamental freedoms, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience should constitute the basis of sound and constructive cooperation with that country."
"Health situation in the Republic of Uzbekistan"
"Mr President, Uzbekistan, the land of Bukhara and Samarkand is now in our thoughts as the border country of Afghanistan with Taliban-linked extremists operating in its territory."
"We acknowledge that there are human rights problems in that country to be tackled, but we welcome its partnership in the fight against terrorism."
"Yet not many of us are aware of the other crisis in Uzbekistan."
"Reporters report on the problem and potential problem of refugees in the area."
"They do not report on the 13 million people affected by one of the worst droughts in history in the area, that started in the spring of last year."
"They do not report that six million children under 14 are affected."
"They do not report that drinking water and irrigation water is in desperately short supply, that most of the crops in the affected areas have failed, that poor-quality drinking water and sanitation problems have resulted in one of the highest levels of ill health in the region."
"They do not report that only 54% of the people in urban areas in Uzbekistan have access to sewage networks, or that only 3% in rural areas have such access."
"As a result, parasitic infection is rife and the third cause of infant deaths is diarrhoeal disease."
"Malnutrition and poverty have reached crisis point."
"We need urgent action to supply essential drugs and equipment, to strengthen water-quality control, to support and monitor nutrition programmes, to train health workers and conduct health education programmes."
"We also need to help the country change from its heavy use of agrochemicals, its diversion of rivers and its poor drainage system."
"I commend this motion to the House."
"Mr President, anyone who visited Uzbekistan during the Soviet era was enchanted by its glorious Islamic heritage, its thriving markets - especially compared with the markets elsewhere in the Soviet Union - and its lively atmosphere."
"We are therefore especially concerned about the situation in Uzbekistan today, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This is no longer a booming country; it is a country in a difficult political situation, scarred by hunger and environmental devastation."
"Intensive cotton farming with excessive use of fertilisers has undoubtedly contributed to this environmental disaster."
"Furthermore, as the previous speaker has just pointed out, Uzbekistan is now in a situation in which we must fear the worst over the coming weeks and months, especially in light of developments in Afghanistan."
"The European Union is called upon to help the region as a whole - for in a situation of economic privation, environmental devastation, and a permanent threat from Islamic fundamentalist or terrorist groups, it would be an even greater disaster if the European Union failed to help the people in this region by supporting them in their efforts to overcome the catastrophic environmental and health situation and assisting them to achieve a modicum of economic prosperity, and above all by providing basic foodstuffs."
"I am sure that Commissioner Nielson, who is the appropriate person to participate in this debate today, is already giving thought to these issues and making preparations with his staff for what has to be done today, but above all, what must be done in the event of further disasters, e.g. in response to refugee flows from Afghanistan."
"Our task is not simply to deliver great sermons."
"This is not a clash of civilisations; it is not a campaign against Islam. What we must do is to take practical action during the coming weeks and months and show the people that we genuinely wish to express our solidarity and support with more than just words."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fully endorse Mr Swoboda's words."
"I am the chairman of the European Parliament delegation for relations with Uzbekistan."
"Please allow me to give a personal account today."
"Last June I spent an entire week travelling around Uzbekistan with a European Parliament delegation."
"We visited the Karakalpakstan region, the region where they are struggling with the serious problems of the Aral Sea. The situation there is disastrous."
"Commissioner, could I have your attention for a moment?"
"We met the people there. We met the relief workers."
"They expressed their thanks to our delegation, they spoke to us and they gave us messages, but they also told us: We have seen so very many delegations come and go."
"When will the European Community, when will the whole international community help us to actually do something together with the other countries in this region?"
"The situation there is disastrous, including in the area of public health."
"Mr Wiebenga and I visited the local hospital in Nukus where patients with TB are treated."
"The situation there is degrading."
"The sewers in the basement are broken. They are absolutely overflowing with human excrement."
"There are mosquitoes flying around. The stench there is unbearable."
"Patients have to keep the flies and mosquitoes off their bodies, with the result that patients who should really be staying for three months leave. They go home."
"They infect members of their families. They infect other people around them."
"I believe that as an international community we must take our responsibility seriously."
"I therefore hope that the Commissioner will be able to promise us some concrete measures soon."
"Otherwise the text of the resolution that is before us receives my unqualified support."
"East Timor"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, East Timor is the first new State to emerge freely and democratically onto the international stage at the start of the new millennium."
"The European Parliament must take pleasure in this result."
"The issue of East Timor has been on our international agenda for a number of years."
"We have given voice to those who have fought to return dignity to the Timorese people and to have their right to decide on their own destiny recognised and we have condemned the violation of human rights by Indonesian troops and by militias sponsored by them."
"I must emphasise the work undertaken by so many Members of this House. In particular, I wish to refer to Carlos Costa Neves, who has chaired the inter-group 'For East Timor' and who has taken part in each of the European Parliament' s missions to that country."
"We may have helped the people of East Timor to regain freedom and democracy, but we also have a responsibility for helping them to consolidate their gains."
"East Timor needs help from the international community: political, technical and financial help."
"Without this assistance, it will not be possible to rebuild what was destroyed, assemble a new administration and ensure the necessary development."
"This is why we call on the international community: to provide more support and assistance."
"Our compromise resolution, therefore, calls for an extension of the United Nations mandate, for the return of the refugees who wish to return to their countries and for the fight against the impunity of those who have committed crimes and who have violated fundamental rights."
"Lastly, I must say that I am glad to see a considerable degree of consensus and multiparty support for the candidature of Xanana Gusmão for the Presidency of East Timor."
"This Sakharov prize-winner could be a reference point for unity and could make a fundamental contribution to consolidating the new democratic institutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, normally at this stage in the proceedings, we discuss accidents, disasters, calamities and all manner of things that cause us deep sadness and pain."
"As Mr Coelho has already said, East Timor used to be one such case. Today, however, is a joyous occasion."
"What we have seen and heard today is the success of the process in Timor. At this moment, I should also like to tell this House of the gratitude of the Portuguese and, of course, of the Timorese people, for the increasing solidarity that their cause has enjoyed in the European Parliament and which has spread throughout the world."
"Mr Coelho has already mentioned the various resolutions and the high point, which was the award of the Sakharov prize to Xanana Gusmão, the distinguished leader of the Timorese resistance, who will be, by broad national consensus, the next President of the country."
"This should serve as an example to us of how, with tenacity and patience, we can achieve positive results and help good causes."
"Three years ago, anyone in this House who said that this would really be happening today would definitely have been called crazy."
"Three years ago, we could not have imagined the referendum of August 1999 and the overwhelming consensus of the Timorese people."
"It would have been impossible to imagine that the tragic crisis following the referendum would be overcome and that, on 30 August this year, we would have the first elections of a new, free and independent State."
"We must continue to help East Timor."
"We made a major contribution to winning the independence for which they were fighting, in defence of their identity."
"We must keep this sense of responsibility alive and remain vigilant to the potential dangers in a geo-political context that remains highly uncertain."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the East Timorese people on the conduct of the peaceful and democratic elections for the Constituent Assembly on 30 August."
"I am particularly honoured to be able to speak about East Timor today as I was the Chief Observer of the European Union Election Observation Mission in the country between 23 August and 11 September, and was able to see for myself just how important these elections were for the people of East Timor."
"Before I turn to substantive issues, however, I would first like to congratulate UNTAET and especially Sergio Vieira de Mello on their work, which was often carried out under very difficult conditions."
"I would also like to pay tribute to the work of the Independent Electoral Commission, the European Commission both here and in East Timor, and the smooth cooperation with UNDP, the Embassy of Portugal, and the Belgian EU Presidency."
"East Timor has taken the first step towards independence and the founding of a separate state."
"What is especially important now is the continued support of the international community and the European Union, for the country faces enormous challenges."
"It is therefore essential that the UN peacekeeping units and civilian police remain in the country until East Timor is able to take over these security tasks itself."
"The EU Member States must lobby hard for this with the United Nations."
"It is important for the European Union and the United Nations, as well as other donor countries such as Portugal and Germany, to continue their technical and financial assistance, for the Commission and the Council to take a positive stance on East Timor's application for accession to the ACP - the ""Everything But Arms"" Initiative, for example, could take effect immediately - and for the EU to support the East Timorese government in developing a master plan for the country's development."
"In this context, the EU should focus particularly on rural development and health."
"The entire administrative sector must also be strengthened and, in some areas, built up from scratch."
"However, it is education, above all, which will be the basis for and a key element of all the development projects - for one thing is clear: these democratic elections are an extremely important step for the country's future."
"However, we must not forget that this is just the first step out of many which must be taken towards a functioning democracy and civil society."
"For East Timor's further institutional development, it is also important for the EU to participate in the arrangements for the presidential elections and the necessary voter education."
"There are many other examples, but one thing, above all, must not be allowed to happen: we must not withdraw from responsibility now that the foundation stone for an independent state has been laid and abandon the people who are only gradually beginning to recover from the trauma of the dreadful events of 1999."
"Instead, let us be prepared for the fact that our support will continue to be needed for many more years."
"As a key factor in this context, the assistance must be coordinated efficiently if it is to achieve its objective."
"After my many discussions in the country itself, I am certain that the East Timorese people are aware of the problems facing their country and understand only too well how difficult the way ahead will be."
"Let us work together with the East Timorese people as equal partners."
"We will also be sending out a positive signal to the international community - that it is possible to resolve problems peacefully and initiate development, especially at the present time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the tragedy in East Timor, one of the most beautiful pages in recent history has been written."
"The principles of an ethical international policy have triumphed in East Timor."
"The example of this country gives us further hope that world history is not merely a succession of barbaric acts and cruelty."
"At a terrible time, in which fear and apocalyptic concerns prevail, East Timor represents a ray of light and hope."
"Elections to the constituent Assembly in East Timor have been the crowning glory of an impeccable democratic process that does honour to the United Nations and, above all, to the people of Timor."
"Not all is rosy, however, in Timor as you all know."
"It is a very poor country, has an economy to rebuild, a State to organise and health, education and social protection systems to create."
"Only with the help of the international community, specifically the European Union, will Timor be able to turn its independence into something marvellous and a fine example for the rest of the world."
"My own country, Portugal, will certainly devote a great deal of affection and support to Timor, since it has become both a Portuguese and a universal cause."
"Colombia"
"Mr President, Colombia - one of South America's oldest democracies and a country which, unusually for this continent, has not been prone to military dictatorship - is tragically a victim of 37 years of civil war and terrorist activity, which have destroyed infrastructure, killed 40 000 people and corrupted its civil and military authorities through guerrilla involvement with the drugs trade."
"It seems from the events of 11 September in New York that democracies are particularly vulnerable to terrorism, which has no respect for the ballot box as a way to achieve change in societies."
"Now - and in spite of Colombian President Pastrana's concession three years ago of a large demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland, where 17 000 of its guerrillas roam at will - the FARC, instead of pursuing a legitimate, peacefully negotiated settlement, continues its policy of kidnapping and murdering civilians."
"Last Sunday it killed the much-loved former culture minister, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, and on Tuesday Congressman Octavio Sarmiento."
"I am sure that this House will join me in sending a message of condolence to their grieving families."
"Pastrana's policy of granting concessions to the FARC, labelled a terrorist organisation by the USA, has remarkable parallels with the policy of Britain's Tony Blair of granting early release to IRA killers without a prior insistence on the arms decommissioning to which they had already agreed."
"Curiously, three IRA suspects are currently under arrest in Colombia for advising the FARC on how to conduct murderous campaigns, on which, as we know, the IRA is an expert."
"I do not have a clear answer to President Pastrana's dilemma, as only 18% of Colombians in a recent poll supported suspending peace talks, scrapping the demilitarised zone and resuming full-blown civil war."
"Only the Colombian Government can decide what is best for the future of its country and what price it is prepared to pay to achieve peace."
"Nevertheless, I am sure that, as well as supporting this resolution, this House will join me in praying for the long-suffering people of Colombia and in hoping sincerely that the FARC and the guerrillas will see the folly of their evil ways and that the Colombian Government will achieve a policy of reconciliation without compromising justice or freedom."
"Mr President, it would appear from the last speech that the Government of the United Kingdom is responsible for the violence in Colombia."
"I would like to state that up to now, in the documentation I have seen, I have not found any involvement by the Government of the United Kingdom in the violence in Colombia."
"The fact is that in Colombia people are being killed - the revolutionaries (the FARC) kill them, the paramilitary organisations linked to the Government kill them - and to make any kind of pronouncement right now as to the guilty parties in Colombia seems premature to me."
"At present there is a situation of violence and those responsible for that violence are in fact the Europeans, because we Europeans left in Colombia, as in many other countries, a trail of injustice, of social differences, which persist to this day."
"The European Union has been concerned with Colombia for a long time."
"Unfortunately, we have not been able to influence events in a very positive way."
"But we have at least succeeded in increasing the country' s economic activity to the point where, today, 40% of Colombian exports are destined for the countries of the European Union."
"I believe that in the European Union we are faced with a somewhat desperate task, because the years are passing and the violence continues."
"The violence also affects us closely."
"For example, in Madrid, forty Colombians have been assassinated in the last six months by Colombian drug trafficking organisations, by hired assassins who come specially from Colombia to kill their fellow citizens."
"If the events of 11 September have demonstrated anything it is that violence in the world has no limits, that in a globalised world violence affects us all and that therefore, any action we take in a faraway country such as Colombia ultimately benefits our own citizens as well."
"We have to protect our citizens and the citizens of the whole world in lands as remote as Colombia."
"I know that the Commission and the Council are restricted in terms of achieving such results."
"If the Colombian Government, if a large number of people dedicated to achieving the pacification of the country in the country itself (writers, intellectuals, etc.) have failed to achieve those results, it is unlikely that we will be able to achieve them, but I believe - I am availing myself of the presence of the Commissioner, who deals with a very sensitive area concerning this issue, to say this - that we should continue our efforts."
"Rather as in the myth of Sisyphus, we should continue rolling the stone from the bottom of the mountain to the top, despite all events to the contrary."
"I am convinced that both the Commission and the Council will agree with Parliament on continuing to help the Colombian Government and the political leaders of good faith of that country to find a solution to put an end to the escalation of violence, which seems to be plunging Colombia, that magnificent and stupendous Latin American country, ever more into the abyss."
"I therefore hope that, between the three institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, we may help in some measure in the pacification of Colombia."
"Mr President, the political violence in Colombia is a crucial obstacle to peace and development in the country."
"No other country in the world has as many murders of active trade unionists as Colombia."
"The Colombian Left has been, and continues to be, subject to a terror campaign without parallel."
"Unfortunately, there is a clear risk that the violence will be further stepped up ahead of the presidential election."
"The resolution criticises both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries for the violence."
"Criticism can fairly be levelled at the guerrillas for kidnappings and violence against the native population."
"However, it is quite clear that the paramilitaries are responsible for the majority of the political violence."
"At least 90 percent of the political murders are carried out by the paramilitaries or the military."
"The paramilitaries would not be able to conduct their campaign of terror without indirect support from, and acceptance by, the regular police and military."
"Therefore, Colombia' s government also has direct responsibility for stopping the paramilitaries' campaign of terror in the country."
"The EU' s role must be to uphold human rights, support the peace process and oppose the military escalation of the conflict inherent in Plan Colombia."
"The demilitarised zone must therefore, also continue as an important precondition for dialogue between the government and the FARC guerrillas."
"Colombia can only achieve peace and real democracy if human rights are respected."
"If it is not possible for Colombia' s Left to operate openly and legally, without having its representatives murdered, the guerrillas will not lay down their weapons."
"It is therefore crucial that the terror campaign against the Colombian left is recognised and combated."
"This applies especially to the Unión Patriótica, to which the murdered Member of Parliament Octavio Sarmiento belonged."
"The Unión Patriótica has had at least 4 000 of its members shot by the paramilitaries."
"Criticism of this could have been expressed even more clearly in this resolution which we are about to adopt."
"Despite this, we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left believe that the text of this resolution is sound, and it is vital that, in the future, we carefully monitor and react to developments in Colombia."
"Mr President, ""Chronicle of a Death Foretold"" was the title of a novel by García Márquez, that has now become a sad reality in the birthplace of the winner of the Nobel Prize for literature."
"The eight bullets that assassinated Yolanda Cerón, head of social care in Tumaco, were also foretold and once and for all destroyed the already precarious working conditions of human rights activists on the ground."
"For a year the paramilitaries have reigned in the town of Nariño."
"The government lets them do as they will and the list of the dead gets longer."
"Just before killing Yolanda, the paramilitaries publicly executed thirteen peasants in Teima."
"On Sunday morning, the former Culture Minister, who had previously been kidnapped, Consuelo Araujo Noguera, was murdered during a chase between the army and the guerrillas."
"Then, the day before yesterday, the paramilitaries assassinated Octavio Sarmiento, a Member of the National Congress."
"We know that anyone who defends human rights in Colombia is a target for the paramilitaries."
"A clean-up campaign was even announced in August."
"The government had already withdrawn the legal basis for the existence of the paramilitaries in 1989, but has never done anything to seriously dismantle them."
"On the contrary, the law on defence and national security, ratified by President Pastrana in August, made the situation even worse."
"The law, which is a real blank cheque for all sorts of violations of human rights, extends the army' s powers and freedom to act in a frightening way and reduces the power of the public prosecutor."
"The close links between the army and its illegal right arm, the paramilitaries, is well known and the ""Human Rights Watch"" report, published today, only serves to underline this."
"The European Union needs to question the bases of its cooperation with Colombia."
"We are still waiting for the first six-monthly report on the progress of human rights in Colombia promised one year ago."
"If the European Union takes defending human rights seriously, it should explain its criteria and mechanisms for evaluation and effective protection to us."
"If it takes the peace process seriously, it should encourage the pursuit of dialogue between the government and the guerrillas, categorically exclude the paramilitaries from the negotiations and support the report from the committee of experts, published on 28 September."
"Finally, if it takes its own commitment to legal reform seriously, the first thing the European Union must do is to support the widespread calls for the law on defence and national security to be repealed."
"Mr President, I will respond to each of the five issues."
"The UN World Day to overcome extreme poverty is a welcome opportunity to highlight the continuing unacceptable levels of poverty and social exclusion across the world and to stress the need to intensify efforts for their eradication."
"Being able to lead a life free from poverty and social exclusion is a fundamental human right."
"While the challenge of combating poverty and social exclusion is particularly acute in developing countries, it also remains an issue of major concern within the European Union."
"The most recent available evidence shows that 18%, or over 60 million of our population in the EU, are at risk of falling into the category of being among the relative poor."
"This is a very high figure."
"At the European Councils of Lisbon, Nice and Stockholm, Member States made a commitment to promote sustainable economic growth and quality employment which will reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion as well as strengthening social cohesion in the Union between 2001 and 2010."
"The intention is to reaffirm and further enhance the importance of the European social model and to ensure that social policy has an equal status alongside economic and employment policies and that all three reinforce each other."
"To underpin their commitment, the Council developed common objectives in the fight against poverty and social exclusion."
"It also agreed that these objectives be taken forward by Member States from 2001 onwards in the context of two-year national action plans against poverty and social exclusion."
"Furthermore, the Council established a new open method of coordination which encourages Member States to work together to improve the impact on social inclusion of policies in fields such as social protection, employment, health, housing and education."
"The national action plans and the development of comparable indicators provide the framework for promoting exchange of good practice and mutual learning at Community level."
"This will be supported from 2002 by a five-year Community action programme on social inclusion which was finalised following a successful conciliation session involving Parliament, the Council and the Commission on 18 September."
"All Member States submitted their national action plans against poverty and social exclusion during June this year."
"The Commission has been analysing these reports and expects to adopt a draft joint inclusion report on 10 October."
"This will be the first time that there has been such an EU-level analysis documenting and comparing the situation on poverty and social exclusion across all Member States."
"It is intended that the joint report will be adopted at the Employment and Social Policy Council at the beginning of December so that it can be tabled and reviewed at the Laeken European Council."
"Parallel to the work on the national action plans against poverty and social exclusion, work has been going on to develop a list of common indicators in the field of social inclusion."
"This will also be presented to and adopted at the Laeken European Council."
"On the basis of these developments, the Laeken European Council is expected to define the priorities and approaches that will guide efforts and cooperation at Community level."
"The issues and concerns raised in the debate on these resolutions are thus well reflected in the initiatives that are being taken."
"However, a key challenge for the future will be to ensure that all Community decisions, in economic and employment as well as social, policies, are assessed for their impact on social cohesion."
"While a lot is now happening, there is no room for complacency."
"Days like the United Nations World Day for the eradication of poverty provide an important opportunity to remind us of the urgency of the challenge we face if we are to build a more inclusive and peaceful world free from the scandal of poverty and social exclusion."
"Looking at the global aspect of this challenge, the first and most important point of criticism is the pathetic level of official development assistance, which is now 0.24%, far from the 0.7% that was promised."
"This is where everyone will be looking on that World Day and we must come up with a European answer to that problem."
"Another issue we will be facing is financing for development in March next year."
"Ôhe policy of the European Union towards Vietnam, as to all other countries, is to encourage and support continued progress on human rights and democratisation, and to raise concerns both publicly and in private where abuses or any deterioration in the situation are observed."
"We have to draw attention, however, to the tendency of the Vietnamese administration to want to control the pace of change and to maintain ""social cohesion"" during transition to a market economy."
"Of course, I do not need to remind you that the European Union is opposed to capital punishment."
"In the case of Vietnam, the number of offences where the death penalty can be applied was reduced last year."
"Juvenile offenders, pregnant women and nursing mothers were also excluded."
"We welcome this progress, but we want to see the abolition of the death penalty altogether."
"Our principal concern remains that of freedom of opinion."
"The original ""offence"" of Professor Nguyen Dinh Huy in 1992 was to be a co-founder of the ""Movement to Unite the People and Build Democracy"" a movement supported by Vietnamese exiles in North America."
"Before that, he had been an active anti-Communist."
"The detention and interrogation of 15 people last month reported by Human Rights Watch was apparently linked to a request to the government to set up an independent ""National Association to Fight Corruption"" ."
"The common thread in all these cases is that, despite some real progress, Vietnam remains a country little accustomed to public dissent."
"The situation of the Montagnards in the central provinces arose from a complex set of unresolved old problems, but was certainly exacerbated by the lack of effective channels of communication between the local people and the central government."
"What is needed in Vietnam is continued progress in the country' s reform programme, so that the administration learns to deal with a wider range of views and to appreciate the value of accommodating dissent in the system of government."
"When Mr Patten was in Hanoi last July he took the opportunity to raise some of these concerns with the Vietnamese Foreign Minister."
"Next month, we will be holding in Hanoi a meeting of the EC-Vietnam Joint Commission, at which all aspects of our relations will be reviewed, including our shared commitment to respect for human rights."
"We shall continue to raise particular issues of concern and individual cases and to encourage continued progress on human rights in Vietnam."
"On the situation in Uzbekistan, the Commission shares the European Parliament' s concern about the present situation in Central Asia."
"It is clear that the drought is causing damage in the Aral Sea area and particularly in Western Uzbekistan."
"For example the Amu Darya, where the major problems lie, is reported to have 70% of the normal water level in its upper reaches and just 40-45% in the lower stretches."
"In addition to natural causes, some structural reasons can explain the present situation such as poor maintenance of water-irrigation systems, inadequate water management at regional level between the newly independent states, and agricultural practices which are water demanding such as rice and cotton."
"Lack of sustainability would be the short version of what this is all about."
"The July 2001 UN assessment mission to Western Uzbekistan has attributed the absence of water to fundamental structural problems (such as irrigation and crop policies)."
"So what is needed are ways to improve water management and agricultural practice."
"These activities are of a developmental nature. The response so far here is not falling within ECHO's mandate as such."
"We are, however, looking at this region from a humanitarian aid point of view, where we see a real risk of a negative fall-out from the situation in Afghanistan."
"In fact, ECHO will include a strengthening of the ability to do something relating to this part of the world in a package soon."
"The absence of democracy, transparency and accountability, corruption at all levels and misuse of the flow of assistance provided by the international community are all part of the problem."
"Since the independence of these countries, no real effort for maintaining the water system has been made."
"In addition, national rivalries between the countries in the region have blocked cooperation and also international efforts have been made more difficult."
"We have been active in Central Asia in trying to develop long-term projects linked with the structural causes of the drought."
"A Tacis programme has been developed to fight against the consequences of the drying of the Aral Sea."
"The Commission thinks that only long-term reform by the Uzbekistan Government itself can solve the current problem."
"Emphasis should be put on: the creation of alternative forms of employment in the drought-affected areas to improve the irrigation systems in use in these affected areas and, in general, improve water conservation; the introduction of more drought-resistant and less water-hungry crops through further research into new crops, pilot schemes, model farms and whatever is necessary to farm in a sustainable manner in this environment."
"Definitely a more effective allocation of water throughout the region is needed."
"We hope that Tacis can develop activities to address these issues, in particular at regional level, but the challenge is huge relating to our actual means."
"Let me turn to East Timor."
"The democratic elections on 30 August were a cornerstone in the transition towards independence."
"The Commission was pleased to see how peacefully the electoral process took place."
"The outcome - with no two-thirds majority for a single party - will require the Constitutional Assembly to work together and to seek a consensus."
"This will hopefully stabilise the political landscape even further."
"I think we can be justly proud of the contribution made by the European Union election observer team, and I am happy to congratulate Mr Kreissl-Dörfler on his leadership of the team of 24 Observers."
"We will certainly look into the possibility of sending another observer team to the presidential elections in 2002."
"In general, I am very pleased with the cooperation with the Parliament and Parliament can be pleased with itself because of its ability to deliver high-quality electoral observation."
"The next steps in the formal process will be the adoption of a constitution, hopefully before Christmas this year, followed by the election of a head of state by popular vote, probably around May 2002."
"Then will come the withdrawal of UNTAET and the declaration of independence."
"This process seems to be well on track."
"At the same time, the evolution of the political process appears to be equally well under way."
"The highly commendable performance of UNTAET, the recent nomination of an interim cabinet and the further ""timorisation"" of management functions in the administration have all contributed to this process."
"East Timor' s regional anchorage will add an additional foundation."
"East Timor is at an historical juncture."
"The emergency phase is over."
"We now have the chance to get the ambitious independence process right."
"The international community has to consider now the long-term development issues."
"The Canberra Donors' Meeting last June outlined the current, clearly unsustainable, economic situation and signalled the need for further international assistance."
"There is a narrow tax base, a lack of skilled entrepreneurs, and rural poverty leading to demographic pressure on the urban areas."
"But there is a realistic perspective for substantial oil revenues coming on stream around 2005-2006."
"This could change the picture dramatically."
"The national budget could double and could hopefully ensure financial cover for basic state functions, as well as some stimulus for the economy."
"We need to support the effort of the East Timorese to manage these oil activities better than what we have seen in many other developing countries."
"Statistics will tell us that it should not be very difficult to do it much better, which may not even be good enough, but definitely it is an opportunity."
"I would say that so far, so good."
"It would be wonderful to have best practice demonstrated in this field."
"Lack of transparency in this area is case-by-case across the world the real reason for a lot of trouble."
"Against this politico-economic background, and as one of the major donors for East Timor, the Commission has identified its future role accordingly."
"We anticipate the need to support one of the poorest countries on Earth until oil revenues provide a more stable economic basis."
"We will seek to create a development relationship based on a partnership philosophy."
"This means taking a realistic view of all the requirements."
"We are currently drafting a Country Strategy Paper, outlining the sectors."
"Most likely rural development and public administration will be where we concentrate our activities, suggesting appropriate financial targets for 2002-2006 within these sectors."
"This is how we will try to do it: focussing both on poverty alleviation and capacity building."
"As was said in the debate, East Timor will also be able to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms'Initiative, helping it to develop its foreign trade."
"Finally, I turn to Colombia."
"The Commission shares the deep concern expressed by Parliament concerning the deterioration of the situation in Colombia, in particular, the continuation of human rights violations."
"The Commission is seriously concerned with the situation of the Peace Process in Colombia after the recent events that have taken place and it is waiting for the evaluation of this process announced by President Pastrana."
"The Commission intends to maintain its support to the Colombian people through ECHO."
"EUR 10 m are being spent this year."
"In addition, the Commission has approved under its human rights budget, four new NGO projects worth over EUR 3 m."
"As announced by myself in Brussels on 30 April at the third meeting of the Support Group for the Colombian Peace Process, the Commission is currently finalising its proposal for a programme of a ""Peace Laboratory"" in the Magdalena Medio region in Colombia."
"This programme envisages the support of actions and movements already being implemented by civil society at local and regional level."
"The Commission sincerely hopes that conditions on the ground will allow an early implementation of this programme."
"The Commission will continue encouraging the Colombian Government and all other relevant political forces to remain strongly committed to the peace process in Colombia, especially during this time of unrest."
"As Mr Medina Ortega said, this reminds us very much of the labours of Sisyphus."
"It is true that it is hard to see progress, but there is no doubt that any relaxation or any type of giving up would definitely make things worse."
"This is our simple analysis and this is why we continue."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m."
"Southern Caucasia"
"The next item is the joint debate and then the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0618/2001 by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus;"
"B5-0624/2001 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on developments in relations between European Union and the Southern Caucasus;"
"B5-0630/2001 by Mrs Schleicher and Mr Posselt, on behalf of the Group PPE-DE, on developments in relations between European Union and the Southern Caucasus;"
"B5-638/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the Southern Caucasus;"
"B5-0649/2001 by Mr Linkohr and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus;"
"B5-0661/2001 by Mr Gahrton and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on developments in relations between the European Union and the Southern Caucasus."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and also a little impertinent to speak before the Chairperson of my delegation, Mrs Schleicher, whom I would have preferred to follow."
"However I thank Mrs Schleicher, Mr Posselt and my other colleagues who have contributed to raising, and now, debating a subject that is forgotten, that of the Southern Caucasus."
"I dare to hope that following the tragedy in New York and Washington, some of us have been made more aware of the importance of this area of the world, of the importance of a region that is in fact the doorway to central Asia, now a hostage of the Russian Federation, as is, to a large extent, not only the Southern Caucasus but also the Northern Caucasus, which is in an even more tragic situation, whether Commissioner Nielson likes it or not."
"The Northern Caucasus, as we all know, is experiencing the tragedy of Chechnya, a tragedy that is continuing and that sees opposition from the European Union."
"The resolution before you contains a number of very specific proposals."
"Most importantly, the Commission and the Council have been asked to draw up an overall strategy for this region of the world, a strategy that could reverse the current constant tendency towards the deterioration of the situation."
"The reason that living conditions in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan are so difficult, particularly Armenia and Georgia, is the constant, daily work of the Russian Federation, which the European Union is not acting against in any specific way."
"This is so true that even an apparently harmless issue such as the opening of delegations in Bakou and Armenia has not yet been resolved by the Commission."
"The problem has been raised on numerous occasions by this House, by Mrs Schleicher as Chairperson of the delegation with those countries."
"During our meetings in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, we have been asked to speak many times."
"We have done so and we still have not had an answer."
"This is a case that has been open not only for a few months, but for a few years."
"Either the European Union must understand that this region is strategically important, particularly for its energy supply, and start to discuss and propose a policy, or in a few months' or a few years' time we will witness the birth of the new Balkans, a little further away from us and therefore perhaps a little less uncomfortable than the Balkans of the 1990s."
"I think, nevertheless, that it is up to the European Union to give a response."
"These countries are part of Europe, they are already members of the Council of Europe, they feel European and in their heart of hearts - they do not dare to ask openly because the Commission and the Council have made it understood that it would not be very appropriate - their ruling classes want to belong to the European Union."
"We need to respond with action, with investment, we need to re-establish confidence, we need to take our entrepreneurs, investors and companies there."
"It is quite a small market but, and I repeat this especially for the benefit of the Commission, it is the gateway to central Asia, a strategic region which, as we have seen over the last few weeks, is particularly unstable."
"I therefore think that the European Union urgently needs to strongly intervene in this region."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, due to the tragic events of recent months, foreign and security policy is currently at the top of the public's agenda."
"In the light of the events in the Middle East and America, it is easy to forget that the situation in the Caucasus is just as explosive."
"The problems faced by Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - including the relations between these three states - still give cause for concern."
"Political instability repeatedly threatens the still incomplete independence process."
"As a result, violent conflict within these countries is often the focus of public attention."
"Yet the history of Europe - especially the history of the European Union - shows that despite the differences and conflicts of interest between states, it is possible to form alliances and thus transcend borders."
"Where war once dominated the scenario, we now have peaceful and democratic co-existence."
"It is based on the establishment of democratic structures and an emphasis on commonalities, which helped the Western European states to overcome their differences."
"In the light of the global coalition against terrorism in all its forms which has emerged since the dreadful attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, there is thus a need to support the states of the Southern Caucasus in their efforts to combat terror and violence which, sadly, are still a feature of daily life in these countries and threaten many people's lives every day."
"The region's democratic structures are still quite new and fragile."
"The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that disunity is incited from outside, and the neighbouring states in this region could try to impede or halt the democratisation process for their own interests."
"For these reasons, one of the European Union's key tasks must be to give more support to the democratisation process in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"Democracy is the only basis for lasting internal stability which in future will also transcend borders."
"However, the European Union and the present Belgian Presidency should focus solely on providing assistance and support; under no circumstances should they intervene in these countries' internal affairs."
"In specific terms, this means promoting these states' cooperation and cohesion, also as regards the possibility of a free trade area which must be set up without external influence."
"The initial elements of trilateral cooperation are already in place; however, they must be expanded and supported in order to counter existing external influences successfully."
"If these countries' shared rich cultural heritage is integrated into this process, I am confident that in the medium and long term, important results and successes can be achieved."
"As Chairman of the European Parliament's Southern Caucasus delegation, I regard the EU Ministerial Troika's visit under the Swedish Presidency last February as the basis for necessary initiatives."
"The joint motion for a resolution tabled by seven parliamentary groups signals the broad agreement between Members of the European Parliament on this issue."
"I hope that the Commission, too, will make our concern its own."
"Mr President, I think it would be useful if we concerned ourselves with the Caucasus, possibly with permanent observers and little rhetoric."
"This historical moment is pushing us towards regional cooperation even in destabilised areas and towards perhaps unforeseen alliances in the interests of greater stability."
"If I wished to make a point about the resolution, it would be this: the three countries - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia - perhaps should not always be treated like Siamese triplets: their recent histories differ, their problems differ and their efforts to build a genuinely democratic system differ."
"It would be unfair if any of the three had to wait until the others caught up in the democratisation process."
"In this context it would, of course, also be necessary to analyse what the West and the major countries have done in such regions and to analyse, for instance, whether the ethnic revolts in Georgia are local or led from outside, and if so by whom."
"I would then like to know why we hear so little about the Minsk Group, founded to seek a compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"Is it still meeting?"
"Even that is not clear."
"The European Union should develop a political role that is more obviously adventurous and daring in the region, as the document states - this is the main message - beyond the conference of the three Southern Caucasus states and the European Union."
"Given the situation, however, a discrete presence of Russia and America might be considered somewhat useful for a proper balance."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, how far is the European Union going to let the situation in the countries in the Southern Caucasus deteriorate before it finally decides to fully commit itself to the region, in keeping with local and regional expectations?"
"Europe needs to provide enough funds to support its policies, and that is far from being the case for the Caucasian regions."
"A few months ago in this House, members of the delegation for relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia urged the European Union to become involved and to commit to a firm and determined policy for the region, where geo-strategic interests are at stake that are both significant and varied."
"We cannot continue to say one thing and mean another."
"Our commitments need to be followed by specific actions."
"Implementing a Commission delegation in each of the countries would send out a strong political signal."
"It would be irresponsible to make these countries, who are struggling to affirm their identity, complete their transition process and establish a real democracy, believe that they can count on the political support of the European Union when the reality is that nothing is actually taking place and secretly it is only the oil and gas in the Caspian sea that are of interest."
"That would be unacceptable."
"Although the Swedish presidency took an initial step by visiting the countries concerned, what has actually been achieved?"
"And has the report by Mr Gahrton, not been put back to a later date in the schedule?"
"Moreover, as my fellow Members have said, this is a matter of urgency: does the OSCE not describe the situation as a state of no war?"
"Let us not forget the powder keg of the impassioned claims on Nagorno Karabakh and the desire for independence of some regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
"Yes, Mr President, yes Commissioner, the European Union has an essential role to play in this region."
"It should take the initiative of a Europe/Caucasus conference with the various States in order to establish, through a non-violent solution to the conflicts, lasting peace and sustainable development."
"Mr President, we pointed out years ago that the Caucasus and Central Asia threatened to become the Balkans of the future."
"Hardly anyone has shown any interest in this region; among the heads of government, only the Pope seems to have shown any concern, and what the Pope is among the heads of state, Ursula Schleicher is here in the European Parliament. She has shown exemplary commitment to this often forgotten region."
"My fear is that the events of 11 September will be misused in order to create new spheres of influence, with entire nations and ethnic problems being forgotten or sacrificed to energy supply interests."
"After President Putin's speech in the Reichstag, many people have forgotten that he was the person who reignited the war in Chechnya, and that as the head of the secret service under Mr Yeltsin, he incited and manipulated the conflicts in Migrelia and Nagorno-Karabakh."
"This is why these European regions are entitled to our solidarity, and we must ensure that we have a presence there."
"I therefore appeal to you, Commissioner, to put President Putin's words to the test."
"If he is genuinely interested in improving the situation, tell him you are going to Chechnya, that you want to test the water for more openness and a greater presence for the European Union."
"As regards the three states of the Southern Caucasus, we need Commission delegations at last, not only in Georgia but also in the other two states."
"This is a region which affects Europe's vital interests, not only in strategic and energy supply terms, but also as regards human rights and our cultural links with this region."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 6.30 p.m."
"Political situation in Myanmar (Burma)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0622/2001 by Mr Maaten, on behalf of the ELDR Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;"
"B5-0639/2001 by Mrs Muscardini, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the political situation in Burma;"
"B5-0650/2001 by Mrs Kinnock and others, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;"
"B5-0656/2001 by Mr Vinci and others, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, on the situation in Burma;"
"B5-0657/2001 by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Lucas, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the situation in Myanmar/Burma;"
"B5-0664/2001 by Mrs Maij-Weggen and Mr Van Orden, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the political situation in Myanmar/Burma."
"Mr President, Commissioner, for ten years, a whole world of citizens, politicians and journalists have taken an active interest in, and been horrified by, the fate of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Despite the enormous support she enjoys among the Burmese people and the crushing victory she and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won in 1990, she has not been able to take on her leadership role formally."
"On various occasions, she has been kept isolated, and now she has been under house arrest for a whole year."
"The Nobel Peace Prize and our own Sacharov Prize have drawn attention to her and to her courageous struggle, but they appear not to have swayed the Burmese junta."
"The general human rights situation in Burma is alarming."
"Representatives of political parties are kept in isolation, thousands of people are in jail for political reasons, dissidents are persecuted and religious and ethnic minorities harassed."
"Forced labour and torture are commonplace."
"According to Amnesty, there are around 2 000 political prisoners, including journalists and several elected parliamentarians."
"The EU Troika and UN observers now confirm that there are some signs of change."
"Several prisoners have been released, attitudes towards the NLD have softened and several party offices have been allowed to open."
"From a situation in which there was a total refusal to engage in dialogue, discussions have now taken place, and a process of reconciliation may be underway."
"It would be very welcome in a country which, for so many years, has been governed by one of the world' s toughest military juntas."
"It may be the case that a window of opportunity has now been opened."
"In anticipation of further signs and surer indications that the junta really would like to enter into dialogue and accept the demands of the NLD, the EU should not however relinquish its common policy."
"When the Council meets at the end of this month to discuss Burma, it is important to keep the sanctions in place for the time being and to keep the pressure up so that the dialogue continues, genuine steps towards democracy are taken, human rights are respected and, especially, Aung San Suu Kyi is released and allowed to take her place as the elected leader of the Burmese people."
"Mr President, the situation in Burma is disastrous."
"Hundreds of thousands of people are living, without any real humanitarian aid, packed into refugee camps in Thailand, China and Bangladesh."
"Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced into labour or displaced against their will."
"The political system is corrupt and repressive."
"The democratic opposition has been suppressed since it was elected on 27 May 1990, and more than 2000 people are in prison."
"Amnesty International condemns the institutionalised torture that takes place in these countries."
"All these human rights violations are crimes against humanity that need to be stopped and denounced in order to be definitively condemned."
"Who finances this regime besides the revenue obtained from the illegal sale of drugs?"
"Well, there is TotalFinaElf, also present in Angola, Congo, Chad and Cameroon, and additionally found to be connected with the sinking of the Erika and in the accident in Toulouse."
"I think that this company, and this regime, should be boycotted."
"More than ever we need to support Burma' s democrats."
"The European Union should affirm that Aung San Suu Kyi is the only real chance for Burma and must take every possible measure as quickly as is possible to move this military dictatorship towards democratic transition."
"Mr President, I believe that this is the sixth resolution on the situation in Burma that we have introduced along with fellow MEPs."
"It is now more than 10 years since Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi won the election there by a large margin. The country was subsequently taken over by a military dictatorship."
"It is also more than 10 years since the elected parliament was dissolved and many of the members of parliament were murdered, went missing or fled."
"Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned and then placed under house arrest. Her house arrest continues to this day."
"The repression continued even after she had won the Nobel Peace Prize for her peaceful resistance and was subsequently awarded the Sakharov Prize by our Parliament."
"This same repression was also unleashed on the population, and in particular on a number of minority groups, with unprecedented viciousness."
"Many people fled, with the result that there are many refugees in neighbouring countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Bangladesh and India."
"However, there now seems to be some light at the end of the tunnel."
"A number of political prisoners have been released and talks have been going on between the junta and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Nobody knows what the outcome will be, however, and on that point I would like to warn the European Commission against making any premature concessions to the Burmese military government until it is clear that they are genuinely willing to release all political prisoners. Or that they are genuinely willing to stop repressing minority groups."
"In December, it will have been 10 years since Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize."
"If there are still no positive developments by then, the European Union will have to step up its measures and put a freeze on investments, for example, just as the United States has done."
"We call on the Commission and Council to exert more pressure so that democracy can finally be restored in Burma and Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi can take her rightful place."
"Mr President, anyone who knows this paradise in South-East Asia as I do, having visited it several times in the last fifteen years, is bound to be appalled by the chronic supply shortages, the catastrophic infrastructural situation and the brutality of this highly repressive regime."
"Yet political systems like the regime in Burma/Myanmar only survive if there are enough states and private companies prepared to keep them alive through economic links."
"If we want to change the political system, we must also exert appropriate economic pressure."
"The double standards involved in calling for democracy while engaging in intensive trade with this country really should stop."
"However, this means that pressure must be brought to bear on those who single-mindedly continue to cultivate their economic links with the military regime with utter disregard for the need for democratisation."
"Mr President, like the honourable Members of Parliament the Commission welcomes what could be called the positive developments that have occurred in Burma/Myanmar, in particular the on-going talks between Aung San Suu Kyi and the ruling SPDC, the release of a growing number of political prisoners and the reopening of 20 party offices of the National League for Democracy."
"This said, it has to be acknowledged that the improvement in the political climate in the last year is clearly only the beginning of a process which now should be further deepened."
"Thus, we still need to see a clear move towards a process of constructive dialogue and achieving respect for internationally accepted standards of human rights."
"We have no guarantee of irreversibility in this respect, so we have to be cautious and we have carefully noted the advice given by Members in this debate."
"We should encourage the government to continue this progress by fully responding to the concerns of the international community, as articulated by the United Nations Special Envoy, Mr Razali."
"At this stage, it is very important to strike a careful balance between recognising the progress achieved so far and maintaining a firm pressure for continued efforts, which can pave the way for democratic reforms."
"I am convinced that Members share the Commission's hope that the on-going talks will lead to concrete results, which could enable the European Union to consider positive measures to support the process."
"As regards the situation of the ethnic minorities, the Commission shares the concerns voiced by Members and remains convinced that a lasting political solution in Burma/Myanmar must be based on agreement between the SPDC, the democratically elected ""opposition"" and representatives of ethnic minorities."
"All EC humanitarian aid to Burma/Myanmar is provided through NGOs or international agencies."
"The Commission is currently exploring the possibilities of increasing humanitarian aid to Burma in full compliance with the terms of the EU's Common Position on Burma/Myanmar."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m."
"Patenting of human genes"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B5-0633/2001 by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten and others, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer);"
"B5-0641/2001 by Mr Ribeiro e Castro, on behalf of the UEN Group, on the human gene register BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer);"
"B5-0651/2001 by Mr Gebhardt and Mr Paciotti, on behalf of the PSE Group, on the human gene register;"
"B5-0663/2001 by Mr Lannoye and others, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, on the human gene register;"
"Mr President, I regret that I must remain seated."
"On 30 March last year, Parliament declared that people and their genes or cells in a natural environment cannot be patented."
"However, if a patent is granted to Myriad Genetics, this will create a monopoly situation for one particular company."
"This means that there is a danger that certain genetic tests and some of the DNA diagnostic tests in Europe will be commercialised."
"Three applications for patents on sequences and applications of a breast cancer gene have now been accepted by the European Patent Office."
"Applications from Myriad for patents on the BRCA2 gene are still being processed."
"If these patents are awarded, this US company will have a monopoly on the BRCA gene and consequently on the DNA test."
"This means that abnormalities in patients from families with a history of breast cancer and ovarian cancer will only be able to be detected with this American test."
"If Myriad is going to use a similar system in Europe to the one it uses in the United States, the samples from all future laboratory tests will have to be sent to the United States, which will also be very expensive if the analyses have to be done there."
"This means that there is a danger that a monopoly may be created, which will put the quality of European diagnostics at risk."
"It also means that the availability of data for analysis purposes and the development of new diagnostic applications in our own molecular and testing laboratories will be limited, which will push up the cost of breast cancer screening and therefore of health insurance."
"Not only Parliament but also everyone in society who is involved in this has registered objections in this regard."
"We therefore ask for this monopoly position, which is in nobody's interest, to be opposed and the patent application to be rejected."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it will not only horrify a great many women to see that a US company, through the patenting process, has effectively acquired ownership of 'breast cancer genes'."
"The fact that in the race for money and profit, a great many people's health is put at risk is enough to make anyone's blood run cold."
"Yet this is exactly what threatens to occur following the award of patents on the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes."
"As a worst-case scenario, many patients may face delays in the early detection of breast cancer as a result of these patent awards."
"Yet with this type of cancer in particular, early detection is crucial to increase the chances of recovery."
"Furthermore, the virtual monopoly on test methods pushes costs so high that early detection of breast cancer is no longer available to many women."
"Nor should we ignore the extent to which the BRCA patents are impeding research in Europe."
"One of the leading cancer research institutes - the Institut Curie in Paris - has highlighted this situation and provided impressive and conclusive proof."
"It is very welcome that this prestigious research institute has taken action and, with the support of the French Ministry of Health, is initiating an opposition procedure to the patent award."
"This House will certainly not be making a mistake if it supports this position."
"A welcome step would be to call upon the responsible agencies to lodge immediate appeals against the award of the BRCA patents with the European Patent Office in Munich."
"It is also important that we should appeal to the institutions and governments of the EU Member States to lodge similar appeals as a matter of urgency."
"We owe this to the women affected."
"This is the least we can do for them at this point."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, next Tuesday, in response to an application by the Netherlands which is supported by Italy and Norway, the ECJ will decide on the Patent Directive's compatibility with the Treaty."
"Today, the European Parliament, through its vote, will decide between the reality and the Directive."
"The BRCA patents in particular make it clear that the price of medicines is being increased unnecessarily and that monopolies are being created which impede effective diagnosis and therapy and block research into new and useful drugs."
"The time has come for the Commission - and I call upon the Commissioner present to make a statement on this issue - to put an end to the conflicts surrounding the interpretation of this Directive, either by amending the Directive or adopting guidelines."
"In my view, the Commission should not bury its head in the sand and say, well, we know that many Member States have problems with this Directive because they do not know how to apply it; we know that the European Patent Office interprets it in a particular way."
"I therefore urge you to make a statement on this issue."
"The human body must not be degraded to biological material."
"Human genes or living organisms or elements thereof must not be subject to patent law."
"A discovery must not be recast as an invention."
"We must prevent monopolies on human genes impeding research into new and useful drugs."
"We cannot stand and watch the early detection of breast cancer falling by the wayside simply because patent rights are to be created for something which is not an invention but, at the very most, a discovery."
"Action is required not only by the European Parliament - we have, I believe, made it quite clear with this resolution that we are not prepared to stand and watch - but also by the Commission and the Member States."
"Mr President, I shall not speak about the subject but on the institutional issues."
"This House has already rejected the option of - or, at least, it has refrained from - lodging an appeal with the European Patent Office."
"That is only right and proper."
"The European Parliament is a legislative body, and as a legislative body, it cannot intervene in current proceedings."
"That is simply not possible!"
"This is one of the fundamental principles of a democracy under the rule of law."
"The legislator passes a law - in this case, the Directive - which will be confirmed next week by the European Court of Justice."
"Then it will be down to the authorities to apply the Directive and award a patent or not, and the courts will have to decide whether this award or refusal of a patent is lawful."
"That is the due process, and no other process exists in a democracy under the rule of law."
"That is why the legislator - in this case, the European Parliament - cannot intervene in current proceedings."
"The European Parliament has about as much responsibility for this issue as the Commission, or the Green Party congress or a general meeting of Greenpeace."
"It is not for the Commission, or this House, or the Greens, or Greenpeace to decide how a Directive should be applied; that is the task of the relevant authorities."
"They - and the courts - decide on this issue, nobody else!"
"And that is how it should be."
"Other than that, Ms Breyer, almost everything you said was factually incorrect."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is against the patenting of human genes as such, something we also stated in 1998 when Parliament adopted the Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions."
"However, we believe that the directive does not allow patents for genes as such, if they do not contain an invention, and we supported the directive when it was adopted."
"We believe that the fact that, in a debate on topical and urgent subjects, we are now discussing a resolution on certain patents constitutes an abuse."
"We have therefore not signed the common resolution."
"Although we have a Temporary Committee on Human Genetics, where the question of patents constitutes one of the most important issues, the issue of patents is being brought up here so that a general position might be adopted on the matter, and I would like to repeat that this is very wrong."
"We really believe that this is an abuse."
"There have been no formal opportunities to raise objections, but we believe that Parliament' s rules should be changed."
"The fact that just a few people are to discuss the issue quickly here is therefore very wrong."
"We also believe that the draft resolution is not entirely correct."
"The patent applications which exist, and I have a summary of them here, expressly state that they apply to methods and not to genes as such."
"You are attempting to give the impression that the European Patent Office is now about to approve patents on human genes, and this is not the case."
"However, there is one point on which we can agree with those who drew up the proposal, and that is that in certain respects the patents are two 'broad' ."
"This means that we should review issues such as compulsory licences with an eye to research and public health."
"Unfortunately, this is not something that can be dealt with at Community level, but is the responsibility of the Member States."
"I hope that we can discuss the issue of licences in peace and quiet in the Committee on Human Genetics."
"We shall not be able to support the resolution."
"Mr President, while Mrs Thors was speaking the Commissioner was interrupted by two different people, so he was not paying attention to what she asked and what she said."
"It was vitally important to me, as someone trying to learn from this debate, to ascertain the facts of the situation."
"I was very interested in what Mr Rothley and Mrs Thors said as to whether we should even be discussing this issue in this Chamber."
"But Mr Nielson was otherwise distracted."
"I would hope that he gives us a proper response when his turn comes to speak."
"Thank you very much, Mr Purvis. The issue of whether or not Mr Nielson was distracted is something we will be able to decide on at the end of the debate."
"Mr President, the previous speaker made a comment."
"I think that Mr Rothley attacked me personally."
"I would like to make it clear once again that the European Patent Office does not have a court."
"It has a Board of Appeal."
"That is a significant difference."
"I say this so that our colleague is properly informed."
"It is quite clear that the patent refers to genes - indeed, to mutated genes - and to the analysis procedure, for the sake of accuracy."
"I would recommend that any Members of this House who are interested should visit the website of the Institut Curie in France - the prestigious research institute which has initiated an opposition procedure - as this describes the situation in detail."
"It is indeed a fact that only an invention may be patented, not a discovery."
"On Ms Thors' objection regarding the urgency: the deadline set for instituting proceedings against the first patent expires on Tuesday."
"This means that we cannot wait for the Fiori report, which will not be discussed until the October II part-session."
"What Mr Rothley says is also incorrect."
"We are indeed a legislative body, but his own Minister of Justice in Germany, Ms Däubler-Gmelin, once applied this procedure."
"Even the Federal Government once appealed against a patent which had been awarded by the Patent Office in 1999."
"Mr President, I will not go into the content again; I would just like to correct a statement which was made in error."
"I spoke for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and what I said applies to our group."
"I just wanted to clarify that point."
"The problem raised by the patents granted by the European Patent Office to Myriad Genetics does not appear to derive from the field of ethics."
"These patents highlight a technical question deriving from the field of patent law."
"The situation is thus completely different from that raised by the famous ""Edinburgh patent""."
"The problem resides more in the extent of the protection to be granted to these patents."
"This question is highly complex since, as it applies to gene sequences, it undoubtedly involves a situation relating to competition and innovation, and in no way fundamental principles relating to the dignity or integrity of human beings."
"It should be noted that this patent is of undoubted interest for the scientific community."
"It should make it possible to improve the early detection of breast cancer in women."
"The Commission considers there are no imperative reasons why the Commission should raise any objections, as the contested patent does not infringe essential ethical rules and concerns the field of application which can be granted to a patent relating to a DNA sequence."
"Nevertheless, the Commission will study the question of the field of protection for inventions relating to gene sequences in depth and will communicate its observations to the Council and Parliament in the reports provided for by Directive 98/44."
"I am utterly amazed that the Commission is not responding. Number one."
"Secondly, I would ask the Commission whether it is in fact willing to do anything before 10 October."
"When I say a gene, I mean a gene sequence. According to the patent directive, a gene sequence cannot be patented."
"Mr President, I vigorously endorse what Ms Oomen-Ruijten has said."
"Commissioner, you cannot take an infinite amount of time over this."
"I too expect that the Commission will state its position on this issue by 9 October."
"You said that there are no objections of an ethical nature, but that you will study the question of the field of protection for inventions."
"However, you have not answered the question put to you by myself, Mr Blokland, and others on whether Article 5.1 now applies in this context or whether Article 5.2 should take priority."
"I believe that many Members of this House expect the Commission to clarify this serious and very important issue."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Breyer."
"I would ask you to exercise a little discipline, because otherwise we will never finish this debate and we still have the voting time at 6.30 p.m. and two further reports to get through."
"Mr President, naturally, I am referring to the procedure."
"I would like to thank the Commission for the explanation."
"I fully endorse its position. Please be assured that the Commission has the support of a large majority of Members of this House."
"Mr President, this is a very serious matter."
"I call upon the Commission to study very carefully whether these patents which have been awarded genuinely comply with the Patent Directive, and not to act as if this House had no role in this area and were not entitled to adopt decisions."
"I hope that you will take serious steps to comply with the decisions which are about to be adopted by this House."
"I will put your objections to my colleagues."
"I also want to point out that what I have said reflects the way the Commission services, and the Commission as such, analyse this issue."
"I will repeat what I just said: ""the Commission considers there are no imperative reasons why it should raise any objections, as the contested patent does not infringe essential ethical rules and concerns the field of application which can be granted to a patent relating to a DNA sequence""."
"Obviously there is, and may continue to be, disagreement."
"This is the reality in an area like this, and ten years of discussions leading up to the 1998 directive may not be enough to create a real, workable agreement."
"However, this is the legislation we have as our basis for action."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 6.00 p.m."
"Community guarantee for EIB loans to former Yugoslavia"
"The next item is the report (A5-0300/2001) by Mr Seppänen, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [COM(2001) 356 - C5-0335/2001 - 2001/0143(CNS)]."
"Mr President, the European Union has a cheap way of helping other countries: it guarantees credit granted by the European Investment Bank to these other countries."
"In practice such aid has not cost the EU anything in recent years."
"The recipients of loans have benefited from the guarantees as they have been granted loans at interest rates which are easier to bear than those that are granted on the basis of the much tougher market conditions."
"This cheap and effective method of assistance is regulated in the EU and there is a maximum amount for guaranteed loans, which is divided into regional envelopes."
"The Commission proposal now being discussed is to increase the envelope for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, out of which the EIB can grant loans of up to EUR 8 930 million covered by an EU guarantee."
"In order to be able to provide financial support for the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia, it is desirable that that country be included among the recipients of loan guarantees."
"With that purpose in mind, it is being proposed that the Central and Eastern Europe loan envelope be increased by EUR 350 million."
"This amount is not being earmarked for former Yugoslavia' s use alone, but, after the increase, it will be able to receive loans out of this envelope of loans if it can show the EIB valid projects for its use."
"It is being proposed to grant loans to former Yugoslavia covered by a 65% guarantee."
"That is the condition of the guarantee generally in use and the EU has incurred no liability in respect of guarantees in recent years for loans granted in accordance with this condition."
"For the increase in the Yugoslavian envelope to take place there will have to be a transfer of funds from the EU budget reserves to the Guarantee Fund, although the increase in the envelope cannot be implemented in full during the current year."
"So the transfers will also have to be made over the next two years as former Yugoslavia finds suitable construction projects."
"In my capacity as permanent rapporteur for these matters I would, in this connection, like to express my concern that next year the Guarantee Fund will have no margin whatsoever for new and unexpected aid actions."
"Next year will be extremely problematic in that sense and the Commission must focus its attention on the problem of the overuse of the Guarantee Fund accordingly."
"The situation is further worsened by the Commission' s proposal for deliberation by Parliament regarding loans granted to Russia by the EIB in respect of environmental protection investments in the Baltic Sea basin."
"Quite incomprehensibly, the Council has demanded that a 100% guarantee be granted to cover these loans, in place of the normal 65%."
"The Council' s decision shows that there are Member States that want to hamper environmental cooperation with Russia."
"The way in which some Member States are acting in this connection is a display of ignorance of how the system works."
"Russia will indeed get its loan, but another country will not, as a 100% guarantee needlessly eats into the margin in the Guarantee Fund set aside for others."
"Increasing the envelope for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the needs of reconstruction in Yugoslavia is justified and there is no need to table amendments to the Commission' s proposal."
"I would like to express my appreciation to Parliament for the timely preparation of its opinion on this proposal."
"This proposal is an integral element of the European Union's support to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"It aims to assist the country's political and economic reform programme."
"I am glad to note that the rapporteur fully agrees with this view."
"The proposal enables the EIB to finance, under Community guarantee, basic investments in the transport and energy sectors, investments much needed to rehabilitate infrastructure damaged by the recent conflicts and by lack of maintenance in the past decade."
"The proposed increase of the lending mandate and the CEEC envelope by EUR 350 m is in line with the foreseen amount of EIB lending to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"The final amount of loans to the country will depend on its absorption potential and on the availability of suitable projects, and could exceed EUR 350 m."
"I say this in response to the rapporteur's warning about the risk of the overuse of funds."
"The possibility of hitting or moving the ceiling is there, but it very much depends on the emergence of suitable projects."
"I can confirm that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has agreed to assume responsibility for its share of the outstanding financial obligations of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
"We have been informed that an agreement between the EIB and the FRY to that effect was approved by the Yugoslavian Parliament last week."
"With the entry into force of that decision - foreseen at the end of this week - I am glad to say that a remaining obstacle to the proposal will be removed."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m."
"Association of overseas countries and territories with the EC"
"The next item is the report (A5-0276/2001) by Mr Fruteau, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the proposal for a Council decision on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community ( 'Overseas' ) ( [COM(2000) 732 - C5-0070/2001 - 2001/2033(COS)]."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when I was elected to the European Parliament, it was with a clear mandate, not only to represent Réunion, the island where I come from, or even the outermost regions, but also to try to make the voice of all of the French overseas territories heard."
"This is why I am glad that Parliament charged me with being its spokesperson on the statute of association between the overseas countries and territories, the OCTs, and the European Union."
"I would also like to commend the spirit of openness that prevailed when this report was being drawn up."
"Allow me first to venture a historical and political look at the relations that some Member States have had with their former colonies, relations that have been marked, in my opinion, by the bond of exclusivity and by supervision, which are pillars of the colonial pact."
"We should now break with the past and with the feeling of guilt that goes with it, in order to define a true responsible and equal partnership between the overseas countries and territories, the attached Member States and the European Union."
"This is the path that we should resolutely take, in order for this new decision of association to be the real qualitative leap expected by all of the overseas countries and territories."
"This challenge is, however, made difficult by the lack of homogeneity among the OCTs and by the structural handicaps that are physically curbing their development: about twenty countries linked with four Member States - The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and France -, mostly small and island countries, with the notable exception of Greenland, very remote from the European continent, characterised by an extreme economic and social diversity (the richest are within the Community average, while the poorest are really under-developed), and also by diversity of status in terms of the relations that the overseas countries and territories have forged during their history with their mainland, relations characterised by considerable independence for some and major State supervision for others."
"It has to be said that the Commission' s proposal, as it has been put forward, only partly responds to this challenge and to the legitimate aspirations of these territories found in all four corners of the globe."
"There are still acute questions in terms of the institutional, economic, financial and commercial problems."
"First of all from an institutional point of view, I would like to welcome the establishment of a forum to facilitate partnership between the OCTs, the Member States and the Commission, although it is regrettable that decision making is not more in the hands of the leaders of the overseas countries and territories."
"Next, from an economic and financial point of view, the Commission has indeed retained a differentiated strategy, taking into account the extreme diversity among the overseas countries and territories, but I deplore the fact that the amount of aid is essentially fixed based on GNP per inhabitant."
"I think it would have been more appropriate to add demographic and social criteria to this, which are a fairer reflection of the vulnerability of these territories."
"I will take this opportunity to call again for the creation of a specific development fund for the overseas countries and territories, separate from the European development fund, which I am convinced would be more in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the association."
"Finally, from a commercial point of view, I must stress here that the share of overseas countries and territories in trade with the Community is very low, which makes it difficult to understand the Commission' s defensive position."
"It is true that it is essential that in certain cases, such as that of sugar, it should be extremely vigilant in order to prevent the original rules, which are necessary for the development of all of the overseas countries and territories, from being abused, with the effect of destabilising some European markets, particularly in outermost regions."
"However, not only out of a concern for coherence, at a time when the Union is completely opening up its markets to the least advanced countries, but also in view of the common history of the OCTs and the European Union, we do not understand why it is refusing them what it is granting to the least advanced countries."
"Community solidarity cannot be two-speed."
"It is thus high time that we showed effectively that the overseas countries and territories are not the poor relations of our development policy."
"In other words, it is high time that we proved tangibly to these people that they are right in believing in the European Union."
"This is why, to finish, I wish to reiterate the desire that I state several times in my report, that the tenth anniversary of the statute of association should be an opportunity for reaffirming the strong political will towards these territories, that have for too long been left to be blown by the wind, across all the oceans of the world, in order to firmly and resolutely undertake the path of partnership and responsibility, in other words the path of development for all."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to state that I am speaking on behalf of my Mr Fernández Martín, who is not able to attend."
"I would like to make clear that among the wide range of regional associations or groups of countries with which the European Union maintains relations, the group of overseas countries and territories, the PTOMs to use the French term, is certainly the most heterogeneous of all."
"In actual fact, they are grouped together more for what they are not than for what they are."
"Hence the special merit offered, in my opinion, by the proposed Council Decision and the report which Mr Fruteau has produced in relation to it."
"Generally speaking, I agree with the rapporteur' s proposals, although I would certainly express some of them somewhat differently."
"However, I would like to announce that my group will vote in favour of them."
"The rapporteur proposes a series of measures which attempt to strengthen the association system which has linked the PTOMs to the Union since 1991, by stating that on this tenth anniversary of the said agreement, the Union should be more ambitious with regard to the most distant territories of the continent."
"I must point out that the PTOMs as a whole, and each one of them in particular, do not form part of the territory of the Union."
"Their inhabitants have European citizenship (French, British, Dutch or Danish, as the case may be) but the territories in which they live do not form part of the European Union itself - in the case of Greenland, for example, its citizens voted in a referendum to leave what we then called the European Communities; in the case of New Caledonia, in accordance with a plan drawn up with the French authorities, they have also begun a procedure which will lead them, in a few years' time, to join the group of ACP countries."
"And I could cite in this way further examples of specific cases, almost as many as there are PTOM countries and territories."
"This heterogeneity is evident in many other respects and the most noteworthy of these is their sparse and irregularly distributed population."
"As the rapporteur rightly stresses, the population of the twenty overseas territories hardly exceeds one million inhabitants and three of them, the Dutch Antilles, French Polynesia and New Caledonia, have more than 150 000 inhabitants each, so these three territories alone account for almost half of the total population."
"Therefore, when almost three years ago we discussed the report produced at the time by our colleague Blaise Aldo, we wanted to place special emphasis on the development of the PTOMs' trade relations with the ACP countries close to them and in some cases, such as that of the Caribbean, with equally close outermost regions."
"However, INTERREG did not meet the expectations raised as a basis for developing these trading relations."
"Perhaps this could be attempted again now with INTERREG III, and I agree with the rapporteur that the development of the PTOMs should be promoted through a specific fund to simplify the procedures for linking it to the EDF or to Cotonou - although I know that the Commission has its own opinion in this respect."
"In conclusion, I request an oral amendment which I hope can be accepted."
"In the first paragraph of the explanatory statement the rapporteur expressly mentions the seven outermost regions of the European Union, stating that they opted for full integration into the respective Member States, former colonial powers."
"That is not correct."
"The Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands did not have any colonial status at any time in their history, which is why they should be expressly excluded from this statement by the rapporteur, and I hope that the House and the rapporteur himself can accept this request."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to express my great satisfaction at being able to speak for the first time in this House on the issue of the Overseas Countries and Territories."
"These twenty territories benefit from a particular association arrangement with the European Union, which, when described in simple terms, is less favourable than the status reserved for the outermost regions, which are integral parts of the Union, but more advantageous than the agreements made with third countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"As a French overseas member of this Parliament my attention is naturally drawn to the fate of the French territories and administrative authorities concerned, which are, and I am pleased to list them here, New Caledonia, French Polynesia, the French Southern and Antarctic Territories, Wallis and Futuna, Mayotte and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon."
"In his excellent report, Mr Fruteau welcomes the progress in relations between the European Union and the OCTs from an institutional, economic and financial point of view, even though there remain many questions on the Commission' s proposals having to respond to the objectives included in declaration 36 with regard to the OCTs annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"With regard to trade relations, the rapporteur emphasises the low level of trade with the Union."
"In 1998, imports from OCTs amounted to 0.21 % of Community imports, with exports to OCTs amounting to 0.43 % of Community exports as a whole."
"A liberalisation of trade with OCTs could fulfil the objectives we have set ourselves."
"We should be particularly careful, however, that this liberalisation does not result in some kind of diversion from our current objectives."
"For several years, imports have been increasing from a particular OCT (which happens to be Aruba but this is not the time to hold it up as an example), which runs counter to the spirit of this association agreement with the European Union."
"These products exported to the Union do not come from the OCT, but are imported there from ACP countries for minor processing such as the whitening of rice, sifting, packaging or mixing."
"These simple operations only require very low levels of investment, and are therefore in no way a development factor as the Court of Justice in Luxembourg highlighted in its ruling on the ""Emesa sugar"" case in 1998, as the only interest is providing easy added value for international operators."
"The increase in this type of inefficiency is all the more intolerable given that it goes against the interests of the other OCTs, the outermost regions and the ACP countries."
"In this context, without questioning the objectives proposed by the rapporteur, which I willingly support, it is essential that we establish strict original rules to prevent these breaches , which are detrimental to the economies of all overseas territories."
"In this respect, the measures for prohibiting cumulation of origin for certain products, increasing the list of inadequate processes or the systematic implementation of safeguard clauses in no way provide a suitable response to this problem."
"I wish to begin by saying that I totally support Mrs Sudre's remarks."
"The Commission is always asked to ensure that there is coherence in what we do and we have a strong case of lack of coherence when we look at the trade practices that are at the heart of this debate."
"We have had good reason to do what we have done and I definitely hope that some constructive conclusion that ends this traffic will be part of the final solution for the whole matter."
"Let me also congratulate the Committee on Development and Cooperation and the rapporteur for a clear and generally balanced analysis of this whole matter, although I need to make some remarks."
"The Commission proposal is based on the widest consultation of the parties concerned ever made in this field."
"Thus, it is not surprising that some of the indications we have received as part of this wide consultation process point in different, even conflicting, directions."
"Inevitably, some delicate compromises have had to be struck, for example in the trade sector."
"However, we have kept to the objective of giving an adequate and ambitious response to the expectations of the OCTs and to the challenges facing them."
"The motion before you today gives a positive assessment of several innovations we have proposed, such as the reinforced partnership procedure, the simplified financial regulations and the new role of civil society."
"In my view, other points also deserve to be mentioned, for example the extension of many budget lines, Community programmes and provisions on trade in services to the OCTs."
"There is a tendency to neglect the importance, the scope and the opportunities for the OCTs to be able to access as users Community programmes in general."
"This is new and should be highlighted."
"I have remarks to make concerning two chapters of the proposal - financial aid and trade."
"As to the European Development Fund, it is correct that, in respect of the past, financial aid will no longer be given to three OCTs - Aruba, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands - because their GNP is now near or even higher than in the Community."
"It is important that all Members of Parliament are made aware of this."
"We have to get out of the habit of having OCT issues being discussed only in the few Member States that have a direct part in the discussion."
"In the past, it has looked a little too much like a self-service shop."
"We are talking about Community matters and they should be discussed at that level."
"For all the other OCTs, in the future funds will be granted following more objective, transparent and coherent criteria."
"Income, GNP, has to be one of them, along with population, as we want to ensure that the taxpayers' money is spent where it is most needed, and this means in the fight against poverty."
"This is the cornerstone of the EU development policy, and I want to stick to this - also in respect of the clear support for this development policy in this House."
"Transitional provisions have been proposed."
"Substantial funds are reserved for social and environmental projects in medium income OCTs."
"Secondly, money has to go where it is best used."
"This is why we have proposed to keep a reserve not only to cover emergency aid and the kinds of activities that cannot be programmed in advance, but also to grant additional transfers to those territories which use their initial amounts more efficiently."
"A real part of the story is that quite an impressive amount of money has not been well utilised."
"So this performance criterion is a necessary component and the reason we want to keep a reserve to solve this problem."
"The Commission is looking into absorption problems but I have the impression that more efforts should be made by the OCTs themselves to use funds efficiently."
"I regret - but I have to tell you - that certain Member States do not seem to share these priorities."
"Again this is a matter for the Community."
"We have to get out of the self-service syndrome."
"The reduction in Regional Funds is justified by the limited use made of them in the past."
"Should this situation change, I would be very pleased to reconsider this point."
"The Commission also wants to send a strong message to those OCTs defined as tax havens in the OECD analysis."
"Unless and until they redress their practices, their allocations will and should be cut back."
"Again let me remind Parliament of the strong emphasis placed on the need for coherence."
"Parliament's views on this matter have been made very clear to us."
"We happen to agree with them but we cannot say one thing in one document and then not apply it in an area like this."
"I share the view that different ways of financing OCT aid than the EDF could be considered."
"However, in practice this would only be possible when new budget guidelines are agreed in a few years' time."
"For the same reason, given the existing budgetary rules, the EDF is currently the only real possibility for financing partnership meetings and evaluation studies."
"But let me repeat that opening access to active involvement in Community programmes is an interesting additional way for the OCTs to benefit from our relationship."
"Let me turn to trade."
"For too many years now this has been a bone of contention between some OCTs and the Community."
"Unfortunately, excessive expectations in this field have been generated despite our advice."
"When the Community has been forced to take corrective measures those expectations have inevitably been disappointed."
"But part of the problem and the cases that have dominated this discussion were also the product of deliberate engineering of ways in which to use or misuse the existing system."
"We should not fool ourselves on this issue."
"So let me be very clear here."
"The Commission has always supported a liberal trade attitude toward our preferential partners, in particular developing countries."
"The recent initiative on ""Everything But Arms"" is just one latest example."
"The OCTs will continue to enjoy the most favourable trade arrangement granted by the Community."
"This is the current position and so it will remain."
"However, a line has to be drawn between supporting economic activities and tolerating purely speculative operations which have no development effects and, in addition, cost huge sums to the Community, be it the Community budget, consumers or productive sectors."
"In other cases, real abuses have been identified and stopped by our anti-fraud departments."
"It is only reasonable that when preparing new legislation we seek to eliminate the risk of this happening again."
"Once more, such misuse has not served in any way the best interests of OCT citizens and governments."
"Let me stress that the OCT association certainly includes the principle of preferential access to our market, but not an unconditional one."
"This is not only the view of the Commission, as the Council and the Court of Justice have consistently endorsed it."
"Coherence with the other Treaty policies and with the rule of the law must also be maintained."
"It is in the urgent interest of the OCTs that a favourable business climate is re-established as soon as possible."
"This has to be our main objective when formulating our proposals on trade."
"Finally, let me express the hope that very soon we can reach the end of this long phase of transition and uncertainty concerning the future regime."
"The Commission will, to this end, be available as a catalyst where needed to achieve a rapid conclusion in the Council to end the long saga of this renewal of the OCT regime."
"I definitely hope that Parliament is giving a helping hand by this work of the rapporteur."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 6.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 6.05 p.m. and resumed at 6.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, we have heard on the news that a Russian commercial airliner has crashed into the Black Sea."
"It is not clear whether it was an explosion or whether the aeroplane was accidentally shot down by the Ukrainian army."
"I think that before the start of this vote - regardless of what caused this tragic accident - we should briefly remember those who have lost their lives in this tragedy."
"If you would be so kind, ladies and gentlemen, we will now observe a minute' s silence for the victims."
"(Parliament observed a minute' s silence while remaining standing)"
"VOTE"
"Adjournment of the session"
"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was closed at 6.45 p.m.)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 4 October 2001."
"Announcement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as you will recall, on 8 October, 104 passengers and four employees of Linate airport were killed in a tragic accident involving a small private aircraft and an SAS aeroplane, which was due to fly from Milan to Copenhagen."
"Immediately after the disaster, I sent a message expressing my condolences to the President of the Italian Council and to the Danish Prime Minister."
"Since I was on an official visit to Denmark the day after the accident occurred, I also gave the same message in person to the various authorities that I met during my visit."
"I would, however, like to publicly demonstrate, once again, our solidarity and deep sympathy for the families of the victims."
"Agenda"
"Madam President, I am rapporteur for the subject of Macedonia which is on tomorrow' s agenda."
"However, the Commission has just informed us that this subject should be withdrawn."
"As rapporteur, and also on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I propose that, in accordance with Article 144 of the Rules of Procedure, we delete this subject from tomorrow' s agenda."
"The reason for this is that we have obtained information to the effect that the Commission wishes firstly to contribute more money by way of aid to Macedonia and secondly to extend the period of aid."
"I therefore propose that we withdraw the subject from this part-session and instead address it in the November part-session."
"We therefore refer the subject back to the Committee on Budgets and to the committees which are to issue opinions on this subject, that is to say the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy."
"Madam President, there is an urgent matter missing from the agenda to which I would briefly like to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Members."
"The German foundation 'Memory, Responsibility and Future' , established by the German government and national enterprises, has taken the surprising, disturbing decision not to count Italian prisoners of war or even a large percentage of Italian civilian forced labourers among the former forced labourers in Germany, providing compensation only for civilians who were interned in actual concentration camps."
"This exclusion is unjustified from a legal point of view and would hinder the deep reconciliation between the European peoples who were divided by the tragic experiences of the Second World War."
"I feel that action needs to be taken to prevent this great discrimination in the German compensation against Italian prisoners of war and Italian civilian forced labourers."
"Thank you, Mr Borghezio."
"We shall of course take note of what you have said."
"Madam President, this morning, when I got up, I found that I had lost my voice."
"I have lost my voice and so I do not know whether I will be able to deliver my usual explanations of vote tomorrow."
"That aside, I am here beside my friend, Mr Borghezio, not because I have changed group but because I support his proposal regarding the failure to provide compensation for Italian former prisoners of war and Italian civilian forced labourers."
"These are all people who are over 75 years of age, and therefore pensioners, who have been left by the Italian government without a pension."
"Therefore, the damages suffered by these Italian citizens, who, like many of us, have suffered the outrages of war, are even greater because, in addition to not receiving this compensation, they are pensioners who do not receive a pension."
"Madam President, given the degree to which the media has had access to an unpublished report commissioned by the EU's Scientific and Technological Option Assessment Committee, STOA, entitled ""The Possible Toxic Effects from Nuclear Reprocessing Plants at Sellafield and Cap de la Hague"", could you immediately organise for the publication of this report to ensure a balanced and informed comment by all, especially by us in this Parliament of democratically elected representatives?"
"I am strongly of the view that all reports by committees of this House, whatever their status, should at least be available to Members of this House before they are available to those outside."
"Please arrange for that report's immediate publication."
"Mrs Doyle, I shall give your request my full consideration."
"Madam President, as president of STOA, may I point out that the study to which the honourable Mr Doyle refers has not yet been officially adopted by STOA's plenary."
"It is on the agenda for the next meeting here in Strasbourg."
"As you know, this study examined numerous aspects and independent experts were also asked for their opinion, because we want to ensure that the study is reliable and that STOA is reliable."
"Once STOA's plenary has reached a decision, we shall pass it on so that we can take what I imagine will be the right decision on such an important matter."
"Madam President, in the absence of our chairman, as vice-chairman of the Committee on Petitions I would point out that our committee requested the report from STOA on the possible toxic effects of Sellafield in the Irish Sea and Cap de la Hague in the English Channel."
"The Petitions Committee is as anxious as anybody that this report should be published as soon as possible."
"It is important that the report, when adopted by STOA, is seen to be absolutely objective and scientifically independent."
"That is why it has been subjected to independent assessment."
"When we have considered that assessment I believe all Members of this House would want the report to be published."
"But that should not be done whilst doubts remain - and unfortunately there are doubts - about the objectivity of the report as currently presented to the STOA panel."
"Madam President, I was astonished to read in the press the outcome of the negotiations by the Conference of Presidents to decide the winner of the Sakharov Prize."
"What I am asking myself is where and when will MEPs be given an opportunity to begin to understand how the presidents, or the majority of presidents, or whoever, came to a decision which patently contradicts the MEPs who voted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy."
"I find this scandalous to say the least, and I believe that there is a genuine problem with the way things work in our Parliament, which is that, in actual fact, we serve no purpose."
"We spend hours having debates and casting votes in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and then afterwards, Mr Poettering calls Mr Barón Crespo or Mr Barón Crespo calls Mr Poettering and what we think counts for nothing."
"I would simply like to say that we are Members who were elected with the same votes as Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo, and that I cannot accept that it is they who call the shots in the European Parliament, therefore I want us to discuss, in plenary, the way that decisions are taken, just as the Sakharov Prize was discussed last week."
"(Applause from the Greens/ALE Group)"
"Madam President, as Mr Cohn-Bendit has referred to me, I will gladly respond in this House to what he has said."
"The Conference of Presidents confirmed the majority vote of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and also proposed the runner-up, who had also received a large number of votes, so that there are three nominations."
"I would also like to tell you, Mr Cohn-Bendit, that you can not only reach me at any time by telephone, but I am also available for private discussions whenever you wish."
"Madam President, I spoke to Mr Wurtz on the telephone and to Mrs Hautala and Mr Lannoye in person."
"First of all, I do not consider the fact that Members of this Parliament should talk to one another as a crime and secondly, the Conference of Presidents has respected the proposal tabled by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Security and Defence Policy."
"The proof of this is that the prize was awarded to the joint Israeli-Palestinian proposal and to the proposal from the bishop of Angola by a very large majority."
"Furthermore, on your own initiative, Madam President, a special mention will be given to Mrs Sedrine, the Tunisian journalist."
"I would ask my fellow Members, especially Mr Cohn-Bendit, to be a bit more careful about what they say because, apart from the fact that the decision of the Committee on Foreign Affairs has been respected, the last thing we need at such a sensitive political moment is to create a religious war between a Christian, a Muslim and a Jew."
"This is completely unacceptable."
"Madam President, I had the opportunity to express my views on this matter before the Conference of Presidents meeting."
"I do not feel that now is the time to argue about this, or to have a dispute over procedure."
"In my view, I am extremely pleased that the Conference of Presidents had virtually unanimously agreed to award the Sakharov Prize to Mr Ghazzawi and to Mrs Peled-Elhanan, who, to my mind, symbolise what many of us aspire to, in other words, to give hope to those who wish to find the path of dialogue and peace in the Middle East, a region that has been so afflicted."
"From this point of view, Madam President, I think that, and the European Council also gave this message, in other words, that we request Ariel Sharon' s government to respect international law and withdraw his tanks and troops as a matter of urgency from the autonomous Palestinian territories, I think that it would certainly be in the spirit of the Sakharov Prize for you, Madam President, if you agree, to give this message to the Israeli government on our behalf."
"Thank you, Madam President."
"Mr Wurtz, I think that, given the applause that I have just heard, I am certainly able to do this."
"I have one comment to make, Mr Barón Crespo: when the prize is given to two people - one a Muslim, the other Jewish - this means that a war of religions does not exist."
"You say, therefore, that the decision was not to award the prize to two Muslims, but to a Jew and a Muslim."
"That is all you need to say and that is why I maintain that a lack of courage and historical insight are what led to the proposal by the Committee on Foreign Affairs being watered down."
"Madam President, Africa also exists."
"We attended the Durban Conference and we must also send a message of hope for the ongoing conflicts in Africa."
"Furthermore, I am delighted with the unanimity that this prize has inspired and I give it my support, which is no less than you deserve."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a few days ago, another five workers lost their lives as the result of an explosion on the tanker which they were repairing in Salamina."
"This is the umpteenth time that workers in my country have paid with their blood for the lack of rudimentary safety measures as the result of the unaccountability of shipowners and the privatisation of control services, which issue certificates based on the shipowners' interests rather than on respect for the workers' lives."
"The Greek government is also to blame for failing to take any action whatsoever, despite the large number of accidents."
"I should like to use this tribune to express our condolences to the victims' families and to roundly condemn the unaccountability of their employers and the policy of the Greek government."
"Be it in Toulouse or Salamina, the working classes are being sacrificed for the sake of a competitive economy and more and more profit."
"Madam President, I do not know if you remember, but, a couple of months ago, I severely criticised the fact that we Danes were being treated unfairly."
"We did not have the opportunity to watch Danish television. I asked you and Mrs Banotti to look into the matter, and I should like to say that Mrs Banotti has again shown that she is good at these matters."
"The Danes among us have now got Danish television again."
"We are over the moon and, as Mrs Banotti can see, I am celebrating the fact in my national colours - a red jacket and a splendid white shirt from the Håndværker Bank in Næstved."
"So you can see that we are really happy to have got Danish television."
"Madam President, I would like to put on record my disappointment that we will not be able this week to discuss the money-laundering directive."
"Thanks to the hard work of the Conciliation Committee and those in this House who have been working on this directive, we are on the point of an agreement with the European Council, and it is a pity that we were not able to get it on the agenda for this week."
"This directive is as important in the fight against terrorism as the bombs which are being dropped on Afghanistan or the efforts of those who are risking their lives there."
"It is something that we should deal with as promptly as possible, because starving the terrorist of his funds is just as important as subjecting him to military attack."
"I hope this House will act swiftly when this matter comes before it at the next plenary session."
"I am sorry that it was not possible to get it on the agenda for this month."
"Madam President, I was not aware that this was going to arise and I apologise therefore to Mrs Villiers for not being able to talk to her about it earlier."
"She is quite right to say that agreement has been reached with the Council and it is now up to Parliament to have the third reading."
"We pressed extremely hard - and you, Madam President, were involved in this - to try and get to a position where we could be flexible and act very rapidly as a parliament."
"Unfortunately, we have to await the documentation that comes from the Council in all 11 languages of the Community before we actually have Council's position formally adopted so that we can come to a conclusion with a third reading."
"It is therefore, unfortunately, a matter of timing, due to the scheduling of documents and translation etc. that we do not have that flexibility. I did press very hard indeed but unfortunately it was not achievable."
"Madam President, my group would also have liked to see the money laundering directive approved sooner."
"We would, indeed, have liked to have seen it wrapped up before the summer holidays."
"But it was Mrs Villiers' own group which held out against an obligation on lawyers to report suspicious transactions and therefore held up the final resolution of this matter for six months after our plenary vote in April."
"I am glad to say that the results of conciliation do not reflect that refusal and lawyers will have to contact the authorities when they have reason to believe their clients may be seeking advice in order to engage in money laundering."
"I am glad that is the final result."
"I deeply regret that it took so long. I am afraid it is Mrs Villiers's own group - indeed her own delegation within that group - which contributed to that lengthened and regrettable delay."
"Madam President, I would like to raise briefly a matter of serious concern to me, and perhaps to others in this House, relating to the question of discrimination."
"This House rightly rejects discrimination in all its forms and we receive opinions on this subject from many quarters, including the Economic and Social Committee."
"It now appears that this committee itself practises discrimination on the grounds of age, in that it is impossible to apply for a job there unless you are younger than 45."
"Madam President, may I suggest that you write to them as a matter of urgency to see whether this is true and, if it is, perhaps to threaten that we will stop receiving their opinions until they abandon such discrimination."
"Surely it should be possible for people to work for any institution at any age, even if they are as old as I am!"
"Thank you."
"We shall look into this, as you have asked."
"Madam President, I should like to raise an issue which I raised at the previous part-session, that is, the predicament of national airlines in Europe which are currently facing effective annihilation."
"It is reckoned that approximately EUR 2.5 billion will be lost by the European aviation industry between now and the end of the year, and that some 20 000 jobs will be lost."
"The Commission response to this, however, has been stony-faced and ideological."
"It has sought to use the crisis arising from the atrocities of 11 September to shake out the industry to ensure that companies that may or may not have survived in the normal course of economic operations are forced to close down."
"I would appeal to the Commission to use some political sagacity in its approach to this situation."
"If the European project does not have the support of the people of Europe it will not succeed, and the Commission is failing to recognise this."
"Every single job lost in the European aviation industry as a result of the Commission's decision, will create an ever-widening pool of resentment towards Europe, not towards national governments which may be pursuing their own agendas."
"The Commission must urgently review its approach to the aviation industry."
"Madam President, this is the second session that we are holding in October."
"As you will recall, at our first October session, we made a last minute change to the agenda in order to debate and vote on the dreadful accident that occurred at the AZF factory in Toulouse."
"Yet, two days ago, this very factory released several tonnes of ammonia into the Garonne river, which flows through the city of Toulouse."
"I am therefore asking you, Madam President, to ensure that the resolution we adopted is followed up by the Commission, to prevent it becoming lost in a mass of administrative red tape."
"I believe that the impunity and the arrogance of the polluters must be met with the determination of our Parliament."
"I shall gladly do so, Mr Onesta."
"Madam President, I would like to present a communiqué concerning our colleague Patricia McKenna."
"She took part today in a peaceful demonstration at the nuclear weapons base at Faslane, Scotland, and was arrested at eight in the morning along with twelve Irish students."
"She asks you to give your attention to the fact that a Member of the European Parliament may not be arrested when he or she is on the way to or from meetings of the European Parliament."
"She also hopes that this request will bring about a debate concerning the unlawfulness of nuclear weapons."
"Quite recently, the International Court of Justice has stated that the possession of weapons of mass destruction contravenes international law."
"Madam President, I am aware that some here will find themselves thinking that it is not possible to travel to Strasbourg via Scotland; but I would merely like to say - in Patricia McKenna's native language - that ""what goes up, must come down""."
"Mrs Hautala, I have just received some information regarding Mrs McKenna, and I shall of course see what we can do to help her."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you for mentioning at the start of the sitting the tragedy which took place at Milan Linate airport, which claimed 118 lives."
"Investigations are currently being carried out into who is responsible."
"Of course, it became clear very early on that, while, regrettably, human error is always possible, it was made possible in this case largely by the severe lack of security in that airport, which we all believed to be safe."
"From the human point of view, I feel that it is becoming imperative that these errors are not repeated and that such a tragic incident should compel all those responsible to undertake solemnly to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in the future."
"As regards responsibility, I feel that we, as the European Union, should call upon the Commission and the Council to be more rigorous in enforcing the imperative need for airport security, to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in future."
"Mrs Ghilardotti, I believe that what you have said somewhat pre-empts the debate that will take place in a few moments, following the points of order."
"Madam President, unfortunately the fears which I expressed the very day after the terrorist attack in the USA have come true and the death of the thousands of innocent American victims is being used as an excuse for a barbaric attack on Afghanistan, giving rise to new hordes of innocent victims and causing tremendous damage."
"Today, 15 days after the attacks started, it is clear - witness the announcements by the US administration - that the aim is not to stamp out terrorism, it is - or at least one of the aims is - to control central Asia and its huge natural resources and highly important geo-strategic position."
"My fear, especially after Mrs Gandhi, that this attack will be used to further strengthen capitalist mechanisms and curtail our workers' and our nations' democratic freedoms and rights, has also come true."
"The EU, led by the three, has aligned with the USA in what is a disastrous policy for our nations and our planet."
"I believe that the European Parliament, as a democratically elected house, has a duty, if it wants to serve the peaceful, democratic visions and wishes of our people, to oppose these developments, to push for the EU to disassociate itself from them, to stop the war and to revert to resolving differences by peaceful means."
"However, in the final analysis, it is up to the people."
"Madam President, we are a small delegation of MEPs who have just come back from the Clinique Sainte Barbe here in Strasbourg, to which a former Chechen minister, Mr Ibragimov, had been admitted after having been on hunger strike for 27 days."
"We went there to talk with Mr Ibragimov and to alert the world to the fact that this hunger strike took place here in Strasbourg."
"Mr Ibragimov naturally drew attention to the fact that he wanted international organisations and politicians to try to convince President Putin to put an end to the war in Chechnya and to adhere to the agreements entered into between Chechnya and Russia, and I should like to convey this message of his."
"Mr Ibragimov has begun to eat again."
"He is still very weak, but human rights campaigners have encouraged him to abandon his hunger strike."
"He will begin it again later, together with other human rights campaigners, if there is still no progress on Chechnya in the future."
"However, I think it was important to visit him."
"My point is that we must not forget that human rights are being violated."
"Now that we are combating terrorism, we must not forget human rights, and I should like to call upon you to tell Mr Ibragimov that you are willing to meet him - if that is possible - during the next part-session in Strasbourg."
"Consequences of recent events for the safety of air transport and industrial installations including nuclear power plants"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the consequences of recent events for the safety of air transport and industrial installations, including nuclear power plants."
"I shall now give the floor to Commissioner Vitorino."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, at the previous plenary session of the European Parliament, a debate was held on the steps to take in the fight against terrorism in the wake of the attacks of 11 September."
"On behalf of my colleague, Mrs De Palacio, I would today like to discuss the consequences of these events for the safety of air transport, and also the implications that such events could have for some industrial installations, particularly nuclear power plants."
"I shall therefore begin with the issue of air transport safety."
"As I am sure you know, the European Council of 21 September 2001 requested that measures be taken in order to strengthen air transport security."
"The Commission showed a dynamic approach and immediately reacted by formulating an appropriate Community response to the attacks carried out in the United States of America."
"Without further delay - following a request made by the European Council - the Commission proposed that Member States put in place a 'dual review' mutual inspection system."
"This reciprocal monitoring system will enable experts of one Member State to be sent to inspect security measures in airports of another Member State."
"We must point out, however, that Member States are reluctant to give inspectors this task."
"So far, only two Member States have submitted to the Commission proposals on the representatives that they wish to appoint."
"On 10 October, the Commission proposed a draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council to approximate air transport security and safety standards within the European Union, and also to give the Commission the power of execution and inspection in order to ensure that the standards are being applied."
"This text specifically mentions access control to sensitive areas of airports and aircraft, control of passengers and their hand luggage, control and monitoring of hold luggage, control of cargo and mail and, lastly, the training of ground staff."
"Mrs De Palacio presented this proposal to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism the same day that it was adopted, and we hope that Parliament will be able to examine it as a matter of urgency in order to enable an agreement to be reached at the Council in December, with the hope that the co-decision procedure can take place at first reading."
"In addition, an ad-hoc multidisciplinary group, made up of experts in air safety and combating terrorism, was set up immediately."
"Unfortunately, the work of the group of experts has been inconclusive and the preliminary report submitted to the Transport Council on 16 October merely stresses, firstly, that much remains to be done in order to ensure that safety measures are being applied effectively in all airports and, secondly, identifies the need for new measures to prevent the dangerous behaviour of some individuals in aircraft, such as banning access to cockpits or enhancing cooperation between civil monitoring of air traffic and the use of military air defence methods."
"We are convinced that we must make headway on the proposals that we have submitted to you."
"Not only because of a lack of specific recommendations from the above mentioned group, but also because international bodies appear to be having difficulties in reacting swiftly."
"Therefore, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which held its assembly meeting in September, has limited itself to the single principle of organising a conference, the date of which has not yet been arranged."
"We hope that, at the European Union' s initiative, the ICAO will take on the responsibility of ensuring the adoption of the recommendations that it received with a view to strengthening international safety standards that apply to airports and air transport."
"Nevertheless, given the situation, the United States naturally decided to move forward themselves on this issue."
"The Commission believes that we must enhance cooperation so that preventative measures are implemented in a coordinated manner on both sides of the Atlantic."
"In this spirit, we organised a meeting with our American counterparts, which is to be held on 6 and 7 November 2001, to set up a working group that brings together the American authorities and the Commission with a view to coordinating efforts so that the highest possible level of security is ensured, whilst avoiding a situation where airline companies are subjected to excessive measures."
"I shall now move on to the possible consequences of terrorist activities, such as those committed on 11 September 2001, had they been carried out on an industrial or power installation."
"The nuclear industry is one of the sectors of industry that has the most stringent security and safety standards, particularly because of the requirements of non-proliferation and radiation protection."
"We should also mention, however, that other installations, that are less well protected, may be vulnerable, and a fatal accident of considerable proportions could happen at one of these plants, whether they belong to the chemical industry, which was the case at Bhopal, Seveso and recently at Toulouse - or at other power installations, such as natural gas infrastructures, which are not without risks."
"Some of us still recall the time when hydroelectric dams burst."
"Since 11 September, Member States' authorities have strengthened existing protective systems and physical protection measures that were already in force for at-risk installations and more specifically for nuclear installations."
"These physical protection measures are particularly for access control to the installations and include a ban on flying over the installations."
"As far as the design of existing installations is concerned, it must be noted that the risks are taken into consideration, either wholly or according to the probability of an accident taking place."
"Therefore, the risk of a primary cooling system bursting, to which terrorists could have access, is taken wholly into account and a security system is put in place to avoid this risk."
"Comparative assessments are carried out on other risks."
"This is what happens for seismic risks, which are taken into consideration in a number of ways, according to the geographical location of the installation itself."
"In this respect, the Commission would like to reiterate that the design and construction of electro-nuclear power stations fall within the sole competence of Member States."
"In addition to conventional nuclear installations, however, we must also take into account the risks related to transporting nuclear materials."
"In reality, the transportation of highly radioactive materials is only a very small part of activities involving nuclear materials and is carried out in accordance with the most stringent provisions of international and national regulations."
"As a general rule, to use nuclear materials for the purposes of terrorism, perpetrators require, beyond simply holding the nuclear materials, the technical capability to store, process and launch the materials, which would be very difficult to achieve without alerting the authorities."
"Everything has been implemented at Community level, by applying Chapter VII of the Euratom Treaty, which requires a strict registration of nuclear materials in order to prevent them being used for non-peaceful purposes."
"Nonetheless, the events in New York show that we must assess the vulnerability of nuclear installations."
"The Commission services are carrying out an evaluation, in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, particularly in terms of security at nuclear installations."
"Our assessment should show how worthwhile it would be to publish the recommendations and to supplement existing legislation at Community and/or international level."
"In particular, we must assess the conventions established under the International Atomic Energy Agency, such as the convention on physical protection, which mainly covers the transportation of nuclear materials."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your attention."
"We on this side whole-heartedly support the response of the United States, the European Union and its Member States and other countries to the attacks of 11 September 2001 and the development of a comprehensive multilateral strategy against terrorism."
"In recognising the determination of the European Union and its Member States to safeguard its citizens from acts of terrorism, we stress the need to reassure the public by striking the right balance between vigilance and enabling everyday life to continue."
"We consider that each Member State must carry out a complete reassessment of its approach to the security of infrastructure and installations, particularly the most risk-sensitive such as nuclear installations."
"We recognise there is genuine public concern about these issues but would like to emphasise the need to keep these matters in perspective."
"I would like to emphasise that the safety of nuclear plants and other such industrial installations is primarily a national competence and responsibility."
"In that context we look, for example, to the United Kingdom government to take all necessary short-term protective measures as well as to face up to the necessary longer-term decisions with regard to the disposal of radioactive waste."
"Clearly, the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States call for a reassessment of the risk of attack on installations that we have previously regarded as secure and I welcome the statement from the Commissioner."
"I only regret that it was not possible for Commissioner Loyola de Palacio to be able to speak to us - it had been our wish to hold this debate at the next part-session."
"President, the basic premise of terrorism is that the unexpected, the unconsidered, the unbelievable will terrify the population into accepting political claims, whether they are rational or not."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement."
"I welcome the cooperation you have outlined and the special attention which will be given to nuclear installations."
"I hope that Member States will cooperate with the Commission in this work."
"Our reaction must be to do all that we can to prevent the sort of widespread slaughter, injury and chaos we saw in the United States."
"Air travel, nuclear power stations, chemical works and oil depots, are all obvious targets for terrorists."
"They are designed, built and protected accordingly at very considerable cost to the public."
"The French government now protects the reprocessing centre at La Hague with fighter planes and missiles. No doubt the United Kingdom does likewise in Sellafield."
"We cannot inhabit the weird minds of terrorists, but we can pay the high cost of protection."
"We can work together and we can be very careful when we consider building, or indeed retaining, a potential target."
"Things will not be the same after 11 September, as many others have said."
"No one had conceived of using a fully loaded, large passenger plane as a weapon."
"We have to factor that into our calculations."
"Please keep reporting to Parliament."
"We want the citizens of Europe to know that everything possible has been done to keep them safe."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we have reached a serious point, a very serious point."
"The worst-case scenario of terrorist air attacks on nuclear power stations, long condemned by the Greens and anti-nuclear citizens, is becoming, through force of circumstance, a valid hypothesis."
"The fact that France has called on its armed forces in an attempt to protect its reactors is evidence that air attacks on nuclear plants are plausible."
"The French authorities, which have always dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks, are now forced to admit that their nuclear temples are indeed vulnerable."
"And will the ground-to-air missiles deployed around the re-processing plant in The Hague be effective against a suicide attack?"
"The German authorities and the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna recognise that even the sturdiest nuclear power station would not survive a crash."
"Throughout Europe and elsewhere in the world, the danger is certainly present, and it is made all the more acute because of the overwhelming number of nuclear reactors."
"We cannot currently guarantee the safety of our citizens."
"They are concerned and quite rightly so."
"Has the Commission taken these disaster scenarios seriously?"
"How will it ensure the safety of our citizens?"
"And does the Commission intend to launch a study into the safety of nuclear power stations, as Germany has?"
"Lastly, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I regret the fact that my fellow Members from other groups did not deem it necessary to follow this debate with a resolution."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the question regarding the safety of Europe' s skies is being considered in terms of immediate and urgent measures."
"It is also being considered in terms of longer-term measures regarding security standards in aircraft and at boarding."
"We have duly noted the Commission statements, particularly on the various measures taken regarding checks on passengers, on hand luggage, as well as on flights from third countries. In my view, these are wise comments."
"We must also accelerate the completion of security programmes relating to checks on hold luggage and ensure that our decisions have been implemented."
"I shall not go back over what was said earlier regarding the scandalous situation involving the AZF factory, only a few weeks after we held debates in this Chamber."
"As far as safety on aircraft and at boarding are concerned, the events of 11 September show that two measures must be taken in aircraft design: cockpits must be sealed off and video monitors must be installed to enable the pilot to see anyone nearing the cockpit."
"Secondly, there is the issue of transponders."
"Transponders transmit the aircraft' s code and position to the air traffic control tower."
"Transponders must be secure and it must no longer be possible to disconnect them during flights, as was the case during the attacks on the United States."
"I would also like to draw Parliament' s attention to the issue of aid to the European airline industry."
"To be honest, I think that it is extremely tactless, even provocative, for the Commission to open the debate on concentration within the airline industry at this point in time."
"In addition to the economic battering that companies are taking, to confirm that Europe only has enough room for four or five airlines amounts to inviting mergers, restructuring and therefore redundancy plans."
"On the other hand, several sources are predicting a 15 to 30% decrease in air traffic and the European Association of Air Carriers states that overall traffic levels will have decreased by more than 7% by 2002, incurring losses estimated to be over three billion euro."
"In my view, the regulations on state aid to airlines must be extended in order to take into full consideration all the consequences of 11 September."
"Lastly, I would like to say one final word to point out that these public funds are intended to help companies to continue to be viable."
"I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to ensure that they are used and to avoid any redundancies in the sector."
"Mr President, the goalposts have now changed, given the sheer level of inhumanity shown by terrorists pursuing their so-called political objectives."
"Terrorists are now willing to engage in suicide missions."
"This simply means that the international community must now fully re-evaluate how best it can put in place security measures to defeat these acts of blatant and premeditated terrorism."
"From an Irish perspective, we are deeply concerned about the safety and security arrangements at the Sellafield nuclear plant in Cumbria."
"At a time when one would expect a scaling-down of nuclear enterprises in Britain, the British government has announced that the MOX nuclear facility can go ahead at Sellafield."
"Instead of closing the Sellafield nuclear plant on safety, environmental and economic grounds, the British governments has agreed to the expansion of operations there."
"This is not only a problem for the Irish people: it is also a problem for the British people and for the wider European Union."
"For instance, how do the British people like the idea of trains carrying nuclear materials continuing to run through London and other cities in Britain?"
"While the American government has halted the movement of potentially dangerous nuclear materials, BNFL is insisting that it will run its nuclear trains from reactors to its controversial Sellafield reprocessing plant."
"In this growing atmosphere of international terrorism, surely it is grossly irresponsible to continue this transportation."
"Equally, the transportation of nuclear materials via the Irish Sea sends shivers down the spine of many people living in Ireland."
"As a representative of the East coast of Ireland, I have always resented the Irish Sea being used as a rubbish tip for the activities of British Nuclear Fuels."
"The decision of the British government to expand the operations of the Sellafield nuclear plant is a contentious one by any stretch of the imagination."
"The timing of this decision, however, is a highly cynical one, considering that it was made as a smokescreen at the same time as war was declared on terrorism."
"This is a clear case of the British government using the war on terrorism to distract attention from awkward and contentious decisions."
"In this climate this is simply not good enough."
"The safety and security at the Sellafield plant is as much a matter of concern for the European Union as it is for the Irish and British governments."
"The British government should make the honourable decision to close this nuclear white elephant once and for all."
"But over the next few weeks the Commission should and must carry out a full and independent evaluation of all the environmental public health risks of all operations of BNFL at the Sellafield nuclear plant."
"The people of Ireland are fed up with pious assurances from BNFL and the British government about safety standards at Sellafield."
"We were all horrified recently when BNFL had to bring back nuclear materials from Japan, because it had falsified documents."
"After this incident alone, how can any reasonable person believe for one moment anything that is written in a press release by BNFL?"
"I can assure all Members of this House that we in Ireland will vigorously pursue every political, legal and diplomatic option open to us to force the British government to close the Sellafield nuclear plant."
"This Sellafield nuclear plant has achieved nothing, except to heap environmental misery on us all."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the crisis in air transport unfolding before our very eyes following the terrorist attack on 11 September is, of course, exacerbated by factors such as structural problems in airline companies, the absence, so far, at least, of a single European airspace, which we hope will soon become a reality, and public concern about the safety of air transport."
"We need to act as quickly as possible."
"When we attended the ICAO assembly in Montreal recently with the European Parliament delegation, we clearly stated the European position that international measures should be taken at ministerial level by the end of the year."
"And, of course, if, our hopes notwithstanding, there are delays, I think that the European Union should proceed unilaterally in order to establish a climate of safety in air transport."
"As you all know, the Commission recently proposed an initial package of measures, referred to as ECAC document 30."
"The parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has promised to examine it as quickly as possible so that these measures can be turned into Community law by the end of the year, which is also in keeping with the Council's wishes."
"For the same reason, the other three legislative proposals relating to safety will also be examined as quickly as possible."
"There is also another package of measures relating to safety in the cockpit, video cameras, ground/air communications etc., that is, the measures to which the Commissioner referred."
"As far as this matter is concerned, my point is that we are worried about the delay and about how the Member States' experts have worked up to now."
"We trust that they will take the hint and improve their working methods from now on."
"We are witnessing serious economic losses not just in air transport but in trade, tourism and other sectors of the economy."
"We would be failing in our duty if we did not do our utmost to deal with this crisis."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that nuclear power installations are not wholly safe from terrorist attacks."
"No reactor could withstand the impact of a Boeing 747."
"It would simply be wrong to assert anything else."
"What is true of nuclear installations, though, is also true of other technological systems."
"Mr Vitorino rightly pointed out that even a dam can be destroyed, and the Second World War shows that the consequences can be devastating."
"An attack on a gasometer, such as can be found in the heart of our towns, could be positively appalling."
"I might mention that some pressurised gasometers already operate at a lower pressure for safety reasons."
"If methane were to escape from a high-pressure holder - a heavy machine-gun would suffice to bring that about - and spread over the town, then once it mixed to a certain degree with the surrounding air, the town would simply burn to the ground."
"Accidents of this sort have occurred in the past; thank God we have managed to avoid them in the past ten years."
"The same applies to the water supply."
"It is relatively straightforward to poison water."
"We can all imagine how immense the consequences of that would be."
"Now, I accept that many in our countries are opposed to nuclear energy, and that, in some countries, they may well be in the majority."
"Although it is not an opinion that I share, it is one that I respect."
"This argument, based on the risk of terrorist attacks, could lead us to get rid of the gas industry or stop drinking water, and I find that absurd."
"My conclusion simply follows the line taken by the Commission."
"I admit it is not likely to make very good press copy, but it does have the advantage of being sensible."
"We should identify the dangerous sites and improve the protection of targets."
"Perhaps we should also take other security measures, but these must be implemented without delay."
"Studies are something we do not need."
"Mr President, please allow me a final word. We should not give the impression of total security."
"That can be had only at the price of total surveillance, which cannot be reconciled with a free state under the rule of law."
"Mr President, Commissioner Vitorino, I should like to make a few observations."
"Our group has already talked about the consequences of recent events for nuclear power plants and mentioned, inter alia, a package of measures which is already being discussed in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"We endorse the quest for common security regulations, such as those formulated in document 30 of the E.C.A.C. What we are mainly concerned with here, in addition to issues of supervision, is adopting a special approach to vulnerable areas."
"We, of course, are of the opinion that such a debate must in any case be genuine, certainly when it comes to protecting privacy."
"I should like to bring one aspect to your attention, for we are concerned here with an extension of the threat to include not only additional targets but also additional modes of transport."
"I would like to draw your attention to the use of other means of transport - something which we have already noted - such as tankers containing chemicals, and ask the Commissioner for his thoughts on the matter."
"In shipping too, it is relatively simple to force a ship in a port such as Rotterdam to take a different course and to direct it towards very explosive installations."
"In other words, not only aviation but also other means of transport should be discussed."
"Mr President, installations at risk, such as nuclear power plants, flood-control dams, ports, oil depots, extremely tall buildings and research centres for biological warfare and for genetic manipulation will never lose their appeal for terrorists."
"That is why we must ensure that the number of installations which can threaten the life of human communities and of our environment is reduced to a minimum."
"Instead of subsidising airline companies with tax money, enabling them to continue pulling off stunts involving low prices, it would be preferable to completely close vulnerable regions to air traffic."
"Moreover, vulnerable airports near cities or with insufficient security provisions in place, as in the recent case of Linate near Milan - an airport that should have been closed down years ago - should not have a future."
"The unbalanced pursuit of economic growth, freedom for airline companies and the rolling back of government has, in connection with the sad events of 11 September, led to too little attention being paid, on the one hand, to the risk of industrial buildings collapsing and, on the other hand, to government supervision of access to airports by people with malicious intentions."
"It is not the first time that I am bringing these two matters to the attention of the Commission."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, 11 September will go down as a crucial date in the history of the modern era in general and for the aviation sector in particular, for which we can talk about a before and an after."
"I wish, first of all, to express my solidarity with the victims of these cowardly and barbaric attacks and with the government of the United States and also to unreservedly, roundly and unambiguously condemn terrorism."
"Improving the security of transport users and transported goods was and must continue to be one of the Union' s priorities for action in coming years."
"I am delighted that this is the view adopted in the White Paper on transport policy presented by the Commission only a few months ago."
"We must not forget that a safe journey is the most important right of any passenger."
"The ongoing safety and competitiveness of this sector require the rapid adoption of the latest Commission proposals on air safety and the 'single sky' package."
"We must also take account of other measures that were already on the table, such as the JAR-OPS Regulation, the draft directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation and the proposal on the professional competence of cabin crew."
"All of these texts, Commissioner, must be approved as soon as possible."
"To conclude, I would say that the disastrous action taken on the air transport sector in recent weeks has shown the extent to which the European Union has a pivotal role in responding to the need for regulation at both Community and world-wide level."
"Only a European vision will enable us to confront new challenges such as international terrorism, for which international intergovernmental forums can no longer provide a sufficiently rapid or effective response."
"Parliament has a duty to support the Commission on these proposals to restore the public confidence and safety that have been lost."
"It is at times like this that we must make Europe' s presence felt."
"Lastly, I also wish to address the Council, which must now find the ability and the courage to support and take decisions that ensure that civil aviation will continue to be safe, reliable and sustainable from every point of view."
"I wish to deal briefly with two issues: one I have already addressed, that is the state of the airline industry in Europe."
"I welcome the fact that the Commissioner has announced that the European Union is going to meet with the US authorities to discuss unfair competition, but that is a grossly inadequate response to the current crisis in the aviation industry."
"I would like some clarity about what precisely the Commission is doing."
"There is a report in Irish newspapers today that the Commission is insisting that the rescue and aid package the Irish government will provide for Aer Lingus must be privately funded."
"Now, that is a gross distortion of the treaties which are neutral as regards where aid or money should come from to assist the aviation industry."
"I want clarity on this."
"Is that what the Commission is demanding or is the Irish government playing its own privatisation game under cover of the present crisis?"
"The second point I wish to make is in relation to the nuclear and chemical industries in Europe."
"The report which is coming before STOA this week makes for worrying reading."
"It will hopefully be made public very soon, but the reality is that Sellafield and Cap de la Hague were a risk even before 11 September 2001; the chemical plants in our midst were a risk even before Toulouse."
"It seems to me that we need commitments from the Commission that we are going to have an independent European inspectorate."
"Madam President, after the 11 September atrocity we are in a new situation."
"Acts of malice and not just accidents are the focus of our concern."
"No-fly zones should be established immediately around the two reprocessing plants in the EU: Sellafield and Cap de la Hague."
"Power plants generally are a ticking time-bomb in our midst."
"The only logical response is to close them all down and end this terrible threat."
"The French government has already moved to strengthen anti-terrorist precautions at Cap de la Hague. These include ground-to-air missiles."
"The German government has concluded that nuclear reactors could not withstand a collision with a targeted passenger jet."
"It has undertaken an emergency risk assessment."
"Government ministers oppose anti-aircraft defences and have made it clear that plants that lie in the flight paths of large airports can be shut down if they are rated as serious risk."
"The US government has halted the transport of nuclear materials, and the EU government should also immediately halt the transport of nuclear materials, including MOX fuels."
"I do not believe that the response we have had so far from the Commission is at all adequate."
"The IAEA has confirmed that 75% of the notifications of incidents involving nuclear material in the last year were illegal activities."
"Nuclear materials are currently clearly not secure and not safe."
"Neither Sellafield nor la Hague was designed to withstand the impact of a commercial jet."
"They contain tens of thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel and over 100 tonnes of separated plutonium between them."
"A new report, which is both timely and in terms of content deeply worrying, has been prepared for the European Parliament."
"I understand it will be circulated tomorrow by the STOA committee."
"I expect it to be circulated."
"I wonder why it has not already been circulated to Members, as I believe it has already been circulated to the industry?"
"The report states that an act of malice - and this was presented to us before September - could initiate a sequence of events that release radioactive material in the liquid high-level waste tanks, in Sellafield in particular, with effects much greater and more devastating than Chernobyl."
"This is very serious."
"I need an adequate response from the Commission, and so far we have not had it."
"Mr President, I made my point about the STOA report when we were discussing the order of business."
"Successive Irish governments have voiced their concern about the operation of the Sellafield plant, formerly known as Windscale, and in particular the innumerable security breaches by the BNFL and the arrogance of the British authorities towards the legitimate concerns of a sovereign and friendly neighbour."
"The commissioning of the MOX plant when the eyes of the international media were firmly focused elsewhere in the wake of the tragedy of September 11, 2001 is but the latest example, and is particularly serious, given the heightened concerns now of terrorist attacks."
"Could the Commission confirm that the same security standards that are now deemed necessary in Cap de la Hague - that is protection with fighter planes and ground-to-air missiles and a no-fly zone - are in place in Sellafield?"
"Does the Commission agree that there is an urgent need for common security standards for all nuclear installations, not just in the EU-15, but in accession countries as well?"
"Could the Commission also comment on the lack of effectiveness of the present inspectorate in this regard?"
"Mr President, I am very grateful to the Commission for using today's statement to take up a theme that currently causes a great deal of concern to the people of Europe."
"I also welcome the way the Commission deals explicitly with all the areas at especial risk, and, in particular, its inclusion of industrial plant and nuclear power stations, which was demanded on Austria's initiative in Parliament's resolution on the events of 11 September."
"We know that precautions were taken at several nuclear power stations in Europe to enable them to survive the impact of smaller aircraft at least."
"Does the Commission have an overview showing which nuclear power stations did not do this, and what is planned at a European level to reinforce protection measures overall, at least at these stations but also at all others?"
"We know that no nuclear power station is completely safe, and that some are not technically up to date in other respects of relevance to safety."
"It would be all the more surprising if there really were a letter from Commissioner Verheugen, confirming that the Temelin plant is completely safe."
"As such a statement would contradict everything international experts have found out about Temelin, I cannot believe that this statement about its safety was actually made by Mr Verheugen."
"I therefore ask the Commission to show this document, addressed to the Czech and Austrian governments, to Parliament."
"We have been very committed to this issue, and I think Parliament deserves, even if the Commission takes an opposing view...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, much as I love Senator Doyle and her Irish friends, she is quite wrong about Sellafield in my constituency."
"I told her so, and the Irish government so when I was the Northern Ireland Minister responsible for Energy and I reiterate that view now."
"I applaud the British government's decision on the MOX plant, a long overdue decision which is going to ensure the economic and employment future of my constituents."
"So my message on that is to keep your hands off Sellafield."
"Briefly, about aviation."
"I congratulate Commissioner Palacio on the actions that she has already taken but there are three things we need to emphasise: firstly we must protect the aircraft on the ground; once someone is on the aircraft they can do more damage."
"Secondly we must renew and reinvigorate security screening at airports and thirdly we must assist with the costs of security and war-risk insurance."
"We must restore public confidence in aviation and the sooner the better."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, personally speaking, I believe that I can welcome the fact that the approach adopted by the Commission with regard to both air safety and security and the safety of industrial and nuclear installations has received wide support from Members here."
"To sum up, I will add that we have drawn up an intervention programme, which strictly observes competences - not simply Community competences, but Member States' competences as well."
"That is why I can assure you that, as regards matters for which the Commission has direct responsibility under the Treaties, we have taken all the necessary measures to deal with the new situation created by the terrorist attacks on the United States."
"We shall continue to put pressure on the Member States so that they also shoulder their responsibilities and adopt the necessary measures that are part of their competences."
"This applies to the examples given regarding the security of the Sellafield and Cap de La Hague re-processing plants."
"I would like to stress that this is part of national competences and that it is the national authorities that inform us that the necessary measures have been taken."
"The Commission recognises the need to begin an assessment of nuclear security and the security of transporting nuclear materials."
"I mentioned this in my presentation and I hope that the assessment that the Commission is currently preparing will soon be completed."
"As far as air safety and security are concerned, I am pleased that several Members of Parliament have welcomed our legislative initiative with open arms and I hope that the regulation that we have proposed can be examined by Parliament as a matter of urgency."
"I would also like to stress that we must improve how we follow up on measures taken at national level, just as the ad hoc group is doing, which is responsible for assessing specific administrative measures that need to be taken to improve air security."
"Mr President, I would like to make a final comment."
"I referred to the conditions relating to competition and to the strategy implemented by the Commission to avoid distorting competition within the context of the Euro-American dialogue on security."
"This was the context in which I dealt with the issue of competition."
"We believe that the solutions we are seeking must be international and must take into consideration the need to avoid imposing measures that are excessive and which may distort competition globally."
"This was the background to what I said."
"I did not mention other measures concerning competition policy related to the effects of the terrorist attacks on the commercial strategy of airlines."
"I did not deal with specific questions, such as those that some Members of Parliament wanted to bring up during the debate."
"All I can do is refer Members to the conclusions of the meeting that my colleague, Mrs Loyola De Palacio, held with the representatives of the airline companies' association."
"I have taken careful note of the fact that some of you thought that the Commission proposals were insufficient or too ideological."
"I have taken careful note of your comments."
"I shall pass them on to Mrs De Palacio, but I repeat that, for the time being, this is the official position of the Commission."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"Mr Fitzsimons has the floor on a point of order."
"It is not the first time I have heard Commissioners come into this House and say they have no obligations in relation to nuclear power plants and that this is a matter for the Member States."
"But clearly the European Commission should and must carry out an independent evaluation of all the environmental and public health risks, not just for Ireland and for all the UK but for all the people of Europe."
"This has been side-stepped down the years but it is high time that the Commission bites the bullet."
"For this type of question, you can contact the Commissioner directly."
"I just want to agree with what my colleague Mr Fitzsimons says."
"I have a report here by Parliament, from the STOA committee."
"Mrs Ahern, I will say the same to you that I said to Mr Fitzsimons: this is not a point of order."
"European judicial area/SIS II"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today sees the fulfilment of a small dream."
"I have ten minutes' speaking time, as much as only a Group chairman can normally expect."
"This, however, comes about through the grouping together of two reports, which do not actually belong together."
"So I would prefer to speak on them separately."
"Let me begin with the area of civil law."
"When the Maastricht Treaty came into force in 1993, judicial cooperation in civil matters became a matter of common concern for the Member States."
"Then the Treaty of Amsterdam, by means of Article 65 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, transferred this cooperation from the third pillar to the first."
"Its entry into force brought about active European lawmaking."
"Regulations on conflicts of law or of jurisdiction were adjusted, the Council directive on insolvency procedures and on the service of legal documents in civil and commercial cases was adopted, and draft directives on the gathering of evidence and on rights of access in matrimonial cases were submitted to the Council."
"The entry into force of the present Treaty of Nice means that future decisions on judicial cooperation in civil matters will finally be reached by codecision procedure with qualified majority in the Council."
"You can see that things in this field are developing at breakneck speed."
"Member States will continue to have sole responsibility for the framework and content of professional training in civil law, but it will be the Community's responsibility to support them whether in the removal of obstacles to the application of Community law or in the cooperation of the judicial authorities."
"In no area of European law is continuing professional education so imperative as in civil law, in which harmonisation has already made progress."
"Criminal and administrative law, on the other hand, are still only at the beginning of their European development."
"This continuing education was formerly supported by two EU programmes."
"GROTIUS, the joint incentive and exchange programme for the legal profession, came to an end in 2000."
"This promotion was maintained only by a successor programme, GROTIUS Programme Civil, which was limited to one year."
"The same year saw the expiry of the Robert Schuman Project, which had been limited to three years and served to make lawyers more aware of Community law."
"The Commission proposal before us today now represents the legal basis for further financial support for activities in the field of legal cooperation in civil matters."
"It promotes judicial cooperation and improved mutual understanding of legal systems, as well as measures to transpose and implement Community legislation in this area and better information for the public."
"For the first time, alongside finance for specific projects, there is the prospect of financial help with the running costs of European NGOs."
"I can only emphatically support that."
"The facilitation of involvement by the acceding countries is also especially to be welcomed."
"Apart from the essential rejoicing at the direction of this draft, which is made all the greater by the generous financial framework amounting to EUR 14.5 million up to 2006, there remain a few critical points."
"The stipulation that NGOs can only apply for support if two-thirds of the Member States participate in them can hardly be complied with even today."
"The prospect of enlargement therefore makes it a matter of urgency to reduce this hurdle to one-third, or else this directive's good beginnings will be nipped in the bud."
"I also wonder why the Commission, contrary to its former practice - for example in the context of the GROTIUS programmes - has omitted to define precisely who is entitled to apply, members of the legal profession in this case."
"The debate on the money-laundering directive showed us how vital it is in this area to define terms."
"Member States must not have discretion to define terms when support with European funds is at issue."
"I have therefore proposed the adoption of the old definition from the GROTIUS civil law programme."
"I would also like to say, on this point, that I would have been glad if the EU had continued to bear up to 80% of project costs, rather than reducing this share to 50%."
"This was, however, not what the relevant committee wanted."
"I think, though, that the EU continues to bear a great responsibility for the further development of judicial cooperation."
"This responsibility is likely to increase rather than decrease in the future. Here, too, we must continue to be a motive force."
"So much for the first part concerning the area of civil law;"
"I now come to the debate on the Schengen Information System."
"The Schengen Information System was established in 1995 on the basis of the Convention of 1990 which implemented the Schengen Agreement."
"Today, as a police investigation system overlapping states and supported by computers, it facilitates online access to over 8 million items of data produced by investigations and is thus the most comprehensive database in Europe."
"It is used by Iceland and Norway as well as thirteen EU Member States."
"All this makes SIS a successful component of a new European internal security policy, made necessary by the dismantling of internal borders and the resulting loss of surveillance."
"Two problems concern us today, the first being advances in technology."
"The Schengen Information System as we know it today was originally conceived for eighteen Member States."
"The fact that all the present acceding countries will join in SIS on their accession makes it urgently necessary to give thought today to what will be its successor."
"Technology has moved on in the meantime as well."
"The initiative taken by the kingdoms of Sweden and Belgium to develop SIS II are therefore much to be welcomed."
"As the development of SIS II will require over three years' preparatory work, these initiatives lay the necessary legal foundations for its budget."
"The originators have, however, overshot their mark a bit."
"In order to ensure the maximum influence on technical development, the Member States are to take part in the comitological process through a combination of administrative and regulatory committees."
"This will therefore involve a maximum of additional bureaucratic effort."
"It is not clear to me why, at a development stage where only technical aspects are to be discussed, the Member States are to join in discussing and deciding on every detail."
"The suggestion that a regulatory committee should be in place to deal with all matters concerning the system's architecture and with data protection issues, also goes against Council decision 468/99."
"This stated that recourse should be had to the regulatory procedure only for measures of general scope intended to apply essential provisions of basic legal instruments."
"Such is quite evidently not the case here."
"At this stage, I would like to point out to the representatives of the Council that, for example, when Eurodac was set up, there was deliberately no official participatory procedure, and the Member States exerted their influence only through an informal network of technical experts."
"This saved us all a great deal of time and money and still produced an effective result."
"At the same time, I have confidence in the technical know-how in this field possessed by the Commission, which is entrusted with guiding this development."
"I therefore suggest to Member States that they replace the superfluous bureaucratic combination of administrative and regulatory procedure by a combination of administrative and consultative procedure."
"Less is sometimes more."
"The second problem is the development of law."
"The Member States did admittedly decide as early as the Amsterdam Inter-Governmental Conference to integrate the Schengen Agreement into the European legal area, but lack of agreement meant that the Schengen Information System was assigned to the third pillar."
"There is no doubt, however, that collection of data on persons who have been barred from entering a Member State is within the scope of the first pillar."
"This is another reason why we have two initiatives today, one by the Belgian Presidency and another by Sweden."
"As Europe's Parliament, we strive to integrate Schengen and the Schengen Information System into the first pillar, and as a whole if at all possible."
"It is only in that way that appropriate parliamentary control can be guaranteed."
"So I will go on the record as welcoming, as a step in this direction, the financing of Schengen II out of Community funds with effect from 2002."
"The initiative unfortunately forgets to submit to Parliament the Commission's half-yearly interim reports on the stage the development has reached."
"It is scarcely comprehensible that the budget procedure of the European Community should be applied to finance Schengen II without the body legislating for that budget - namely Parliament - being informed about these developments at the time."
"However much the direction taken by the report's contents may be worthy of approval, in this respect there must be clear improvement."
"Apart from that, I can only give my full and wholehearted support to the proposals as a whole."
"I crave your indulgence for having to leave in about a quarter of an hour - as indeed must other ladies and gentlemen - but we have a meeting of the Committee on Citizen' s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"We have some votes to take part in there as well."
"So there is no disrespect for this House."
"Thank you, Mr von Boetticher."
"We are aware of this problem of meetings being scheduled to take place at the same time, especially with the aforementioned Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to congratulate Mr von Boetticher on his work on the two reports that he has just presented to us."
"I should like to focus on the second report that deals with the Schengen system, which has come before Parliament not for reasons of clear political will, but because the Council has not been able to achieve unanimity on maintaining the system of intergovernmental funding, whilst a source of Community funding is also necessary."
"These are the peculiarities of our work in the European institutions: many things happen for strange reasons and as a result of stopgap solutions."
"I should like to say that this proposal to develop a new generation Schengen Information System, SIS II, can only be accepted as the first, preparatory, stage in the system' s development."
"Community funding will not solve the problems that divide us in our analyses of the functioning of the SIS."
"It is crucial, as I argued here last September, when I presented my report on Schengen, that in addition to Community funding, the Schengen Information System cannot continue to be managed in secret and on a purely intergovernmental basis. It must instead be managed at European Union level by a separate agency."
"At the same time, a single Community information system must be set up consisting of a computer network system that contains data received under the three conventions, Schengen, Europol and Customs, bearing in mind the need to keep the data held under these conventions separate."
"This is the only way in which we will be able to guarantee an adequate level of protection for personal data, which is fair and identical for all citizens, complying with the level of protection stipulated by the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Lastly, we know that the SIS is reaching saturation point with eighteen States participating, which means that it will not be able to survive beyond the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union, which also means that we must rapidly adapt the system."
"I hope that the five years we have ahead of us will be long enough to present a proposal that is balanced and which meets the demands of the European Parliament."
"Mr President, the initiative by Belgium and Sweden on the development of a second generation SIS system is underpinned by two legal bases: the decision laid down in the Treaty on European Union and the regulation laid down in the EC Treaty."
"These initiatives are the real premises of the preliminary work that must be undertaken in order to create the new SIS II system. They have come into being, as has already been stated, as a result of the rejection of intergovernmental funding by some Member States and are based on the Commission' s willingness to take the risk and the political responsibility for going ahead with the development of this new information system in the years to come."
"The SIS, which, as we know, has only been a Community instrument since 1999, has matured very quickly."
"Although it was designed for twelve Member States, it now serves thirteen plus Iceland and Norway and we now have the United Kingdom and Ireland knocking on the door."
"As we know, in the current historical circumstances, it provides a vital European source of information on citizens of third countries and assets that have disappeared or been stolen, given the immensity of the task of controlling our external borders or movement within any part of Community territory."
"With the imminence of the new round of enlargement and given the challenges of adapting the new technologies and the new requirements, of which we are all aware, it is crucial that we develop the current system by providing Community funding for its modernisation."
"The requirement for its development towards the so-called second generation SIS is, today, crucial to detecting threats arising from the situation of third-country nationals, in order to provisionally arrest criminals who qualify for extradition, to help to locate people who have disappeared or been kidnapped, to monitor dangerous individuals and to retrieve stolen goods and assets."
"I am delighted to have the support of Mr von Boetticher, who has done an excellent job. I also believe that tomorrow' s final vote on this report will produce a text on which it will be much easier for Parliament to agree on an opinion."
"Mr President, only budgetary funding can give coherence to the new Community nature of the Schengen acquis, of which the current and future information systems are a part."
"Furthermore, the new requirements for online and in tempo judicial information and cooperation should be able to guarantee the security of Europe' s citizens."
"I therefore feel, Mr President, that we must not get bogged down in the minutiae of accounting procedures or of the law."
"The important thing is that the SIS moves ahead, to the benefit of the citizens of Europe."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur for this."
"The rapporteur has produced two excellent reports. He makes a first-class contribution to the work of the committee which I have the honour to chair."
"I would like to talk very briefly about the first of these reports to do with the freedom of movement of people."
"It is essential that we have a European legal space and that we pursue its development with judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"The rapporteur quite rightly identifies the problems here and recognises that just as the single market required a massive benchmarking exercise, a massive exercise in approximation and mutual recognition, so too will the development of a European legal space require this."
"In the second report the rapporteur looks at the problems that have emerged with the Schengen Information System and the opportunity to move forward to the second version of it, which clearly will be needed with enlargement."
"We have here, in Strasbourg, with the central Schengen computer system, the most comprehensive databank in Europe."
"It must be financed from our budget. Sadly, the Belgian and Swedish initiatives, which propose a regulation for the First Pillar and a decision for the Third Pillar, show how ridiculous it is still to be operating with these two pillars."
"In particular, Article 96, which is the article governing the data on those refused entry, must be in the First Pillar."
"It contains the personal details of 1.3 million people and will contain substantially more with enlargement of the Union."
"In conclusion I would draw the House's attention to the report from Justice last year that found significant defects in data protection, poor quality of data and obstacles placed in the way of individuals seeking to correct mistakes."
"We must take account of this."
"Mr President, instead of talking here today about the approval of a new generation of the Schengen Information System SIS II, we ought much rather to be discussing the disastrous consequences of the information system we already have."
"I find it scandalous that the overwhelming majority of the persons listed in the SIS have not been charged with any criminal offence."
"Only 11 000 people have their names stored in these computers because of an arrest warrant for the purpose of deporting them, but there are 780 000 listed as barred from entering any of the EU's Member States."
"Article 99 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement states that the SIS can also be used to - as it is termed - obtain information in order to repel a significant danger originating from a specified person, or other significant dangers."
"This provision means that the names of quite blameless citizens are to be found in the SIS computers."
"This data was, for example, used in issuing demonstrators with unjustified bans on entry when the summit was held in Genoa."
"As long as this continues, we cannot give any support to the further development of this Schengen Information System."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking Mr von Boetticher for his work and also the Members who spoke after him."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for what has been gained through Parliament' s work, although we do feel that an essential element, democratic control, is missing."
"Once again, we are being forced to agree to providing Community funding, as Mr Marinho said, in order to be able to have a say as well."
"However, we feel that the European Council is continuing to do an appalling job, which, moreover, consists both of greatly increasing the number of databanks, and of greatly increasing the amount of data."
"We know that, in addition to SIS, there are the - albeit revised - Europol and Eurodac databanks etc., and the latest addition will be the databank containing the index of criminal records used by Eurojust."
"Hitherto, SIS has been a huge collection of information and notes on people and objects: it contains data entered by each Member State according to different laws and criteria which has been accessible to users at different levels of responsibility."
"Among the errors which may have already been made, consider the case of the US citizen arrested in Belgium because he had lost his passport whom SIS recorded as a passport thief."
"Reference has been made to the events in Genoa: thousands of people had been recorded in SIS after the incidents in Gothenburg, but this was of no benefit to the Italian police."
"Basically, our view is that there will not only be more States entering data in this bank but also, essentially, more data."
"Lastly, we do not believe that total control is compatible with the rule of law, as has been maintained."
"Mr President, I congratulate Mr von Boetticher."
"I am speaking on the European judicial area in civil matters."
"When the Treaty of Amsterdam entered into force, judicial cooperation in civil matters was transferred from the third pillar to the first, since when the European Community has elaborated an ambitious work programme in that area."
"A detailed examination of the GROTIUS programme led to the conclusion that a new, more general, framework for activities in this field was needed."
"The new framework regulation makes it possible to continue the projects already financed by the GROTIUS programme."
"I thoroughly welcome this draft regulation by the Commission, which is intended to create a legal basis for the financing of judicial cooperation in civil matters by the EU Budget."
"For the first time, the framework regulation also makes possible financial support for European non-governmental organisations, provided that these function on a non-profit basis and that their objectives serve to promote judicial cooperation."
"It is greatly to be welcomed that acceding countries and third countries are able to participate in all these activities."
"The limitation, proposed by the rapporteur and adopted by the Committee, to one-third of the involved Member States, is realistic and far-sighted, especially against the backdrop of the imminent enlargement up to 2006."
"This regulation does not apply in Denmark, Ireland or the United Kingdom."
"Legal practitioners in these countries can, however, participate in the projects alongside their counterparts from the acceding countries and elsewhere."
"The concept of 'legal advisers' in this regulation has a quite different background from that in the directive on money laundering."
"For that reason definition by means of a concluding list, as proposed by the rapporteur, would in this case inhibit the flexible use of this regulation in the future and limit its scope."
"This is true, in particular, because it is difficult to translate correctly into all the Community languages without giving the terms for the relevant legal profession a different meaning, especially since individual Member States might in the future add other types of legal practitioner, who would then be barred from participation."
"I would therefore prefer it if there were no list of these occupations."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is the Schengen Information System meant to achieve?"
"It aims to improve police cooperation in criminal law matters, to harmonise immigration and visa policy and to monitor the free movement of persons."
"This monitoring, though, is targeted not least at migrants, who find it impossible or virtually impossible to travel to the EU legally, and the great majority of whom are fleeing situations that the EU may well not have created on its own but has substantially helped to bring about."
"As many people have already mentioned today, the system is directed against those of the EU's citizens who incur its displeasure by wanting, for example, at a summit meeting, to express their disapproval of an EU policy which is characterised by lockouts and the capitalisation of essential areas of life."
"It is becoming clear what this update of the Schengen Information System amounts to."
"On the one hand, it is about the efficient use of the surveillance which technology and geography make possible."
"At the same time, the EU wants the mere existence of these possibilities to mean that use is actually made of them."
"Even the apparently technical changes in these proposals are also about improving the existing surveillance structure, and so this improvement needs to be financed."
"And here I must disagree with Mr Turco and say that, in my judgment, nothing whatever in this project would be changed even by democratic control."
"Seeing this from the Left, I believe this proposal cannot be supported."
"Basic freedoms perform quite different functions in capitalism."
"From a quite pragmatic point of view, though, they do guarantee the citizen a minimum of protection from the State."
"It so happens, in the present situation, that most restrictions on basic rights...."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr President, as we all know, the current Schengen Information System has been in operation since 1995 but did not become a Community resource until 1999 when the Schengen acquis was adopted by the European Union in the Treaty of Amsterdam."
"Its Community identity, therefore, implies that any proposal to replace it must be bound by the same legal considerations governing how it was set up and operates and that any extension to its purpose must be subject to full democratic scrutiny by the relevant bodies, as previous speakers have stated."
"The current climate, with the need for additional measures to safeguard our citizens and the inability of the current information system to meet that need, should not provide fertile ground for arbitrary derogations from and extensions to its powers."
"The proposed legal framework needs to clarify certain crucial issues."
"If natural persons are to be protected against personal data processing, the joint supervisory body set up in the Schengen Agreement needs to be involved."
"This authority has been commissioned to draft an annual report on how the current system functions, including a systematic review and analysis of the new data which the new system will create."
"At the same time, the European Parliament needs to step up efforts to ensure that the new system functions are monitored efficiently by calling for regular progress reports."
"The point here is that, as far as the continuing application of the Schengen Agreement is concerned, the Council has only updated the European Parliament once, meaning that Parliament is unaware of issues which impinge directly on the free and unimpeded movement of citizens or how the Union's borders are controlled."
"Finally, we also need to mention the need to adopt a Community information system consisting of a single electronic network in order to facilitate transparent data storage, management and evaluation."
"Mr President, since it started operating in 1995, the Schengen Information System has been used and is used, together with Europol, as a tool to facilitate repression at European level, to manufacture and monitor suspects, to combat resistance movements and disobedience policies and to devastate immigrants arriving in Europe looking for a place in the sun."
"It has been used with particular enthusiasm every time grass roots resistance movements have been organised against the interests chosen by the European Union, in Nice, in Gothenburg and in Genoa."
"A month ago, the European Parliament requested a progress report in which the rapporteur revealed the arbitrary nature and unreliability of the personal data recorded."
"A few days later, the European Union rushed to make this information available to the American services to help them stifle any voice of resistance anywhere in the world and spread a new imperialist war on the pretext of fighting terrorism."
"And, as if that were not enough, the recent extraordinary European Council of the European Union of the 15 gave the Americans unaccountable access to all European sources and files."
"The Schengen system, be it the first generation or the second generation which we are debating today, is a constituent element in the mechanism of repression, which is why the grass roots movement is fighting to abolish it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin with the first report by Mr von Boetticher on judicial cooperation in civil matters."
"Since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, we have, in fact, had a particularly ambitious agenda in the field of civil judicial cooperation."
"By way of example, I would say that over the last two years, five regulations in this field have already been adopted by the Council, and two other proposals are under discussion."
"Two new legislative proposals are currently being prepared by the Commission."
"The aim of this proposal is to contribute to the establishment of a European judicial area in civil matters."
"The intention is not to propose a new action programme, but to contribute to the successful implementation of the existing action plans in this field, in particular, the Tampere conclusions."
"This is why the support we suggest in these proposals is aimed not only at co-funding projects carried out by public and non-public institutions and organisations in the Member States, but also at funding Commission actions, such as actions aimed at ensuring the correct application of Community law in the civil field, which I am convinced will be of benefit to citizens."
"I am very pleased to note that Mr von Boetticher has received our proposal with approval, and I would like to congratulate him on his excellent report."
"With regard to the amendments proposed, the Commission accepts four out of the six of them."
"I am talking about the amendments on the two new recitals proposed by the Committee on Budgets, the new recital proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, and the amendments on the introduction of a definition of the term 'legal practitioner' ."
"With regard to the amendment on the specific objectives of the framework programme, I prefer to preserve the Commission' s initial proposal, because it very closely pursues the objectives set in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council."
"With regard to Amendment No 5, I well understand the rapporteur' s argument, but I believe that setting a strict threshold in relation to non-governmental organisations is also a way to promote the existence of genuine European organisations in this field."
"And I believe that the threshold we are proposing will remain practical, even in the context of the enlargement of the European Union."
"Furthermore, several non-governmental organisations in this field already play a significant role, including in a very significant number of the candidate countries."
"Mr President, in relation to the second report on the Schengen Information System, I believe that this is a key element in the operation of the area without frontiers."
"The need for a second-generation SIS was recognised some years ago."
"This need is due, above all, to the limitations of the current SIS system."
"The system only allows for the integration of 18 countries."
"This is why the enlargement of the Union requires the development of a second-generation SIS that will permit the full integration of new Member States."
"Without the SIS II we will not have the conditions appropriate for the lifting of internal border controls in the countries which are currently candidates for accession to the European Union."
"The two initiatives you are debating today confirm that the European Parliament and the Commission will henceforth have an increased role in relation to the development of the SIS II, both in this initial phase in the field of funding, and in the definition of the future architecture of the system and its specific operation."
"These two initiatives are in line with the conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council at the end of May that favoured funding the development of SIS II by means of the Community budget from 2002."
"In accordance with the two initiatives aimed at creating a committee to assist the Commission in the development of the SIS II, the European Parliament will be kept systematically informed of work in progress, by means of the institutional mechanisms for informing Parliament within the framework of commitology."
"I must stress that, at the request of the Commission, a sum has been included in the 2001 draft budget for preparatory action in relation to the development of the SIS II."
"Given that this is for preparatory action, and in accordance with the rules on the execution of the budget, the Commission really does not require a legal basis for these preliminary expenses, but it is nevertheless aware that it cannot develop the SIS II without calling on the experience of Member States in relation to the current SIS and its operation."
"This experience is absolutely essential and the implementation of commitology offers a well-established structural solution with a view to assisting the Commission in its new responsibilities relating to the development of the SIS II."
"If the principle of creating a committee to assist the Commission is acceptable, however, we would like to express our preference for a system of commitology based on the creation of an advisory committee and a management committee."
"The Commission is pleased with the amendments proposed by Mr von Boetticher in this regard, and I hope that they will be approved in plenary session."
"The Commission is also prepared to accept the European Parliament' s amendment on the delivery of a six-monthly report prepared by the Commission on the work on the development of the SIS II, not only to the Council but also to the European Parliament."
"This is not only important with regard to the principle of transparency, but also with regard to the role the European Parliament will have to play within the framework of the legislative measures necessary for the development of the SIS II, which require that the European Parliament is kept fully informed of all work in this area."
"Because, in fact, the two initiatives we are discussing today relate, above all, to the technical work involved in the implementation of the SIS II."
"This implementation also requires the adoption, when the time comes, of legislative measures based on the appropriate bases in the Treaties, which the European Parliament will be consulted on."
"These legislative measures will have to define all the essential elements of the SIS II, in particular, the purposes of the system, the categories of information to be included, the protection of information, control by a common control authority, the management of the future operational SIS II and the issue raised by Mr Coelho of whether or not to create an agency."
"The points I have just highlighted will be the subject of a later debate, when the time comes, on the basis of the results of the feasibility study to be launched by the Commission at the beginning of 2002."
"The reason that the Commission cannot support the amendments on these points today is not that we disagree with their content, but simply that to me it seems premature to deal with them within the framework of the two initiatives which are aimed solely at the funding of the development of the SIS II."
"We will have the opportunity to discuss these issues again and to make decisions, when the time comes, on the basis of legislative proposals."
"Please allow me to conclude with the following positive statement: the development of the SIS II is a task which will concern us in the years to come and which must be achieved within a reasonable timescale that will allow the new Member States to be integrated into it and to thereby create the conditions for them to participate in our common area without frontiers."
"The adoption of your opinion today, within the three months which have followed the delivery of the two initiatives, demonstrates the will and capacity of the European Parliament, of its Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and its rapporteur, to contribute to the creation of the SIS II as soon as possible."
"This gives me great pleasure."
"Public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes"
"The next item is the debate on the following report (A5-0321/2001) by Mrs Korhola, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC (COM(2000) 839 - C5-0027/2001 - 2000/0331(COD))."
"Mr President, we are currently debating a directive which concerns participation by the public in decisions which affect the environment."
"It is the second pillar in the legislative work whose purpose is to ratify, within the Community, the Aarhus Convention which was concluded in 1998."
"I wish to express my thanks for the fact that my draft report has received copious and unanimous support in many of the points which I have put forward."
"The report has, however, also stirred up some political passions."
"It must be possible to find a balance between, on the one hand, guaranteeing broad opportunities for participation by citizens, and, on the other hand, avoiding deliberate and vexatious delaying tactics."
"This task is not easy, especially as the structure of the Commission's basic proposal is very complicated."
"The vote taken the week before last in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy led to an unfortunate and illogical conclusion, which must now be rectified in plenary session so that we can correct a situation which is embarrassing from the point of view of the Parliament's reputation."
"At the moment, the report version approved in Committee contains some mutually contradictory ingredients."
"I personally feel that not enough time was available to discuss and to understand the basic starting point which I put forward, and its practical consequences."
"I stated that information gathering and public hearing concern the entire public at large, but I limited the legal safeguards following the decision to a more restricted public, in other words those whose rights are infringed by the decision."
"It was only in this point that I failed to receive the support which I had hoped for from the major groups."
"I wished to open the consultation stage to the public at large, since there is a very peculiar logic in a situation whereby an authority ends up determining in advance which part of the public a matter concerns."
"How could the authority know who will be affected by it, and in what way, before the public has been heard on the issue?"
"And if this is already known, then hearing the public is a pointless exercise."
"Such restriction is odd from the point of view of public participation, and also squanders the time and energy of the authority itself."
"Since colleagues have feared that my approach means that anyone may take an authority to court, I wish to stress that just the opposite is the case."
"It is precisely the Commission's version which - in setting demanding obligations for the authority - would achieve this result."
"In my proposal, the right of appeal is restricted solely to those whose rights are infringed by a decision, so that appeal is not used with deliberately vexatious intent."
"The opportunity to express an opinion will not automatically imply the right of appeal."
"In the Commission's proposal, the public's right of participation was restricted at all stages to that public which the matter concerns."
"I continue to hold that the Commission's proposal is misguided in this respect; its practical consequences will create needless difficulties in the work of the authorities."
"Authorities will face uncommon difficulties in establishing whom a matter concerns; this includes all civic organisations, which according to the Commission's proposal are always interested parties."
"Failure or negligence at this stage will always form grounds for taking the matter to court."
"Without a doubt, in the form proposed by the Commission these provisions are indeed open to abuse - and this abuse can also take the form of slowing down projects."
"My proposal was unusual in that it would have simultaneously benefited citizens who genuinely wish to participate, and also the authorities dealing with the matter and those players whose project was in question."
"Perhaps the matter may still be rectified when the Member States have to ponder the practical application of the matter in more detail."
"The explanation which I have given here is, in my opinion, important from the point of view of all parties who have anything to do with the directive."
"Fortunately many other matters which are important from the point of view of the Aarhus convention have been received positively."
"I have, first and foremost, wished to streamline practice by standardising the regulations concerning processing with regard to the various directives."
"In this way, it will be easier for citizens to know how to proceed, and the obligation of authorities to advise citizens will be more straightforward."
"In the Commission's proposal the modes of procedure vary slightly, and as a result it is difficult to know what one should do in any particular case."
"In addition, I have incorporated into the report some objectives which are pursuant to the Aarhus convention, which the Commission had either omitted from its proposal or simply forgotten."
"In this way the report complies better with the spirit and objectives of the convention."
"In particular, this applies to Item 5 of Article 6, and Article 8, of the Aarhus Convention."
"I would also like to thank the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Petitions for their opinions, which gave encouragement and support to my work in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Also, cooperation with the Commission and (in particular) the Council has been constructive, and bodes well for the second stage of processing of the report."
"Mr President, we would like to thank Mrs Korhola for her work on this complex document."
"In the Committee on Petitions we have a large number of petitions which relate to the particular directives concerned in this important report."
"It is very clear to us that the public want to be involved, they want to be informed and they want information in good time about particular proposals."
"We often hear complaints from the public about the lack of information, that it comes late, it is incomplete, it is difficult to understand."
"We have often found through those petitions that there are a number of Member States that have very poorly applied the directives which are mentioned here and we have seen court cases resulting from that."
"Our committee was extremely clear."
"We want the widest possible definition of ""public""."
"We have found in the issues raised with us that it is not just environmental NGOs, or people living in an area that is directly affected."
"We have come across small businesses, fishermen and others who have felt that particular schemes affect them and therefore they are interested parties."
"We also thought it was important that the area of policy should be looked at as well, because one of the questions we often get is ""what is the context of a particular development going ahead?"", particularly where that is linked at times to European Union policy, such as CAP spending and spending on the Structural Funds."
"We also find that people want access to resources in order to be able to understand the information they are given."
"Sometimes we find complaints come to our committee effectively to have those environmental impact assessments assessed, because those organisations lack the resources to fully participate within the planning process and it is vital that we look at that, certainly at Member State level."
"Mr President, full, effective participation by the public in the decision-making process in environmental matters is necessary and we support it."
"It allows the citizens to express opinions and fears that may have a bearing on the decisions to be taken and allows those responsible for taking the decisions to take them into account."
"This, in turn, increases accountability in the decision-making process and makes it more transparent, and helps to raise public awareness of environmental matters."
"As has already been said, the importance of providing greater incentives for public participation has already been recognised at international level, with the Aarhus Convention."
"The directive upon which we are going to vote tomorrow seeks to bring Community law into line with the provisions of this Convention and to smooth the way for its ratification by the Community."
"The citizens will be able to participate fully right from the initial stages of the decision-making process, especially as regards the development of plans and programmes, the environmental impact assessment process and the prevention and overall reduction of pollution."
"In this regard, I welcome the introduction by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of fresh provisions, which refer clearly to the dissemination of information through the Internet as well."
"A crucial element is that only the public concerned, citizens or groups, including NGOs, are entitled to express comments and opinions or even to appeal before a judicial body."
"While I welcome other amendments made to the text by the rapporteur, I cannot support her proposal to extend this right to the participation of all citizens, without restriction."
"A wider, less clear definition of citizens could lead to ambiguous interpretations and inappropriately hamper a project' s implementation."
"However, I support the definitions included in the Commission' s proposal, which clearly define the concept of the public concerned, which alone is entitled to express comments and opinions to the competent authority before a decision is taken within the areas covered by the directive and, where appropriate, to appeal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as far back as a few months ago, we debated an absolutely excellent report by Mrs Korhola concerning access by the general public to environmental information."
"This time, we are debating public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes."
"What these reports have in common is that the Commission' s proposals are based on what is known as the Aarhus Convention."
"According to Article 8 of this Convention, every country must endeavour to promote a situation in which, at a time when it is still possible to influence the decisions, the general public is given an effective opportunity to participate in the public authorities' work on such rules."
"According to Article 9 of the same Convention - and this is something I want to emphasise - each country undertakes, within the framework of its own national legislation, to give the public concerned the opportunity, through the courts, to have the validity of the authorities' decisions tested."
"For me as a liberal, it is obvious that the decisions made and the proposals drafted by the public authorities must, as far as possible, be made accessible to anyone interested and affected."
"Anything else would be unthinkable in a democracy."
"May I congratulate the rapporteur on this important report - a crucial element of which is the definition of participation, ensuring that people can influence plans and programmes at different stages of the process and receive proper feedback so that they know that the issues they have raised have been dealt with seriously."
"It is essential that consultation is not restricted in a way that in practice would make it meaningless - in other words, that authorities themselves could define the people who would be affected and they would be the only ones consulted."
"I have a case in Swansea in my own constituency where a local authority is building an incinerator on the border of two counties and has consulted its own constituents, but not the people of the other county who live closer to it and who will be more affected and are now protesting vigorously against the plans."
"This legislation could prevent that kind of situation arising."
"Just as important it gives the public access to a review procedure, and so I ask for support for the amendments of my group which seek to strengthen the report in line with the Aarhus Convention."
"Mr President, to advocate transparency and public participation in drawing up environmental plans and programmes is a laudable objective, which we fully agree with. However, the report gives rise to some fundamental problems."
"First of all, the possible overlapping of texts prescribing public participation and, in particular, the directives on environmental impact studies and on the prevention or reduction of pollution. Secondly, the ratification of the Aarhus Convention."
"This convention has been signed by the Community and by all the Member States, but has only been ratified by Italy or Denmark: it is therefore not in force."
"This report must not be an opportunity for the Union to replace, by means of a directive, the desire of the Member States to be bound by an international convention."
"Furthermore, to add environmental policies to the plans and programmes seems to me premature at this stage, given that the Aarhus Convention is yet to be ratified."
"There is also the concept of 'public affected' , which we are in favour of so as not to widen the scope of the text in an unrestricted fashion."
"Nevertheless, the two concepts of 'public' and 'public affected' should be able to coexist, and it should be for the Member States to decide on the most appropriate level of consultation."
"In the case of cross-border projects, for example, it would be sensible to broaden the consultation to the public as a whole."
"We will support Amendments Nos 30, 31 and 32."
"Finally, like the Commission, we believe that we should lay down the minimum conditions required in order to guarantee effective participation by the public and leave it to the Member States to regulate the practical details in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"(PPE-DE). (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, one of the complaints most frequently voiced by the public concerns the very limited role they are given to play in representative democracy."
"Our citizens complain that they are given the right to vote every now and then, but that they do not enjoy full rights of participation in the day-to-day activities of the institutions for which they vote: at European level, at national level, and at regional and local level."
"It is precisely in the area of the environment that the dissatisfaction of communities has been most keenly felt. When they disagree, often rightly so, with a particular project, their only option is to express their anger on the streets or in the courts."
"This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds."
"It is, therefore very important that, as a follow-up to the Aarhus Convention, the Commission has produced legislation on public access to environmental information, on public participation in certain plans, programmes and policies and on public access to justice."
"Greater public participation not only gives greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions; it can also improve their quality."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the work she has done on this proposal for a directive on public participation in drafting environmental plans and programmes, especially for having sought, by means of various amendments, to extend citizens' rights and to eliminate some ambiguities."
"There is nevertheless one subject on which I disagree with Mrs Korhola. Public consultation will only be feasible if the definition of 'the public' is not too vague."
"I therefore prefer the Commission' s approach, which defines the public affected by a given project as the target of consultation and not the rapporteur' s choice of a broader and, therefore, vaguer definition of the public."
"Mr President, I share the European Commission' s opinion that actual public participation in environmental decision-making is beneficial."
"After all, the public is given the opportunity of expressing its opinion, along with any concerns it may have."
"The decision-makers are given the chance to take these into account when taking decisions."
"In short, public participation will contribute to the transparency of the decision-making process and the acceptance of the outcome, namely the plans and programmes."
"However, broadening participation to include policy-making, as proposed by the rapporteur, is taking matters a step too far, since policy-making is not specific enough for public participation."
"Also, 'policy-making' is not a category that falls within the scope of the present 'environmental impact assessment' directive."
"The objective of the present directive is to render basic procedures concerning public participation consistent in all Member States and to ensure that they are carried out in the same way within the Community."
"However, it is also a minimum obligation."
"It will thus become apparent upon implementation that discrepancies between the Member States exist after all."
"Mr President, as many speakers have already said, the intentions behind this report are extremely commendable, particularly the aim of making it possible for the citizens to have a say in the process of establishing environmental rules."
"This point was discussed during the March plenary and it was already clear then that attitudes towards the methodologies and towards the influence of this participation too vary from North to South, so to speak."
"Indeed, the northern countries have a different attitude towards this type of involvement, towards the idea of this type of participation from the countries of central and southern Europe."
"The rapporteur, clearly inspired by the way things work in her country, which is possibly democratically more developed, more advanced than others - proposes participation that is too peremptory, too authoritarian, participation that could ultimately slow down, if not block or paralyse certain decision-making processes, upon which there will never be total convergence between the direct democratic base and what is known as the authority, that is the administration appointed to deal with these issues."
"There you are: this authority must also take into clear consideration all the demands and comments of those who have to build, sell and create tourist, sporting and cultural concerns - in short, daily activities - in the environment."
"Considering that this second debate contains points and issues which involve legality and access to levels of justice, including in the event of appeals, the roles and responsibilities must be quite clearly, fairly and unambiguously defined in terms of who the actors should be and how much influence they should have."
"The Aarhus Convention has been cited: that is all very well - we support it - but it must not be taken as Gospel."
"It too must allow for a healthy subsidiarity, for customs, for habits, and for the level of directly democratic involvement possible in the various countries."
"In any case, I congratulate the rapporteur, who has put in an enormous amount of work, but I feel that there should be some adaptation, as I said at the beginning, to the different attitudes."
"Mr President, may I begin by saying that this proposal deals with the second pillar of this convention involving public participation in environmental decision-taking."
"In addition to this proposal on access to environmental information, there are other pieces of Community legislation which already incorporate the principle of the Aarhus Convention."
"The Commission will ensure that the Aarhus elements are built into all future proposals."
"Public participation has to become a fully integrated part of environmental decision-taking."
"To reach that objective, our proposals have to be easy to put into practice, so that they may be smoothly implemented in the different administrative systems of the Member States."
"The question whether participation in decision-taking should aim at the public at large or the ""public concerned"" is a key point, and it has been addressed by a number of Members who have just spoken."
"In accordance with the Aarhus Convention, the Commission proposes to ensure that the public at large is fully informed about planned developments which might affect them, whilst giving the right to participate in the decision-taking process to those having an interest in or likely to be affected by the developments, that is, the ""public concerned."""
"Some of the proposed amendments, and indeed what has been said by some Members just now, seems to imply that by using the definition, ""the public concerned"", both the convention and the Commission are deliberately restricting the rights of citizens, but may I be permitted to point out that is certainly not the case."
"It is not correct."
"This proposal is aimed at extending the rights of citizens."
"There is no question of restricting those rights."
"By defining the ""public concerned"", we are focusing the attention of the competent authorities on the need to take account of those citizens most directly affected."
"The definition will confirm both the right to express a view and the right to be heard."
"The definition of ""public concerned"" is sufficiently detailed to ensure that there is no doubt who should be involved."
"Therefore members of the public could argue that they had been unjustifiably excluded."
"That would be difficult with a more general definition of the public."
"The inclusion of NGOs within the definition of the ""public concerned"" will ensure that a more general public view may be taken into account."
"On a more practical level, the definition of ""public concerned"" has been used without major problems in existing legislation - for example the environmental impact assessment directive - for a number years."
"There have been no problems raised as a result of people having been excluded by the use of the definition - at least no major problems."
"In short, this approach will give those affected by new developments the right to influence decisions which will not just affect their environment but which may also affect their economic and social conditions."
"For those reasons, the Commission, regrettably, cannot support the amendments seeking to replace the concept of the ""public concerned""."
"Amendment No 26 seeks to extend considerably the scope of Article 1, so as to cover plans and programmes not only in the environmental field but also in other sectors."
"The Commission's view is that this would make the scope of the proposal less well-defined and also that the measures proposed would lead to legal confusion."
"There would in effect be a duplication of measures in different pieces of legislation each seeking to do the same thing, but in an inconsistent manner."
"In particular, for plans and programmes in other sectors that may have significant environmental effects, Directive 2001/42 on strategic environmental assessment already incorporates measures of particular relevance."
"The directive provides for environmental assessment of relevant plans and programmes in many integration sectors and envisages public participation fully in line with the Aarhus requirements."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 12 aim to give effect to a best endeavour clause under the Aarhus Convention and are formulated in a non-binding way."
"Amendment No 9 introduces public participation concerning policies in its heading, but the text does not contain operational provisions in this respect."
"In formulating the proposal, the Commission's objective has been to incorporate the binding provisions of the Aarhus Convention."
"The Commission's view is that there would be no added value in taking up its soft-law provisions."
"Not only the Community but all Member States have signed the Aarhus Convention and so already have to take into account the soft-law provisions."
"The Commission, regrettably, cannot accept Amendments Nos 7 and 11 which provide for access to justice concerning public participation in plans and programmes."
"The Aarhus Convention does not explicitly require this, neither does the directive on strategic environmental assessment of plans and programmes provide for access to justice."
"The Commission is however considering possible further legislative proposals in relation to the third Aarhus pillar on access to justice."
"In conclusion, may I now confirm the Commission's position on the amendments."
"The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 15, 18, 25, 28 and 29."
"In addition, Amendments Nos 9, 13, 14, 23 and 27 can be accepted in part and Amendments Nos 4, 5, 10 and 17 in principle."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 16, 20, 21 and 22."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is in our common interest, which is the interest of the European citizen after all, to have this proposal enter into force swiftly."
"Only once the frameworks are established can public participation in decision-making become a fully integrated administrative practice."
"The English interpretation was not able to follow my speech and thus all the other languages based on that interpretation were incomplete."
"I regret this."
"It has happened many times so I urge you to see that the quality of interpretation is improved as soon as possible."
"Thank you, Mrs Korhola, we have taken note."
"We know that our relay interpreting system causes problems now and again."
"We have taken very good note and this should not happen again."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0324/2001) by Mr Schmidt, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending:"
"I. Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses [7551/1/2001 - C5-0296/2001 - 1998/0243(COD)]"
"II."
"Directive 85/611/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS) [7550/1/2001 - C5-0295/2001 - 1998/0242(COD)]"
"Mr President, let this be the end of twelve years' debate of the 'UCITS Directive' !"
"In February of last year, we had the first reading."
"One and a half years' later, in July, the common position was finally adopted, and now it is our turn."
"As you know, the first proposal concerns the UCITS itself and what investments it may engage in."
"The second updates and extends the rules relating to the actual management of the funds."
"Both proposals were broadly supported by Parliament at first reading."
"A total of 37 amendments were adopted for the two proposals."
"Of these, 30 have been accepted in full or in part by the Council."
"As for UCITS-1, the Council wholly or partially approved 20 of Parliament' s 24 amendments."
"Moreover, it has made a number of changes of its own."
"The most important concerns OTC derivatives, the use of which the Commission opposed from the start."
"However, Parliament considered that OTC derivatives could be employed more broadly, but according to stringent criteria."
"The Council adopted the same policy."
"In several cases, the Council adopted a still more prudent approach than Parliament on the issue of OTC derivatives and considered that investments in these had to fulfil more stringent qualitative criteria."
"Where comitology is concerned, the common position does include comitology provisions in the field of financial services. I nonetheless want to stress that there is no obvious link to the subsequent proposals made by the group chaired by Mr Lamfalussy."
"The 1985 directive created the so-called UCITS Contact Committee which was set up to advise the Commission."
"The extension of the Contact Committee' s powers to include new powers was foreseen in the original proposal."
"Parliament accepts parts of the proposal, but not the part concerning the adjustment of limit values, as adopted by the Council."
"In the same way, both the Commission and the Council accepted Parliament' s request to limit the scope of the delegation to the Committee."
"In my view, Parliament has thus agreed to the use of comitology and, moreover, successfully amended the scope of its powers."
"I do not therefore see any reason to re-open this issue at this juncture."
"There is nonetheless an amendment from Mr Goebbels, Mr Jonckheer and Mr Herzog."
"Should it be adopted, I am afraid that we should be facing conciliation and not knowing where it might end."
"The Lamfalussy agreement is in danger of being delayed and the UCITS directive of being halted in its tracks."
"That is something that no one can want to see happen."
"I hope that Mr Goebbels is able to share my view."
"Turning to UCITS-2, the Council has, for the most part, accepted the concerns expressed by Parliament at first reading."
"Ten out of Parliament' s 13 amendments have been incorporated in part or in full."
"The most contentious issue was that of the capital requirement for management companies."
"The compromise finally reached by the Council is, broadly speaking, in line with Parliament' s stance."
"Given how complicated these two directives are and how quickly the market is developing, the committee proposes a review of the rules within the next three years."
"There are two reasons for this."
"First of all, the compromise reached in Council is a very fragile one, and it would not serve anybody' s interests to open the Pandora' s box of detailed, technical or politically sensitive amendments."
"A conciliation would delay this review, for which there is already a need, and it might also stop the legislation from ever seeing the light of day."
"Secondly, the two common positions strike a good balance between investor protection and investment freedom."
"As I say, the majority of those changes we proposed last time have been introduced."
"There are nonetheless certain unresolved issues."
"In my opinion, these are better tackled in a wider context."
"The committee was kind enough to follow my recommendations."
"There is therefore only one amendment to UCITS-1, setting out some guidelines for a future review process."
"A 'grandfather' clause is also proposed, whereby existing funds should not have to comply with the new legislation for a transitional period."
"There is also an amendment to UCITS-2, seeking to align the review period for the capital requirement with the general review."
"Following the committee' s reading, I have been in contact with the Council, as recently as a few hours ago, and also with the Commission."
"Together with Mr Goebbels, I am therefore tabling a new amendment to reduce the transitional period."
"In this way, it will be possible to introduce the UCITS directive into the Member States by 2005, that is to say the year in which the financial action plan is to be implemented."
"The purpose of this is to avoid conciliation."
"The work on renewing the regulations governing UCITS has been going on for as long as twelve years and is a clear example of why decision-making within this area needs to be reformed."
"If Europe is to have a chance of competing with, for example, the American economy, it will have to be possible for changes of a more technical nature to take place significantly more simply and quickly."
"There is now a good balance between a well-functioning market and reasonably secure protection for consumers."
"Parliament has been proactive and shown an ability to act quickly and to compromise when it really counts."
"May we continue along that route!"
"Well thought-out, prompt and effective legislation - that is what Europe needs."
"I want to end by thanking everyone involved: the Commissioner, his efficient and friendly colleagues and my fellow MEPs who have all really shown willing during this difficult period."
"I hope that, tomorrow, we can thus draw a line under twelve years' work for the benefit of Europe' s consumers and investors."
"Mr President, to tie in with the rapporteur' s closing words, I wish to thank everyone who has taken part and especially the Commission staff for their help."
"The issue of concern to us, however technical it is, is of extraordinary political and social importance because it is widely known that undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), including pension funds, are currently the preferred form of saving for the majority of European citizens."
"The first problem we came up against was that there were two directives: one called a 'product' directive, which allowed these bodies to invest in products from which they were hitherto denied access, and another, which proposed substantially increasing capital requirements."
"Both the Commission and Parliament were tempted to immediately adopt the so-called 'product' directive and delay the adoption of the so-called 'management' directive."
"This Parliament warned that it was dangerous to allow these undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities - which, I repeat monopolise the market in public savings - to move into deeper waters without any guarantee that their ships were prepared for what would be a more daring day' s sailing than they had hitherto embarked on."
"As the rapporteur indicated, the purpose of the first discussion - and I am limiting myself here to the product directive - was to decide what they could invest in."
"He referred to non-standardised derivatives, index funds, the cascade effect, etc., which are technical issues that I will not go into now."
"What I do want to say is that, in my group' s opinion, a balance has been achieved between giving greater opportunities to management bodies and, therefore, greater opportunities to investors and the protection, the caution, that must be present in any discussion of such delicate matters."
"Parliament wanted to send a message to the Commission."
"As on previous occasions, Parliament wants to be flexible on the adoption of the directives of the financial services action plan."
"We want this directive to be adopted rapidly and we do not, therefore, want to have to go to conciliation."
"We have therefore, limited our amendments to one - which I personally am not in favour of, although I will be voting for it - which consists of creating a 'grandfather' clause, in other words, creating a transitional period so that currently existing bodies have additional time in which to raise their capital."
"Mention has been made of another amendment by Mr Goebbels, which he is going to withdraw, but I think it is extraordinarily intelligent and is the second message that Parliament is sending to the Commission."
"The first, I repeat, is not tabling amendments that cannot be accepted by the Council and the Commission."
"The second, even though we are not involved in a Lamfalussy procedure, is to warn that we will always have to be flexible. We will always show willingness to be flexible on the legislative procedure, but we are not prepared to concede the codecision powers that Parliament has taken such a long time to gain."
"Mr President, I will try to make up for the time which Mr García-Margallo has used. I would simply like, on behalf of my group, to express our support for the proposals of Mr Olle Schmidt, and I congratulate him on his arduous work as rapporteur for the European Parliament."
"We support the two amendments he has tabled."
"I have personally, along with some other fellow Members, tabled another amendment."
"We are, in all likelihood, going to withdraw that agreement, depending on the replies which Commissioner Bolkestein is soon to give us."
"We believe - and there are many of us; I believe I can speak for Mr García-Margallo and others - that the balance between the Council and the European Parliament as co-legislators was upset at Stockholm."
"The Commission must re-establish that balance."
"We await concrete proposals from the Commissioner."
"I just wish to say on behalf of the Liberal Group that I very much hope Mr Goebbels and his colleagues will withdraw their amendment."
"We do not believe that the amendment insisting on call-back is appropriate to this particular piece of legislation, which my colleague Olle Schmidt has described as being very carefully balanced after the common position of the Council."
"Nor is it appropriate in the context of the ongoing discussions over Lamfalussy."
"Indeed, I would go as far to say that by insisting on call-back, which was not a phrase which appeared in Parliament's second resolution on this subject after the Stockholm Council, we risk calling into question our bona fides in the lengthy negotiations which some of us have undertaken with Mr Bolkestein."
"I very much hope, therefore, that the people who have put forward this amendment will withdraw it, and that discussions will take place in an appropriate place."
"We should not try to call into question this piece of legislation."
"I believe it should be put through as is."
"I too very much hope that Mr Goebbels is going to withdraw Amendment No 4."
"You want call-back, Mr Goebbels, I want call-back and so does Mr Bolkestein."
"The fact remains that it is not feasible to have a legal call-back within the terms of the Treaty."
"Therefore, it is up to us to find a political agreement and a form of words which will do until 2004 when we can review this whole issue."
"Indeed I believe the Commission is committed to such a review."
"It is vitally important that we come to this agreement."
"On Mr Schmidt's report, it is excellent to see the modernisation of the framework for UCITS by the inclusion of derivatives and OTC derivatives."
"Parliament is leading the way on this, and Mr Schmidt has played a particularly successful role in updating the directives in this way and very much led the way on the derivatives issue."
"I am sorry to see the capital requirements in the form that they are."
"I believe that UCITS managers should be subject to capital requirements, but I do not believe those contained in the directive are sufficiently risk-sensitive."
"I do not believe that they are consistent with the general framework that we hope to implement."
"I do not think that assessing capital according to risk under management actually reflects the risk undertaken."
"I am also concerned that this formulation of the directive will produce an uneven market opening, leaving the market closed in one Member State and open in the other 14."
"But I have been persuaded by the rapporteur and our esteemed shadow rapporteur not to table amendments on these defects because we are very keen to get these two directives on the statute book to modernise the framework for a unit trust and UCITS in the European Union."
"I commend the directive to the House."
"Mr President, I refer to the common position on Directive 1998/242 and the capital requirements that it will impose on investment management firms."
"In Scotland, there is a long tradition of investment management going back to the opening of the American west in the 19th century."
"These investment managers were usually law firms, private partnerships, which managed the assets of their clients very successfully."
"To this day, there are investment firms of this type, private partnerships, sole proprietorships and other structures with limited capital."
"The interests of clients are fully safeguarded as their assets are held by independent and fully capitalised and regulated depositories."
"It is largely irrelevant to set capital requirements on the investment management firms themselves."
"I am relieved that the Council has reduced slightly the capital requirements set by this Parliament at first reading and has set a top limit of EUR 10 million."
"But this is still substantial for private partnerships and sole proprietorships."
"Incidentally, the largest and most successful firms in America and in the world - Fidelity is a good example - are exactly of this type."
"The requirements of this type will be a hurdle for new enterprising entrants into an industry which requires a regular injection of new blood."
"At the very least, it should provide for this capital to be available by means of guarantees from banks or by insurance policies to cover professional and operational risk."
"But the common position, for some not very apparent reason, restricts such cover to only 50% of the requirement."
"Why?"
"The common position provides for the Commission to report on this matter within five years of entry into force of the directive."
"I should like to put on record now the request that such a report should specifically consider whether any capital requirement at all is necessary for investment management companies, and certainly that it should be greatly reduced."
"Mr President, while, in many areas, the European legislation which we produce here is often openly criticised - quite rightly - we should recognise that the 1985 directive on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities was, for once, a masterpiece."
"The success it has had in the investment fund sector and with the clients of these funds bears witness to this."
"It has also become an example for legislation on a world scale."
"Since it entered into force in 1989, not only have the assets of the UCITSs increased dramatically, but also cross-border trade has developed very strongly."
"It has therefore achieved the objectives it was intended for."
"However, if, after ten years, this directive needs a 'facelift' in order to adapt to the evolution of the markets, to the increasingly sophisticated financial products available, I remain concerned about the fate of the older funds, which do not meet the new demands."
"That is why I had advocated a clause for these funds, a so-called 'grandfather' clause, which would be unrestricted."
"Also in this field there are acquired rights, which it would be unfair to modify in a backdated fashion."
"If there is no such clause, there will be a significant risk of market insecurity, which would have disastrous effects on the performance of the funds, prejudicing not only the industry but also the investors."
"And above all, the weaker consumers, who do not keep so up-to-date with financial matters and who therefore react more slowly to them, will be the most affected."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has finally expressed its preference for a clause which is restricted in time."
"This is the lesser evil, even if this clause may have negative effects, in terms of competition, for the older UCITSs, all of which will probably not be able to adapt to the new provisions of the directive in the best operational and financial conditions."
"Mr President, I therefore hope that the House will vote in favour of this restricted clause."
"Please allow me to point out that I am also opposed to the amendment by Mr Goebbels, which would have the effect of delaying, indeed sacrificing, the modified directive, which we are able to live with, despite its shortcomings - but it would appear to be a lost cause from the outset."
"Mr Goebbels would do well, I believe, to withdraw his amendment."
"He can put it in cold storage until there is a better occasion to table it once again."
"I should like to begin by saying that the Commission would firstly like to thank very much the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt."
"On behalf of my staff - about whom Mr Schmidt had some extremely kind words to say - I thank the rapporteur, and the Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their extremely constructive approach on these important files."
"The common positions are crucial elements for delivering the FSAP - the financial services action plan - on time, in other words, by the year 2003 for an integrated European Union for securities markets and 2005 overall."
"These proposals, taken as a whole, represent a highly delicate and complex compromise which the Commission fully supports, as does European industry."
"That is an important fact to bear in mind."
"Given the capitalisation of the UCITS market - nearly EUR 4 trillion - the expected benefits to be had are large."
"Firstly, the proposals will widen the set of financial instruments eligible to be used in UCITS portfolios while enhancing risk management requirements."
"Thus they will provide greater financial diversity while keeping the original concept, namely risk diversification with the highest standards of investor protection."
"Secondly, the management companies which generally run these savings schemes will enjoy a European passport and will be allowed to provide additional services to customers who request, for example, individual management of their assets."
"But they will have to comply with a comprehensive set of requirements and rules."
"Thirdly, investor information will be strongly improved by detailed disclosure of risk profiles, along with a fully harmonised, simplified prospectus to play the role of a single, investor-friendly pan-European marketing tool."
"Now I come to the amendments tabled."
"I should like to stress that the provisions contained in the first three amendments, namely the twin review clauses and the grandfathering clause, pose some difficulties for us - not because of the substance, but with the timetables proposed in each case."
"We would much prefer a single deadline for both, that is, 2005 - the date of the conclusion of the financial services action plan, which we think would be more logical."
"However, in a spirit of compromise and because we must now lay this matter to rest after twelve years of discussion, and in recognition of the efforts this Parliament has undertaken, also considering the last amendment of the rapporteur with would shorten the grandfathering period foreseen in Amendment No 1, the Commission will, in the end, support Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"I now turn to Amendment No 4, which would introduce a so-called ""call-back"" clause regarding the UCITS Contact Committee."
"I should like to be clear that this is not acceptable to the Commission. We believe that it would not be acceptable for the Council either."
"It is not acceptable to the Commission because firstly, the clause which has been tabled is not compatible with Article 202 of the Treaty, as Mr Goebbels knows full well."
"It is also in contradiction with existing comitology rules. Of that, Mr Goebbels is also aware."
"(Interruption from Mr Goebbels) Not before 2004, Mr Goebbels, as I have explained on behalf of the Commission many, many times."
"The second reason why this amendment is not acceptable to the Commission is that the UCITS Contact Committee's mandate was discussed by Parliament at first reading."
"Parliament then gave its full support to the mandate of the UCITS Contact Committee."
"Indeed, the first common position fully incorporated what this Parliament wanted."
"So I suggest that Mr Goebbels does not back-track on what Parliament has previously agreed."
"The third reason why that amendment is unacceptable to the Commission is that accepting it would lead to an institutional dispute in conciliation and seriously put at risk the adoption of both directives."
"That is the last thing the Commission and - I assume - this Parliament would want."
"So let us agree on Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3."
"In particular, I would address the following words to Mr Purvis, who referred to the United States' system, which is different from the European system. Depositing is fundamental for the European system."
"We are going to consider updating, following the Ecofin Council of December that the European form of UCITS need capital because they cannot assume debts in order to provide themselves with working capital."
"That is possible in the United States."
"Therefore the need to provide such undertakings in the United States with capital is less than in Europe."
"Once again, the European undertakings cannot use debts for their working capital and therefore must provide themselves with capital."
"I believe the vote will be taken tomorrow and I hope we can now agree to Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3 and to the proposals as such."
"This would allow us to move ahead constructively for the sake of European investors, European industry and the European economy."
"I hope that after twelve years of discussions these proposals can now find their way to the statute book."
"Thank you, Commissioner Bolkestein."
"The debate is closed"
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"International monetary system"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0302/2001) by Mr Goebbels on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the international monetary system."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, according to the International Monetary Fund, the world experienced 120 monetary crises between 1975 and 2000."
"A monetary crisis is defined as the depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in one year."
"It was always the real economy that paid the price for this financial instability."
"Less growth, less employment and more misery accompany financial crises."
"We should therefore view the need for financial stability as being in the public good."
"Public authorities are called upon to prevent, or otherwise to manage as best they can, any crisis."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has commissioned me to produce this own-initiative report."
"I have experienced some difficulties with the rules laid down by the Bureau of our Parliament."
"My report was too long, as if it was possible to deal with the complexity of international monetary relations in five pages."
"The Meltzer report, in the American Congress, was some one hundred pages long."
"The Meltzer committee, made up of congressmen, scientists, bankers and trade unionists inspired a lively international debate."
"My humble report, and the motion for a resolution, will certainly not inspire a similar debate."
"In order to carry more weight, our Parliament should have followed a procedure similar to that of the American Congress, that is, by means of a collective report, with detailed proposals."
"The motion for a resolution is restricted to certain essential issues."
"My report hinges on the notions of transparency and accountability, regulation and solidarity."
"In 2000, the private sector transferred about twenty times more resources to the developing countries than the World Bank and the other multilateral banks."
"Open financial markets will lead to significant increases in efficiency for world exchanges so long as they are provided with a better framework."
"The international financial institutions must become truly universal."
"The monetary fund must become more democratic."
"The super majority of 95% must be abolished for all important decisions."
"It gives a right of veto to the United States and to the Union, if it is also able to unite within the International Monetary Fund."
"A regular rise in quotas and the issuing of special drawing rights is needed, in accordance with the growth of the world economy."
"Common rules and standards should be applied on an international level."
"We need a legal and judicial framework allowing for the rapid resolution of insolvency crises."
"The private sector should be involved in the management of crises, in particular by means of the general application of collective action clauses."
"This involvement should extend to the freezing of debt service payments."
"This will allow a reduction in moral uncertainties and in the cost of restructuring programmes."
"Better prevention of crises requires increased supervision of off-balance sheet operations."
"In particular, we must toughen the prudential requirements imposed on banks when they serve to offset hedge funds."
"Europe must become more active in international bodies."
"In this respect, the ECB must be more involved."
"The European system of central banks must be designed as a body for coordinating the Union' s supervision and control authorities."
"One of the conclusions of my report is that the Tobin tax will not work."
"In fact it would have terrible economic consequences."
"Why penalise transactions between strong currencies, which make up more than 95% of international currency transactions, on the basis of a desire to prevent speculation against the currencies of developing countries."
"The Chilean encaja would achieve better results."
"Nevertheless, I welcome the decision of the ECOFIN Council to invite the Commission to prepare a report on this issue which I hope will make the decision much more objective."
"My report puts great stress on the need to settle the problem of third-world debt as soon as possible."
"This debt should be partly cancelled and partly rescheduled, so as to allow the developing countries to repay the amounts up to a limit of 5% of their annual exports."
"The London Agreement of 1953 laid down such provisions in favour of Germany."
"This was the basis of the German post-war economic miracle."
"This could also be the basis for a new economic partnership between all nations, the beginning of a true globalisation."
"Settling the problem of third-world debt would allow the internal development of these countries and would cement the victory against poverty and ignorance and therefore against intolerance and terrorism."
"Mr President, one could, with reference to Mr Goebbels' report, say that it was worth it in the end."
"It is an own-initiative report dating back as far as 1999, when it was prompted by the crises in Asia, Russia and Brazil."
"In the meantime, there has been a succession of further small crises, and we have got on with our work."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, our group wholeheartedly agreed with the basic line taken by the rapporteur, not least because you, Mr Goebbels, took up a clear position on the Tobin tax."
"The international monetary system is undergoing transformation, as is clear from your report."
"We want to bring proposals into this process of transformation, but we can also see that the euro has firmly established itself since 1999 and has fully proved itself as an anchor giving stability to the global economy."
"That in itself is an important contribution by Europe to stabilising the international monetary system."
"Mr Goebbels has done a sound job of work, something I want to emphasise here today."
"For that reason, we are in substantial agreement with his proposals: the improved supervision of banking, surveillance of international financial activities, greater powers for international bodies such as the IMF and the World Bank to really get to grips with crisis situations."
"As you have just said, the IMF must become more democratic."
"Above all else, it must fit into the overall scheme of things so that it does not become the bogeyman of crisis management."
"Of course, the states must work together in this, for financial means alone will not overcome crises."
"We agree with closer collaboration at international level between national supervisory and regulatory authorities, a stronger coordinating role for the European Central Bank, something that has still not been resolved, and which we would remind you is overdue - the establishment of an observatory for systemic risks at the Bank for International Cooperation, and continued efforts at reform of the international monetary system."
"We share Mr Goebbels' view - contested in their proposals by our Green colleagues - that the Tobin tax does not belong in this report."
"Looking through the proposals, I noted that the Group of the Party of European Socialists also, according to Amendment No 10, wants this to be checked up on, even though it does refer to an ECOFIN Council resolution."
"On that point we take a completely different view."
"We agree with your basic approach and we will be asking for a separate vote on this subject."
"Introducing such a tax, whose technical problems cannot in any case be resolved, would imperil the transfer of capital and thus also put at risk the advantages of global division of labour, investment and employment."
"That is why we are opposed to it, but will vote for your report without a Tobin tax, and against it with one."
"Mr President, thank you for your willingness to allow us this pleasure late in the evening."
"On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report."
"We support this report because it gives the right solutions to the issues of the new financial architecture which must be created, of reform as a whole and of crisis management - solutions which also deal practically with the needs of regions hit by crises, the requirements of international financial markets and the very important need of all societies for stability in financial markets."
"I would like to emphasise again that I believe stability in financial markets to be a public good to which all citizens are entitled."
"Taking a look at the situation we are in, I cannot resist making an observation."
"International financial activity on the currency markets has, in fact, decreased to around USD 1 200 billion a day, and that is due to the creation of the monetary union, which is of course one of the levers of the flows of capital that are quantitatively scarcely manageable."
"At the same time, though, we must note that during the course of the nineties we were dealing with a twenty-five-fold turnover increase in derivative trading such as swaps, options and so on."
"We know that, now, not even 3% of the transactions have to do with the real market in goods and services."
"I believe it to be important that we should look at the flow of capital under the influence of globalisation in terms both, on the one hand, of the yield accruing to institutional investors and of the economic and social situation, and on the other, from the point of view of the capital-importing countries."
"In this connection, we have to bear in mind that 75% of the capital invested flows into only twelve states, and that only 1% of the capital invested flows to black Africa."
"The rapporteur is right to demand that we now move to a consolidation, and that can only be done if we write off debt more comprehensively than we have done before."
"Functioning globalised financial markets are no doubt advantageous."
"Presupposing stable development, they contribute to growth and employment."
"Despite that, there are still economic and social deficits and a lack of regulation and supervision."
"The report points that out."
"Concern about speculative commitments to the detriment of the real economy and the excessive volatility of the market brought about by an enormous increase in transaction volume for certain financial products are factors which make a reform of the international financial architecture more necessary than ever."
"We have lived through 120 currency crises, and they cannot be abolished."
"We have not yet succeeded in developing a working system of early warning indicators, in making information transparent and in drawing up a code of conduct that works for everyone, and we have not yet solved the problem of moral hazard."
"So I consider it very important that this report's demands should influence the EU's negotiations, and the EU, too, must speak with one voice at the international level."
"It is not just about us having a monetary zone, but we must also speak with one voice internationally on financial market policy and on issues of the world's financial architecture."
"The introduction of the euro is a contribution to financial stability, and our financial system is better protected against external shocks, but we must move on, for the monetary union is only one contribution to stability in Europe and the world."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report."
"We, in the Liberal Group, welcome the thrust of the report, because it grapples with the real issues and it avoids the sort of populist solutions which, I am afraid, are on offer in many of the amendments before this House."
"I am particularly thinking of the Tobin tax."
"It is, of course, the case that nobody, particularly liberals in favour of free inquiry, could object to the Commission's study on this subject."
"But I frankly believe that this is a false promise which really offers very little practical benefit to the countries that we are all, I hope, trying to help."
"Instead, the report quite correctly identifies as a potential model, the Chilean deposit system, which introduces an incentive for investors to invest long-term in an emerging market rather than going for short term paper because that involves a longer-term investment for depositors."
"That is the right way to go, and therefore I very much congratulate the rapporteur and hope that we will not support the amendments to an excellent report."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to thank Mr Goebbels for all the energy and intellect he has invested in his report."
"We regret that the motion for a resolution presented to us does not in the end meet the expectations of the explanatory statement which he had drawn up, and that is why we have thought it appropriate to introduce certain amendments aimed at reinforcing the political message of the report."
"The first category of amendments relates to the 'organisational' aspect of the International Monetary Fund, which we believe to be currently in an unacceptable situation."
"That is why we are taking up an idea put forward by Jacques Delors, in this case that of an economic and social security council within the United Nations."
"We would like the Commission and the Council to express their views on this issue at the Council to be held next spring in Barcelona."
"Furthermore, we believe that the decision-making procedures and the composition of the governing body of the International Monetary Fund should be substantially reviewed."
"The second great area on which we would like to express our view is the need to combat terrorism, which has an extremely important financial dimension."
"This is why we feel there is an additional reason to make the recommendations of the FATF binding and to increase its mandate, as also requested by the European Council in Ghent."
"I believe that this would supplement the report."
"Finally, with regard to capital flows - in particular exchange operations - I will say no more, personally, about the Tobin tax, but I will nevertheless continue to demand an in-depth debate on taxes which could discourage speculative assaults on the currencies of a number of countries."
"In this respect, I believe there are some interesting proposals that deserve to be supported."
"Mr President, despite the flashy title of this report - 'How the international monetary system can be made to work better' - these insipid formulae are certainly not going to prevent future crises."
"The only purpose of this report is to justify an economic system which is irrational, anarchic and socially unjust."
"You, the defenders of capitalism, are totally incapable of regulating this economy which is based on the quest for profit and competition."
"Because it cannot be regulated."
"The only imaginable regulation is that which the most powerful impose on others, but they do so to their own benefit."
"The desire to democratise the IMF, which is controlled by the United States, is also ridiculous."
"The rapporteur recognises that the risk of financial instability is inherent to the operation of the economy."
"This is undoubtedly the case for your capitalist economy, but the seizure of social wealth and the means of production by a limited number of financial and industrial groups, their rivalry and their speculation, will come to an end."
"For future generations, the immense wastage and patent stupidity of your economy will serve as a demonstration that, in relation to the control of its collective life, humanity had not yet moved beyond barbarism."
"Mr President, the rapporteur deserves support in his endeavours to achieve greater financial stability."
"He is right to call for tighter supervision, although that does not rule out a crisis."
"Interestingly, the strategy of the International Monetary Fund has shifted towards more focused support."
"This role of catalyst in stages of growth can preclude negative effects of the policy, such as an increase in the burden of debt for up-and-coming countries."
"The rapporteur' s request to coordinate a number of matters at European level is understandable."
"If these do not follow naturally on from global policies, Europe' s own policy would undermine the strength of the system as a whole."
"Finally, I cannot see a role for the European Central Bank in global crisis prevention."
"Only a few months ago, the ECB was asked to absorb the slow-down in growth, although there was no reason to reduce interest rates within Europe."
"Striking a compromise between European policy and global requirements does not seem to be benefiting international stability."
"Mr President, the large number of monetary crises and the negative consequences they have for the global economy as a whole require joint action."
"There are many who believe that the introduction of a tax on global financial transactions could prevent future financial crises."
"Personally, I am glad that this opinion is not held by many in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"I do not believe that introduction of the Tobin tax could prevent financial crises."
"Let capital make its way to where it is of the greatest use, in other words, let it be invested in new markets, developing countries and so on. By that means, growth can be produced."
"If we now make the transfer of capital expensive and limit and regulate it, the effect would only be counter-productive."
"Introducing it would also make sense only if it could be done internationally and without loopholes."
"This seems impossible, so that this tax will result only in additional burdens, bureaucracy and so forth, without the actual objective - the limitation of financial crises - being able to be achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, congratulations to the rapporteur."
"That has already been said."
"There are four areas I would like to touch on briefly."
"First, we want to make the international monetary system more stable, because financial stability is, among other things, a public good and a basic economic precondition for growth, employment and social justice - that is to say, a moral duty."
"Second, we demand not simply a reform of the IMF, we require of the public authorities the moral obligation to create optimum balance between the free play of markets and the need for them to be regulated in accordance with the fundamental principle of the eco-social market economy, and to guarantee a balance between the public and private sectors in public rescue measures in times of crisis."
"We demand of the Member States economic policies geared to growth and employment, and we demand the cancellation of debt, subject to appropriate economic and political conditions."
"Third, we begin at home."
"The euro is a stability currency even in the eyes of the world."
"The response of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank after 11 September was one of stability in the face of the crisis."
"The Stability and Growth Pact is a European response."
"The Commission and the European Parliament have, by a majority, expressed their opposition to the Tobin tax, and the Liège resolutions include measures as correctives to globalisation."
"Fourth, we oppose measures to slow down economic development and ideologically motivated attempts to undo the Stability and Growth Pact or introduce the Tobin tax on its own, which create insecurity among those who work in the market."
"So I also regret that the Social Democrats' Amendment No 10 reinterprets the actual Liège resolution by inserting the Tobin tax."
"Remove this reinterpretation; in Liège we find ourselves."
"Mr President, I was astonished to read the briefing by Parliament' s Information Office, which presented the Goebbels report as follows: 'In a resolution on the operation of the International Monetary System, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is critical of the introduction of a Tobin tax on financial speculations' ."
"This appears to be the headline which is supposed to attract the press, and this still appears to be the subject around which the debates here revolve."
"In my opinion, this does not at all do justice to the balanced and excellent report by Mr Goebbels."
"To start with, the resolution does not in any way speak in favour of, or against, the Tobin tax."
"The extensive explanatory statement does contain a few observations, but what is more important is that it also contains many other alternatives in order to achieve the two objectives pursued by those in favour of the Tobin tax."
"Capital movements and foreign exchange markets must be founded more on actual economic reality and must be directed towards long-term investments and financial stability by taking a number of measures, but also by adopting a more flexible stance with regard to developing countries."
"Their debts should be cancelled and they must be granted an appropriate way of refinancing in order to be given a new lease of life."
"Actually, one could say that, in fact, this report fits in perfectly with the Tobin tax action points."
"It would be unfortunate if the report were seen as an opposing force, for I believe that it complements the Tobin tax well."
"In an amendment tabled by my group, a proposal has been formulated in an entirely neutral way that was also formulated in the ECOFIN Council."
"This amendment warmly welcomes the proposal by the ECOFIN Council to carry out such a study and further analysis."
"That seems to be far more fruitful than another instance of polarisation concerning the method: yes or no to the Tobin tax."
"In this way, those in favour of the Tobin tax can again endorse the objectives which are now actually on the agenda, and those against can be pleased about the fact that research can be carried out in a neutral way and that the objectives, namely, better management of capital movements and more opportunities for developing countries, can be achieved."
"Mr President, first of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Goebbels on his report."
"This is an interesting report that goes into considerable depth in an attempt to explore the various issues it raises and its resolution is informed and balanced."
"In our opinion, the report makes a constructive contribution to a debate of fundamental political importance and, furthermore, is very timely."
"The debate on how to create a better-working international monetary and financial system lies at the heart of our task of responding to globalisation."
"Private capital flows - and the report also takes this view - are the main source of growth, prosperity and productivity."
"If our objective is to ensure that countries, both developed and developing, are able to take full advantage of the benefits of globalisation, the best option that I can picture is for financial markets and their operations to merge."
"Broad-based, deep-rooted and fluid financial markets will make funding investment easier, which will, in turn, enable economic operators to spread their risks more effectively."
"This situation will prove beneficial for those operations that would otherwise be too risky for international investors, which will be of benefit not only to developing countries, but also to small and medium-sized businesses in our own countries."
"The economic benefits generated by the globalisation of finance are the result of the links between markets and operators having become stronger."
"Because of the nature of these links, the upsets passed on within a modern economy as a consequence of this process of globalisation are more rapid, for the very reason that borders that existed twenty years ago have disappeared."
"It is true that amongst the risks we will have to face, there will be financial markets with excessively volatile exchange rates and share prices."
"A 'contagious' effect can occur between one country and others and it is possible that capital flows will fluctuate."
"Within the Economic and Monetary Union we have stimulated stability and growth by means of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, which are fundamental factors for strengthening our economy and for preventing - or rather, fighting against - these financial upsets."
"Economic and Monetary Union, therefore, contributes to improving the stability of the international situation in our region."
"It is also true, however, that various alternatives have been put forward across the world."
"I agree with the thesis of Mr Goebbels' s report."
"There are no panaceas that will help us confront the challenge of consolidating the global financial system."
"The report makes this point very clear and I hope that its resolution will be read not only by those for whom this document is officially intended and who have a professional interest in these matters. I hope that it is also read by the people who are - legitimately - concerned at the direction in which the process of international economic and financial integration is heading."
"The problems and challenges inherent in the integration of financial markets must be addressed in a broader context, which is what Mr Goebbels has sought to achieve in his report and what we in the Commission are seeking to achieve in the study that the Liège Ecofin meeting asked us to produce on how we can respond to the challenges of globalisation, which we are intending to present next February."
"What has been happening in recent years?"
"I would say that since the crises in Asia, we have made substantial progress."
"Efforts have been made to improve macroeconomic conditions, economies are today more resistant to external shocks and the number of countries choosing to abide by internationally agreed codes and standards in order to make their economies more transparent is continually increasing."
"The G7 ministers and the Monetary Fund have made progress in a few key areas, such as, for example, the international financial institutions, which clearly act with greater transparency these days."
"There is also the International Monetary Fund itself, which has increased its capacity and is fine-tuning its instruments so that they will enable it to analyse, assess and oversee the stability of the financial system more efficiently."
"I would also say that coordination between the various national supervisory authorities has improved substantially."
"Of course, we cannot rest on our laurels as a result of these improvements."
"Much still remains to be done and, in its report, Parliament shows the correct way forward."
"The Commission is quite happy to accept your view that we must ensure full participation by the private sector in solving and managing financial crises."
"Not only in order to ensure that responsibilities in times of crisis are shared in an equitable way, but also that the private sector is appropriately and systematically involved, which is crucial to effective crisis prevention, thereby preventing dangerous and, ultimately, unsustainable, risk situations from arising."
"I do, therefore, take note of the call for the Commission to consider the viability of introducing clauses for collective action on financial instruments such as securities."
"You all know as well as I do that the Member States do not fully agree with this position but it is a point of view that the Commission takes seriously, as we do all references to the fight against the funding of terrorism."
"The 11 September attacks have brought to the fore the abuses of the financial system by terrorists and the Commission has already adopted certain measures in this field."
"You have also made an effective contribution by finalising the codecision procedure on the second directive on money laundering."
"Nevertheless, we must keep making progress in this area."
"We are now in the early days of a process which will be long and we must continue working in this direction over the coming months."
"It is important that we make rapid progress on each of the proposals that provide valuable instruments for combating the funding of terrorism."
"I wish to make a brief comment on one point that is still a source of some frustration to us, and that is the external representation of the European Union."
"The explanatory statement of the motion for a resolution refers to Europe' s conspicuous absence from the debate on a new financial architecture."
"You criticise the fact that the isolated initiatives of some Member States do not form a European policy."
"The Commission can only agree with this analysis."
"So how do we respond?"
"What can we do?"
"How can we improve the situation?"
"I would say that it is not simply a matter of improving coordination and of speaking with one voice."
"Economic and Monetary Union has undoubtedly transformed the blueprint of worldwide financial and monetary relations, but the way in which we continue to address these issues in the main organisations and forums, including the Monetary Fund and the G7, is still based, to a large extent, on a purely national concept."
"I can, therefore, only agree on the need to make progress."
"I think we will find it very difficult to formulate a meaningful policy in this area unless we clearly state our European positions as such at world level."
"This will require a more appropriate and clearly defined external representation of our interests."
"I am aware, however, that it will be very difficult to make progress in this direction unless we first make progress on the substance."
"Focusing the battle solely on our representation abroad is not as important as defining our own positions and producing coordinated policies on external matters."
"These two steps must be made in the same direction and at the same time."
"And on these points, Parliament can be sure that the Commission will continue to make progress."
"Thank you, Commissioner Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.47 p.m.)"
"Mr President, colleagues will have read in some of this morning's newspapers about the refusal of the Republic of France to recognise the extraterritorial status of the European Parliament."
"Apparently, the French government has refused to issue a visa to the President of the Republic of China to allow him to come to Parliament for a meeting."
"This is a denial of our status as a supranational Parliament, and I hope that you will be protesting to the French government about the fact that Mr Chen has not been allowed a visa. . ."
"- . . . and insisting that we, in the European Union, should be recognising a country which has existed as a flourishing parliamentary democracy for some 14 years and the status it must have in a world in which democracies must work together."
"(Applause)"
"I have taken note of what you have said."
"The President will, of course, be duly informed."
"Decision on urgent procedure"
"Mr President, the same argument in favour of urgent procedure applies in this case as applied to the previous matter, namely, that Taiwan too should be able to take part in the meeting in Doha."
"(Parliament agreed to urgent procedure)"
"Community incentive measures in the field of employment"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0319/2001), on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on Community incentive measures in the field of employment [8432/1/2001 - C5-0294/2001 - 2000/0195(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mrs Jensen)."
"Madam Commissioner, the EU' s employment policy is one of open cooperation in which the Member States set common goals, exchange experiences and evaluate each other' s results and employment policies. It is an open process in which the individual country itself chooses which funds it will use in order to achieve the common goals."
"We, in Parliament, should also like to see the process become more open by involving and engaging the general public more. The report we are debating today is about the implementation of Article 129 of the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning employment policy incentives."
"It is about appropriations to the work on employment policy over the next five years and about money for analyses, statistics, conferences and reports etc."
"Employment policy is to be evaluated in 2003. It will be the first open coordination to be evaluated, and the money for employment policy is also to be used for this evaluation."
"At Parliament' s first reading, we adopted 17 amendments to the Commission' s proposal, covering the following themes. We should like to see the social partners and local and regional authorities more involved in the process, and we should like to see greater focus placed upon the ways in which information and employment policy affects a broader public."
"We should like to see more focus on the equal treatment of women in employment policy; we should like to receive some further proposals concerning Parliament' s involvement; and we should like to look at the connection with other Community activities."
"Last but not least, we should like to see pilot projects to increase information about employment policy at local and regional levels and help develop relevant strategies. As a result, Parliament proposed an increase in the budget."
"The Council thereupon accepted a number of Parliament' s amendments, including those aimed at involving the local and regional levels and at involving the social partners more."
"Some of the proposals concerning greater focus on equality have also been accepted, but the Council did not want to accept some very central proposals from Parliament."
"Against that background, there was a great deal of support in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for Parliament' s re-tabling those proposals from the first reading that the Council did not accept."
"A majority of Parliament has campaigned for a long time for local and regional efforts to be incorporated into employment policy, and we have pointed out that the exchange of experiences and methods with those operating at local level and working in a voluntary capacity could be financed via Article 129."
"That is because it is clearly characteristic of unemployment in the EU to be focused in regions and local areas and in pockets of poverty where there are islands of unemployment. Local efforts are central when it comes to getting people into work."
"That is why it makes good sense to talk about local action plans and about the exchange of experiences and information from this work."
"I am quite convinced that greater focus on local efforts will make all of us much wiser about the new avenues that might be explored in employment policy."
"We have supported local employment initiatives by means of preparatory action, for which there has been a budget line called B5-503, and it is Parliament' s desire that this initiative should be followed up and continued via pilot projects under Article 129."
"Perhaps the expression 'projects' is misleading, for we want, of course, to see a development of the methodical work carried out, that is to say analyses and studies and the development of statistics and methods."
"We do not wish, under Article 129, to finance projects with the project-oriented and experimental character of projects financed under Article 6 of the Social Fund."
"There is therefore no question of our wanting to duplicate things that are already happening under the aegis of the Social Fund."
"On the contrary. There are many of us who are happy about the open coordination method of employment policy, for it enables the Member States to improve their results in employment policy, learn from each other' s experiences and actually compete to obtain better results."
"There will not, however, be very much of that healthy competition as long as employment policy and the 'Luxembourg process' are as unfamiliar to people as they are at present."
"In many countries' national parliaments, there is no debate on national employment plans. Nor are there any other activities that might make the process and the results better known and create more grassroots support."
"Is political coordination based on analyses and statistics debated by the same politicians, officials and experts at conferences around the EU really binding enough?"
"No, let us obtain a much greater awareness of results and objectives, so that governments encounter much greater commitment and a desire for everyone to achieve the results obtained in those countries which have most success in employment policy."
"Mr President, after first congratulating and thanking Mrs Jensen for her good work, I would like to start my speech with reference to the fact that last Sunday, in Galicia - my country - a former Member of this European Parliament, Manuel Fraga Iribarne, founder of the Spanish Popular Party, obtained, for the fourth time running, an absolute majority in the elections to the Galician Parliament."
"I mention this because, during its twelve years in power, the Fraga government has been constantly concerned about the issues and problems arising from the lack of employment in Galicia, and for this reason, during the latest election campaign, it made a commitment to providing jobs for the young unemployed under the age of 30 consisting of a one-year contract for those who have been out of work or unemployed for six consecutive years."
"This concern about employment, as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty and which takes the form of a European Community action for promoting the coordination of employment policies in Member States, confirmed by the special European Councils on employment in Luxembourg and Lisbon, which resolutely advocate a global employment strategy, implies and demands a systematic mobilisation of all Community employment policies, whether these be framework policies or support policies."
"If we want to become a knowledge-based economy that is both competitive and dynamic, able to grow economically in a sustainable fashion, with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion, so that we can once again meet the conditions necessary for full employment, we should encourage the coordination of employment policies between Member States, upholding, of course, the right to make decisions that correspond to the particular circumstances of each Member State, the exchange of good practices, including the aforementioned forms of participation for social partners and also local and regional authorities, without forgetting the need for the coordination of policies directed towards the creation of employment."
"I therefore think that the commitment made by Mr Fraga Iribarne is good practice that could be exported or exchanged with others."
"It will provide Galician youth with the chance to become integrated into the labour market, make it easier for them to gain the necessary training and experience, both in their quest for a first job as well as subsequently being able to keep that job or to move on to other jobs."
"I think that this is good practice, in the same way that the practice for the conciliation of family life with professional life was also good, another initiative of the Galician government."
"Mr President, I, too, should like to thank Mrs Jensen for a brilliant report."
"It is a good day today, for today' s vote should show that we are now all endorsing the fact that employment policy is not just something made behind desks at meetings of the Council of Ministers, but is something that must be rolled out among the people."
"Information must be provided about it, and the local authorities that are to help set these things in motion must also be involved."
"That is what we are voting on today."
"There are many good things in Mrs Jensen' s report."
"I would emphasise what we have agreed concerning the local dimension of employment policy."
"Gradually, we have got the Commission and the Council to realise that local and regional authorities, the social partners and non-profit organisations are important in the context of employment initiatives."
"Practical work aimed at getting people into employment is done locally."
"That is why room must be made for local players."
"However, support for local initiatives is required, for example, in the form of better information about what the common European employment policy is and what the objectives are."
"That is why it is important for us to put incentive measures in place and for us to appropriate some money to enable us to learn from each other' s methods and experiences. That, moreover, is what we are trying to do here today."
"That is why it is also disappointing that it has been difficult to get the Commission to agree to increasing the budget so that we might appropriate this money, and that is why we, in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have naturally endorsed the need to increase the amount to EUR 55 million, and not EUR 50 million."
"I hope that we obtain broad support today and that the Commission and the Council are alert to the signal from Parliament today."
"Mr Pronk, after the Commissioner' s speech, we will see whether your pessimism is justified."
"Mr President, we support Mrs Jensen's report because it is based on concepts and policies which we fully endorse."
"To start with, we need to make sure the citizens of the Union know what the European Employment Strategy is."
"That is the only way they can perceive our common objectives and add their ideas to the Luxembourg process and it is the only way to ensure the relevant national, regional and local authorities benefit from the best practices which have proven to be efficient in other areas of the Union, such as those which the honourable Mr Pérez Álvarez has just mentioned."
"Mrs Jensen's other proposal concerns the role of local society in both planning and implementing employment policies."
"We must make ensure that all the Member States understand that it is crucial for the social partners and civil society to be involved if this effort to increase employment is to be effective."
"And the Member States must change their structures and implement measures to create institutions and resources which will allow local employment pacts to be applied. On the other hand, the European Union also needs to back these structures with its policies, advice and resources."
"We already have experience of numerous countries, including Greece, in which local employment pacts have failed to work."
"In some cases, they were policies applied by the central administration to encourage a few additional measures in areas with problems; they did not mobilise local society and they did not have the required results."
"I am sure other areas in the Union have had similar bad experiences, which is why we believe that the measures proposed by the honourable Member and other policies in this sector of the European Union should be coordinated and dealt with at European and national level in order to give new impetus to employment planning and implementation at local level."
"Mr President, I will try, as you request, to transform Mr Pronk's pessimism to optimism!"
"This programme gives effect to Article 129 of the Treaty which provides that incentive measures may be adopted in order to encourage cooperation between Member States and support their action in the field of employment."
"Here I very much agree with what Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has already said: it is not a matter of employment or a matter of Council meetings, it is a matter of real cooperation between the Member States."
"The programme underpins the European Employment Strategy and provides for activities to ensure its continuing effectiveness."
"It is important that it is going to be adopted in the near future and I am hopeful that outstanding concerns expressed in the 14 amendments submitted can be resolved satisfactorily."
"In its amended proposal the Commission, after the first reading, accepted in full or in part 12 of the 17 amendments tabled by Parliament."
"The common position which you have been considering, while significantly different in format and presentation from the amended proposal, contains resonances of the ten amendments."
"In relation to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept nine of them in full or in part. Those are Amendments Nos 1-8 and 14."
"I should like to specify exactly what I accept."
"Amendments Nos 1-3 I accept in full."
"In Amendment No 4, I very much welcome the reference to special attention to groups subject to multiple discrimination in their access to the labour market and I share your concerns that we should be able to understand, monitor and analyse developments in mainstreaming by establishing indicators."
"I do not consider it appropriate, however, to enter into details on specific studies to be carried out and cannot accept this part of the amendment."
"On Amendment No 5, I am very pleased with the emphasis you introduce with regard to the importance of promoting public knowledge of the European Employment Strategy and further encouraging individuals and organisations at all levels to contribute to enhancing its impact and effectiveness."
"This programme should and will assist in the realisation of those objectives."
"However, assigning funding for the 'projects' in this context is not appropriate, and I have to reject that part of Amendment No 5."
"Our diverging views on Amendment No 5 may lie more in the wording used than in any disagreement on its intent."
"Local projects involving local actors are funded through Article 6 and the European Social Fund regulation, as well as through another budget line - B5-503."
"The latter is available exclusively for the funding of local development projects."
"The analysis, research and evaluation work which it incorporates will include measures, informed by the outcomes of the projects delivered under other budget lines, to assess how knowledge of the European Employment Strategy, and local level involvement in its delivery, might be further improved."
"I hope that this approach will meet your concerns."
"With regard to Amendment No 8, I again fully subscribe to the principle of consistency and accept this part but I cannot agree to specify each linked programme."
"Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are taken on board in spirit by the inclusion of Amendment No 1, and Amendment No 14, I can fully support."
"Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 9-13."
"I will briefly explain why: Amendments Nos 9 and 10 concern the committee."
"While I am grateful for your support for the Commission's role and the re-institution of an advisory committee, this is a lost fight with the Council."
"Looking at the legal framework and recent precedents, a mixed committee is a fair compromise."
"We could look at the mandate in future discussions to see if this could be adopted to meet your concerns as part of a global compromise."
"On the annual plans in Amendment No 11, this is an internal Commission question which has no place in a Parliament and Council decision."
"Amendment No 12 also has to be rejected on institutional grounds and more specifically with reference to the framework agreement on interinstitutional relationships."
"Finally, regarding Amendment No 13, we maintain the EUR 55 million initially proposed."
"We have made a thorough analysis and this is an adequate figure for the activities envisaged."
"To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 14; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 8; it rejects Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13."
"It is clear that some issues have to be resolved; some of them are more sensitive than others."
"I have, however, taken the most positive approach possible to the amendments which you have tabled."
"Accordingly, I am hopeful that, with your cooperation and that of the Council, we can soon identify a compromise which is acceptable to all."
"I once again reiterate the urgency of this matter and the Commission's resolve to help find workable compromises."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"Informing and consulting employees"
"Mr President, the information, consultation and participation of employees assumed primary importance in the European debate as far back as 1974, when the first social action programme was adopted by the Council."
"Since then, the issue has featured in many of our debates in this Chamber and the Commission has launched a large number of initiatives, which have met with resistance."
"Almost all the Member States have a legislative or contractual legal framework in place intended to guarantee the information and consultation of employees."
"This directive proposes the introduction of minimum information and consultation standards which would be implemented throughout Union territory: after the European Company Statute, the European Works Council Directive and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the directive before us today completes the existing Community and national frameworks, thus contributing to the ultimate purpose of the law in question which is to ensure that adequate preparations are made for the change, that restructuring takes place under acceptable conditions and that due importance is given to the employment objective in the current situation."
"The Commission presented its proposal - a sound proposal - in November 1998, and the European Parliament concluded its first reading in April 1999, adopting a series of amendments to improve it."
"Only in June 2001 did the Council adopt a common position."
"In general terms, the common position reflects the position adopted by the Commission following Parliament' s first reading but, if we compare the first reading of the European Parliament with the common position, we see that thirty or so of the amendments made by Parliament were not actually accepted."
"As rapporteur, I called upon the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs not to repropose all the amendments adopted at first reading but concentrate on the most important points in order to improve the common position."
"My colleagues - whom I would like to thank for their cooperation - put forward 15 amendments to my proposal, almost all of which serve to reinforce it."
"After an in-depth debate, we came up with the text on which the House is to vote today."
"There are 16 amendments and they concern: the procedures for consulting employees, and these are in line with the common position but more specific in identifying problems; the definition of economic and financial information; the exact definition of 'social partners' , in order to avoid ambiguities; the protection of employees' representatives, which needs to be better defined in terms of protection against disadvantage with regard to career, wage and training; suspension of decisions which could result in substantial negative consequences for employees, so that the taking of a final decision can be deferred for a suitable period at the request of employees' representatives in order to allow time for further negotiation and for a solution acceptable to all parties to be found."
"Transitional periods: this is an extremely sensitive point."
"We do not feel that specific transitional periods are necessary. Precisely because this directive introduces minimum standard rights, it must be enforced for all European employees simultaneously."
"The question of penalties is the most sensitive point. It has provoked a deluge of lobbies from all sides of the House."
"We have decided not to include our initial suggestion of a European penalty with legal effect in our proposal, but we have reinforced the common position, stipulating that it should be the Member States that, whilst respecting the principle of subsidiarity, introduce more stringent penalties for serious violations which impact upon employees."
"This is an interpretation of the common position, which states that the Member States must lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties."
"It is my genuine hope that this House will confirm the wide majority reached in committee and will lose no time in providing the Union and the Member States with this major legislative instrument during the Belgian Presidency."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, firstly because she showed a great deal of flexibility in meetings of the Committee, including taking on board a series of proposals by the European People's Party, and secondly because this has meant that her very good report on the Common Position on the framework directive for minimum standards in national employee information and consultation points in the right direction."
"As with the directive on European works councils, the issue is not codetermination, but information and consultation on important economic, financial and employment policy developments in business."
"Restructuring cannot and should not be hindered, but it must no longer take place in the form of a commando raid, as so often happens - witness Renault's shock at Vilvoorde - but only following prior notification of the employees concerned."
"There are, though, many parallels with the works councils directive in other respects."
"The regulations on European works councils apply only to mergers of businesses across national boundaries, but restructuring often takes place at a national level."
"The European People's Party favours flexibility."
"For example, management and labour in a business can, through agreements, arrive at a special made-to-measure arrangement on information and consultation for that business."
"That is subsidiarity."
"The Common Position says rightly that agreements should be able to be more, or even less, favourable than the minimum standard."
"Yet, the rights of local works councils may not be jeopardised under national law."
"Article 1 prescribes that the procedure should be carried on in a spirit of cooperation."
"This means partnership."
"Partnership aims on the one hand at the clear representation of interests, and on the other hand at their conciliation in shared dialogue through information and consultation."
"There is no doubt that this is economically advantageous."
"Inadequate information results in insecurity, mistrust, and finally only fear, ending in blockade."
"Timely information means transparency that creates trust and avoids businesses making friction losses."
"Both workers and employers are winners, and in the same way."
"Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti has already indicated how difficult it has been to present this issue for second reading."
"My group' s first priority, therefore, is to bring this issue to an end at long last and to have it published in the Official Journal."
"We thus hope that agreement with the Council will be reached in the near future."
"This is also evident from the stance adopted by our group, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated."
"We dropped a huge number of amendments from first reading and concentrated in the committee on a number of compromise texts, on which it must be possible to reach agreement, in our view."
"For example, we deleted the precious point on Tendenzschutz, which we would have liked to have seen scrapped."
"Neither will we be backing the Group of the Greens and the GUE/NGL Group on this matter in the framework of reaching a compromise."
"However, we hope that the PPE-DE will continue to support the compromise proposals we reached in committee."
"The differences of opinion with the Council mainly revolve around two key points: the provisions on sanctions and the unnecessarily long transitional periods."
"I should like to note that these are not points which we have added but, rather, points which the Council has added to the Commission position."
"Parliament is not asking for points to be added."
"In this case, it is the Council which is departing from the Commission proposal."
"I will briefly comment on those two points."
"With regard to the sanction provisions, Mr Menrad has also already communicated their importance in order for the directive to be taken really seriously."
"In this connection, I would like to refer to the experience in my own country."
"In the Netherlands, this kind of sanction exists in legislation pertaining to works councils."
"Precisely those provisions have an extremely preventative effect."
"It is not often that legal steps are required, but the very fact that it is possible to take these steps means that very intense consultations are often held."
"With regard to closures and transfers which need to take place, a very broad support structure is created and sound consultations are held."
"That is very important for industrial relations, in my opinion."
"The second point concerns transitional periods."
"I already stated last week, at a meeting which Mr Bushill-Matthews had organised with an English association of people who, in fact, propagate the idea of employee participation, that it strikes me as bizarre that they call for a much longer transitional period."
"If one considers - as they did - that information and consultation are very important, not only to employees but also to employers and to the company' s performance, then one must ensure that this measure is introduced very promptly."
"One should not ask for longer transitional periods, for that gives British industry entirely the wrong signal."
"I would therefore ask you to reconsider this and to support these conventional transitional periods, as proposed by the Commission, after all."
"Come what may, based on the experience which we have gathered in the Netherlands with an act that has been in force for more than 50 years, it appears that industrial relations have improved as a result."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for the sound and skilful work she has done on this report. I also wish, in particular, to thank her for her understanding of the minority views that may be adopted by a Danish MEP in this situation, for we have a special system of consultation and cooperation in the labour market which creates problems for us from time to time."
"We all agree, of course, that information and consultation and a good social dialogue are important."
"It has become a part of modern management to attach importance to these things, to involve employees and to talk about learning organisations, so enabling companies to develop better."
"I believe it is important that, when we talk about these matters, we do not only view information and consultation as part and parcel of restructuring and the reduction of the labour force, but as also being a part of day-to-day work in which it takes a long time to build up mutual confidence and that reciprocal dialogue that can be of value both to employees and companies in a crisis situation and which may also perhaps play a part in preventing crises from breaking out within companies."
"We have had a long period in which it was difficult getting everyone to understand the need for revising this directive, and revision has been blocked by a majority of the Council."
"Denmark has been a part of that blocking majority, not because we are nervous about having rules on information and consultation - we have in actual fact had stringent rules on these matters from as far back as 1960 - but because we are afraid that common rules might create problems for the system we think works well in practice."
"It would, of course, be an irony of fate if common rules were to be destructive in an area in which matters are operating well."
"Flexibility is a key word when it comes to drawing up the common rules, but there must not of course be so much flexibility that the required information and consultation does not occur in those places in which these things have not been emphasised."
"I must say, therefore, that, on the whole, my group is able to support Mrs Ghilardotti' s proposals."
"We have some problems where the sanctions are concerned, and I must say that the Council' s solution is an extremely fine balance that it is very difficult not to upset."
"There is therefore a single point in regard to which we cannot completely endorse the strict rules indicated in Mrs Ghilardotti' s report but in regard to which we prefer to endorse the Council' s solution."
"On the other hand, I want to say, on the subject of interim arrangements, that it is a question of putting these in place."
"Let us now get these matters implemented and not just continue to talk about them."
"Information and consultation are not a punishment for business. On the contrary, they are things that promote good business and competitiveness."
"Mr President, my group supports the recommendation for second reading, which, moreover, received the very broad approval of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"In addition, we would like the Council to follow suit and thus put a definitive end to the three long years that have passed since the Commission, perceiving the breakdown in social dialogue, made very timely use of its right of initiative."
"This is three years too many, which have been punctuated by social catastrophes, with rapid liquidation of businesses and loss of jobs due to bankruptcy and genuine distortions in Community social law on information and consultation of workers."
"While we must not expect miracles from this directive, because it will only apply, at best, to businesses with more than 50 employees and will not single-handedly resolve the fundamental problem, namely that competition law is dominant, this directive may represent a significant step towards harmonising the rights of European Union employees, subject, of course, to it not being stripped of its content and reduced to the smallest common denominator."
"This is why it is so important that the Council take into consideration the recommendations proposed by Mrs Ghilardotti, particularly Amendment Nos 2 and 12 on sanctions for disregard of the directive."
"Although the Council is opposed to European sanctions, the least it can do, in my view, is to accept this compromise position."
"We also support amendments which clarify and widen the scope of the information that must be provided to employees' representatives, and the amendment proposing the latter may request a decision' s application be suspended, pending the outcome of new negotiations, where this decision has serious effects on jobs."
"If our citizens are to find this directive credible, it will have to be applied simultaneously throughout the European Union."
"That is why our group asks the Council to support the position submitted to us, and make it impossible for some Member States to evade having to enforce the application of the directive for several more years."
"Our group proposes to supplement the draft recommendation by adopting amendments that rule out the possibility of withholding information that the company considers sensitive to its business from employees' representatives, because we are convinced that there are no grounds, that it even constitutes discrimination to introduce an element of suspicion with regard to employees who, by definition, have no less company spirit than the management or shareholders."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, despite the fact that it has welcomed some of the positions adopted by the European Parliament, I find it deplorable that the Council persists in maintaining a proposal for a directive that fails to meet the expectations of workers in the European Union."
"When you see the behaviour of the directors of many companies, especially the multinationals, who decide to restructure, relocate or even partially or totally close down their businesses, making hundreds or thousands of workers unemployed simply to cut costs and/or increase profits, it is all the more intolerable that the Council should not have accepted proposals that we have adopted in this House."
"Examples of these are:"
"the reference to the planning stage in the definition of consultation, its extension to cover economic and financial developments in the company and the obligation to seek agreement on all issues subject to the information and consultation of workers."
"extending consultation in particularly serious cases; extending the concept of a serious breach of the obligations to inform and consult; the implementation of the directive on public administration."
"the abolition of the employer' s right to retain particularly sensitive information and the obligation for Member States to promote social dialogue within SMEs."
"These are our reasons for supporting Mrs Ghilardotti' s proposals, which once again take up the positions adopted at first reading, with particular emphasis on the amendments that seek to step up sanctions and specific legal proceedings in cases where the directive is breached, on suspending decisions at the request of workers' representatives when their implementation has serious consequences for workers, with a view to eliminating or minimising these harmful consequences, on eliminating the transitional periods for the directive' s implementation in Member States that do not have a system of worker consultation and on reducing the period of transposition into national law to two years as well as its implementation in the public sector."
"These are positive proposals which, as I said, we support."
"I can only regret the fact, however, that the rapporteur has dropped her two proposals on eliminating the option the Council wishes to give employers to, in certain cases, neither inform nor consult their workers, although the rapporteur' s proposals envisage sanctions against employers that fail to act promptly."
"The Council' s position, however, opens up loopholes that could prove dangerous for workers and it is, therefore, important to eliminate this possibility."
"This is the basic justification for the two amendments that we have tabled in conjunction with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"We hope that a majority in Parliament votes in favour of these and that the Council takes account of the positions that have been put forward here in one of the most sensitive areas of the protection of workers' rights."
"Mr President, the subject addressed so well by Mrs Ghilardotti' s report is, as we all know, not a new one, but on past occasions when it was discussed it has never been set out so clearly."
"I refer, in particular, to the legislation on European works councils, which has not been transposed by all the Member States and, where it has been transposed, has not been incorporated into their legislation but is regulated by means of agreements between the social partners which are often then disregarded by one of the partners, as has been shown by recent events which, moreover, have been debated in this very House."
"Yet Parliament, which has, in the past, been attentive to the issue of employment and openly involved in establishing and guaranteeing the dignity and even the quality of work, and which, moreover, has not hesitated to propose sanctions for the cases I have mentioned which even involved requirements governing the use of European funds for maintaining employment levels, has shown varying degrees of indecision in the debate on this report."
"The different attitudes are certainly understandable, given the sensitive nature of some issues such as the enforcement of sanctions, for sanctions do have to be enforced if one wants a requirement to be respected, or the confidentiality granting exemption from the consultation procedure to be removed, even though it is no longer observed, or a transitional period to be granted for the transposal of the directive which is, moreover, unnecessary, given the time frame for its implementation."
"The fact is that, both in terms of the continuous implementation of Community law, the continuing hope of ever-increasing cohesion and, lastly, the forthcoming practical introduction of a European Company which would provide greater protection of employees as regards participation than other forms of legal entity, the issue had to be closed, with the identification of major, related questions ranging from the contents of the information to the termination clause, from the time frame for initiating the procedure to the parties involved and to the sectors where it is to be applied, and all this in respect, on the one hand, for the fair trade requirement, which, also in this case, would be guaranteed by the different behaviour of the Member States, and, on the other hand, for the reasoning of the open coordination method, which has, at last, started to be applied practically in social policy."
"Clearly, the issue in question lends itself to being addressed within the context of the principle of subsidiarity, even though that concept still remains to be clearly defined today, despite the fact that it is one of the founding principles of the Union itself."
"However, it must be said that the definition and application of the principle does not and cannot serve the single purpose of calling for competence for certain subjects to be given to the Member States alone, for there is also a conflicting, appropriate need to provide the Union, in the face of great national differences and oversights, with a basic definition of these subjects wherever they have any significant implications for the Community as a whole."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by stating that I think it very important that minimum standards be set for informing and consulting employees, but that it is just as important that it be done in a way that does not disrupt existing national arrangements that are operating well."
"It has unfortunately proved that not all Member States have been in a position to draft national guidelines for informing and consulting employees."
"That would otherwise have been the best solution when it comes to companies in the individual countries, for it is, of course, there, that the real problems arise."
"Political unity has now been achieved in the Council concerning the revised proposal from the Swedish Presidency and the graduated transitional arrangement, as proposed by the Commission."
"In Denmark, we have no direct laws about informing and consulting employees."
"That does not, however, mean that employees are not consulted and informed in Denmark. This is specifically regulated via cooperation agreements between the social partners in accordance with the Danish tradition of greater freedom between the social partners."
"Only when it is strictly necessary does the government get involved."
"The Danish government has therefore stated in the Council that it assumes that the current cooperation agreements in the Danish labour market comply with the directive' s requirements. The Danish government will also issue a statement in the Council to the effect that implementation of the directive will not affect existing agreements in this area in Denmark and that these will be fully respected when implementation takes place, but that it will of course be necessary to enact legislation for those companies not covered by the existing cooperation agreements."
"I should like to ask the Commission whether it is of the same view as the Danish government."
"In other words, is the Commission able to ensure that the social partners themselves are given the freedom to enter into, and maintain, the existing agreements and procedures about informing and consulting employees, just as Denmark was given a similar assurance in connection with the compromise reached by the Council in July?"
"I should also like to thank Mrs Ghilardotti for having agreed that sanctions must be established nationally."
"It is very important that the Member States themselves should devise appropriate sanctions, that this is done by means of agreements between the social partners and that we take account of the Member States' different systems."
"If Parliament had maintained its hard line, the proposal could have been rejected by the Council, and that would have been a major defeat for the unions which, for years, have been campaigning for the right of employees to be informed and consulted."
"Mr President, Commissioner, rapporteur, the view that it is, in general, appropriate and also necessary to ensure an adequate flow of information between a company and all its stakeholders, especially the employees involved in the life of the company, is, I believe, widely held, including by myself."
"However, I am not in favour of imposing on the States, the individual Member States, solutions which involve employees in management decisions, on the basis, in some cases, of joint management models which are foreign to the legal and economic traditions of many European countries, as has just been said."
"I therefore feel that, in line with both the Commission' s initial proposal and the Council' s common position, the directive before us needs to leave the Member States sufficient room for manoeuvre to identify the best way of adhering to the principle of the need to keep employees informed."
"However, many of the amendments adopted by the Commission and included in the common position which we are about to put to the vote conflict with this, particularly Amendments Nos 2 and 12, which seek to grant employees' representatives a sort of de facto - and I repeat, de facto - right of veto on decisions taken by companies."
"I therefore call upon Parliament not to adopt the amendments and to stay with the Council' s common position."
"I would like to make one last point: Article 3 (2) lays down specific provisions applying to political associations, trade associations and religious organisations etc."
"This is my question."
"Mr President, we are dealing with a long history and a relatively complex directive."
"Fortunately, the Council' s common position is very useful and provides a sound basis for our further debate."
"In fact, a number of people, including a large number of socialist ministers, are of the opinion that we should not have anything other than the common position."
"I am not certain whether they truly believe this or whether they think that they will then be able to put the whole thing behind them."
"In any event, that is the state of play."
"Although the stance adopted by our group has been expressed very eloquently by Mr Winfried Menrad, he very much takes the common position into account, as well as the amendments adopted at first reading, a number of which - I have to say - we were unable to support."
"We voted against a number of amendments, but as they are not included in the present package, that is not such a big issue."
"There is now a sound compromise proposal before us by Parliament, also accommodating the Council."
"We make no bones about the fact that our group is struggling with a number of amendments."
"There are also a number of amendments which some delegations in our group find it difficult to come to terms with."
"But on the whole, I believe we can congratulate the rapporteur warmly on her work."
"I also believe that if we have voted on this matter by lunchtime today, we will have made a significant contribution to informing and consulting employees in Europe."
"We must not forget that an incredible number of problems have arisen."
"Over the years, we have discussed many resolutions dealing with the lack of consultation."
"If this is now rectified properly, we will have made huge progress, in my opinion."
"Mr President, I do not speak for my Group on this matter, but I want to congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti for her hard work in making this directive a reality."
"We hope this directive will develop into a new partnership between workers and management and strengthen dialogue."
"That, in turn, will improve flexibility and productivity."
"We have a directive which is essentially a two-way street."
"It must make sense for workers in retail, service and manufacturing industries not to learn about their future through the media, but to work within a positive consultation mechanism making them aware of what will happen to them and their families."
"The question is whether existing laws work well."
"There is plenty of evidence that they do not."
"Workers in my own country at Rover/BMW, Marks & Spencers, in Longbridge, at Corus and Vauxhall - the list is endless - would all benefit from this directive."
"The directive is essentially about the future of work, not the past."
"When closure is inevitable for companies with more than 50 workers, we want to see information and consultation, so that workers are informed, leading to a better level of trust within companies."
"We need realistic thresholds to allow the directive to work well."
"In discussions with trade unions and business, it is clear that companies need to be made aware of their responsibilities."
"The responsibilities work both ways."
"Colleagues, information and consultation has been a very difficult directive."
"There have been a number of compromise amendments."
"We are very happy with the way in which those discussions have progressed."
"It is clear that some Member States will continue to have problems with certain aspects of this directive."
"We must work together to ensure that in conciliation we reach the stage where information and consultation are embraced by both sides of business and industry."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work on this report."
"I am one of the Members who has spoken in this House previously regretting the fact that we did not have the kind of legislation that we are discussing today."
"I know that myself, along with several other colleagues, have been in the very unfortunate position of representing constituents who have suffered the very worst examples of the lack of consultation and the lack of information."
"Workers who have learned of job losses in the press and media when there has been speculation and uncertainty in the workplace."
"I only have to mention what happened with Corus in Wales earlier this year for you to see why I attach such importance to this particular piece of legislation."
"I am therefore particularly pleased to have the opportunity to welcome this proposal which will change things."
"It will mean that employees will be involved in discussions when there really is still an opportunity to influence the debate and the outcome, not when the decision is more or less a fait accompli."
"Employees would have to be given all the relevant facts."
"While certain measures are needed to protect a company's commercial interests, my group believes that these are adequately covered."
"The ability to impose sanctions is one of the most important aspects of this report, including the suspension of decisions which lead to job losses if the consultation guidelines have not been followed."
"Voluntary agreements are not enough."
"We often hear about good examples of voluntary agreements."
"I applaud those companies that follow good practice, but many do not."
"We have seen that time and time again especially in Wales and Britain where we have had no legislation on information and consultation to date."
"I am very pleased that there has at last been progress on this crucial matter."
"I believe, as others have said, that we cannot wait too long for this to come into effect which is why I support the shorter transition period."
"This proposal, of course, would not prevent job losses, but it would allow enough time to ensure that plans for rescaling and retraining of workforces could be well advanced before closures or redundancies take place."
"This is an issue of the effectiveness of companies and businesses. It should be a part of the everyday work of companies and businesses."
"It is also about dignity in the workplace."
"Employees are an integral part of the partnership with management and must be kept informed on decisions which affect not only their lives, but those of their families and whole communities."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ghilardotti' s report on the directive on information and consultation of workers is very topical indeed."
"Many Member States of the European Union have, unfortunately, been faced with a wave of mergers, restructurings and numerous redundancies, such as at Danone, Marks and Spencer and Moulinex, to name but a few."
"Until now, the directive has not enabled employees to take any effective action and to have a real bearing on their future, and that of the business."
"In many other cases, the directive has not been applied."
"That is why I support the proposals made in the report by Mrs Ghilardotti, because the directive strengthens provisions and provides the means to apply these provisions."
"The Council included Parliament' s amendments in its common position; the reference to the most favourable provisions for employees, the obligation to respect minimum requirements, and the non-regression clause."
"Although this is a step forward, we must go further, as proposed in Mrs Ghilardotti' s report."
"Some important amendments have again been proposed, which improve the report."
"For example, employees shall be consulted and informed at the planning stage, before decisions are taken."
"For example, if the decision has an adverse effect on employees, such as collective redundancies or closure, the final decision must be postponed so that consultations can continue with a view to avoiding or mitigating the consequences."
"This directive will enable us to begin to encourage an approach to economic and social issues, which includes improving working conditions and economic efficiency."
"This efficiency requires the involvement of employees, naturally."
"That is why we are proposing two amendments, which rule out the possibility of withholding information where there is a risk or prejudice to the business."
"To demand discretion is one thing. To enable the company' s management, once again, to take unilateral decisions on the nature of the information is quite another."
"Obviously, we must be determined to ensure this directive is observed, and I hope that, this time, the Council will heed Parliament' s will."
"Mr President, the company is clearly an example of plurality."
"According to Max Weber, a company is an organisation that, in controlling goods and services, aims to produce goods and services for a particular market."
"It is also clear that those who lend their services to a company cannot always relate to their employer directly or on a personal level, above all when the number of employees in that company exceeds a certain level."
"There therefore needs to be the implementation of some kind of permanent and flexible mechanism which would facilitate this relationship, functioning in a way that is simple yet effective and which can deal with the multitude of issues that arise in a company every day."
"The everyday life of a company, in this day and age, takes place within a global world - globalisation is the key word - a globalisation which does not exclusively affect large or very large companies, but also those of a small or medium size, because they are also having to function within this environment."
"So, what exactly is the problem?"
"Well, we need to regulate rights to information and consultation with true content within the specific framework in which we operate, that is to say that it is not a simple case of paying lip service to these declarations, but neither do we want to go too far, depriving the management of its powers."
"I think that this is what Mrs Ghilardotti set out to achieve in her arduous and efficient work: I think that she was seeking this point of equilibrium, and, yes, it is difficult - I would say practically impossible - for some delegations, such as the Spanish, to vote for the content of Amendment No 12, and for the rest, we have to underline the work she has undertaken and congratulate her on her effort."
"Evidently, a company' s own capacity to adapt, more necessary today than ever before, is going to be strengthened if we are able to convey its needs, concerns and prospects to all its workers."
"More than just an exhaustive regulation, we are talking about an advanced communication culture within the company."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we are all well aware, I believe that we are about to take a decisive step along the path to adopting a general framework on the information and consultation rights of workers."
"We can only welcome this and we must congratulate Mrs Ghilardotti, the rapporteur, who has spared no effort in ensuring that today we have reached a position that we are defending."
"It has been almost three years since the draft directive was published, and during this time, we in this House have had to condemn many situations."
"There have been site closures, redundancies and relocations, without any prior information being given by the companies to the employees concerned."
"Of course, this directive is far from ideal - it does not provide a ban on redundancies - but it illustrates the determination to make up for these shortcomings, firstly, in national legislation, but also to correct the occasionally fragmented aspects of Community law that we have already passed, which it also supplements."
"These three years of debate have resulted in a text that is now balanced and realistic."
"This report is not intransigent, nor is it extremist, and I believe that we should mention the efforts on the part of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the various groups, in negotiating with the Council, to iron out specific differences of opinion."
"The European Parliament and the Council are co-legislators and we do not have to blindly support any directive, Mr Pronk. We have to support positions, namely those of Parliament."
"I have three points to make; the first relates to confidentiality of specific information."
"We have returned to the common position of the Council to acknowledge that there actually are objective situations and contradictions with stock market law, for example, which must be considered and that this confidentiality, in some well-defined cases, can be upheld."
"My second point relates to sanctions."
"There is no law without sanctions, and I believe that what is laid down - I am about to finish, Mr President - where there has been a serious breach is an absolute minimum."
"As for transition periods, well, fundamental social rights must simply be applied."
"Yet, we can no longer defer the enforcement of these rights."
"(Applause from the Left)"
"Mr President, Commissioner, informing and consulting employees is a basic right."
"It is inherent in our European social model and distinguishes us from other social models."
"I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur for the sound work and also the Council which, in any case, managed to pull the debate back on track in Nice."
"This was timely and also necessary."
"If we examine such a framework directive and compare it with the take-over directive which was discussed in this House recently, and subsequently rejected, we can see that this did not fit into a framework directive."
"The statute of the European company does fit in, which means that a framework directive is needed for that."
"That framework directive is also needed - as has been indicated by various people - if we consider what happened to Renault-Vilvoorde, Michelin, Chorus and other companies."
"For example, in the case of Chorus, there is a pronounced difference in the level of information and consultation provided in the Netherlands, for example, compared to England."
"Consequently, this directive relies wholly on the quality of information and consultation."
"In my opinion, these should be assessed in the fullness of time, but this is a first step."
"It is absolutely vital to tackle it this way."
"One of the things I am struggling with is the exemption from this directive when a company is said to be at risk."
"We have positive experiences in countries where works councils exist, and that applies to the Netherlands, Germany and Austria."
"Problems do not arise."
"There is already a duty of confidentiality, and I should like to urge you to adopt the amendment which we tabled in this connection."
"Mr President, the right of employees to be consulted and informed has been enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but what use are frameworks set up at national or EU level, when employees are too often presented with faits accomplis, learning of restructuring processes only after the event or from the media?"
"I support Mrs Ghilardotti's Amendment No 5, which requires them to be consulted as early as the planning phase, so that they can have some degree of influence."
"There was long debate on Amendment No 7, which laid down what information supplied by the employer must include."
"This includes the economic situation - developments in the market, the structure of the organisation, the company's strategy - but also turnover and production figures to show the financial position."
"This is about in-house information and not in any way about investment control by stealth."
"More and more employees have a financial share in their business, now, and so they are well positioned to think entrepreneurially in local and global terms."
"They are ready and willing to share responsibility for significant strategies that make their firms more competitive."
"Dialogue between informed social partners is a major challenge, and so we also need training and development for qualified employees."
"People with in-depth knowledge add to productivity."
"These employees are willing to share responsibility even for crucial decisions."
"All this adds up to another element in the structure of a modern organisation."
"It is in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that dialogue between employer and employee is particularly important."
"Mr President, you are right to emphatically put the case for them as well."
"This dialogue is to be set in motion in the Member States, in accordance with their current national regulations."
"The pressure of competition and the challenges posed by globalisation mean that there is no alternative to cooperation within businesses, provided that it is founded on fairness, openness and timely information."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating my colleague, Mrs Ghilardotti, as well as the Council and the Commission for having finally secured progress on this dossier."
"As with the Regulation on the Statute for a European Company a few weeks ago, and the annex on participation, we have been making more progress in the last few months than we had for years."
"I think that this gives us an excellent opportunity to send a clear signal to the public that, at European level, we have a concept of the company that encompasses all those that work within it, which, it must also be said, is not only a democratic right of workers, but, also, these principles of information and consultation set the right path for companies to become more efficient, more effective, non-authoritarian and participatory."
"In these times of globalisation, lifelong learning and the incorporation of workers into the dynamics of a company are crucial."
"We hope, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, that, as Mrs Ghilardotti stated very clearly in her amendments, that this is a genuine regulation."
"This will require two obvious and fundamental elements: firstly, that the participation of workers should take place before decisions are made, for if this is not the case, they will carry on finding things out through the papers and they will really be under the impression that the work that has been carried out here in Parliament, in Council and in the Commission is a joke."
"They have to be involved before decisions are made, because the press is there for everyone else."
"Secondly, their participation must also be a legal requirement."
"The exact difference between the regulation and the recommendation is that, when the regulation is violated, there can be a sanction."
"If there is no sanction, what we do remains purely symbolic and has no legal foundation."
"Representatives of the Council, we are at second reading."
"I would like to finish by saying that I hope that on this occasion we do not experience what has taken place on so many others, that you forget that Parliament has legislative faculties on a par with your own."
"I hope, therefore, that you will take good notice of Mrs Ghilardotti' s report, which is not only for her own good, but for the good of millions of citizens and workers in Europe."
"Like my colleagues in the UK Conservative Delegation, I have consistently supported the principle and the practice of employee information and consultation."
"In my previous job as managing director of a large UK food manufacturing company, I was very proud to lead the first such company in the whole of the West Midlands Region to achievement of the coveted Investors People Award."
"As has already been mentioned, earlier this month I hosted a lunch debate in Brussels with the Involvement and Participation Association for my fellow members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to share with them UK best practice and the benefits of flexibility, because that is the issue."
"The common position as it stands is fine, which is why I personally did not put forward any amendments to that, but the committee amendments propose yet another one-size fits-all straitjacket which would be highly damaging to managers' ability to manage and in particular to their ability to manage rapid change."
"If companies are held back from taking the key decisions necessary perhaps for the very survival of those businesses, their problems will get worse, which means that more employees could suffer."
"The UK government has asked all UK MEPs from all political parties to vote down all these amendments and to support the common position."
"Conservative MEPs will do exactly that, so I now call upon UK Labour MEPs to reverse the position they all took in committee when they supported these amendments and to vote with us in the interests of employment and in the interests of the nation."
"Mr President, first I would like to apologise: in my introduction I did not mention Mrs Jensen, and I would really like to congratulate her on an excellent job."
"As far as Mrs Ghilardotti is concerned, we all know what a difficult job she had and she has."
"She had to strike a balance between completely different political, national, social and economic views, and I would like to congratulate her and to thank all the Members of Parliament who have participated in the debate and supported the Commission's proposal through this process."
"This is an important proposal and, once adopted, it will add an indispensable element to workers' rights."
"Recent events, with mass lay-offs across Europe, have only underlined the urgent need for different kinds of instruments and this proposal - this directive - information and consultation is a very important instrument."
"Once adopted, the directive will ensure better anticipation of crises and will contribute to developing a positive attitude towards change by both management and workers."
"Let me tell you that I fully understand all your requests. Most, if not all, of the issues they raise were the subject of intense debate within all the institutions."
"The text before us strikes a delicate balance between different points of view and divergent interests on the sensitive issues at stake."
"While I understand your desire to improve the text, it would be unwise, in my view, to depart now from that balance and jeopardise the actual adoption of the proposal."
"I refer in particular to Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 16, 18 and 19."
"Therefore, the Commission is not prepared to accept those amendments."
"However, a number of the proposed amendments are acceptable, in full or in part, to the Commission, as they will improve the text."
"These are Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 13 and 14."
"The Commission will, therefore, actively support these amendments and will do its utmost to facilitate consensus on them between Parliament and the Council."
"Allow me, before moving to the two most important issues - sanctions and transitional periods - to respond to Mrs Sandbæk, as far as the Danish model is concerned."
"I would like to underline the fact that the current text strikes a balance between the necessary protection of workers and the autonomy of the social partners, as contracting partners."
"They can freely conclude agreements which are not fully in line with the provisions of Article 4, but they have to take into account the principles which are established in Article 1 and in national law."
"Now, we know that the most difficult and controversial issues are the two which I have already referred to: sanctions and transitional periods."
"With regard to the first of these issues, Amendment No 2 and especially Amendment No 12 propose reinforced sanctions, including judicial suspension procedures in cases of serious breach of information and consultation obligations."
"This amendment, while reinforcing the common position, offers a compromise with the Commission's original proposal."
"It is, therefore, undeniable that Parliament is making a step in the direction of the Council, in a serious search for a final compromise."
"I would like to thank you for your support of the Commission's stance on this very important element of the directive."
"Nevertheless, taking into account the sensitivity of the issue in the Council, the best basis for a final compromise on this issue would be to limit the request to the first sentence of the proposed amendment."
"Under these circumstances, the Commission can accept Amendment No 2 and the first paragraph of Amendment No 12."
"We can accept Amendment No 2 with a minor change."
"Finally Amendment No 15 which seeks to delete Article 10 - on transitional periods - is equally a major issue."
"In the past, the Commission has always opposed this kind of provision which tends to grant different treatment to different Member States."
"This time, we can see some justification in it."
"Some Member States will clearly have to introduce major changes to their industrial relations systems."
"Therefore, the Commission is of the opinion that Article 10 of the common position constitutes a fair compromise and it cannot accept this amendment."
"To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 3 and 8; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 2, 6, 12, 13 and 14."
"It rejects Amendments Nos 1, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18 and 19."
"I know that you fully appreciate the challenges ahead of us: we need to do everything possible to find an acceptable compromise between the co-legislators."
"I think that our big challenge is to strike the balance between what we think is desirable and what is achievable or possible."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 12 noon."
"Employment guidelines for 2002/Joint employment report 2001"
"The next item on the agenda is the report (A5-0360/2001) by Mrs Weiler on behalf of the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs on:"
"1. the proposal for a Council decision (COM(2001) 511 - C5-0498/2001 - 2001/0208(CNS)) on the guidelines for employment policy measures by the Member States in 2002"
"and"
"2. the Commission communication (COM(2001) 438 - C5-0423/2001 - 2001/2168(COS)) on the draft Joint Employment Report 2001."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, employment policy in the EU was successful last year even though not all our ambitious objectives have been achieved."
"But the points have been set."
"In few other fields do we have to think in the long term as much as in employment policy."
"My impression is that the Member States have not only grasped that, but that they are also acting accordingly."
"My report takes the same line as that of the Committee, which has kept to it over the past few years."
"We have always followed employment processes in the Member States and offered constructive criticism."
"I have therefore concentrated this year on some new key points."
"The first of these is the new theme of work quality, on which we in Parliament agree with the initiative of the Commission and the Belgian Presidency, which have also made the quality of work a pre-eminent item on the agenda."
"We are very keen that this topic should find its way into all policy areas by a kind of mainstreaming."
"The second key point is gender equality in the employment market."
"Here, too, according to the Commission's figures, we have achieved an improvement."
"The proportion of women in employment has increased by 2% in any case, which is of course not enough for us, but it is the right way to go, and also shows the change in the Member States' thinking."
"This reorientation also means - and even that was not so simple - that a change of consciousness has taken place, at least in some Member States such as Germany, Greece and Ireland."
"A third point is very important to me - the integration and incorporation of disadvantaged groups into the employment market."
"This has for some years been an important topic for this Parliament."
"In my report, I put forward the argument that employment policy measures should include immigrants as well."
"I believe this to be an important area for the future, precisely because we will otherwise be creating new social flashpoints."
"I would like finally to mention the area of continuing education."
"We had debates in Committee as to whether it made sense to demand a right to continuing education and to direct the national governments to translate it into action."
"I believe that, now, of all times, when we are already finding that bottlenecks in certain trades result from too little training and development in the past, such a national right to continuing education would represent the dictates of the hour."
"I am, moreover, convinced that we will have achieved it within four or five years."
"Why, then, should Parliament not be the trailblazer for once?"
"National and European targets need to be set if these policy objectives are to be achieved."
"There is, I believe, an additional need for more intensive cooperation between enterprises and institutions of higher education than hitherto, in order to facilitate more effective knowledge transfer and more speedily initiate entrepreneurial innovation than has previously been the case."
"I appeal also to the Member States, to the Council and to the Belgian Presidency to have the courage to initiate a public debate on employment policy in Europe."
"The fact is that we have observed that there is in the national parliaments - with the possible exception of Denmark - and in the regional parliaments and assemblies, still, little or no, discussion of European employment policy."
"Even employers' organisations and trade unions, at regional level, do not know of the significance of our debates and resolutions in the European Parliament."
"Of course, effective employment policies and coordinated and farsighted economic and financial policies belong together."
"I cannot draw a veil over this Parliament's present dissatisfaction with the Council's objectives in this area and with its debates on the subject."
"I cannot help thinking that we could do with a bit more courage on the part of the finance ministers on the Ecofin Council, in order to guarantee here, too, the appropriate and proportionate goal for a rational European employment policy, for only then can an offensive for growth and employment in Europe be realised."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is, in our view, the Member States which have the primary task of creating the appropriate framework for more employment."
"It goes without saying that the European Union can contribute towards it."
"I believe, though, that dialogue between the ministers of the various Member States is particularly important here."
"On looking into the matter more closely, we note that we have in some countries of the European Union almost full employment, but in others unemployment - and, in particular, youth unemployment - on a frightening scale."
"I believe it to be a matter of extraordinary importance that the States should learn from one another and avoid making the mistakes already made by others."
"We can see that the countries that perform best have created jobs on the basis of a solid financial policy and have got to grips with the necessary structural reforms earlier than others."
"We must also ask ourselves the question: who, then, actually creates jobs?"
"It is not the state, it is often not the major enterprises, which indeed tend rather to retrench."
"It is, far more, the small and medium-sized enterprises that create the most jobs."
"If we want to be successful, the establishment of new enterprises is especially important."
"It is a matter of creating the appropriate framework for them."
"We must make it our concern that the European Union is not the institution that contributes to life being even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises or to making it difficult to set up new ones."
"The European Union's activity must focus more on creating the conditions that will give these enterprises a better chance."
"Mr President, equality is a prerequisite for economic growth."
"Twenty-five million fewer women than men participate in the European labour market."
"That is a huge unexploited resource which needs to be made use of if Lisbon' s employment objectives are to be achieved and if economic growth is to be guaranteed."
"At the same time, the birth rate is falling dramatically."
"Demographic experts predict that Europe' s labour force will consist of considerably fewer people in the future, when more women will therefore have to be in gainful employment and, at the same time, give birth to more children."
"How are we to balance the equation?"
"A basic prerequisite is an equality perspective in all four pillars of the employment policy guidelines, and I am therefore very pleased that Mrs Weiler has been so attentive to the proposals tabled by the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities."
"The most important thing is perhaps to ensure that European women and men can combine professional life with having a family and children."
"The Member States must make child care available and offer parental leave."
"The women of Europe must not be forced to choose between professional life and having a family."
"The Commission' s focus on better jobs is very encouraging, for better jobs and better working conditions for women are among the prerequisites for having more women in paid employment."
"Precarious and low-paid jobs which require little in the way of qualifications and in which women are over-represented at present are hardly going to attract women."
"Quality, which is the recurring theme in the guidelines for the year 2000, must also apply to work done by women."
"Overcoming gender discrimination at work and in the social insurance systems is a huge challenge."
"Discrimination against women in the labour market is not only unproductive, it also ruins the opportunities for individual women, for women as a group and for society as a whole."
"Quite simply, growth and human development require us to put an end to gender discrimination."
"Equality is an investment."
"Mr President, when the experiment of the Luxembourg procedure was set in motion in 1997 and guidelines for Member States' employment policies adopted, it was in the conviction that a favourable climate of economic growth might not alone be sufficient to ensure automatic positive results in employment."
"Today, we are confirming this strategy, these undertakings and guidelines in an economic climate which we all know to be much less favourable, or, rather, full of risks, and we are therefore doing so, first and foremost, by duly recognising the need, already established at the Lisbon Summit, to bring the economic policy guidelines adopted at Community level and by the Member States into line with employment policy recommendations and guidelines."
"This does not diminish the specific role of the Luxembourg procedure and the economic policy guidelines in the context of what has been defined a coordination process, an open coordination process."
"We are aware that these alone are not enough; however, they are, or can be, decisive for maximising the effects or reducing the risks for employment, which are also linked to the economic trend."
"All this must be subject to certain conditions, focused on in both the Commission' s proposals, which we judged to be positive, and Parliament' s position."
"I will mention them very briefly: we feel that this is a process which warrants careful attention, controls and monitoring."
"It is not enough just to state the objectives which are then included under the principle of subsidiarity in national employment plans."
"There must also be consistency in terms of effectiveness and implementation: that is why we call for the adoption of auditable, reliable common indicators at Member State as well as Community level, in order to achieve national objectives without whose achievement it would subsequently be difficult to reach our common European and Community objectives."
"There must be consistency with budgetary policies at Member State level and at local and regional levels as well; there must be quality employment objectives seeking to combine flexibility, social dialogue, protection, rights and safety, but which also extend beyond that context to include lifelong training, integration policies and employment with a view to increasing the productivity of less elderly workers."
"Lastly, and most importantly, there must be equal opportunities policies and active employment policies."
"If these conditions are met, the contribution of the Luxembourg procedure will not be the only factor but it will certainly be decisive."
"Mr President, I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report and to thank the Commission for its sustained commitment to the European employment strategy."
"No one will now deny that the European employment policy, since it first started in 1997, has led to a certain level of convergence stress in the Member States and has brought with it increasing unanimity as to what an active labour market policy in Europe could be."
"That is apparent from the continued refinement of the employment guidelines, although I would add that this is rather unilaterally evident from the first pillar, namely employability, and that the results in the field of adaptability of undertakings still leave something to be desired."
"Yet, the moment of truth is now upon us, in my opinion. In this economic slow-down, Member States must prove that the Lisbon objectives, being sustainable growth, full employment and quality of jobs, were not simply prescribed for periods of boom, but must also remain applicable now."
"That means that the Member States will need to lend a hand, for at the same time, I have noticed that a number of cracks are starting to show in the employment strategy."
"First of all, I have noticed that people have cold feet about laying down specific, let alone European, objectives and benchmarks."
"For example, I think it is great that the Council has recognised that equal opportunities for men and women is a question of social justice as well as economic efficiency."
"However, I should also like to see the Council go the extra mile by formulating clear, quantitative and specific objectives in terms of reducing the wage gap and setting up a number of child care centres."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will be monitoring this closely."
"Secondly, with regard to the mix of policy measures, the method of open coordination is an interesting policy instrument in areas where Europe previously had nothing to say, and I very much applaud the fact that the Belgian Presidency has included the aspect of quality of employment."
"Commissioner, it seems obvious to me, however, that collective agreements as well as social legislation will be needed in different areas where the social dialogue has failed."
"That is why it is of the utmost importance for my group, for example, to know whether the European Commission will, after the failure of social consultation, produce a draft directive on temporary employment."
"Indeed, temporary employment can create new opportunities."
"However, for temporary employment to be quality employment which offers social rights, trade union rights, right to training and, at the same time, guarantees for permanent staff in the firms making use of their services, a European directive must be compiled which offers a number of warranties, warranties which have, inter alia, been presented in the joint declaration recently concluded by Euro-CIETT and UNI-EUROPA and that include, for example, equal treatment at temporary employment agencies and at firms making use of their services."
"Commissioner, following on from this debate, I should like to know when you will be presenting this draft directive to Parliament and in what way these essential basic conditions will be met."
"Mr President, I, too, wish to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her report."
"I very much agree with her remark about the significance of training and the importance of making a special effort on behalf of older people in the labour market."
"I do not agree that we, in the EU, should have a directive granting any rights, but I well understand that many in this House want to see special emphasis and importance given to actually ensuring a right to training."
"However, this is something which the individual countries must take care of."
"The employment guidelines provide, of course, both some political priorities and some political objectives, and they also provide a framework for deciding which funds are to be used in order to achieve the objectives."
"The funds are allocated to four pillars."
"The unemployed must be made better qualified to obtain jobs. They must be given more incentives to get into employment."
"That is the first pillar. Secondly, entrepreneurship must be promoted so that we see more companies and jobs created, partly through the removal of constricting regulations and bureaucratic arrangements."
"Thirdly, adaptability and flexibility must be promoted so that companies become more competitive. And fourthly, more opportunities must be provided for combining working life and family life so that there is a real opportunity for women to achieve equality in the labour market, leading to an improvement in the employment situation where women are concerned."
"Many points have been registered under the four pillars, and I believe we are coming to a point at which it is worth considering whether we are pinning too much on this process, for the more objectives we add to the process, the more we are also in danger of watering down the cooperation and perhaps losing sight of the real goals, namely those of creating more jobs and getting the unemployed into work."
"That being said, I am very pleased that, this time, we have obtained an innovation in the guidelines for the year 2000, whereby local and regional efforts are to be involved and local and regional employment strategies developed. I also believe this underlines the fact that the Commission will need resources for carrying out analyses and studies within this area."
"Mr President, I, too, want to thank Mrs Weiler for a good report."
"The Commission reports on which this debate is based presuppose that there are to be no major changes this year, because a large-scale evaluation of the first five-year period is to be carried out in the course of next year."
"We do not, therefore, wish to start making changes at the present stage."
"Naturally, this state of affairs has also had a marked influence upon the current report, which concerns what we have discussed in previous years."
"I think that the rapporteur has added some important aspects: quality at work, training, professional education, life long learning, equality etc."
"These amendments worry me because some of them place such heavy emphasis upon price stability policy, budget restriction policy and such like. They worry me because we are heading for an economy which is no longer as strong."
"The Luxembourg procedure has been very focused upon improving the supply of labour, but this presupposes that there are job opportunities and that current economic policy is creating job opportunities and countering the trend towards economic recession."
"I therefore believe that, in the current situation, the amendments in question militate against a European employment strategy."
"I should also like to say a few words about the future."
"A number of evaluations are now under way."
"I have been in contact with people working on a number of the ongoing research projects, and I believe that one of the things that will be emphasised is the fact that the Member States are failing to implement the policy properly."
"There is relatively broad agreement between those pursuing labour market policy in the Member States but, in spite of that, no such policy is being implemented in the Member States themselves."
"The labour market administrations really do not have much to do with the procedure itself."
"They are pursuing their own policy."
"The parliaments have no influence at all, but it is nonetheless they who must fund the national efforts we are demanding."
"It is therefore incredibly important that more attention be paid to the parliaments in particular, but also to the entire political process in the Member States, if the result is to be effective."
"I believe that this will be the major task in the forthcoming evaluation."
"It is not enough simply to emphasise indicators and such like. The bodies that supply the finance and then administer the measures must also play an active role in the process."
"Mr President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to address Mrs Weiler's report."
"She has identified unemployment as one of the most serious economic and social problems faced by the European Union."
"This was true prior to 11 September."
"It has now become an even more stark reality in the aftermath and against the background of continuing economic uncertainty which results from war."
"One in 12 EU citizens is unemployed today."
"This is an intolerable situation and one which is of great concern to all of us."
"Indeed, unemployment rates are much higher in some Member States."
"Solving the problem of unemployment requires active labour market measures."
"Labour markets do not always function efficiently, and Member States must be prepared to take up their responsibilities when the need arises."
"The Luxembourg process of employment guidelines is intended to give the Member States a powerful stimulus in shaping their employment policies."
"In the short time available to me I want to focus on recent events, but firstly I want to say that a number of key European industries are facing unprecedented difficulties."
"Every effort must be made to secure the maximum number of jobs."
"Hardest hit at the moment is the airline industry but we must not forget the tourist industry which has already suffered greatly this year from foot-and-mouth disease."
"In the case of the Irish national airline, Aer Lingus, 40% of their business and 60% of their profits are generated on trans-Atlantic routes."
"Ireland's location as an island state in the north-west periphery of the Union creates a particular set of circumstances to which I would urge the Commission to give full consideration."
"The collapse of Aer Lingus simply cannot be permitted."
"The economic and social consequences would be unparalleled in any other Member State in the Union, and the knock-on effects to related industries would be enormous."
"The fact that we are an island state without any linkage to the rest of Europe means that we require this."
"The Commission must look at this sympathetically and favourably."
"Mr President, I do not wish to make any profession of political faith in the many detailed proposals to be found in the report and in the Commission' s proposal for a Council decision."
"By far the majority of these are to be welcomed and are politically correct, and many are in response to urgent needs, especially the conclusions of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, which Mrs Theorin has reported on."
"However, I have some general remarks on employment policy and the EU' s labour market policy which have, of course, been an overriding theme of a number of reports and proposals here this afternoon."
"First of all, I have a remark to make about the reality as it is perceived."
"There is, of course, a very big gap between the reports of various kinds and the social reality."
"Armchair manifestos are largely absurd descriptions of social reality and will be completely unrecognisable to Europe' s enormous army of unemployed and socially excluded."
"A similar remove from reality is reflected in quite a few places in this report."
"We see this, for example, in recital F, which emphatically opposes the attitude that 'labour market considerations are subordinated to economic policy' ."
"The Treaty' s convergence requirements and such like may, upon examination, perhaps be seen as wishful thinking, but the only problem is that the Treaty is out of step with reality."
"The other remark I have to make is that employment policy and labour market policy, in general, consist, in large measure, of just such political confessions of faith. On the one hand, this means that we are operating in an area where what is decided is not legally binding, and this, of course, gives free rein to a lot of fine words and good intentions."
"On the other hand, we are, to a large extent, in areas for which the Treaty provides no legal bases for proper legal regulation. What, however, there is, at present, no legal base for, there may in future be a legal base for."
"I am thinking, for example, of the reference to harmonisation of social arrangements, of tax policy etc. However, I would remind you that, in Denmark, we have a saying about all good intentions, to the effect that 'the way to hell is paved with good intentions' ."
"Mr President, we all stand for a higher level of employment, indeed for full employment."
"But how?"
"There are considerable differences in how we answer the question as to how we want to achieve this objective."
"Many advocate, to the exclusion of all else, additional measures for employees, but that alone cannot reach the goal."
"We must indeed implement measures to benefit both employers and employees - or transpose such measures, as the case may be."
"This means, though, that we, together, have to be consistent in ensuring that there is a durable improvement in the economic conditions for our small and medium-sized businesses."
"Two-thirds of all European workers are employed in them."
"Their productive capacity must be improved, and that by means of easier access to additional finance on more favourable terms and a distinct reduction in the tax burden."
"Mr President, unemployment is the most serious problem facing our European national economies."
"Young people, women, older people and people with disabilities have a particularly hard time of it."
"There is a lack of access to training, vocational and continuing education, retraining and, of course, work itself."
"Society's weaker members must, though, be strengthened in a spirit of solidarity."
"Mrs Weiler is right to draw attention to the 1997 Luxembourg Summit."
"The Member States have been showing their true colours since the guidelines on employment policy appeared."
"Progress has been made in lifelong learning, in the application of practices which have proved their worth, in the involvement of both sides of industry and in action plans for local and regional employment."
"Above all, though, incentives for active jobseeking and for investment in research and development, the reduction of the tax burden on work and structural reforms are all still lacking."
"In this report, I do not find long-term strategies, but rather feverish measures for dealing with periods of slack growth."
"Not everything can be blamed on the tragic events of 11 September."
"Predictions of growth must be substantially adjusted, for example Germany's from 3% in January to 0.75% this week."
"Chancellor Schröder will not reach his goal of reducing the number of unemployed to 3.5 million in the election year, since the figure is expected to shoot up to 3.8 million."
"His famous steady hand is trembling."
"An additional EUR 2.5 billion will be required for unemployment benefit and for the Federal Institute for Employment."
"If Germany, the engine of growth, falters, the whole of the European Union will be affected."
"It is high time that there were financial concessions for SMEs."
"Taxes must not be raised still further, especially at a low point in the economic cycle."
"Tax reforms must be brought forward and the Member States must become more active in the fight against the black economy and tax evasion."
"I urge both sides of industry to make employment contracts more flexible and further modernise the organisation of work."
"In doing this, I am counting on the expertise and commitment of responsible managers and employees."
"Mr President, I should also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"When we look back at the very short period during which we have worked on employment policy within the EU, we have to note that it has been relatively successful."
"The level of employment has increased and unemployment has gone down, and that is indeed progress."
"Now that the economy is in decline, the moment of truth has, however, arrived, and I believe that the need for a coordinated employment policy is even greater than before."
"Even though the situation is encouraging now, we still see shortcomings, such as women' s low share of the labour market."
"It is not just that women' s share of that market is much lower than men' s."
"Rather, women are over-represented when it comes to atypical and precarious jobs in the labour market, even in countries which have a very high proportion of women in gainful employment."
"As has been observed in recent years, there are also problems when it comes to the older workforce."
"It is really a pity that such a small proportion of the population between the ages of 55 and 65 are in work."
"In this area, a range of measures relating to the working environment, skill development etc. is needed if we are going to be able to increase these figures."
"There are also very large regional differences and, for groups such as immigrants and the disabled, levels of employment are still very low."
"I welcome the discussion about quality at work and about not only creating more job opportunities but also increasing the quality of those jobs."
"In this area, a long list of measures is, however, required."
"That applies, of course, to the working environment, and especially to the new problems arising in the working environment in connection with people being stressed, excluded, burned out and such like."
"It also applies, however, to the issue of life long learning. I believe that this is perhaps the most central issue if we are to be able to obtain economic growth and create more employment opportunities in the future, and that is why I am supporting this universal right."
"I genuinely want to see a framework agreement at European level in which the social partners agree to this right."
"I do not know whether that is possible. Otherwise, the Commission will have to act."
"However, it would be the best solution. This right to skill development must then be adapted at national level within different sectors."
"Finally, a view of the open coordination method."
"The open coordination method exists parallel to legislation in the areas of employment law and the working environment."
"The open coordination method is good, but is lacking in the areas of democratic control and transparency."
"We must free the European Parliament to exercise influence on this process."
"The open coordination method has grown in importance over the course of a long period of time. It has operated relatively well, but there is a lack of democratic control."
"Mr President, I join with Mrs Weiler in many of her assessments and conclusions, and also consider much of what has been presented by the Commission to represent definite progress."
"Mrs Weiler, I would like to express my congratulations to you on this work, but also wish to point out three major problems that I find in the real world, which is not quite as rosy as it is depicted in some of the Commission's assessments or, indeed, in this report."
"First among them is the strategy of full employment by 2010 on the basis of a 3% growth rate."
"I found that illusory from the very start."
"The problem with it, though, is that other ways of combating unemployment have been disregarded."
"It is lamentable that even Social Democrats stay aloof if you advocate the reduction of working hours."
"Scant regard is paid to elements of a third economic sector for social, ecological and cultural services or indeed to the greening of society."
"The second problematic aspect - one to which Mr Andersson has just referred - is the split development of employment policy."
"There are, of course, some positive trends."
"Full employment in engineering and in technical and managerial occupations has increased."
"Modernisation really does have winners."
"The other side of the coin is, though, a clear increase in part-time employment, especially of women, among whom it has now reached 45.7%. in the EU."
"The third problem is this: you have addressed the issue of the quality of work but, in my opinion, the social content of work is largely disregarded."
"The law on employment contracts is 'made more flexible' but in reality it is relaxed."
"We see the promotion of the low-wage sector."
"The right of the long-term unemployed to choose their work is being limited."
"It is precisely because these things are naturally long-term phenomena that we are, I believe, obliged to act with sensitivity in taking precautions, so that no new social division arises."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Weiler, on the quality of her report."
"This House has been an enthusiastic supporter of the quantitative objectives laid down at the Lisbon and Stockholm European Councils with regard to the overall rate of employment, the rate of female employment and the rate of employment amongst the elderly."
"Unemployment, as has already been said, is one of the most serious economic and social problems the European Union faces and, currently, one in twelve citizens is unemployed, with the worst-affected groups being women, young people, the elderly, the disabled and members of ethnic minorities."
"The 2002 guidelines for employment must be accompanied in all aspects by qualitative objectives, hence the importance of adopting special measures for incentives and action in the field of economic and social cohesion for the least-developed regions which lack the appropriate structures."
"One pillar of the employment strategy, the entrepreneurial spirit, calls for priority to be given to the creation and growth of SMEs, which have enormous potential for job creation, as we can see from the most recent data from Eurostat, which shows that micro-enterprises with between one and nine workers made the greatest increase in terms of job creation in the European Union."
"The report quite rightly highlights reducing bureaucratic and tax obligations as a means of stimulating the creation and growth of companies."
"Nevertheless, we must reiterate that active support must be provided for the creation of infrastructures to support research and development, vocational training and lifelong learning so as to ensure the quality and continuity of employment."
"We all know that the European Union will only become a knowledge-based economy if all Member States make investment in human resources their absolute priority."
"While the European Parliament deliberates on a report on employment policy, a report that sings the praises of competition, and claims that the social market economy has proved its worth, this same market economy has recently claimed a further 4 000 victims, 4 000 Moulinex workers who now find themselves jobless."
"I am citing the example of Moulinex, because the decision has just been taken."
"I could, however, cite dozens of other businesses scattered throughout Europe, from Philips to Siemens, as well as several airlines."
"This is a tragedy for many thousands of employees, and a disaster for the regions that are affected."
"I would like to express my solidarity with the workers of these companies and my indignation at the attitude of their bosses, who have become wealthy on the back of the workers. The latter are made to pay for their bosses' economic blunders, and they are now jobless, have no wages coming in, sometimes after they have been in employment for many years."
"These workers have reaped no benefits whatsoever from their companies' periods of prosperity, and in no way are they responsible for their difficulties."
"Both governments and the European institutions are helping to prolong this despicable situation, where workers are suffering to enable company owners to safeguard their assets."
"The money needed to finance jobs must be deducted from the wealth accumulated by shareholders, past and present, and from the resources held by banks."
"Without this political will, these great promises on employment policy are nothing more than idle talk."
"So, I warn you, workers will not let themselves be pushed around forever; the greed of their bosses and the policies that favour their employers will eventually cause social upheaval."
"This is what will require a genuine employment policy, as it is this alone that will force those who have made their fortune on the back of others to shoulder their responsibilities."
"Mr President, further to the present evaluation of the employment process, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission, and of Parliament too, of course, to two points."
"First of all, there is the method of coordination itself."
"It has become a popular method in the social sector with regard to a number of themes which fall within national competence but which create common problems across all European countries."
"It is therefore possible to put forward common goals."
"However, Commissioner, the success of the method, given the fact that it is not a binding mechanism, relies on the moral and political pressure that can be exerted."
"Media attention plays an essential role in this."
"The employment process based on the open coordination method has now been running for some five years, and a dramatic decline has been noticed in the level of attention given to this."
"Media attention has waned and, as a result of this, there has been less pressure on national governments to take serious account of the objectives and of the annual criticism levelled by the Council and Commission at their national action plans."
"The open coordination method is only successful insofar as convergence stress continues to exist, and efforts will need to be made in order to sustain its existence."
"The question therefore arises as to how the pressure can be kept up. In my opinion, this should be one of the crucial points in the evaluation."
"The second point is best practices."
"The different reports include best practices for national Member States."
"The question is: to what extent is a policy being adopted to actually learn something from those best practices?"
"How many Member States have visited projects in other Member States?"
"How many best practices have been discussed in the different Member States?"
"It is one of the methods, even if the pressure subsides, to keep the employment policy going."
"I would therefore ask for both these points to be looked at in the evaluation."
"Mr President, this is the fourth public debate in the European Parliament on the Employment Strategy."
"The Employment Strategy is just one part of the European debate, but this is the first time there has been a general downturn in the economy, the first time there has been anxiety and, however much we want to avoid creating fear or panic, the situation is clearly going to be more difficult and problems with employment and economic development are bound to appear at the beginning of next year."
"Several honourable Members have raised the question of the Lisbon target, that is, is it feasible and is the proposal in question an adequate proposal now that circumstances have changed?"
"It is true that the analyses underlying our proposed guidelines are based on the excellent results for 2000, which possibly painted the most positive picture of employment and job creation in Europe in the last twenty years."
"The situation is different now, however."
"Can we continue within the same framework?"
"Can we continue with the same approach to the employment strategy?"
"Mr Schmid put this question very clearly."
"I think that we should start from the following premise: thanks to the reforms introduced on the job market over recent years, the common, healthy, budgetary base in the Member States and the efforts made to achieve monetary union, the European Union is better placed than ever before to cope with a recession."
"Let me just remind you of previous recessions, which were exacerbated to a frightening degree by differences and fluctuations between currencies within the Union."
"So today, we are better, much better placed to cope with a recession."
"The second point is that, obviously, if serious problems arise in the future, we have tools to deal with them in the form of monetary policy and interest rates, in the form of economic policy and the margins allowed within the Stability Pact."
"But what is important is for us to maintain the employment strategy without chopping and changing."
"It is important for us not to make short-term changes, but to keep to our objective and step up the implementation of the employment strategy."
"It would be a huge reversal at this stage if the Member States failed to focus their energies on efforts to apply the employment strategy as agreed."
"There are very specific policies which the Member States need to develop in relation to the targets for employment quotas, the need to incorporate policies on the quality of work, better management of change, especially corporate restructuring, investments in human resources and policies on equal opportunities, where, it has to be said, the results of our evaluation in the joint report on employment were fairly disappointing."
"The Member States have not put enough emphasis on policies for equal opportunities."
"No major changes have been made in the proposed guidelines, first, because we made changes last year, taking account of the message from Lisbon, and because we are currently in the process of a more general evaluation."
"The changes which we propose include three basic factors."
"The first is the need for national targets."
"The Member States need to set national employment targets."
"The second is the need for policies on the quality of work, and the third deals with the widening wage differential between the sexes."
"Unfortunately, there is still a huge discrepancy, as much as 15%, between men's and women's wages for the same work."
"As far as the European Parliament resolution is concerned, I should like in particular to thank Mrs Weiler for her very serious approach and to point out that your reference to the question of rationalising procedures, to cohesiveness between individual procedures in the European Union is something we fully endorse - we are planning to move on to a new framework for the package next year - and that we agree with you wholeheartedly on the need for cohesion between the general economic policy guidelines and guidelines for employment."
"I would refer again here to the agreement between Parliament and the Commission and the view taken by the Council that labour issues should be dealt with within the framework of the guidelines for employment and that the guidelines for employment should be policies which are absolutely distinct from the economic guidelines."
"There are numerous points on which there is consensus and agreement. There is the question of the social partners and their role, there is the question of flexibility and security on the job market and, to reply to Mrs Van Lancker, may I say that the Commission is determined to submit a proposal for a directive by the end of the year, due to the lack of success of the social partners."
"This proposal is being prepared as we speak."
"There is a common view on the need to work with the candidate countries, so that they can incorporate the strategies for employment, and to step up policies on sexual equality."
"Your text contains proposals for changes to the guidelines."
"The European Commission will examine a good number of them."
"Certain particularly important points to which I should like to refer are: the lack of adequate information on the financial means available to the Member States in order to apply the strategy; the need for a framework between the social partners and the Member States for applying lifelong learning to companies; the need to combine the objective of promoting mobility with reductions in regional inequalities and for stronger measures to combat illegal employment - this links up with the issue of immigration to which Mrs Weiler referred in her personal presentation - and the need to deal with specific entry barriers to women on the job market."
"Honourable Members, we are planning to submit a revised proposal to the Council over coming weeks which takes account of these questions."
"I should like to offer you my warmest thanks because the open and highly interesting debate on the guidelines in Parliament has enhanced the substance and role of the strategy for employment in European policy in general."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 11.30 tomorrow."
"Exposure of workers to risks arising from physical agents"
"The next item on the agenda is the recommendation for Second Reading (A5-0320/2001) by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Common Position of the Council [7914/1/2001 - C5-0293/2001 - 1992/0449(COD)] with reference to the adoption of the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on minimum requirements to protect the health and safety of workers from physical hazards (vibrations) (16th individual directive under Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)."
"Mr President, the Council of Ministers has presented a common position on mechanical vibrations."
"There are a great many good things in the common position."
"The best is that agreement on a compromise has been successfully reached in the Council."
"This means that there is now broad recognition of the fact that vibrations constitute a health risk, when it comes both to hand/arm vibrations and whole-body vibrations."
"It is also good that all three institutions appear to be in agreement as to a method of limiting these vibrations."
"The key to this method is the parallel introduction of action values and limit values that should never be exceeded."
"In the Committee reading, we talked a lot about the limit values."
"That is really rather a pity, however, for it is in actual fact the action values that are the most important for, when the action values are exceeded, the employer is obliged to do something and to take preventative action to change the way in which the work is organised."
"It is precisely this method which offers flexibility and emphasises prevention rather than injunctions."
"Moreover, I find it very annoying that it is precisely this flexibility and the emphasis on prevention that have not been recognised at all by the opponents of the proposal here in Parliament."
"That is a great pity, in view of the fact that they themselves often talk about flexibility and prevention rather than injunctions."
"However, there are, unfortunately, also less happy facets of this proposal by the Council of Ministers."
"The Commission' s original proposal has been weakened in a number of ways, and it has therefore been necessary to table some amendments."
"I will go through a couple of them."
"Amendment No 1 is a reminder that we still do not have the directives concerning the remaining physical agents."
"We know that the Noise Directive is on the way, but we are now waiting impatiently for the latter, and it would be appropriate if, by accepting our amendments, the Commission were, today, to tell us that they are as committed as we are to putting these directives in place."
"We have been waiting for many years."
"Amendment No 2 is crucial."
"As I say, it is good that the Council could agree to set a limit value, but when you consider how high it really is, you can also understand how agreement could have been successfully reached."
"The proposed 1.15 m/s2 constitutes a significant weakening of the original proposal."
"The report therefore proposes a limit value of 0.8 m/s2."
"We know from the internationally recognised ISO standards that it can be said with certainty that there are health risks with exposure of more than 0.8 m/s2."
"It therefore makes more sense to set a limit value in which the protection of employees will, in actual fact, be something real."
"There is no question of any tightening-up. All that is proposed is a return to the level proposed by the Commission itself at first reading, and there is no new knowledge to justify choosing another limit value."
"Some MEPs have repeated again and again that there is not one single proof of the connection between whole-body vibrations and injury."
"That is simply not the case, however."
"There is a quite clear connection between strong vibrations and injury."
"That is something that science is agreed about."
"It is true that we cannot put clear figures upon the number of people who will be injured in the case of a specific limit value."
"However, that is how it will always be when it is a question of people and their working environment."
"In such cases, the precautionary principle must be applied, and this is also something actually laid down in the Treaty."
"Amendment No 5 proposes shorter transitional periods than those proposed in the common position."
"Clearly, these could be applied in practice out in the real world."
"With the common position, however, we should arrive at transitional periods of up to 12 years, and it makes almost no sense to legislate for such long periods."
"Finally, on behalf of my own Group of the Party of European Socialists and of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that makes it possible to exempt agriculture and forestry from the limit values for whole-body vibrations."
"We have arrived at a compromise whereby agriculture and forestry, like aviation and shipping, are given the opportunity to be exempt from these limit values for whole-body vibrations."
"We have done this because we remained doubtful as to whether agriculture could, in fact, comply with these conditions."
"Allow me to emphasise two things in this connection."
"First of all, I think that the farming industry' s impact assessments have been very exaggerated and therefore not to be taken seriously."
"It has been maintained that farmers would only be able to work for two hours a day."
"That, I think, is wrong."
"I believe in actual fact that, in preparing the assessments, it has been forgotten that the directive only applies to employees and not to people who are self-employed."
"The second thing it is important to state is that this compromise proposal does not mean that we are giving up combating harmful vibrations within agriculture."
"It simply means choosing another method, and it is worth emphasising that the action values must go on being maintained."
"I hope that the Commission and the Council will respond positively to our proposal."
"I also hope that we shall obtain wide support for the proposals here in the House."
"The text before us is balanced and reasonable and fulfils the main purpose of this directive, namely to ensure flexibility in the workplace at the same time as ensuring that employees are guaranteed the necessary protection against harmful vibrations in the workplace."
"Mr President, the proposal for a directive which is before us for its second reading, falls within the scope of measures that aim to improve the safety and health of workers. As you know, this is an objective that Parliament quite rightly considers very important."
"We must, however, find a fair balance between, on the one hand, the need to protect the health and safety of workers and, on the other hand, the need to prevent this directive from placing excessive burdens on companies and particularly on small- and medium-sized enterprises."
"If we adopt overly restrictive exposure limit values, it could, in practice, and technically speaking, turn out to be extremely difficult to abide by them; it could actually harm the interests of workers, either because this could lead to their working time being limited to two hours per day, or because if the limit values are not applied, the protection they do have could be significantly reduced."
"Since this report only concerns the issue of vibrations, we must also take into account the delicate and hard-won agreement between the various national requirements, and we must not impose further excessive restrictions on the sectors and industries concerned."
"And in this respect, I would like to say that our Committee was not able to complete its work due to an incredibly busy timetable."
"We were unable to interview all the relevant people involved before the deadline, and this is something I regret."
"For these reasons, our group believes that the amendments adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs are a relatively acceptable compromise between the requirement for the protection of workers and on the competitiveness of European industry."
"Nevertheless, our group considers that it is essential to include the derogation option for the agricultural and forestry sectors, since the current arrangements for servicing and replacing machinery in these sectors would not enable exposure limit values to be effectively applied."
"On a personal note, and particularly with regard to the work that we did last week, I would lastly like to thank Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her cooperation."
"Mrs Diamantopoulou, I hope that this spirit of openness, as part of our conciliation work with the Council, will enable us to agree on a halfway point so that the directive can be adopted within a reasonable timeframe."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, for the tremendous grasp she has demonstrated of this highly technical subject both in committee and in plenary."
"My father and his brothers and, in fact, all the male members of my family worked in the coalmines in the northeast of England and most of them have received compensation for both industrial white finger, which is caused by hand-arm vibration, and industrial deafness."
"This proposal concerning physical agents is a very real proposal to me."
"Vibration has been a major problem in the past."
"But it still is, and that is demonstrated by the very strenuous lobbying on all Members of this House from various sectors of industry in relation to this proposal."
"I would like to echo what the rapporteur has said about the other elements of the original physical agents' directive."
"Noise, the original directive of 1986, was due to be reviewed in 1991."
"Here we are, ten years later, and no revision to the existing legislation on noise has been made."
"On optical radiation, industrial lasers were in their infancy when the original proposal was brought forward."
"They are now in widespread use and we need to update or introduce law at European level on that subject in regard to fields and waves."
"We are increasingly bombarded by fields and waves of all types and all intensities in our homes and workplaces."
"That is set to increase radically as a result of developments such as the new bluetooth standard."
"All of those outstanding elements are becoming increasingly urgent, and I hope the Commission will continue its good work to break the impasse that has so far existed inside the Council."
"The rapporteur has introduced a number of important amendments in her report, but probably among the most important is Amendment No 2 concerning whole-body vibration."
"Amendment No 2 represents a compromise, it lies between the Commission's original proposal and the common position, and I hope it will receive the support of the House."
"We have received strenuous lobbying, particularly on whole-body vibration."
"There is general consensus on the need to act on hand-arm vibration, but industrial lobbyists have worked hard to convince Members that there is no link between whole-body vibration and injury."
"I know for a fact that the Commission has at least 17 box-files of evidence showing causality between exposure to whole-body vibration and injury."
"The difficulty is in untangling what proportion of the injury is due directly to whole-body vibration and what proportion is due to other factors such as poor ergonomics or bad posture."
"There is a causal link and there is a need to act."
"I hope we will see support for the rapporteur on that issue."
"The rapporteur has also mentioned a compromise to exclude agriculture."
"It proved necessary to introduce such a compromise; the exclusion would be for five years if it does come to pass."
"I would have preferred that it did not occur, but it had to happen to secure political consensus here for today's vote."
"If it is agreed, the Commission must not do its usual trick of waiting the full five years before assessing the scientific evidence and bringing forward a proposal."
"The preparatory work needs to be done to move quickly once that five years has expired."
"What, then, we are aiming for and will continue to seek to achieve in conciliation, beyond the debate and vote today, is a balance between action levels and limit values which it will be possible for industry to accept and implement but will at the same time drive forward improved engineering to eliminate vibration from new equipment and improve the way in which ergonomic considerations are taken into account."
"I hope the report will be supported today."
"I am going to deal specifically with whole-body vibration."
"As has already been said, there is evidence that whitefinger can be caused by hand-arm vibration, but I do not believe that there is sufficient evidence that whole body vibration causes tremendous health risks for workers."
"There is a slight health risk, but even the ISO standards say that there is no quantitative health risk, and so without further scientific evidence, I think it would be crazy for us to put more burdens on industry."
"I am glad that the rapporteur has eventually agreed that we need a compromise on agriculture, so I urge you all to vote for Amendment No 11."
"This would exclude agriculture and forestry for five years and then it would come back to Parliament after further research and scientific evidence has been provided."
"If we do not vote for the compromise in Amendment No 11, I believe that the harvest across the whole of the EU will not be able to take place."
"If we do not vote for it, tractor drivers, for instance, will be able to drive their tractor for between 2 to 4 hours in any 8 hour period and that is if we get the 0.8 m/s2 that the rapporteur is suggesting."
"Even if agriculture and forestry is taken back, we need to go back to the common position of 1.15 m/s2 instead of the 0.8 that the rapporteur is proposing, because if we do not go back to that, other parts of the industry such as engineering, mining, construction will have tremendous problems, so I urge you to make sure that you do not vote to put more restrictions on industry when we do not have a quantitative health risk demonstrated."
"I hereby beg you not to vote for the rapporteur's position on this and to go back to the common position and vote for Amendment No 11 and against Amendments Nos 2, 4, 12 and 9."
"Mr President, in my opinion, the rapporteur has done sterling work."
"I have been active in an advisory role vis-à-vis works councils, trade unions and industry concerning conditions at work, among other things."
"I have observed that, for some fifteen years, we in the Netherlands - but that also applies to other Member States in terms of best practices - have been working with the ISO Standard 2631, as recommended and followed by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt."
"Only at the end did we decide to adopt the amendment by Mrs Hermange."
"I actually agree that we should not simply consider the views of industry."
"There are also other angles to be considered."
"For example, the trade unions have stated that this is not simply a matter of exposure from a health perspective, but also a matter of symptoms of fatigue, for example."
"Consequently, the standard should, from the point of view of safety - or, rather, the lack of this - actually be stricter than is now the case."
"I have not yet heard this aspect mentioned here, and it should actually help us find a happy medium."
"Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Thorning-Schmidt on her excellent work and, having said this, I would like to remind you that Article 31(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that every worker has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity."
"This is a wide-ranging declaration, within the chapter on solidarity, which includes not only the measures taken against obvious risks, such as the risk of falling or risks faced when dealing with abrasive materials, but also those preventative measures used against risks that could go undetected by the majority of those who are not experts in this field."
"These are the risks that those who work in mines, in construction and in the field of transport have to face on a daily basis, which, according to those who study them, affect up to 24% of European workers."
"These risks originate from two different types of vibration: Hand-arm vibration, which is the cause of whitefinger, impaired feeling and grip, amongst other problems, or Whole-body vibration, which is the cause of back problems, lumbar pains and slipped discs."
"It is worth remembering, Commissioner, that these measures should not be limited to including only physical causes, such as vibrations, but should also take account of electromagnetic fields, noise and waves and optical radiation, for example, and also bear in mind the transitional period needed to make the required adjustments arising from the adoption of these measures."
"I am convinced that all employers and workers have a common goal, which is the improvement of their workspace and environment, so that the place in which they work is suitable."
"A transitional period will be needed so that equipment can be replaced and procedures can be improved and adapted. Differences relating to technological development and type of activity, such as agriculture, will have to be taken into account, with a conviction that 'no-risk' does not exist and that the quest for safety is the responsibility of all those involved: workers, be they self-employed or employed, employers or local, regional or national administrations."
"Mr President, in my two years in this Parliament I have never received such a barrage of letters of complaint as I have about this report."
"I am talking particularly about whole-body vibration aspects, rather than hand and arm vibration."
"These comments are not just from employers, large and small, in farming, quarrying, mining, engineering and construction businesses - to name but a few - who are rightly concerned about the very viability of their entire industries under these proposals."
"They are also from ordinary employees concerned about their jobs if the rapporteur's amendments go through."
"Recently published and well-respected scientific work from Germany, Italy and the UK, as well as the rapporteur's own country of Denmark, shows no direct quantifiable link between whole-body vibration and back pain."
"I note that Mr Hughes maintains otherwise; not for the first time his own government disagrees with him."
"The above comments from constituents have two things in common: their anger that Socialist MEPs should be proposing such amendments in the first place, and their sheer disbelief that such MEPs could be so out of touch with reality."
"Let me be clear."
"The above comments are nothing to do with health and safety, issues which all of us recognise as important."
"They are everything to do with the rapporteur jumping to conclusions that are not supported by specific scientific evidence."
"The UK government is strongly opposed to the rapporteur's proposed amendments which, it maintains, would damage industry and agriculture for no benefit."
"UK Conservative MEPs agree, and we urge the UK Labour MEPs, who supported this report so resolutely in committee, now to support the common position, and meanwhile to support our compromise, tabled jointly by a number of political groups."
"I urge you all to join us in voting for sound science and sound sense."
"Mr President, this is really one of the worst pieces of legislation I have seen in this Parliament."
"The benefits it offers are vague and speculative - they are unproven and unquantified, but the costs are real, immediate and massive."
"Credible estimates suggest that the costs of implementation in the UK alone could range between EUR 15 and 30 billion."
"The effects will reach into a wide-range of industries - not only agriculture, but road haulage, construction and many other areas."
"I have been contacted by an exceptionally wide-range of business organisations and they are universally opposed to the measure and especially to those amendments which would make it even more repressive."
"Those organisations include: the Confederation of British Industry, the National Farmers' Union, the Road Haulage Association, the Quarrying Association, the Coal Industry and JCB, the heavy equipment manufacturer."
"It appears that the limit set by the directive would restrict a truck driver to six hours work, a tractor driver to two or three hours and a brush cutter to 15 minutes."
"This will do huge damage to European economies. It will cost jobs."
"It has been pointed out that the average jogger exceeds the limit by a factor of 7 or 8, while even walking down a road could break the rules."
"I suspect that I was over the limit on Monday on the bus from Basle Airport to Strasbourg!"
"The directive also places huge new costs and administrative burdens on industry in terms of measuring vibration levels and recording exposure."
"There is a crying need, Mr President, for proper regulatory impact assessments to be applied to European legislative proposals."
"If that had been done in this case, it would never have got this far."
"Any possible benefits are far outweighed by the costs."
"It appears that we cannot reject the whole proposal, but I appeal to colleagues to support amendments which would soften it and to reject amendments which would make it even more disastrous than it already is."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to congratulate Mrs Thorning-Schmidt for her excellent report particularly because it is such a difficult technical issue: It is not only that is a difficult dossier, but it has been before the Council since 1994 and only now are things on the move."
"I consider that this legislation on vibrations will be a fundamental step to achieving better protection of the health and safety of workers exposed to risks arising from physical agents, but of course, we have to take into account the economic impact, the impact in the enterprises - the small, medium and large."
"That is why we propose a step-by-step approach."
"We cannot forget that a considerable number of workers suffer from the effects of their exposure to vibrations, notably neurological, vascular and musculo-skeletal disorders."
"This is a particularly serious problem which is costly for business and society and which, more importantly, causes suffering for the people directly involved as well as for their families, and when we discuss costs, we must calculate the cost that enterprises have because of the health problems of their workers."
"On your amendments, the Commission has worked very hard to maintain a high level of protection while, at the same time, ensuring that a compromise could be reached."
"Although we consider that lower values more in line with the amended proposal would be more appropriate, we have accepted the Council's common position with a view to achieving a global compromise."
"The common position increases the exposure limit values and exposure action values for the whole-body vibrations and introduces new provisions on transitional periods for existing work equipment in general and for equipment used in the agricultural and forestry sectors in particular."
"For reasons of consistency, the Commission cannot therefore accept Amendment No 2, which decreases the exposure values for whole-body vibrations in the common position, nor the part of Amendment No 5 which reduces the length of the transitional periods."
"However, the last part of Amendment No 5 would be acceptable if slightly redrafted."
"Similarly, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 8 and 12 because they merely restate the principles of the employer's responsibility already contained in the Framework Directive without additional added value, nor Amendments Nos 9 and 13 since they either remove the possibility for Member States to grant derogations on whole-body vibrations in case of seasonal work or simply allow for the averaging of exposures which is already considered by the ISO standards to which the directive refers."
"The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 11 for both technical and political reasons."
"Although the Commission agrees with the principles behind the changes proposed by Amendment No 1, we can only agree with the first part but we cannot accept the second part which foresees the commitment of both the European Parliament and the Council to continue with the adoption of other parts of the original physical agents proposal."
"This is not a question of political disagreement."
"This part of the recital contravenes the rule that the recitals 'shall not contain normative provisions or political exhortations'."
"I accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7."
"These amendments clearly improve and clarify the text."
"I regret that I have to reject Amendment No 6 as it stands."
"Nevertheless, I could accept the idea of justifications to be provided by Member States on any transitional periods or derogations granted by them."
"This should however be integrated in Article 14 (1)."
"Finally, let me remind you that the step-by-step approach we have used, starting with vibrations, implies that we should now push ahead with the remaining three physical agents included in the Commission's original proposal: noise, electromagnetic fields and optical radiation."
"To conclude, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 7."
"It can accept in part Amendments Nos 1, 5 and 6 and it rejects Amendments Nos 2, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13."
"Thank you, Commissioner Diamantopoulou."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to judge by what I am hearing now, I think we will soon be needing a new Directive on noise in the Chamber during a debate!"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon today."
"Mr President, I wanted to ask you about the decision of the Bureau that was taken last night on the issue of a Staff Regulation."
"I want to know on what basis that decision was taken."
"I think that the House should be reminded that when the present Commission was accepted, it was accepted on the basis of the need for radical reform."
"A decision was taken by the Bureau last night to adopt a rather more cautious approach than the one that has been adopted in plenary, but we did not want as in the past, we wanted a radical overhaul."
"I wish to know why the Bureau has gone against the spirit of what was accepted in the plenary both on the van Hulten report and on the Harbour report and why, given the critical importance and interinstitutional nature of this issue, the Vice-President for Reform, Commissioner Kinnock, was not invited to speak at that meeting."
"Could you, Mr President, give me an assurance that the Bureau will look at this again and also invite the Vice-President of the Commission to speak to the Bureau in order to amend the letter that was agreed last night?"
"I was at the Bureau meeting last night and I am not aware that the Bureau actually took any final decisions."
"They took a decision to write a letter to Mr Prodi and therefore there are still ongoing discussions on this matter."
"At the last part-session, I raised under points of order, this whole question and asked the presidency to give this House a comprehensive report about the state of reform discussions as soon as possible."
"So far, we have not had this report and I emphasise here the concerns of my colleague Mrs Morgan."
"In my report, that was passed by a very big majority in this House, we set the linear career structure on merit as the centre-piece of the reform."
"But it appears from comments being made by one of the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament in the newspapers and not to this House, that the whole issue is now not regarded as important by the Bureau."
"I hope I have the support of all colleagues in the House in saying that we still consider this the centre-piece of the reforms and we do not see any reason why Parliament should not follow a similar line to that being taken by the Commission in this crucial area."
"The point made by you and by Mrs Morgan will be raised again in the Bureau."
"I can assure you that it will be given proper consideration."
"Mr President, can we take that as an assurance that no letter will be sent until the Bureau has met again on Thursday, because that is what I think the House would like to hear?"
"I cannot tell you the status of the letter."
"I imagine that it has already been sent, so I cannot say that it will not be sent."
"But the matter will be given full discussion when the Bureau meets again tomorrow."
"Mr President, can I just object to the fact that the Thorning-Schmidt report and the Ghilardotti report are going to be voted on immediately after the debate? Some Groups have not had a chance to look at the Ghilardotti report in particular and to debate them."
"Can we at least, if this happens in the future, have far more warning?"
"We only heard last night that this was about to happen when it was too late for us to do anything about it."
"This report has been scheduled for today since the agenda was drawn up."
"We get a great deal of complaints from the press who say that we do not vote quickly enough after we have had a debate."
"Therefore a balance has to be struck."

"Theato (PPE-DE), rapporteur."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to make a few short remarks on the procedure."
"In accordance with Article 247 of the Treaty, the Council has on this occasion, after consulting Parliament, to appoint nine members of the Court of Auditors."
"Four of the appointments are re-appointments by France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria."
"The members concerned are to be reappointed for a term of six years."
"Three Members are new appointments by Germany, Greece and the United Kingdom."
"Two are to take over for the remaining four years of the term from their predecessors, who have left office early."
"Denmark and Sweden are the countries in question here."
"Article 247(6) of the Treaty makes this possible."
"In accordance with rule 35 of the Rules of Procedure, the Committee on Budgetary Control, being the competent committee, was entrusted by the President of Parliament with the examination of the nominees to the Court of Auditors."
"On 10 September and 8/9 October, these examinations took place in public session."
"This was followed by a brief in-camera discussion and then candidates were voted on individually by secret ballot."
"Candidates were, of course, examined as individuals."
"The result of the examination and the secret ballot that then took place was that we had voted in favour of all nominated members and also recommend them to this House."
"Mr President, I see from Rule 114 of the Rules of Procedure that procedure without debate applies when the committee responsible has not tabled any amendments or when all the amendments for deliberation have been adopted with no more than three Members voting against them."
"This report has now come to us without debate, although the Committee took a vote on the Swedish candidate, Mr Tobisson, when more than three Members voted against him because he has no experience as an auditor whatsoever."
"For this reason, I would like to hear your interpretation as to whether it is right that this matter can be voted on without debate, without the possibility of openly putting forward these points of view, as more than three Members have voted against a nominee."
"I insist this matter be referred to Parliament' s plenary for debate there."
"Of course every Member is allowed to vote as they so wish."
"You correctly state Rule 114."
"The committee has requested that this be put to Parliament."
"We are now in a position where the Conference of Presidents approved this being put on the agenda of Parliament at the request of the committee."
"Therefore the vote will go ahead."
"(In successive votes Parliament adopted the nine resolutions)"
"Report (A5-0318/2001) by Didier Rod, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the proposal for a Council recommendation on the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in human medicine (COM(2001) 333 - C5-0411/2001 - 2001/2164(COS))"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, resistance to antimicrobial agents now causes hundreds of thousands of deaths the world over."
"Diseases that we thought were under control, such as tuberculosis or the plague, are re-appearing and are posing a serious threat to human health, particularly in developing countries."
"We acknowledged, by voting in favour of the Khanbhai report, that resistance to anti-malarial agents was one of the causes of malaria-related deaths."
"But we now know that one of the true causes of the current situation in Europe is the incorrect use of antibiotics and over-consumption, not only in the field of human medicine but also in animal feed."
"Reports on GMOs also indicate this..."
"I am sorry to interrupt you, as rapporteur, but it is not correct for a rapporteur to start making a speech before we take a vote."
"If you have something pertinent to say about the vote, we will listen to you."
"But if it is not to do with voting procedure I suggest to you that, as rapporteur, you have already had your opportunity of speaking to the substance of the debate."
"- (DA) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of appointing nine new members of the Court of Auditors."
"All nine candidates are well qualified to become excellent members of the Court of Auditors."
"We would nonetheless remind the Member States that, in appointing candidates, they must take Article 247, Paragraph 2 of the Treaty seriously: 'The Members of the Court of Auditors shall be chosen from among persons who belong or have belonged in their respective countries to external audit bodies or who are especially qualified for this office.'"
"The Court of Auditors plays a very important role in relation to supervising the Community' s funds."
"It is therefore very important that there should be enduring respect for its Members."
"We have voted on these nine re-appointed and newly appointed members of the Court of Auditors with mixed feelings."
"The EP' s role in this instance is marginal, since the Council is the designated institution."
"We endorse this distribution of tasks in accordance with the Treaty."
"However, the quality of the candidates should be paramount in the EP' s verdict."
"We were bitterly disappointed in this respect, both in terms of some of the Member States and in terms of the majority of the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"A few candidates are, in our opinion, clearly not up to the task and, in one instance, do not even meet the Treaty requirements."
"A Member State that puts forward a candidate simply on the basis of a long political career, without the relevant candidate having qualifications in the area of accounts, should hang its head in shame."
"But also in other areas, the level of candidates was very diverse."
"For such a post with high accountability and a huge significance for community funds, only heavyweights in the financial-political arena should be put forward."
"Since this has not happened in a few cases, we have given some the benefit of the doubt, but we were unable to give the weakest candidates our vote."
"Report Rod (A5-0318/2001):"
"We shall not discuss the medical arguments put forward in favour of restricting the use of antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents."
"However, the report mentions the need to save money on health care costs."
"Although this need could, generally, be justified, we nonetheless reject any argument for this."
"We know only too well that, when it comes to making savings on medical spending, it is always the health care of the working classes, and particularly the poorest sectors of society, that suffers."
"The result of these 'careful recommendations' , which governments usually use as a pretext to take restrictive measures, does nothing to affect the excessive use of medicine by the rich, whilst the poor are deprived of even the most basic levels of care."
"We therefore abstained from voting on this report."
"Report Schmidt (A5-0324/2001):"
"Mr President, I have made so many speeches that I have lost my voice."
"Maybe I have delivered too many explanations of vote!"
"I voted for the directive on undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities because one way that pensioners get rich - I am not being serious here - is through reaping the benefit of fruitful savings."
"In this way, if their savings bear fruit, as the directive proposes, pensioners will be able to follow the example of the great single-handed circumnavigator, Mr Francis Chichester - the father of our beloved fellow Member, Mr Giles Chichester - who celebrated his sixty-fifth birthday while sailing single-handedly round the world."
"Report Jensen (A5-0319/2001):"
"Mr President, the Pensioners' Party voted for the Jensen report."
"I would nevertheless like to tell Commissioner Diamantopoulou, who works so hard to help workers and to increase the number of jobs throughout Europe, that, as representative of the Pensioners' Party, I believe that, if we are to have more jobs, we must reduce the cost of labour: we must, therefore, reduce the cost of pension services and contributions while still increasing the size of pensions."
"We want less contributions and larger pensions, and that can only be achieved by careful, sound administration of contributors' money."
". (PT) We have supported this report since its first reading in February 2001."
"Its relevance warrants our support once again and this is why we have voted in favour of it."
"Developing, programming, monitoring and assessing the European employment strategy with the involvement of the social partners and local and regional authorities are important and essential objectives for fully and effectively achieving the strategic ambitions defined at the Lisbon European Council."
"More and better jobs mean greater economic and social cohesion."
"It is, therefore, crucial that cooperation between Member States is improved with regard to exchanging experiences and information and identifying best practices in addition to the involvement of the social partners and local and regional authorities, not forgetting the implementation of an active and transparent public information policy that takes account of the public' s requirements for transparency."
"One particularly praiseworthy aspect of this report is the attention it pays to the promotion of equal opportunities for men and women in the employment and labour markets."
"Undertaking studies on the provision of childminding structures and of home assistance and care services is an essential instrument for assessing shortcomings in this field, initially and then putting into practice, in a later stage, an action plan designed to enable people to reconcile their professional lives with their family lives."
"With regard to the budget and annual appropriations, we agree with the rapporteur' s position and fully support it."
"Report Ghilardotti (A5-0325/2001):"
"Mr President, I voted for the Ghilardotti report."
"Keeping employees informed is a very good thing, Mr President, but I tried substituting the word 'pensioners' for the word 'employees."
"The result is a wonderful report: the European Union calls for pensioners to be kept better informed; the European Union wants improved consultation of pensioners."
"The pensioners would be happy to know that there is a report addressing the issue of more information and consultation for pensioners, for it is still the case today that some European pensioners do not even know how large their pension will be the day before they start to draw it, they do not know at what age they will be able to retire and they find the documents presented to them totally incomprehensible."
"I therefore hope that I will soon be able to vote in favour of consulting and informing pensioners as well as employees."
". This particular proposal can be traced over 20 years and today we should be reaping the benefit of the conclusion of intense negotiations and compromises, not only here in Parliament, but also in the Council and amongst the social partners."
"The Common position offers the most appropriate means of ensuring that we can achieve the objective of guaranteeing that employees have real access to information and consultation, and also offers them an opportunity to have an input into the continuing operation of the enterprise."
"Unfortunately, the amendments proposed by the rapporteur and approved by the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs goes totally against the spirit of co-operation achieved up to now."
"In particular, the issue of sanctions to be imposed at an EU level flies totally in the face of subsidiarity and competences of national governments."
"All that has been gained is that this issue ends up in conciliation and brings us no nearer to achieving the real goal of securing information and consultation for the employees of the European Union over the running of their companies."
". Generally, I welcome the outcome of this vote, although I wish more Members had been willing to support the amendments dealing with sanctions against companies that fail to implement the directive's requirements."
"However, there is no doubt that the measures agreed by Parliament will make an important difference for many workers throughout the EU."
"Hopefully, thanks to the tighter definitions of the information required and the proposal for a delay for full consultation in the light of proposed large-scale redundancies and other potentially harmful changes, we shall avoid the situation where we see workers appealing to this Parliament to protect their rights and interests."
"I also welcome Parliament's insistence on the rapid implementation of this directive for all Member States, whatever the current state of employee representation."
"I trust that Council will now follow Parliament's lead."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by Mrs Jensen."
"The call to increase the EU's fund for job creation comes at a time when the EU is attempting to coordinate its employment strategies by the so-called open method of coordination."
"This fund could do much to bolster these efforts and consolidate the work under way since the Lisbon dot.com Summit."
"Moreover, the report also recognises the valid and worthwhile role that local and regional authorities can play in the process of job creation."
"It is only when we work with such authorities, who have vital in-depth knowledge of regional employment needs and peculiarities at their disposal, that we shall be able to reap the potential benefits outlined in this report."
"Report Thorning-Schmidt (A5-0320/2001):"
"Mr President, the pensioners who sent me, Mr Carlo Fatuzzo, here include a large number of people who have become ill as a consequence of exposure to mechanical vibrations throughout their working lives."
"I therefore voted for Mrs Thorning-Schmidt' s report, although I know she would prefer me not to speak any more in this Chamber and has tabled an anti-Fatuzzo amendment which, I am glad to say, was rejected by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I therefore call for working hours to be limited in places where there are vibrations which are unavoidable because of the nature of the activity to be performed but which are more frequent than the maximum permitted limits."
"According to Mrs Thorning-Schmidt, 24% of workers in Europe are exposed to mechanical vibrations."
"These are mainly those working in the mining, building, manufacturing, forestry and transport industries."
"Hand-arm vibrations cause serious and virtually systematic problems, such as the 'white finger' phenomenon in woodcutters and forestry workers; carpal tunnel syndrome, poor circulation and loss of feeling."
"Whole body vibrations cause lumbar pain, slipped discs, as well as premature degeneration of the spinal column."
"However, despite the fact that these problems are known to be harmful to workers' health, it has taken almost ten years for a European directive to be drafted!"
"The reason why this has taken so long is because the management in these sectors and equipment manufacturers are taking a stand, and they do not want restrictive standards, which would mean the equipment used would have to be replaced immediately in the light of technological developments."
"Furthermore, businesses do not always use approved equipment."
"And where they do, they do not necessarily inspect it on a regular basis, so the vibrations increase."
"Above all, however, the conditions under which people are obliged to work are considerably aggravating factors."
"The equipment concerned is often used by workers who are paid for their output, in terrible conditions of intensive work."
"We must oblige businesses to pay for regular breaks throughout the day."
"It is scandalous that workers continue to risk their health in order to earn a living."
"Report Korhola (A5-0321/2001):"
"When the environment is respected as it is in Mrs Korhola' s directive, Mr President, we are all extremely happy."
"Indeed, I have just returned from a visit of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy to Slovakia, where we saw the progress made by this country in environmental matters, and I have to say that we were all happy campers, Mr President."
"Just think, one evening, as I was about to get into the lift to go to the second floor, I saw Mr Bushill-Matthews and the usually impassive Mr Blokland rush into the lift, both extremely happy too, shouting in unison: 'Mr Fatuzzo, we cannot leave you alone with Mrs Malliori' , who, as we all know, is extremely attractive like all Greek women."
"Even Mr De Roo, who places great store by silence, heard these utterances!"
"'Public participation' in 'plans relating to the environment' is something we are obviously in favour of."
"However, this report is another of those indecisive documents, where the proclaimed good intentions do not hide the ineffective measures proposed."
"If we consider current events in France alone, the Mont Blanc tunnel has been reopened despite the views of the people living nearby; the protests of those living in the Rhône valley against the noise pollution caused by lorries using the motorway, or even against the route of the TGV railway line, have been disregarded, we can see how little importance the authorities attach to public opinion when it is voiced."
"Apart from that, what control can the public now have over preventing a disaster, such as that of the sinking of the Erika, from polluting hundreds of kilometres of coastline?"
"What control can the public even have over preventing a disaster, which, unfortunately, is not only ecological, such as that of the explosion at the AZF factory, from happening again?"
"In reality, since the public does not have the right and the means to control the activity of businesses such as TotalFinaElf, nor does it have the possibility of banning any economic policy that is detrimental to society and to its own workers, 'public participation' comes across as a hollow expression."
"We abstained from the vote."
"Although this proposal for a directive makes some welcome amendments to certain aspects of Community legislation, it represents a reductive and inadequate view of the implementation of the Aarhus Convention, which has already been ratified by all of the European Union' s Member States."
"Nevertheless, its contribution to the implementation of the Aarhus Convention in the Member States is very small, as is the implementation of the Convention in procedures and decisions at Community level."
"The proposals contained in the Korhola report do, by and large, improve the document, although they do not sufficiently resolve all the shortcomings of the proposal for a Directive, which is why we have also voted in favour of other proposals that extend the report' s proposal, thereby helping to ensure that an opportunity is not wasted in the complex process of implementing the Aarhus Convention."
"What has also become clear during this debate is that the importance of this Convention' s content and its ratification by all the Member States justify an extension of the debate, a broader and more inclusive discussion and a more appropriate and committed response from the Commission, and not the minimalist vision contained in the proposal it has submitted to the European Parliament."
". This proposal intends to ensure that opportunities are given for public participation at an early and decisive stage of environmental decision making."
"This includes public participation and the drawing up of certain plans and programmes, greater participation in the procedure concerning the implementation of environmental impact assessment statements as well as in the putting in place of integrated pollution prevention and control measures."
"Annex 1 of the Directive lists the instruments in relation to which the public for the first time are be given the opportunity to participate in the drawing up of plans and programmes."
"Such provisions are to be inserted in the directives on waste, the protection of waters against nitrate pollution as well as being included in the hazardous waste, copper packaging, air quality and landfill of waste directives."
"The main thrust of this directive is to ensure that information must be made available to the public within a reasonable timeframe."
"The public must be given the opportunity to express comments and opinions before decisions are made."
"It is important that the citizens of Europe are involved in decisions that are taken at a European Union level."
"The European Union and national governments support the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees that decision-making incorporates a local input at every opportunity."
"We are also all aware of the environmental proofing of EU regulations and directives which is now constantly taking place."
"I support progress."
"I support economic development."
"We must ensure that there is a balance between the protection of our environment and economic progress at all times."
"This directive which is before us is a balanced piece of legislation which I am sure will be supported by all Members of the House."
". I welcome this initiative and was very happy to support many of the amendments and the report itself in the final vote."
"I deeply regret Parliament's unwillingness to really open up access to such decisions to the widest possible number of people."
"The willingness of the largest groups to maintain the restrictions to the 'concerned public' , which will be defined by the Member States, is a surefire way to continue to leave certain people deeply dissatisfied and feeling sidelined."
"At least we managed to support the rapporteur's proposals to have some definition as to what the 'concerned public' might be."
"We have also managed to argue that the relevant authorities should make some response to show that the concerns of the concerned have been heard."
"However, a frequent complaint is that objections were raised but nothing happened."
"Parliament has given itself little room to manoeuvre in future negotiations with Council, so I hope we shall at least maintain the limited progress made today."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by Mrs Korhola."
"In an era where many citizens, from all sections of society, feel disenfranchised and marginalised, the call for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment is certainly needed."
"This proposal, the first of its kind, could see everyday citizens involved in and having say about issues ranging from air quality to the protection of water."
"The report makes concrete and practical recommendations as to how public participation in this domain can be realised; for example, information must be made available within a reasonable time-frame."
"In addition, citizens would be entitled to submit their comments either orally or in writing."
"The report addresses many of the tricky issues that have faced decision-makers since the demonstrations at Seattle, Stockholm and Genoa: it could lead to greater transparency and accountability since citizens could act as both a check on decision-makers' complete autonomy and they could be more informed of the decisions which are being taken in their name."
"Effective public participation in the drawing-up of plans and programmes for the environment is of the greatest importance and, therefore, all means of disseminating information to the public are essential, particularly the Internet."
"There are other areas directly linked to the environment, in which the public must also participate, such as the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the common agricultural policy. The Commission must, therefore, review its decision to consider general policy options to be non-binding and ensure that its proposals meet the requirements laid down in the Aarhus Convention on effective public participation."
"It has become necessary to broaden the definition of 'public' as much as possible."
"Inequality in access to adequate means of assessment for small and local voluntary groups compared with the resources of large corporations or public authorities is an important issue and must be taken into consideration."
"Report von Boetticher (A5-0339/2001):"
"Mr President, while I was in the aeroplane on the way to Slovakia, I closed my eyes for a second, as frequently happens, resulting in interesting dreams which I have related in many explanations of vote."
"This time, I saw my daughter, Cristina - who, as we all know, has been striving to finish her degree in law for six years - graduating at last."
"She had specialised in Community law and received a prize of EUR 1 000 for developing Community law, which is also what the von Boetticher report seeks to do. I therefore voted for the report."
"But Mr President, which was the dream: the fact that my daughter Cristina had graduated in law or the fact that we had, at last, succeeded in establishing the European lawyer, with a EUR 2 000 prize, which is what should happen in Europe?"
"The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of this report because we agree that the EU should develop cooperation in the area of civil law for the benefit of EU citizens."
"We are nonetheless alert to the fact that the regulation does not apply to Denmark, cf. the protocol on Denmark' s position with respect to the Treaty on European Union."
"Report von Boetticher (A5-0333/2001):"
"Mr President, I voted for the second von Boetticher report."
"How could I have voted against a report whose objective is to make it possible to move within the European Union more quickly and rapidly, providing for effective identity checks on the undesirables in our Union?"
"With regard to this report, during my visits to the Eastern European countries - Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary - lots of pensioners came up to me and said: ""Mr Fatuzzo, we are pleased that the European Union is doing its best to make it possible for us to move freely within the Union but, even today, we are always being asked to show our documents, we are subjected to checks every few minutes and we have to prepare a large number of documents in order to be able to move from one part of the Union to another."
"Please bear in mind that we are waiting anxiously for the day when we will genuinely be able to move freely."""
"We voted against this report because this report does nothing other than apply the Schengen accords, something we do not wish to approve, either directly or indirectly."
"Whilst claiming to facilitate the freedom of movement of individuals within the European Union, the Schengen accords actually put up barriers along the path to achieving this freedom of movement, at least for those who are from countries outside the European Union."
"We are in favour of total freedom of movement of individuals, whether or not they are from the European Union."
"In fact, the European treaties guarantee the freedom of movement of capital, regardless of its origin, to the extent that they allow profits from arms trafficking, drug trafficking, even terrorism, to be laundered on European territory as long as the sacrosanct banking secrecy and business secrecy are protected."
"Our vote expresses our opposition to a Europe built for capital, and not for individuals."
"Report Goebbels (A5-0302/2001):"
"Mr Goebbels' report stresses the importance of the international monetary system for those who use money to attempt to boost their economy."
"I voted for the report but I was unsure about one thing: I remembered that Neapolitan shoeshine, that penniless Neapolitan boy who, when he met a wealthy old industrialist in Ischia, was told: ""When I was your age, I used to clean shoes instead of sitting here sunbathing."
"Then I bought a taxi, then a public transport firm and then an airline, and then I became the owner of a satellite network."""
"""And what are you doing now?"" asked the boy."
"""Now I am sitting here, sunbathing in the sun of Italy and Ischia."
"""And I,"" replied the boy, ""what am I doing?!"""
"The Goebbels report on how to avoid international monetary crises is, on the whole, accurate, reliable and reasonable."
"We are simply surprised that the report does not mention the euro once and that it does not reiterate the (very serious) argument that has been put forward before, whereby the euro, which is soon to become a major international currency, would control the dollar by forcing the US monetary authorities to abandon their policy of 'benign neglect' ."
"It is true that the dissident analysts believed, on the other hand, that a dollar/euro bipolar (or tripolar, if you count the yen) international monetary system risked being more unstable than the previous unipolar (or bipolar) system."
"At any rate, this was an interesting debate, which should have fallen completely within the scope of the Goebbels report, having the added advantage of experience on its side, since the euro has been in circulation for almost three years, on the international currency markets at least."
"Yet, the rapporteur carefully avoids this question."
"Why is this so?"
"Simply because the theory of the euro having a stabilising effect, like that of the euro having a destabilising effect, was based on the same hypothesis, namely that the euro was to quickly become the second international currency, next to, if not equal to, the dollar."
"This is far from being the case."
"Not only is the euro not a major currency, but its value has depreciated, it is permanently on the verge of a crisis of confidence, and its international role is not progressing."
"And, on top of that, we are heading towards unavoidable problems between the Member States!"
"If the European Union had not obeyed those with dogmatic views, if we had gradually developed the ECU whilst respecting the national currencies, the process would have been safer and more straightforward."
"To sum up, the experience of the last three years confirms what we always believed: a wrong move in European monetary unification will actually make life much easier for the dollar."
"In spite of the recent attacks, the good health of the latter also seems to be further evidence of this."
"We understand why the rapporteur does not wish to dwell on the subject."
"Following Mr Goebbels' excellent report, a motion has been tabled in the European Parliament that is too narrowly framed from the outset."
"Moreover, the Commission' s representative expressed a position on its behalf, that is, firstly, false and, secondly, unacceptable, as it does not mention all the abuses now being committed other than terrorism, such as the international financing of the drugs trade and corruption."
"Finally, a majority in Parliament, either inattentive or complacent, rejected many constructive amendments, including the creation of an Economic and Social Security Council, the need for better representation of all continents in global financial institutions, and the need to restrict financial transactions with Member States and off-shore centres which do not abide by even minimal international regulations."
"Parliament has even refused to declare that 'financial speculation is one of the major causes of international financial instability' ."
"When democratic parliamentary institutions refuse to acknowledge the evidence, they cease to serve the common good."
"The reason that I abstained was in order to highlight this, as I did not wish to counter the few positive effects that can still be found in the resolution after the report has foundered."
"As the report points out, between 1975 and 2000, the world has gone through some 120 monetary crises, which the IMF defines as depreciation of a currency by more than 25% in the course of a year."
"Regrettably, however, even in the knowledge that every such crisis involves enormous costs for the countries involved, as happened in the Asian crisis in the summer of 1998, the report offers no basic measures that could prevent the emergence of new crises with any degree of effectiveness."
"Data from the Bank for International Settlements shows an enormous increase in international financial activity, which practically doubled in the 1990s, with trading on stock exchanges appearing increasingly disconnected from the real economy. This, combined with an increase in the speed of circulation in the financial sphere has heightened instability, thereby helping to increase the gap between richer countries and developing countries."
"Despite the report' s considerations and criticisms, specifically regarding the lack of democratic accountability of the IMF and its use by the USA and the G7, does not offer much by way of an alternative."
"On the contrary, it suggests from the outset that it is unrealistic to expect the creation, in the foreseeable future, of a United Nations organisation that would exercise full universal powers of regulation and supervision, when this is precisely the path that should be promoted and pursued in order to achieve fair and democratic international relations that provide solidarity and are concerned about development and the fight against poverty."
"Although it is to be welcomed that the rapporteur acknowledges that starting from scratch on growth and on combating poverty will require cancelling the debts of the poorest countries, it is disappointing that he does not put forward any other practical proposals, such as a Tobin-type tax or abolishing tax havens and that the majority in this House has rejected every move in that direction."
"The Goebbels report sets itself the ambitious goal of how to make the international monetary system work better."
"But for whose benefit?"
"We are entitled to ask this question, when the rapporteur believes that 'the IMF is the only institution concerned about the smooth operation of the world economy' ."
"The victims of its structural adjustment programmes will be delighted to hear this, and will not be particularly convinced by the request to the IMF to henceforth allow for 'social aspects' ."
"It is also significant that the report chooses to disregard any tax on speculative movements (Tobin style tax) and the need to abolish tax havens."
"However, I did not vote against the report, in order to support two specific requests, which we see as fundamental."
"We are in favour of eliminating third world debt and we therefore support cancelling the debt of the poorest countries and introducing a standstill procedure for the others."
"In this spirit, this procedure should not produce a restructuring plan, but should enable us to cancel an illegitimate debt."
"In spite of all these reservations, these proposals are heading in the right direction and I do not wish to stand in their way."
"That concludes the explanations of vote."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.12 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"2002 budget"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, guided by the 'guidelines for the 2002 budgetary process' , approved on 3 April, Parliament has attached particular importance to improving the efficiency of the European institutions, with particular emphasis, in this field, on the Commission reform that is currently underway and on the quality of the budget' s implementation."
"In this context, we must once again state our continuing political support for the reform of the Commission and mechanisms are being put in place to effectively monitor it, in an attempt to avoid both the delays that we have seen and those concerning staff regulations, in which we want to see the position opportunely adopted in the European Parliament resolution respected. These are the mechanisms of the long-awaited reform, which must be implemented by all the European institutions: an increase in the size of the external delegations, and also better coordination between the legislative and budgetary procedures, amongst others."
"These are well-known objectives and we shall continue to work to achieve them."
"At the same time, and with a view to improving the monitoring of the budget' s implementation, we expect the Commission to produce a definition of clear objectives for implementation and a timetable for this, and we will see how the timetable is being respected in the course of the year by means of sources of information that are now being made available."
"It is not possible to effectively assess the implementation of a budget if we do not have both clearly defined objectives and the means of finding out whether these objectives are being met."
"It is also widely known that the European Parliament attaches clear priority to producing a more detailed study of the budget' s implementation."
"We feel it is important to be able to forecast the budget for the following year."
"Indeed, the budget is, by definition, a forecast."
"Equally important, however, as establishing the forecast for the following year is being able to see how this forecast is being put into practice and, in cases where this is not being done, to know the reasons why."
"This will also contribute to making good delays in payments that have already been identified and to being able to pay out new commitments more rapidly."
"We want to eliminate outstanding payments as far as possible and also to ensure that new payments outstanding, or new RAL, to use the commonly accepted term in this field, do not occur."
"Increased operational spending will also be promoted, with corresponding reductions in administrative spending."
"This is also related, as you all know, to a set of horizontal amendments, in other words, amendments that cover the whole budget proposed by the Committee on Budgets, and which are designed to provide an real reduction in the RAL, greater speed in making payments and also increased operational spending rather than administrative spending."
"Along the same lines, we state once again our intention to only decide on the basis of the most complete information and, consequently, we hope to have the following information supplied by the Commission soon: on the one hand, and most importantly, the study examining the impact of the various measures that have already been adopted in the field of agriculture under the reforms laid down in Agenda 2000, as well as their budgetary consequences and also those of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises, in addition to the prospects for changes to the agricultural budget."
"The European Parliament cannot be a budgetary authority in name only."
"In order to reach a decision on a given budget line and, even more, on a given category of the budget, we need full and up-to-date information."
"It is clear that, at the moment, with regard to the last reform of the common agricultural policy and the impact of the foot-and-mouth and BSE crises, we need more information."
"This is why we have been asking for information since at least March of this year, so that we can make an informed decision, both on the 2002 budget and on the Letter of Amendment."
"As important as our concern to have information, we hope that new measures will be identified, which will provide a response to the situation arising from the terrorist attacks of 11 September, specifically concerning Europol and Eurojust in the fields of justice and home affairs. We would also like to see measures in the field of external action, on increasing humanitarian aid and a diversification of development cooperation, without, of course, undermining previously given commitments."
"I think that we all accept that the situation arising from 11 September has changed many aspects of world policy and therefore, since the budget acts as a mirror for this policy and reflects this policy, there are bound to be budgetary consequences for the new situation."
"The consequences of this new situation are being felt in 2001 and will be in 2002 and in the future."
"We see these consequences chiefly affecting refugees, and the tragic problem they create, but they also affect concerted action in terms of the European Union' s external policy."
"We do not want to be systematically faced with faits accomplis. We can now, therefore, certainly forecast changes in these situations and these new situations must be reflected in the budget."
"The budget must accommodate them although they must not endanger other commitments already given by the European Union."
"We have the greatest respect for the 1999 provisions on the financial perspective but we also have great respect for social and political dynamics and where political dynamics are concerned, we cannot fail to draw the necessary conclusions."
"We have also stated on various occasions that we will not accept new needs and new challenges being met to the detriment of longer-standing needs which are still as topical as they ever were."
"We also have great expectations of the report to be drafted by the Secretaries-General of the institutions on the multiannual study of administrative spending on preparations for enlargement."
"We even feel that, as a natural consequence of this work at a technical level, it could then be followed up at political level, with cooperation between the two branches of the budgetary authority."
"At this level, therefore, we will be able to draw political conclusions from information that we obtain technically, which is already being done."
"Continuing with a different type of issue, but which is also pending, in the case of the Commission' s proposal, we are waiting for the drafting, in the very near future, of the proposal to mobilise the flexibility instrument that will ensure the means necessary for the conversion of the fishing fleets that were dependent on the old Fisheries Agreement with Morocco."
"This flexibility instrument is a mechanism provided for in the Institutional Agreement. It has been used year after year and we are waiting to see the corresponding proposal for the year 2002."
"In terms of sectoral objectives, I should like to highlight a few to which we attach particular importance, such as that of improving the European Union' s competitiveness, to which the priority of more and better employment has been linked. It is not sufficient for declarations to be made at European Councils and summits."
"What we need is for these declarations then to be put into practice. More and better employment also means more and better support, more and better support mechanisms for small and medium-sized businesses, progress on the e-learning initiative, which we would very much like to see have a corresponding legal basis and also the consolidation of common policies in the field of asylum and immigration."
"It is also worth making special mention here of the intention to support the competitiveness of Member States' border regions in the context of the forthcoming enlargement, as well as extending the benefits of the Leader programme to cover the future Member States."
"All of these aspects are considered, in our guidelines, in the proposals for amendments that we have tabled on the budgetary proposals, and in the comments that we have included on the budgetary proposals."
"Of course, we shall also continue to fight to improve the level of payments."
"I know that this is something that the Member States often attempt to avoid, but the fact is that, if we want to see more effective European institutions, if, furthermore, we want their actions to have greater credibility, and if we want to see their results being more successful, we must have the necessary means to make payments."
"I would also remind you that under the terms of the Interinstitutional Agreement, in terms of the financial perspective, in 2002, the level of payments should stand at 1.08% of the gross domestic product of Member States and the Council' s proposals fall considerably short of this figure."
"I shall conclude by expressing my complete willingness, in the period between this first reading of the budget for 2002 and the vote on it in December, to work together with the Council and the Commission in a systematic process to reach the most appropriate allocation of available resources and to find the appropriate responses to the challenges we are currently facing."
"Hopefully, after the vote that will be held this coming Thursday, the European Parliament' s proposals will lie clearly on the table."
"We would also like to see that our priorities are considered in all the discussions that take place between now and December and that they take account of what I have just said, which is that the position of the European Parliament and that of the Council must both be respected, so that, ultimately, it will be possible to use the best from each proposal."
"What we cannot, of course, accept now is something that we have never accepted in the past: a dialogue of the deaf, in which some people state their wishes and other people accept what some people say they wanted."
"In this specific case, and to ensure that real negotiation takes place, there must be respect for the positions of all parties involved, attention must be paid to everyone' s priorities and that a close look is really given to everyone' s priorities."
"Only by adopting this approach will the discharge of the budgetary process be worthwhile. Only through this approach will we ultimately have any guarantee of success and only in this way can we have any hope that the budget will receive a favourable vote in December and be approved."
"We do have strongly-held positions but we are also willing to negotiate and what we want is an in-depth examination of the proposals of all sides so that the final outcome is a balanced one."
"Thank you, Mr Costa Neves."
"As Mr Costa Neves has finished his speech early, leaving us with a few seconds left over from the time he was allocated, I would like to take the opportunity to tell you something that will be of interest to you all: each second we spend debating here in Parliament costs us EUR 9.73."
"I am telling you this so that you will understand that the reason I am so inflexible when it comes to the allocation of speaking time is this cost."
"Mrs Buitenweg has the floor."
"Mr President, you have once again pushed the boat out with this long conclusion, but perhaps I can once again try to finish my speech in less than ten minutes, and then the balance will be redressed after all."
"This week, we are hoping to take a big step towards establishing the 2002 budget."
"I, as rapporteur, have worked towards this for the past couple of months, and I have received a great deal of support from the MEPs of the other groups, Mrs Gill, Mr Ferber, Mr Virrankoski and the other MEPs, as well as from the rapporteur for the general budget, Mr Costa Neves. I expressly want to thank them all here for their pleasant and also very fruitful cooperation."
"The trilogues involving the Council have also proved useful, and let me therefore count our blessings for once."
"From this year onwards, the Council budget contains a special chapter dealing with the common foreign and security policy."
"Since the Council now covers operational costs in its budget - which, unfortunately, do not fall within the remit of the Commission - such as for military planning capacity, it is necessary for democratic control to be possible."
"It is also important to gain a clear insight into the administrative structures which are being set up, so as to avoid overlapping with Parliament offices."
"That is not possible in a general Council budget if it is not clear how much is being spent on what and if Parliament does not give its opinion on those administrative expenses in general."
"We are therefore pleased with a separate chapter since, in this way, Parliament can try to gain some control."
"Now that we have chosen this path, I hope that the Council will approve a number of rational and very logical requests by this Parliament at second reading too."
"For example, there is the issue of long and wild nights at the European Councils."
"In the midst of all this wheeling and dealing, do Heads of Government still consider the financial implications?"
"I wonder about that."
"During the meetings of the European Councils, the Dutch government is always equipped with a special calculator which closely monitors the implications for the Dutch contribution."
"But who is accountable for the impact on the European budget?"
"A pertinent example of this is the Nice Summit."
"In order to facilitate an agreement on vote weighting in the Council, compensating seats in the European Parliament were distributed lavishly."
"Who will pay for this?"
"The Treaty of Amsterdam stipulated a maximum of 700 seats; we are now sentenced to 732 seats and the buildings are not designed to cope with this number."
"In the short term, the number of MEPs could run well into the 800s, and I had better not hear a squeak from the Council when it is presented with the bill for this."
"An example of a totally different nature is the Balkans."
"Whilst, in front of running cameras, billions were given for reconstruction with one hand, the Council took away development aid with the other."
"In order to avoid any repeats, it would be wise to add a financial picture to the political conclusions at important summits."
"How much is it all going to cost us and does it involve new money?"
"It would be a sign of honesty if this were presented along with political conclusions."
"For example, the situation in heading 5 has changed dramatically since the Berlin Agreement because, in those days, no consideration was given to, for example, developments in the second pillar, the common foreign and security policy, the third pillar, Eurojust, Europol, or expenses for the European data protection supervisor."
"I welcome these developments, but I would equally welcome an explanation as to where the funding is coming from and at what expense that funding will be granted."
"A second subject on which I should like to ask the Council to adopt a positive stance, quite apart from the annual budget discussion, is our request to consider how we want to give the taxpayer more value for money."
"During that trilogue too, Parliament talked in that context about setting up a political working party, which will enable us jointly to examine how we can give more value for money for, each year, we discuss the nuts and bolts and minor changes to the budget, but the institutions, once they are up and running, are not subject to thorough reviews as far as their objectives and working methods are concerned."
"Despite this, we should have the courage to move away from the way things have developed and question, once again, whether all the institutions, for example, all the agencies, should continue to exist in that way."
"We are making a start this year at micro level by asking all the institutions to draw up a list of negative priorities."
"After all, we should not only add items to the European budget, we should also learn to scrap some of them."
"Interinstitutional cooperation is another area where huge savings could be made."
"In this respect, I should like to make a concrete proposal."
"Since the Treaty of Nice, it has been mooted that the Council would need a new meeting place for its half-yearly summits."
"But the impact on the taxpayer and on the quality of life in the Leopold Quarter if yet another huge building were to be erected would be enormous."
"Let us therefore examine together whether some of the Council meetings could take place here in the parliamentary House, in Brussels or in Strasbourg."
"Look around you, as you already are doing. It is a beautiful building, and you will understand that we would not mind if cooperation were to develop in such a way that Parliament were to meet in Brussels only, and we would be delighted to make this environment available to you."
"Until such time, and until the seat issue has been solved in another way, we really are stuck with two buildings that need to be altered to cope with a larger number of MEPs."
"The Bureau has drawn up a three-year plan which serves as an indicative framework for expenses related to enlargement."
"The other institutions, too, are working hard to ensure that the effects of enlargement are ironed out, and we cannot wait for these adjustments until 2004."
"It is not an option for us to be in the middle of activities, still, when the first new Members join."
"This means, therefore, that more funding is required prior to the accession of the candidate countries."
"The Committee on Budgets has noted that, by means of rigid budget management, it is possible, in the coming year, to remain within the self-imposed maximum of 20% in the category of administrative expenditure, although we have always said that enlargement and buildings do not fall within this maximum."
"As for the subsequent years, however, I am not convinced that this will work again."
"Even if the other institutions implement their plans in preparation for enlargement, and even if Parliament faces higher costs because, by that stage, preparations will have got well and truly under way, in my opinion it will then be difficult to remain within the established ceiling."
"However, the intention to enlarge by spending tax money in an efficient, effective and desirable manner does merit such praise. Let it therefore be the guiding principle in the budgetary procedures which follow."
"You will have gathered by now that I am greatly irritated by the Council' s stance, and despite this, I shall try to mention a few other elements from my report."
"I shall, first of all, focus on what it does not say."
"The report does not contain any judgment by Parliament of the basis on which expenses must be paid as soon as a new statute for Members has been approved, and that is something which I very much regret."
"Precisely because Parliament wishes to retain the power to decide on its own arrangements and does not therefore want expenses to form part of a package involving the Council, it is important for us to indicate at this stage what we want."
"I should particularly like to ask the PSE and PPE-DE Groups to endorse the position which was initially included in my report, namely that, once the statute enters into force, only expenses actually incurred will be reimbursed."
"I would like to mention something which is in the report."
"I am delighted that the institutions reacted in a quietly positive manner to the request by the Committee on Budgets to take part in EMAS, the EU' s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme."
"I should like to warmly congratulate the European Commission on the fact that it has already committed itself to this, and I hope that it will set an example for others, including the European Parliament itself."
"There is still room for improvement on many levels, including in our House, for example with regard to differentiated waste processing and the use of environmentally-friendly materials, saving electricity and setting up a mobility plan for staff and Members alike."
"Parliament has a model role to fulfil, and this also applies to realising sound environmental objectives. I would be grateful if we were to make a start on that next year."
"Mr President, the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community was signed in 1952, and was to run for fifty years."
"It comes to an end next summer and there is no intention to extend it."
"We are therefore to debate the last ECSC budget, now, with expenditure to cover the period up until 23 July of next year."
"Thereafter its assets, estimated to be worth EUR 1.1 billion, are to be transferred to the EU' s general budget, to be invested safely and profitably."
"Earnings from the assets are to be used for funding research in the coal and steel industries."
"It has been estimated that around EUR 45 million in earnings per annum will be available for these purposes."
"The ECSC has not attracted payments for many years."
"Its expenditure has mainly been financed out of a reserve intended for funding under the operating budget."
"The largest item of expenditure in the last six months of the ECSC' s existence will, according to a proposal by the Commission, be in respect of social aid."
"Of that, most is intended to be spent on special adjustment aid in countries where production in the coal and steel industries has been wound down."
"In many countries the industry has social problems associated with it, and, consequently, the Committee on Budgets has decided to propose that EUR 16 million more than the Commission originally recommended should be paid in adjustment aid to Great Britain, Ireland and Belgium with regard to the special problems associated with their steel industries."
"When the ECSC ceases to exist, social aid for employees in the coal and steel industries will end."
"The Commission has not promised to distribute special aid out of the EU' s general budget for social purposes in these industries."
"When the ECSC ceases to exist, the social dimension it represents will not continue in another form."
"The ECSC' s resources have been used to finance important research."
"Although earnings from the ECSC research fund will be channelled exclusively into research after it ceases to exist, there will be less money available than there is now."
"For example, early next year EUR 72 million will still be channelled into research."
"That is a considerable sum compared with the EUR 45 million that represents the earnings from the ECSC' s net assets that will be used for research."
"Consequently, we could say that the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community is coming to an end makes for a negative situation from the point of view of social action and research."
"The Commission is charging quite a sum in compensation for earnings from ECSC funds under the guise of managing the investment of the ECSC assets and allocating money for research: EUR 3.5 million a year."
"That will pay the salaries of more than 30 officials employed to manage the ECSC' s remaining functions."
"The activities involved are so limited in scope that the officials seem to form just one group, which will not suffer from the ECSC' s cessation of operations the way the workers and researchers in the coal and steel industries will."
"The Treaty' s cessation will have surprisingly little effect on the lives of the officials who have been attending to the ECSC' s banking business and are managing its effects."
"This brings to light the inefficiency of the new organisation of the Commission' s functions."
"There is a problem I wish to draw attention to, although it is not strictly relevant to this report."
"The legal basis for the Coal and Steel Community Research Fund was established by the Treaty of Nice."
"If the Treaty of Nice is not in force next July, there will be no legal basis for any subsequent management of the estate."
"The Commission must adopt a position on this swiftly."
"Finally, there is good reason to say a few positive words in memory of everything the ECSC has achieved, not least the fact that the European Coal and Steel Community has probably been one of the institutions that had an impact on building peace and international co-operation in Europe after the Second World War."
"While it was in operation its Member States did not wage war on each other."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in a few days' time, you will be voting at first reading on the amendments to the draft budget as it was drafted by the Council in July."
"I already had the honour of making an explanatory statement concerning this draft budget at the part-session in September."
"I will therefore not enter into any detail today."
"Instead, I should briefly like to outline the aspects which will undoubtedly be on the agenda in the framework of our dialogue."
"I hope that this dialogue will be fruitful, so that we can reach an agreement which is satisfactory to everyone, but particularly to the European citizens, of course."
"I should like to reiterate quite emphatically that the presidency would like to reach an agreement on the 2002 budget as early as November at second reading of the Council."
"A few days after your first reading, the overall structure will be in place and the different positions will be known."
"In November, we should consequently be able to put the finishing touches to the activities which will culminate in a sound budget for 2002."
"In this connection, it seems useful to me to remind ourselves briefly of the guidelines which the Council used when it compiled the draft budget, in respect of which you will be proposing amendments in the next couple of days."
"This draft budget is able to fund all policy components and priorities of the European Union, without imposing too great a burden on the Member States that work towards achieving stricter control of government finances."
"At the same time, however, notably under the ceilings of heading 3 of the financial perspectives and of heading 4, it creates some leeway for coping with new priorities."
"For that purpose, the Council has made sure that the different actions of the European Union are funded appropriately within the available financial means under the ceilings of the financial perspectives, in connection with which no changes have been made to the funds allocated to programmes on which a decision was made in the codecision procedure, whilst the extent of the commitment appropriations has been determined on the basis of implementation options."
"In addition, the Council has paid particular attention to the development of payment appropriations by curbing and controlling their growth compared to 2001. In this context, particular consideration was given to the implementation options and the expected rate of payments in connection with commitments outstanding and national budgetary requirements."
"After these general considerations, I should like to broach a few subjects which will be on the agenda in the next couple of weeks and these concern, of course, agricultural expenditure."
"As you know, the Council did not adopt the Commission' s proposal at first reading and has asked the Commission for a detailed analysis of the requirements."
"During the conciliation meeting of 20 July, Parliament sided with the Council, and I have every faith that, once we have discussed the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, we will reach an agreement through which we will be able to cushion the effects of the different crises."
"I think that I can already say that, at the moment, it is becoming increasingly clear that, in this connection, a solution is certainly in the offing."
"As far as the other agricultural expenses are concerned, when the Council' s draft budget provided for an increase in the appropriations, although they were still slightly below those which the Commission had initially put forward in its preliminary draft, consideration was given to the effects which the decisions by the European Council of Berlin would have on the reorganisation of the common agricultural policy."
"When we analyse the final appropriations to be included in the 2002 budget, we must obviously take account of the most recent data in the letter of amendment concerning agricultural expenditure."
"I should now like to turn to a second point which, according to the Interinstitutional Agreement, is also pertinent, in the framework of the letter of amendment which the Commission will be sending us shortly, namely the financial implications of the delay in the fisheries agreement with Morocco, together with the funding and restructuring of the fishing fleet in question."
"In July, the Council followed the Commission' s preliminary draft of the budget as far as the international fisheries agreement was concerned, and the Council asked the Commission only to use these appropriations for other fisheries agreements."
"It is unfortunate that this position by the Council in July did not lead to an agreement."
"With regard to the structural measures, heading 2 of the financial perspectives, the Council insisted on including this entire heading in the budget in the form of commitment appropriations in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of Berlin of March 1999."
"In this connection, I should like to point out that the Council, at the time of compiling its draft budget, did not have a full overview of the situation, and that it stated that it would review the situation in the light of the letter of amendment in the autumn, which is prescribed according to the Interinstitutional Agreement."
"The Council will do this as soon as it has received the letter."
"I would remind you that the appropriations for international fisheries agreements, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, fall within compulsory expenditure, whether they are indicated in the budget line or in the reserve."
"As for the letter of amendment, to which some of our discussions in the coming weeks will relate, I should like to note that the Council expects a balance estimate for the 2001 budget year to be included."
"This request is an illustration of the principle of good management, which means that the budget burden for the individual European taxpayers will, where possible, not become any heavier."
"I know how much importance the European Parliament attaches to the expenditure under heading 3 of the financial perspectives."
"That is why the Council has ensured that its draft budget sufficiently covers the priorities of the EU' s internal policy, notably the honouring of commitments concerning the funding of multi-annual programmes, in respect of which both our institutions have taken a decision."
"I would also point out that, at first reading, the Council increased appropriations in its draft budget in order to launch Eurojust and the SISII system for Schengen."
"The Commission had proposed the budget lines for this in its preliminary draft."
"In the current climate, these objectives are more topical than when we compiled the draft budget back in July."
"In this way, the Council has created a margin of EUR 110 billion which is wider than the margin in the Commission' s preliminary draft budget."
"This margin should be sufficient to cover priorities, some of which, including e-learning and immigration, will undoubtedly be mentioned by your rapporteur or, in any event, will be suggested at our forthcoming dialogue."
"I would now like to turn my attention to the funding of the EU' s external measures, as included in heading 4 of the financial perspectives."
"The Council has largely followed the Commission' s preliminary draft budget."
"The Council has also made an effort to allocate resources to the different priorities in the field of external measures."
"For example, the Council has created a margin of EUR 100 million under the ceiling of heading 4 of the financial perspectives, which should enable us to shore up the priorities in this sector."
"With regard to this heading 4 of the financial perspectives, I should nevertheless like to point out one particular aspect pertaining to the appropriations for the common foreign and security policy."
"I very much regret the fact that, during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council, an agreement was still not reached with regard to the level of appropriations to be included."
"That is why the Council has adopted the amounts in its draft budget which the Commission proposed in its preliminary draft."
"I have to confess that I do not fully grasp why requests for a reduction in these amounts were made."
"You will agree with me that these amounts, which are already lower than in 2001, are very modest as they are and are really the bare minimum to ensure that Europe can play a prominent role on the world stage."
"The wish to reduce these amounts at such a crucial time as in the current international crisis could particularly harm the EU' s credibility."
"I do not believe that that is what is intended."
"I should now like to move on to the administrative expenditure of the institutions."
"When the Council compiled the draft budget, it was motivated by the wish to meet the needs of the institutions as much as possible, taking into account their specific characteristics."
"In the draft budget, there is a surplus left over to the tune of EUR 53 million under the ceiling of heading 5 of the financial perspectives, which allows new needs in the field of administrative expenditure, notably for the budget of the European data protection supervisor, to be accommodated."
"In this connection, the Council recently sent you its letter of amendment No 1 for 2002."
"Despite this, I am of the opinion that each of the institutions represented here are acutely aware of the pressure which the ceilings of heading 5 are under."
"A first step in this connection was the agreement that was reached during the conciliation meeting of 20 July involving the European Parliament and the Council concerning a request to the Secretaries-General of the institutions to compile a report for the benefit of the budgetary authority by the time the Budgetary Council is held in November. This report should comprise a multi-annual analysis of heading 5, as well as proposals concerning necessary economy measures to prevent the maximum allocated to this heading being exceeded, also in the framework of enlargement."
"In the light of this report, the follow-up action that needs to be taken should subsequently be determined."
"I should already like to underline that a number of suggestions made a moment ago in connection with the report are certainly worth looking at further."
"I should also like to mention another aspect concerning administrative expenditure, notably the Commission' s staffing requests."
"The Council continues to support the reforms on which the Commission is working, and agreed at first reading to the creation of 78 new offices requested by the external delegations in the framework of decentralisation."
"With regard to the other 239 offices, the Council failed to adopt a position on 20 July because, on the one hand, it requires more clarity concerning the decision on the regulation for the definitive termination of service by Commission officials and, on the other hand, it nurses the hope that your discussions on this matter will yield a solution which can accommodate our respective wishes."
"I should like to finish this list of the different points which will be occupying our minds for the next couple of weeks by returning to a question with which you are all too familiar, namely the extent of payment appropriations."
"First of all, I am delighted that the European Parliament and the Commission share the Council' s concern as to the commitments outstanding (in our Community jargon also known as the 'RAL' )."
"The progress report of 30 June 2001, requested by the Commission in the framework of the previous budgetary procedure, is certainly useful in this connection."
"However, I should like to point out that the vast increase in payment appropriations is not a cure-all for RAL absorption."
"This is evident from the extent of the balances over the past budget years which were repaid to the Member States."
"On the one hand, there will still be commitments outstanding as a logical extension of the split appropriations, while, on the other hand, the improved follow-up of the commitment appropriations, notably by an opt-out policy, is also an effective means of absorbing potentially abnormal RALs."
"As to the extent of payment appropriations in the draft budget, the Council has expressed a preference for limited and controlled growth."
"Indeed, the Council is striving to include payment appropriations which correspond to the actual implementation options."
"In this way, we prevent the individual European taxpayers from being faced with too heavy a burden."
"I have given you a brief outline of the points which will undoubtedly be the topic of discussion over the next couple of weeks."
"The seriousness with which the Commission and the two arms of the budgetary authority are treating the start of this new budgetary procedure is obvious to me, and a source of real pleasure to me."
"It is my wish for the budgetary discussions, after you have cast your votes in a couple of days, to be continued in the same spirit and, if possible, for agreement to be reached as early as November about a budget of the European Communities for the 2002 budget year which will provide us with the resources to meet the priorities and challenges which the European Union will be facing shortly."
"Mr President, honourable Members, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, planning the Budget for next year demands flexibility and provision for the unforeseen."
"Flexibility and provision for a rapid and appropriate response to new financial demands on the European Union and on a common European policy."
"The current year has indeed shown what demands can be made on a budget, demands that cannot be planned for or envisaged in advance."
"We had the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease, we now have the new Global Health Fund project that has come into being this year, greater demands are being made on our humanitarian aid, not only in Afghanistan, but also because of the escalating situation in the Middle East;"
"Palestine's dependency on external aid, including from Europe, has continually increased."
"The EU's budget quite clearly needs the capacity to respond to crises and to surmount them, and we have - I believe - managed in the past two years to draft the Budget so as to cope with this demand."
"I am optimistic that we will manage it for next year too."
"At this point, I would like, on behalf of the Commission, to thank the rapporteurs for the 2002 Budget, first of all you, Mr Costa Neves, but also Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Seppänen and of course the entire Committee on Budgets for the work you have put in."
"Anyone who has seen the mountains of amendments that the Committee on Budgets again had to get to grips with this year, will know what is meant by hard committee work."
"There is, though, a great deal of work ahead of us, and we have a long way to go."
"Flexibility and willingness to compromise are required of us all."
"Of course, I know that the Belgian Presidency of the Council is endeavouring to pass a good EU Budget, which will fulfil all requirements."
"I thank you, Mr Vande Lanotte, for re-emphasising in your speech this aspect - the willingness to negotiate - for I believe that this demand must also be addressed to the Council, that flexibility is necessary in negotiations and that what is said in the various sittings must not be merely a repetition of what was decided by governments in the capitals."
"It is just at the point where the Committee on Budgets does not want to respond to increased responsibility and to greater demands with an expanding budget, that our proceedings need flexibility."
"I intend now to discuss individual aspects of the European Budget, beginning with agriculture."
"The Commission's preliminary draft for the budget, which we presented at the end of May, planned for a EUR 1 billion reserve to facilitate a response to the demands of the BSE crisis and foot-and-mouth disease."
"We have now moved on a bit, and the Commission will next week be adopting the letter of amendment."
"Developments in the livestock sector have turned out, thank God, to be less dramatic than had at first been feared."
"We have indeed managed to put aside EUR 400 million from the Budget in this year already for the costs of foot-and-mouth disease."
"The consequence of this will be that we have to plan for less of an increase for foot-and-mouth in the Amending Budget for next year than had at first been feared."
"This means that current developments make it possible for us to release the reserve we had proposed in May."
"There are, however, developments in some areas of the agricultural sector that still give cause for concern from the budgetary point of view."
"The key word here is 'wine' ."
"Here, there is a production surplus whose constant increase is reflected in the financial results."
"Expenditure in this field has, in the meantime, doubled in two years, with the natural consequence that we have to observe carefully what steps can be taken to stem this overproduction and slow down the growth in the agricultural budget."
"The letter of amendment that we will be laying before you concludes by saying that we can release the reserve and that we require less expenditure on agriculture than our calculations had originally provided for, so that a fairly substantial margin remains."
"At this point, I must however state quite clearly that agriculture ministers must not take this margin to mean that there is plenty of scope for every kind of shiny new expenditure package; this year has shown how quickly such a margin can be required for things which could not have been planned for."
"So, in my judgment, caution demands that we keep this margin in this area."
"I might mention in passing that I welcome the fact that the Committee on Budget's various amendments and resolutions show its desire to look into the agricultural sector more deeply, including with regard to the Midterm Review, which is due next year."
"We do have an agricultural aid programme for the acceding countries, which I would now like to mention briefly, namely the SAPARD pre-accession instrument."
"I share your absolute dissatisfaction with this programme not yet having, so to speak 'arrived' , in the sense of aid payments being able to be made from it for agriculture, and with our still being at this preliminary stage in which the appropriate administrative structures are being set up."
"Of course it is important to have absolute control, and certainty that nothing will go wrong, but if this leads to the other extreme of the programme not working at all, then that is not what its inventor had in mind either."
"You have now, in this Parliament, come to the logical conclusion and said that a new stage in the programme is to be set up, in particular to finance information for the agricultural sector about the EU's future agricultural policy."
"I must now, despite this, ask you to please reconsider this proposal, which would mean that we would have to create a new legal basis for this programme."
"All of SAPARD's components would have to be reprogrammed, with even greater delays as a consequence."
"That cannot be what you meant."
"Hence my plea to you to negotiate it again with great precision, in order to find room in SAPARD for your demand for more information along the lines of the LEADER programme to be made available for rural areas."
"On this point I must also address a few words to the Council: In your first reading of the preliminary draft of the Budget, you made substantial cuts in the means of payment for the pre-accession aid packages."
"It is of course contradictory to say on the one hand that we want better implementation and a reduced backlog of payments, and on the other to cut funds so drastically."
"So I must ask you to keep an open mind on the Commission's reasoning."
"Of course we have to produce evidence that next year we will need the items we have proposed, but that we shall surely do."
"Coming to the topic of enlargement, I, of course, have to mention the 'frontier regions' , as Mr Costa Neves, the rapporteur, has already done."
"Of course we all know that the frontier regions, the regions that are at present situated on the borders of the European Union, will profit in the long term from the enlargement of the EU, because they will at last be frontier regions no longer."
"Despite this, we also know, on the other hand, that there are problems with adjustment."
"In order to absorb the impact of these, or, to put it the other way around, to work towards making use of the opportunities that will be available, the Commission has proposed this programme for the frontier regions."
"The Budget provides for an additional EUR 150 million to be made available for transport infrastructure measures in the frontier regions and for a further EUR 15 million for cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises, an additional EUR 20 million from the INTERREG programme and EUR 10 million more from the youth programme, in order to promote this programme for school students' exchanges and so on in the perspective of enlargement."
"Last year, Parliament had adopted, for the 2001 Budget, the new pilot project ""Cooperation with small and medium-sized enterprises in the frontier regions with a view to enlargement""."
"I have to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that this was an excellent idea of Parliament's, as a great deal can now be done with this programme."
"I welcome Parliament's statement that this project should continue to be supported, and I, of course, follow with interest, Parliament's endeavours to activate supplementary funds for this area as a whole."
"Mounting demands on European policy, of course, also mean that greater demands are made on personnel and also on the Commission's staff."
"For years, the Commission has faced ever-increasing tasks which have had to be dealt with without additional human resources."
"Last year, this brought us to the conclusion that we would have to take stock by analysing our workload."
"As a result of this, we presented a claim for 717 new posts."
"The budgetary authority approved 400 additional posts for the Commission last year."
"Let me take this as an opportunity to thank you again for this on behalf of the Commission."
"We also ask for approval of the second tranche of 317 posts, however."
"I would again point out that some departments are really not lavishly provided for."
"To take only one example, that of Mr Vitorino's Justice and Home Affairs Directorate-General."
"It has 189 established posts."
"The temporary posts bring the total to 215."
"The Scoreboard for more intensive cooperation in judicial matters decided on in Tampere, is really not a bad thing."
"Indeed, it is, of course, justified."
"The post-11 September situation has now shown that it is in the field of more intensive judicial cooperation that joint action is required."
"Not enough has yet been done about this at European level."
"We must, therefore, make the effort to move forward in this area, which means, of course, a need for staff to work in this field."
"I wish to thank you for your support for the Commission's reforms as a whole, which you have reiterated here today."
"You have now tabled various amendments which you will probably adopt on Thursday, and the Commission, in consequence, will be asked for further reports, for example on the delayed presentation of the Budget."
"We will of course do all in our power to satisfy this demand for reports."
"I must also point out that the Commission has responsibilities as an executive, and so it is also necessary to find a balance."
"I would, though, like to thank Mr Costa Neves for reiterating your offer of negotiations."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the ability to use budgetary policy to react to crises and intercept the unexpected is of course particularly necessary in the field of foreign policy."
"This was true when we had to work together to find the wherewithal for the reconstruction of Kosovo and incorporate it into the 2000 Budget."
"Together, we managed it."
"It was the case last year, when additional funds for Serbia had to be added to the 2001 Budget."
"As I have already mentioned, we are now in a situation in which a contribution is to be made from the European Budget to the Global Health Fund."
"We are talking in terms of EUR 60 million for this."
"We will be presenting to Parliament the relevant proposal for a transfer, in order to use the fisheries reserve, which is still in this Budget, for this purpose among others."
"When we sat together in our three-way talks last week, you supported making EUR 25 million from the emergency humanitarian aid reserve available for Afghanistan, EUR 7.5 million for Palestine and EUR 7.5 million for the Caucasus region."
"That shows what current demands are."
"I would like to return to one point in particular, which you, Mr President-in-office of the Council, mentioned: I refer to the funds for the common foreign and security policy."
"Public opinion sometimes misunderstands this and takes it to mean that this is the only budget line where foreign policy is concerned."
"On the contrary, of course other measures are of a foreign policy nature, that is quite clear."
"We have, though, this specific line for the common foreign and security policy."
"The Commission has proposed EUR 35 million for it."
"Parliament proposed its reduction by EUR 14 million."
"Now we have to give more careful consideration to precisely why."
"Parliament does not, indeed, believe this to be an unimportant area; it is far more a question of how decisions are reached, of whether it is actually right that the Council should have sole discretion as to how the funds are applied."
"We note - I note in my capacity as Commissioner for the Budget - that this principle, according to which the Council decides on the use to which funds are put and the Commission then writes the cheques out, does not work well, as there has to date been under-utilisation in this area, even though everybody knows what demands are made."
"I believe we have to talk about the fundamentals of how future finance for the common foreign and security policy is to be secured, quite independently of the 2002 Budget."
"In my judgment, it is not tolerable that the Council attempts to appropriate ever more operational duties in this area; we need, on the contrary, a common foreign and security policy that will also provide the necessary financial security."
"There are a whole lot of related issues to be sorted out."
"We must also consider the people's expectations in this area when we really thoroughly discuss, investigate and then define, what we want to do in future."
"This demands a common response and, I believe, in many respects a stronger Community response."
"To return to the Budget for 2002: the Commission had until now envisaged a EUR 125 million reserve for the fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"That fisheries agreement has now finally collapsed."
"In the letter of amendment that the Commission will be discussing next week and then presenting to you in due time, this reserve is released."
"The funds will be used in part for other fisheries agreements, which have been extended."
"A large amount will become available."
"I would say it would be a mistake to budget all these additional funds which have become available from the reserve, at this early stage."
"I know we are going to need this money."
"It is not a matter of saving this money but - and I urge this - not already allocating it all."
"Why do I urge this?"
"Let me now make only one point: battle is at present being waged in Afghanistan against international terrorism, and the European Union is keeping humanitarian aid in readiness for the civilian population, and the amounts involved are not small."
"The European Union will be providing a total of over EUR 310 million."
"Let me also, however, point out that the USA was a great donor of funds for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan even before 11 September."
"Now, though, we should already be thinking of what the period after this conflict will mean for the region and for the country of Afghanistan, and it is quite clear to me that this means the post-Taliban era in Afghanistan."
"I think we can all agree that the European Union will then also have an obligation and a responsibility to build up a democratic society, a society that has regard for human rights and makes it possible to live with human dignity."
"In this Budget, we should make provision in such a way as to enable us to meet this obligation financially as in other ways."
"Looking back over two years as Budget Commissioner and on two years of Budget discussions with Parliament and the Council, I can truly say that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have together managed to meet well the demands made on the European Budget, and I am very optimistic that we will achieve this again for 2002."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, for his efforts to reconcile the different interests in this House."
"Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would like to remind you that we are at the first reading stage, which, although this seems obvious at first sight, makes it clear that many of the balances and agreements we must achieve will be of a general nature and will have repercussions upon the final appropriations under this heading."
"In this context, I would like to give a vote of confidence to the general rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets, as long as he, of course, takes on board to the greatest extent possible the priorities set out by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which are balanced, given that they seek an equitable distribution between different geographical areas, and aim to respond to the European Union' s various commitments on the international stage."
"The Commissioner referred to the finely balanced measures we have had to take in the last few years: Commissioner, we cannot continue in such an unmethodical fashion, we cannot continue to finance new priorities with the same resources."
"I understand that this is not an exercise in revising financial perspectives, but we cannot continually take on new priorities to the detriment of the commitments that the European Union has already made."
"We will have to look for formulae that are more imaginative and more creative in this area."
"Mr President, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has given its opinion: we want to strengthen the Commission' s administrative reform policy, particularly with regard to the decentralised management of external aid."
"With regard to the proposals made by Commissioner Patten, the Committee on Foreign Affairs has expressed its strong support on this matter."
"In conclusion, the Committee on Foreign Affairs gives its support and vote of confidence to the general rapporteur from the Committee on Budgets, Mr Costa Neves, we affectionately urge him to pay very close attention to the objectives that the Committee on Foreign Affairs has set out in its opinion for this 2002 budget."
". On behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I would also like to offer my congratulations to Mr Costa Neves for guiding us so far and for the very good job that he has done."
"I have been asked by my committee to raise a number of points, the main one being the amendment that we are retabling on the Court of Auditors."
"As the House will know, the Court of Auditors asked for a number of new staff."
"The Council recommended that only five new staff be granted and various positions have been taken on the additional staff requested and the money for them."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control decided quite wisely, in my view, that we should take an apolitical stance on this."
"We should ask the Court of Auditors to assess the performance of financial control systems in the applicant countries; improve the Court of Auditors' cooperation with the national audit institutions - which is a requirement of the Treaty of Nice - and establish more detailed specific DAS assessments - again, a requirement of the Treaty of Nice."
"We would therefore be fairly apolitical and once those issues had been clarified, we would ask for the money to be released for the other posts."
"However, in the Committee on Budgets a completely different amendment was tabled."
"It is much more political, and we are very worried about the independence of the Court of Auditors in relation to the requirements set down by the Committee on Budgets, so I do hope that will be considered."
"I have also been asked to say a word about implementation."
"We have looked at the implementation figures and we will continue to look at them in the future and use them for future amendments to the budget."
"You have our full backing on everything you have done in getting better information on implementation for us so far."
"We have also looked at tabling amendments."
"We have an amendment coming through asking for money to be tied up and asking the Commission to tell us whether an evaluation unit has been set up in DG V."
"Finally, we are very concerned about the future of the A-30 lines, or rather how they are going to be spent."
"Those are the points that the Committee on Budgetary Control would like to raise."
"Mr President, on behalf of my Committee, I would like to emphasise one point, namely the PRINCE programme."
"We see it as very important that the information campaign on the euro should be carried on for another half-year, for we find an information deficit here despite great campaigning efforts."
"It is particularly marked among small and medium-sized enterprises, and this programme is intended to make good this deficit."
"As permanent rapporteur for the agencies, I can say at the present time that the most acute problems have been resolved with the help not only of our colleagues in the Committee on Budgets, but also that of the general rapporteur."
"We decided, on the basis of the facts, to consider the agencies individually."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to say a few things for future reference."
"The agencies carry on growing, as they have done for years."
"Everyone who works in one seems to have a vested interest in the agencies' expansion."
"To give an example, between 1995 and 2001, the personnel complement of the agencies increased by 366%."
"We are creating another 99 posts this year alone."
"I get the impression that many of the European agencies maintain to some degree a separate existence."
"In the Budget procedure, we always have to deal with one demand - they say they need more money."
"The consequences of this development are clear to see."
"The agencies take up all the scope for other programmes, and at some point the Community ends up having to pay the pension costs as well."
"We must make changes here."
"No longer must the Budget be adapted to the programmes decided on by the Management Board, but the programmes must fit the resources provided by the Budget."
"We need a working audit of the agencies, involving all the actors concerned on a permanent basis. In other words, Parliament's specialised committees must likewise carry out an evaluation."
"We urgently need to examine the question of whether the services provided by the agencies are actually needed and then put to good use."
"The Budgetary Control Committee, the Court of Auditors and all the other actors must be involved in helping us get a grip on the whole thing."
"Over the coming weeks, I will be attempting to create a structure for this purpose, one which can be put to use in the next Budget procedure."
"Mr President, I am going to combine my time as rapporteur for the Committee on Industry and spokesperson for the Socialists on the other institutions."
"Firstly, I congratulate both the rapporteurs for successfully completing the mammoth budgetary task, and also the chairman of the committee, Mr Wynn, for getting through the votes in record time."
"Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Industry, I am disappointed with the outcomes in this budget because many of the priorities which we highlighted have been totally ignored."
"Let me single out three issues. The e-Europe initiative, launched with much fanfare at Lisbon, highlighted how it would increase the competitiveness of European industry; increase employment opportunities; and acknowledge that a knowledge society is indisputably a fundamental prerequisite for future economic prosperity."
"The extension of e-Europe to the applicant countries was again much heralded at Stockholm, but we are proposing not to extend this programme."
"I would like to remind everybody that the Council and Parliament confirmed e-Europe as a priority."
"By not supporting it we are undermining one of Europe's priority programmes and this will be to the detriment of the applicant countries."
"We need to ensure, as the rapporteur stated, that rhetoric is matched by action, that the EU citizen is not left to ponder."
"We have all these programmes; they are acclaimed; and then they seem to dissipate into thin air!"
"This applies equally to my second point on Save."
"This has been a parliamentary priority for a number of years."
"Here we have a proposal to decrease the funding for the coming year."
"An environmentally-friendly European energy policy is at the top of most people's agendas and it is important that Europe leads the way in our Kyoto obligations."
"Therefore, to reduce programmes that promote sustainable energy consumption and impact on climate protection is extremely short-sighted."
"The third area in which the Committee on Industry will be retabling amendments is the decommissioning of weapons of mass destruction, and waste management. These are key to promoting a safer world."
"This is even more critical in the light of the recent atrocities of 11 September and to ensure that states have a proper strategy for dismantling chemical weapons so that there are no opportunities for these weapons to fall into the wrong hands."
"I would urge the rapporteur to rethink and support these amendments."
"Moving on to the other institutions, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Buitenweg, for the open and inclusive approach she adopted in arriving at the budget for the other institutions."
"This year, as she said, Heading 5 was under tremendous pressure for a number of reasons, including the preparation for the forthcoming enlargement."
"My group's efforts have been to continue to improve effectiveness, efficiency and transparency."
"As far as Parliament is concerned, these are not just hollow words, but words of substance."
"We have demonstrated our commitment to improving efficiency by staying under Parliament's 20% self-imposed ceiling, whilst absorbing the costs of preparations for enlargement of some EUR 18 million."
"However, this will be extremely difficult in the coming years."
"I would urge the Council to address this, so that the costs associated with the proposed enlargement are dealt with before we commence the budgetary procedure next year."
"Furthermore, I welcome the three-year enlargement plan that the Bureau has approved."
"At this stage, it is fairly sketchy and perhaps conservative - with a small 'c' - and not very radical."
"This is a shame because enlargement offers a real opportunity to make Parliament more dynamic in its operation."
"Some of the ideas outlined in this plan need to be developed further and we need to have a broader view of how things are done."
"Yesterday we heard in plenary that Parliament was unable to look at the money laundering proposals, which were agreed by the Council, for another three weeks because of the need for translation into 11 languages."
"This is extremely frustrating for everybody concerned, but what will this mean when we have 10 more languages?"
"We must address this issue because it causes us fundamental problems in terms of the image of Parliament. It creates negative perceptions in the minds of European citizens, in that the European Parliament is seen as undynamic and unresponsive."
"Whilst we are on the subject of radical thinking, I would like to make some suggestions to the Council to improve their own efficiency."
"The under-utilisation of Parliament's buildings, for instance."
"We have buildings in Brussels which are almost empty for one week every month, and a building in Strasbourg which is hardly used and remains empty for three weeks a month."
"As the Council is consistently pointing out waste, here is an offer it cannot refuse."
"It could share and make full use of our buildings by holding its meetings in our buildings."
"I hope that will also benefit transparency in the way it works."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr President, we on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy this year can generally welcome the progress that has been made so far in formulating the budget for next year."
"Looking back historically, we are doing a better job every year and this is certainly due partly to the work done by the rapporteurs."
"Things are going along much more smoothly than they were, despite the fact that we are considerably squeezed for money because of external demands upon our budget."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Budgets has supported the view of Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in restoring some of the budget lines which we are particularly concerned with, at least to the level of the PDB."
"Also, it is worth mentioning that we look with approval upon the work that was done in terms of the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgets with regard to the tobacco subsidies."
"They urge the Council to take a good look at this."
"We urge the Commission to take a good look at this."
"We know something must be done."
"I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets acknowledges this."
"Its proposals for a gradual reduction over a period of time of that subsidy make sense, and it is time the Council and the Commission started talking about this issue."
"One particular success is on the issue of the budget line associated with the approval of orphan drugs by the medicines agency."
"I am very pleased the Committee on Budgets has accepted our point of view and I hope the Commission does as well."
"This has been a very successful budget line since created last year together with the SAB procedure."
"We were concerned about what the Council wanted to do in terms of the massive cut it demanded in that line, which was completely unjustified."
"We are pleased about the restoration to an appropriate level of that budget line and we hope the Commission will also defend that point of view to the Council."
"This is a budget line which does genuinely good work for the people of Europe and brings real and genuine benefits and it must be protected."
"Finally, I would say that we have some concerns about the way in which the agencies have been handled."
"I can fully understand why money must go into the reserve and I can fully understand why there is increasing concern about the way the agencies operate, but we need to give them the appropriate resources to do their job and that particularly applies in the case of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Agriculture Committee wishes to address the Council and express its fundamental opposition to the cuts across the board that the Council is always making."
"We see this, in political terms, as a rather unimaginative way of handling Budget guidelines. We are working on the assumption that the letter of amendment will be the right basis on which to adjust individual areas in preparation for second reading."
"Apart from that, we hold to our demand for agricultural expenditure to be made more flexible in future by enabling the transfer of funds from the mandatory to the discretionary division."
"We know how complicated that is and how many changes have to be made, but we will carry on demanding this whenever budgets are laid before us, until our demands have been met."
"The Commission's proposal on the introduction of a reserve meets with our explicit support."
"That is needed."
"We are sure that we do not have to explain why it is necessary."
"We also assume that the Commission will act responsibly if it becomes necessary to make use of it."
"Our colleagues on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy have just spoken about tobacco."
"We too on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development have had to return to the tobacco issue."
"We are most dissatisfied with the inadequate use being made of money from the Tobacco Research Fund."
"On the Agriculture Committee, we, too, are fed up with forever flogging a dead horse where this subject is concerned."
"We have, on the one hand, the demand for preventative health education, and, on the other, the need to promote tobacco growing."
"We must, though, face reality."
"For as long as we have farmers who grow tobacco - and they are not the richest - and have no alternative crop to offer them, we cannot help them."
"This sector therefore needs possible alternatives not only to be examined, but also offered."
"Most of all, I would like to say something more about SAPARD: we are glad that the appropriations have been increased, but, like the Commissioner, we are critical of the way the Council has cut by EUR 100 million the amount of funds SAPARD is authorised to pay out."
"This is not on!"
"It is absolutely not on!"
"Please, Commissioner, let there be no fear of a new implementation along the lines of LEADER."
"Take your courage in both hands!"
"Let me take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur for working so well with me and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee."
"Mr President, to begin with, I should like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for offering such close and constructive cooperation."
"That does not mean that he was able to agree on all counts as far as the fisheries budget is concerned, but he listened carefully to everything we had to say and created, in any event, a basis for further collaboration, which we found useful."
"The huge problems in the fisheries sector and the partial failure of the common fisheries policy have left their mark on the fisheries budget."
"Clearly, the multi-annual orientation programme and the unilateral closure of areas have not proved successful."
"Failure to conclude a new fisheries agreement with Morocco has led to an explosive situation along the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, an area which is already facing major social problems in connection with illegal immigration."
"It is for that reason that the Committee on Fisheries has asked for nearly EUR 200 million in order to be able to tackle these problems."
"The rapporteur suggests including a token entry first and challenging the Council to meet the pledges made in Nice."
"The Committee on Fisheries endorses this view."
"However, the Committee on Fisheries is disappointed by the fact that the budget proposal for more money for quota control, which was desperately needed, has been watered down by a liberal amendment in the Committee on Budgets, while the original amendment did receive wide support from all groups in the Committee on Fisheries with this proposal."
"In the capacity as shadow rapporteur of the PPE-DE Group for the agricultural budget, I note that, of the original request for EUR 1 billion extra for food safety and animal disease control, eventually 580 million was left over, but what we say is: better some of a pudding than none of a pie."
"In actual fact, we also regret to some extent the Commission' s failure to adhere to the original request for EUR 1 billion extra."
"Fortunately, the PPE-DE position, that more money must be earmarked for animal disease control, has met with approval."
"In general, we are of the opinion that, in order to restore consumer confidence, it is vital to bring the European markets, including those for beef, back to normal."
"As a final point, I have to say that I am delighted with the fact that, with regard to foreign policy, the PPE-DE Group will be tabling an amendment for more attention for Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan, and I should also like to recommend this amendment warmly for further discussions."
"Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on behalf of whom I am speaking, put forward ten or so amendments to the draft budget with regard to the four Community initiatives (URBAN, INTERREG, EQUAL and LEADER), for safety and sustainability in transport and tourism."
"Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September, tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union."
"The World Tourism Organisation anticipates a doubling in the number of tourist arrivals up to a figure of approximately 720 million per year by the year 2020."
"The 9 million people who already work in the tourism industry will be joined by a further 2 to 3.5 million between now and 2010, to reach 12.5 million people employed."
"The Committee on Budgets, however, rejected our proposals."
"Fortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has once again been able to put forward an amendment to this House so that, at European level, resources are assigned to stimulate the promotion, monitoring and evaluation of a tourism policy that is both ecological and socially sustainable."
"I trust that the majority of my fellow Members here will have the sensitivity necessary to support this reaffirmed proposal with their vote."
"Mr President, the budget of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport contains three important new features:"
"Firstly, a separate appropriation of EUR 12.6 million is being proposed for the implementation of the elearning initiative."
"It is justified because IT studies have a key place in the EU' s strategy."
"A considerable increase in the appropriation for IT teaching would also be wise, as if it is to be financed merely from the Socrates, YOUTH and Culture 2000 programmes this might put the implementation of the fundamental aims of these programmes in jeopardy."
"We have to remember that information technology is a tool, not an absolute value."
"The second new feature is connected with sport, which still does not have a legal basis in the Union."
"Sport is mentioned, however, in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the conclusions of the Nice Summit stressed its social importance."
"The Committee on Budgets has approved a proposal for a EUR 5 million appropriation for sports club work to prevent exclusion amongst youth."
"The third new matter in our Committee' s budget is the EUR 1 million appropriation for establishing a centre for monitoring cultural co-operation."
"In my opinion, the co-ordination of cultural co-operation could be practised in association with the Council of Europe, which has much experience in the field."
"Chapter A-30 again caused problems."
"I am very disappointed with the work of the Committee on Budgets in item A-3042, which concerns the funding of European cultural organisations."
"We in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport had done a lot of work in connection with this point."
"We took the Commission' s report on the funding of organisations into account as well as the recommendations of the Committee on Budgets' working party."
"We, above all, tried to assess how money might be used in the best possible way from the point of view of European culture."
"I cannot accept that the Committee on Budgets has interfered with a proposal that required the expertise of a special committee the way it has."
"I warmly support the proposal contained in the report drafted by Mr Costa Neves for a legal basis and proper rules to apply to A-30."
"Parliament cannot act as if it were in a 'grab as grab can' type of wrestling contest, in which the most unscrupulous party of all is the victor."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Vande Lanotte, I would like to draw your attention to the three amendments tabled by Parliament' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs."
"The aim of these amendments is to enhance the information given to citizens and to stimulate the debate on issues relating to the future of the European Union, pursuant to Declaration 23 of the Treaty of Nice."
"The aim of Amendment No 223 is to restore the commitment appropriations granted to the Prince-Programme, as proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget."
"The increase in these appropriations has, in fact, been reduced by the Council."
"We feel it is inconceivable not to support strong investment to provide more information for the public on the euro, enlargement, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and, of course, on measures in the area of justice and home affairs."
"All these subjects are extremely topical."
"I would also like to reiterate that we are already involved in a period of reflection and consultation on the future of the European Union."
"We also believe that it would be counter-productive to enter, as suggested by the Committee on Budgets, a part of these appropriations into a reserve."
"We know that using the appropriations entered in the reserve is a much more complicated procedure, and we see no reason why the Commission' s room for manoeuvre should be hampered in this area."
"I would add that, in any case, monitoring is undertaken by Parliament by means of its presence within the inter-institutional working party on general and specific information."
"Lastly, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has also expressed its support for maintaining, and even increasing the financial support given to the European Movement."
"We know that this Movement' s actions are effective, and it would be surprising if the European Union withdraws its support for the European Movement at a time when we need, more than ever, to encourage dialogue with the citizens."
"Furthermore, all Member States should support European Union day, which is organised for 9 May, as this would greatly contribute to developing the rapport with the public that is severely lacking."
"Mr President, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, both the powers of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and, in particular, European Union policies that promote equality of the sexes, in which particular emphasis is given to the Community programme for equal opportunities as a fundamentally important instrument in the struggle for equality, have been strengthened, as have the Daphne programme against domestic violence, and the Equal programme to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market and compliance with the employment objectives of the Lisbon Summit, to name but a few."
"Social exclusion is another concern of the Committee on Women' s Rights, given that we are unfortunately witnessing the phenomenon of the 'feminisation of poverty' ."
"In order to achieve these priority objectives, we have put forward a series of amendments to the budget, which have been well received, and I would like to give special thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for his support in obtaining a majority in the Committee on Budgets."
"A small proportion has been rejected, because it was already included in other budget lines: information actions in the common agricultural policy; methods to combat exclusion; the information society; the fight against poverty and the illnesses that arise as a result of it: malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS; care in the field of health and welfare; consolidation of democracy and human rights, etc."
"Aid for women' s organisations that work for the promotion of women in the European Union should also be pointed out, not only the women' s lobby, but also other organisations that monitor the respect for pluralism in our society."
"We cannot affirm that one sole organisation represents all of Europe' s women."
"This action is therefore intended to promote justice and recognition for many other European organisations that have been working towards the equality of the sexes for a long time now, which also have a right to receive financial aid from the European Union."
"The Committee on Women' s Rights is therefore very pleased that the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets has accepted its proposals."
"Mr President, I apologise to the rapporteurs that I was not able to be here at the beginning of the debate, but I would wager a euro that nobody has yet touched on the subject that I will raise on behalf of the Committee on Petitions."
"Deep in the Buitenweg report is Amendment No 2022 on Budget Line 250 and this makes a new proposal to allow in certain circumstances, individual expenses to be paid to particular petitioners if they feel it appropriate to come to Parliament to put their case."
"I want to thank the rapporteur for accepting this report and the committee for passing it."
"Parliaments, you know, have various responsibilities."
"They decide who is to be the government, of course, that is not a responsibility of this Parliament."
"They decide budgets, but you know, we have only partial budgetary powers."
"We have no powers over taxation, we have no powers over 50% of the expenditure more or less devoted to agriculture."
"Parliaments decide legislation: that is a power we have to share with the Council of Ministers and we have no powers of legislative initiative."
"But parliaments also have a responsibility to protect the rights of the individual citizens in dealing with the bureaucracy and that is a responsibility that we discharge in this Parliament through the work of the Committee on Petitions and the work of the Ombudsman."
"I would say to Parliament this afternoon that the money spent on petitions and the EUR 3 million that we make available to the Office of the Ombudsman is money that is extremely well spent."
"It works out at less than EUR 0.1 per person per annum, so it cannot be said to be a great deal of money, but it is money that is being spent on real European democracy and we want to ensure that we keep that up and that we see that we do more in future years."
"Mr President, I shall concentrate in particular upon the remarks on the ECSC' s operating budget, in which context I shall talk about the report issued by Mr Seppänen on behalf of the Committee on Budgets."
"We are pleased about the role played by the ECSC as a pioneer in the European integration process and about the way in which the ECSC has made a positive contribution to peace in Europe."
"We note that the ECSC was financed by means of revenue of a fiscal nature which facilitated the development of economic and social intervention measures associated with sectoral industrial policies."
"At present, the coal and steel sector employs 357 000 workers and, as we enlarge the EU by means of the candidate countries, enlargement will mean that coal production in the EU will be doubled and that steel production will be increased by a third."
"We can note with pride that, thanks to the ECSC, something was constructed and further developed that led to the European Union as we know it today."
"The Committee has approved the Commission' s draft operating budget of EUR 151.8 million in 2002, and it is of course on 23 July 2002 that the ECSC Treaty expires."
"We might have wished that, when it came to both operations and research, there had been a little more money for future energy needs relating to clean coal technologies, and we call upon the Commission to take account of this in the other programmes."
"Mr President, I would like to put a question to you."
"I do not understand why, when I am the official draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, when I prepared the amendments tabled by my Committee, when I arranged the vote on these in my Committee, when I defended them, rather vigorously at times, in the Committee on Budgets - where, in most cases, I also managed to obtain the approval of my fellow Members - why, therefore, my name is not on the list of draftsmen due to speak."
"I, therefore, ask permission to take the floor now, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms."
"Mr Deprez, your name does not appear on the official list of Members allowed to present committee opinions and I am, therefore, unable to give you the floor at this time."
"I shall therefore request permission to take the floor now, Mr President."
"Mr Deprez, the list of speakers is produced from the official requests presented by the various committees on behalf of which one can speak."
"Since your name is not on the official list and as I see no reason for this to be changed, I shall give you the floor later, when you do have the right to make a speech."
"President, our spokesman will be speaking for our Group later, but I also have a few comments to make at this stage."
"As other speakers have already done, I should like to congratulate our two main rapporteurs, Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg."
"It is never an easy job to steer something through this House, as I know, and I think that they should be warmly applauded."
"With the Commission budget this year, we have a proposal in front of us which, at 1.06% of GDP, is one of lowest budgets we have seen proposed in this House and therefore well below the ceiling as foreseen in the Financial Perspective, but I guess that with enlargement on its way, the Financial Perspective could well be tested before we reach the end of 2006."
"In referring to the Costa Neves Report, I should like, first of all, to congratulate the rapporteur on having focused on the progress report, on what had been done in terms of following up on the Joint Council/Parliament Declaration at the end of last year which has shown its worth in our budgetary procedure."
"It may well be a useful idea to think of continuing this on an annual basis, because where we have gained is looking at the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations of the European institutions, and this for us in Parliament is a point of major importance which I shall come back to at the end of my speech."
"I should like to raise a few points on the particular matters of the Commission budget where we would, as a group, be looking for value for money - a tried and tested position with us."
"Firstly, in terms of agriculture: we do not believe in having a reserve - we already have some money which has already been made available and a letter of amendment on its way, and I feel that it is quite sufficient."
"But we think there should be an enquiry into the management of foot-and-mouth by the Commission and the British authorities, and we will be pushing for that."
"Secondly, we believe that in information policy there is a continuing problem: every time we see Commission proposals come through without the interinstitutional working groups, we as a Parliament have to put them back on the information policy lines."
"I urge the Commission to make sure that they become a permanent part of your proposals - this will save some effort on our part to ensure that this interinstitutional work is continued."
"Thirdly, in terms of the food safety agency - I noted that was raised in the European Council in Ghent - I would remind the President-in-Office (instead of laughing, he might listen to parliamentarians when they are speaking) that Parliament's position is that the money will stay in reserve until we are satisfied about the operations and the location of this agency."
"I therefore assume that you will consult Parliament before any final decision is taken."
"Fourthly, as regards Afghanistan - and I turn to the Commission again here - there is an amendment down to create a 'pour memoire' entry for aid to Afghanistan, and we will be asking the Council with Parliament to put this into the budget on second reading because we want to see in our Group that there will be an international alliance to help the reconstruction of Afghanistan once the conflict is over, and initial thinking on this issue is already under way in the United Nations."
"Lastly, I would like to refer to the question of the posts which we have put in reserve and we would like to ensure that the conditions for the reserve are met before the posts are released - including the fact that the Commission has the capacity to use the posts during the next year in terms of the vacancies."
"There is, however, one more very critical point, and I turn again to the Council of Ministers here."
"Rumour has it, Mr President, that the early retirement package which is being negotiated in the Council at the moment is not open to Parliament."
"I would like you to confirm in any future remarks that it will be open to us - that is a critical point for our Group as we wish to see it applied across all institutions."
"I conclude, Mr President, on a point for our institution."
"Yesterday evening, the Bureau decided, in opposition to the resolution of Mr Harbour, to go against the idea of having a linear career structure - I quote paragraph 38 of the Resolution which we voted in this House last November - ""urges Parliament's administration to introduce a linear career structure in parallel to the Commission allowing for easy interinstitutional transfer""."
"It is unacceptable that Parliament's Bureau seems to have gone totally AWOL and decided for itself: under pressure from Parliament's administration, Parliament's Bureau has chosen to ignore what this Parliament has voted for."
"Therefore, you will have to answer three questions, and I end on this."
"Why is the organisation and the function of Parliament so distinctive from the Commission as to require a different career structure?"
"Secondly, how can a career structure retaining four different categories meet the objectives of a linear career structure with progression on merit as strongly supported by Parliament?"
"And lastly, how can staff mobility between institutions be encouraged if Parliament and the Commission have different career structures?"
"The Bureau has to come and justify before this Parliament the decisions it has taken as they are not in line with our resolutions."
"Mr President, I do not want to repeat things, so I will stick to just a handful of points - although James Elles has stolen some of the thunder from my speech with his last two points."
"I congratulate the rapporteurs."
"Their work is never easy."
"This year they have done a particularly good job under difficult circumstances."
"I welcome the President-in-Office's statement that at the next conciliation he hopes we can get an agreement with the Council."
"I hope so too because on 20 July, at the last conciliation, we agreed virtually nothing."
"There is no point in having conciliation meetings if that is the level we are going to reach."
"Hopefully, in November we may get something more positive."
"As for the situation regarding the margins, which the President-in-Office also mentioned, there will not be much of a margin left by the time we vote on Thursday."
"One of the reasons for that is because, once again, we could not get into any discussions with the Council; we could not get any agreements with the Council."
"I made the point on several occasions in July that the three institutions must seriously discuss the problems of trying to finance categories 3, 4 and 5 for the future."
"The Council cannot ignore these categories as though there were no problems."
"At times it seems it is like an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand trying to ignore all the problems around it."
"When the Council takes that attitude, we are left talking to the backside, although sometimes we get more sense out of the backside of an ostrich than out of some of the people that we do have to speak to!"
"That is not a reference to you President-in-Office! There are times when it is so frustrating trying to get the message through that we waste our time having conciliation meetings."
"Hopefully, in November we will get something a lot more concrete."
"On the issue of reform, James Elles has just touched on a very significant point."
"I was going to refer to the concern that we have about the progress that is not being made, but Parliament has not helped itself with that decision last night by the Bureau."
"One has to hope that can be changed rapidly."
"Realistically, it is now left with the Council: almost three years have passed since the resignation of the Commission, and we still have not seen the reform that everyone is looking for."
"Where are we?"
"It is stuck in the Council."
"President-in-Office, you are aware, because I have discussed this issue with you, that the message must get through that we need a solution to this as quickly as possible."
"Otherwise the whole process will be bogged down in the mire."
"Hopefully, Parliament can play its part and unravel last night's decision and continue on the track of getting a speedy process going so we can get the whole issue sorted out, not just for the Commission but for all the institutions."
"I want to turn to the Global Health Fund which we have a budget line and a relatively small amount of money for next year."
"As we are all aware, the Commission will be bringing forward proposals to finance that from this year's budget, taking EUR 60 million from the general budget and EUR 60 million from the EDF."
"I need to ask the Commission a question: on the monies from the EDF, once that budget is agreed, it is agreed with the ACP states, so can we be assured that the ACP states have agreed to the use of EUR 60 million for the Global Health Fund?"
"Several of my colleagues have asked me that question, and quite frankly, I do not know the answer to it. So if Commissioner Schreyer could reply to that, I would be grateful."
"Let me turn to the contentious issue of the A-30 lines."
"It seems that whenever we vote on the A-30 lines, we please very few people and displease a lot of people."
"I would hope that the situation that we found ourselves in this time will give us the courage for next year to make proposals which envisage a more transparent system."
"We are concerned that if we hand the whole process over to the Commission, it will be no better."
"The Commission will take the decisions instead of Parliament."
"I hope we can get some sort of an agreement within Parliament on how we handle A-30 in the future."
"Finally, I want to make a plea to the Council and to repeat what I said in conciliation and at the recent trialogue."
"What we need is a working group of the Council and Parliament at a political level to start looking at value for money within the European Union, to look at the institutions, to look at the activities and to make sure that we can persuade the taxpayers that they really are getting value for money."
"I hope you will take that on board."
"Mr President, firstly my sincere thanks and congratulations go to Mr Costa Neves, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen for their excellent work."
"At the same time I wish to thank Terence Wynn, as chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who has proved a competent leader in the work of the current year."
"The job of general rapporteur is a tough and demanding one, but Mr Costa Neves has managed well and my group supports his policy on the Commission' s budget."
"The budget' s general lines include cancelling the cut in agricultural expenditure, attending to arrears in payments, and the Commission' s reform."
"The strengthening of the policy on the northern dimension in the budget' s explanatory statement may also be regarded as a positive move."
"The handling of the budget is based very much on last year' s financial statements, which showed a surplus of EUR 11 billion."
"Expenditure was EUR 8.5 billion less than anticipated and EUR 6.5 billion of the Structural Funds remained unspent."
"For that reason, we now have to pay special attention to improving administration and not producing such large estimates for expenditure."
"Otherwise, the bottom will fall out of budget policy altogether."
"One particular focus in the budget is the reduction in payment arrears."
"At present they stand at more than EUR 60 billion."
"My group supports this goal."
"It also supports the reform of the Commission, which is one of Parliament' s most urgent priorities."
"It will increase efficiency and the importance of personal responsibility."
"It is being proposed that a part of the appropriations should be placed in a reserve, so that the Commission may quickly propose a reform of its staff regulations and clarify its ideas on the early retirement scheme."
"Heading 4 is difficult."
"The Commission and the Council are proposing EUR 125 million for the Moroccan fishing agreement, although this agreement is not forthcoming."
"This is clearly a matter of a concealed reserve which, indeed, contravenes the Financial Regulation."
"It must be dissolved."
"As a counterweight, it is being proposed that a flexible instrument should be used to modernise the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets."
"This could be partly acceptable."
"On the other hand, our group cannot accept the cut of EUR 84 million in the CARDS Programme."
"We, as liberals, like participating in joint agreements to carry through the budget in Parliament, but we cannot be party to this idea."
"The CARDS Programme has been an undisputed priority with Parliament, and, for that reason, we are hoping for similar cuts in the budget for other programmes where payment appropriations have not been used to the extent they might have been in any case."
"Of the small programmes, the most considerable is the A-30 appropriations, which are earmarked as assistance to organisations."
"These appropriations take up a totally unreasonable amount of Parliament' s time in relation to their importance."
"For that reason, the whole system should be clarified."
"In addition, the way the organisations are selected is very rarely based on objective criteria."
"We particularly support Mrs Buitenweg' s recommendations concerning discipline in Parliament' s budget, as mentioned in her report."
"They remain beneath the ceiling we, ourselves, set, that is to say 20% of all administrative costs, even though it includes the costs relating to enlargement. The question of eastward enlargement itself is one that must be dealt with in such a way that Parliament' s work is not made any harder and that in the future we may congregate in our own united assembly."
"Mr President, I, too, would like again to express my thanks to the rapporteurs, and also to the Chairman of the Committee."
"If you consider the conflicts that arose from attempts to pass budgets in the past few years, it seems as if greater calm prevails this year, as if the conflicts were not so evident to the public eye."
"But it must be recorded that, this year too, the Council is not actually facing up to its responsibilities."
"As a component part of the budgetary authority, it has the task of supporting a Budget with real commitment and in a politically explicable way."
"Whilst Parliament worked very carefully for a balanced budget, in long debates, discussions and negotiations with most of the interested parties, weighing needs against the duty to budget prudently in the taxpayers' interests, the Council again merely cut lump sums without any underlying political thought."
"At any rate, its political thinking is not clear to us, and the question arises of whether it ever engaged in any."
"Problems are needlessly exacerbated by the way the Council acts, for, this year too, the Budget is below the margin, far under 1.27% of Gross Social Product, despite special tasks, preparations for enlargement and many other problems."
"This year, the Council has cut payments by 10% across the board, something made all the more incomprehensible by the delay in implementing programmes in many areas."
"Parliament is now reinstating these figures."
"We cannot, on the one hand, build up expectations in areas such as the Structural Fund or overseas aid, but then live up to them only with great hesitation."
"This undermines trust in the institutions of the EU."
"So the Council must bear its share of responsibility for this if its action is to be approved."
"This action is particularly problematic in Category IV, foreign policy."
"Whilst the Foreign Ministers and Heads of Government make great speeches about the Common Foreign Policy, the Finance Ministers narrow-mindedly cut the supply of funds, without considering the prestige lost by the EU institutions."
"It is far from clear why the instrument of a flexible reserve is not fully available to us this year."
"We still have major problems in the Balkans, new tasks await us in Afghanistan and in its neighbouring states and more new tasks await us in the Middle East."
"We need a response from the Council too on the way that the EU is losing its capacity for flexible reaction."
"The Council must explain how the EU is to continue to be flexible and capable of political action."
"We, as a group, are more critical of the A30 lines procedure."
"The great number of individual motions - including those from Parliament - has led the two major groups to attempt a solution by dealing with them en bloc."
"Our committee would then no longer be able to do any fine-tuning in this area, and we would thus be inadequately performing our monitoring function."
"Now Mr Wynn has clearly mentioned that changes are to be made to the Budget process next year."
"I hope we will be able to work together to produce an intelligently thought-out procedure which will also enable Parliament to perform its function of monitoring the A30 lines."
"We must not lay ourselves open to the accusation that we are engaging in economics for the benefit of special interest groups."
"This really is not what we should be doing in the Budget."
"No, I do believe there must be a certain amount of self-criticism."
"I am perfectly aware of the fact that there is a great deal of pressure on the time available to us, but every individual item in this field in particular must be politically justifiable even to people outside this Parliament."
"I would like to sum up and end my speech by referring back to what previous speakers have said and, again, challenging Parliament to push ahead with its own reforms."
"Our demands to the Council and the Commission for reform will only be credible if we strive credibly for reform ourselves."
"Yesterday evening's decisions from the Chair did not, I believe, take sufficient account of that."
"Mr President, a very strict budget policy has been adopted in the drafting of next year's budget."
"As the GNP for the EU Member States has grown faster than the increase in payment appropriations, the amount the EU budget represents in the figure for combined GNP has shrunk to 1.03%."
"That indicates that next year' s draft budget will not exhibit any special areas of focus."
"The permitted ceiling in the EU budget is 1.27% of the combined GNP for the Member States."
"There will consequently be room in the budget for areas of special focus, but the Council and the Commission do not seem to have the political will or the ability to prepare any such areas."
"Examples of them might be employment or healthy food."
"The EU political élite no longer even debates the matter of the prevention of unemployment, let alone try to combat it with appropriate policy."
"Our group has traditionally stressed the importance of preventing unemployment."
"In most cases unemployment is not the fault of the unemployed person him or herself: that person is at the mercy of the economic situation as it happens to be at any one time."
"We must have a policy against unemployment."
"The political élite and EU officials certainly look after their own interests."
"We are to have an early retirement scheme that will generously reward those who no longer, even through retraining, can be made into functional tyres to go on EU wheels."
"If there are hundreds of officials no longer needed, that shows just what a bad state EU staff policy is in."
"The Commission' s ability to implement Parliament' s political decisions is nothing less than wretched."
"The gap between the budget that has been decided and the budget implemented by the Commission is always much too wide."
"There are no delays in payment when it comes to issues that are important to the Commission, whereas there often are in issues important to the Parliament."
"The EU budget is a political document, as it channels money to the EU élite bodies, and now also to the European political parties and for EU propaganda."
"That is not the way to make a citizen' s Europe."
"If an illegal war was waged in the bombing of Yugoslavia, assistance for the country' s reconstruction should not be the object of cuts."
"Let us hope that the CARDS vote does not take the large groups by surprise."
"Mr President, we note that, for the first time, the Commission' s preliminary draft budget exceeds the symbolic EUR 100 billion mark and is firmly dominated by crisis spending on agriculture and external commitments."
"In this first reading, our group supports many of the choices made by the rapporteur, such as the horizontal amendments, in principle, and particularly when this involves a systematic reduction of the RAL and the desire to prevent further RAL from building up."
"As for agriculture, almost all of the appropriations for this sector have been restored, and this can only reassure our farmers, who are greatly in need of these funds."
"The package of EUR 180 million approved by the Committee on Budgets in favour of other agricultural interventions also helps, even if we must condemn the obvious lack of appropriations for the emergency fund for veterinary complaints, for the distribution of agricultural products to the less wealthy sectors of the Community and for the setting up of young farmers."
"With regard to cross-border regions, it is worthwhile reiterating that these regions already benefit from extensive financial support, and we might well consider whether, in view of their diversity, a unique instrument could be the appropriate response."
"As far as internal policies are concerned, the interests of small- and medium-sized businesses are safeguarded, and Parliament can welcome the increase in appropriations that aim to combat violence against women and children, such as paedophilia and misuse of the Internet."
"In our view, however, the reduction made by the Council concerning advertising for the euro, and which was increased by Parliament, is sufficient."
"This advertising, for which the citizens of our countries pay a high price, seems to be nothing more than propaganda."
"Furthermore, the French delegation of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group is opposed to the appropriations included on a multitude of headings in Chapter A 30, which do nothing more than to encourage federalist presuppositions and these alone, whereas other tendencies are not recognised, in spite of the choice of the electorate."
"With regard to Europol, and this thinking also applies to Eurojust, all our energies must of course be channelled into the fight against terrorism in all its guises, as reiterated by our Chairman, Charles Pasqua, who has relentlessly pursued this fight. However, the necessary strengthening of solidarities and police and judicial cooperation between our nations would only serve as a pretext for the rampant communitarisation of policies and actions that fall fully within the remit of national sovereignty."
"Furthermore, Europol is funded by national contributions, and, in our view, has no place in this budget."
"As far as external actions are concerned, whilst our group appreciates that the appropriations in favour of the MEDA 2002 programme have been doubled, we condemn the drastic reductions in appropriations for the fishing agreement with Morocco."
"You cannot achieve good policies from figures alone and this decision by the Committee on Budgets is the worst message that we could send our counterparts in Morocco, particularly during this difficult time when there is an international crisis."
"Lastly, Mr President, although we are able to welcome the method used by the rapporteur, we must admit that the excessive level of payment appropriations put forward by the Committee on Budgets will certainly not help to control public spending, as this would represent an additional cost of some FFR 27 billion, even for France alone."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the budget must be the perfect instrument for choosing the EU' s political priorities."
"And those choices, I should like to underline once more, must serve the interests of all European citizens."
"The on-going debate on the final form to be taken by the Union indicates that there are many different opinions on the subject."
"I am alarmed by the fact that this diversity of opinions is not reflected in many European projects."
"The fact that a unilateral propaganda megaphone is resounding from Brussels across the Union, and at the citizen' s expense, concerns me greatly."
"Those concerns were recently intensified when the Committee on Budgets rejected an amendment tabled by our Conservative English MEPs to inject impartiality into the Commission' s information policy."
"There is more."
"The Commission, as well as the majority in this Parliament, want to press on."
"Driven by the intense desire to bring about political Union as soon as possible, the European Commission has submitted a proposal for making contributions to European political parties from community funding."
"This is highly peculiar, for those European parties hardly exist."
"The citizens are not familiar with them, yet we are expected to sponsor them."
"Once again, the EU' s political diversity is being overlooked."
"In this way, only mainstream European parties qualify for European subsidy, while the national political parties - which are closer to the citizen - do not."
"Time and again, polls illustrate that the citizens in the Member States are not keen on interference from Brussels."
"Promoting European political parties will only further alienate the citizen from European politics."
"This is why we warmly recommend our amendment which proposes scrapping these contributions."
"The Commission' s and Parliament' s urge to stress the distinctive features of the European political parties does not end at the Union' s borders."
"I should like to quote one example by way of illustration. More than EUR 180 million is pledged annually to the Palestinian Authority."
"If the schools paid from that budget use inflammatory school books full of racist and anti-Semitic language, the Commission washes its hands of the matter."
"Why does the Commission continue to ignore this evil and keep running away from its political responsibility?"
"I have to say that the Union is punching above its weight."
"The Union should confine itself to those areas of policy where European action has an obvious added value."
"The fundamental choice which I, apart from all the positive things, miss in this budget, is that of prioritising the EU' s core tasks and leaving the other tasks where they belong: with the Member States."
"Mr President, this Budget has again committed substantial sums of money to the planned enlargement."
"We must not, though, in doing this, forget the 23 frontier regions which will be particularly - even adversely - affected by the accession of these countries."
"Being a Member for one of these regions, Carinthia, I am disappointed."
"I am sorry that the Commission, the Council, and also the Committee on Budgets are not giving these regions adequate support by allocating sufficient budget resources."
"To cut resources for these regions is to play a dangerous game with popular feeling."
"If the population of these regions suffers overwhelming disadvantages, as is to be feared, the possibility cannot be excluded that they will vote against enlargement and thereby jeopardise the whole undertaking."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if, today, we are discussing at first reading stage the Community budget for the coming year, we are of course talking about politics coated with figures."
"A lot of the European Parliament's initiatives can be seen in that way."
"We want to exert pressure on the Council - those who have spoken before me have pointed out how urgently that is needed - but also on the Commission, because many points have not yet been given the consideration they deserve."
"I will push on with the subject on which Mr Ilgenfritz has just finished speaking, that is to say, the frontier regions."
"It is just not the case that we have cut something, rather we are of course waiting, Commissioner for a rather feeble communication to be followed up by the presentation of something more from the Commission for the frontier regions, as the Commission has a monopoly on initiative."
"You were perfectly well able to propose legal foundations for other things in quick order."
"When it comes to the frontier regions, though, you cover yourself with modesty."
"But it will not do for you to tell us that you observe Parliament's intentions with great interest. The Commission is being called on to produce an initiative."
"That is your duty - it is an honourable one - and you cannot evade responsibility for it."
"So I hope that we will succeed, here in this Parliament on Thursday, in adopting the inclusion of EUR 10.8 million in the reserve for the PRINCE programme."
"I think this will motivate the Commission to present a corresponding proposal on the frontier regions."
"The same goes for the issue of the 317 new posts that the Commission has asked for."
"I think it high time to synchronise the Budget procedure and the Commission's legislative process."
"We cannot have the situation where we briefly discuss the annual reports on the legislation in preparation if the Budget has, in principle, already been passed."
"Here, too, it is a matter of ensuring synchronisation of these two activities."
"So it is right to keep these posts, and the resources for them, in reserve."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the same is true of the common foreign and security policy."
"It is enough to make me weep when I hear your disquisitions on how we would be making savings here in an important area."
"Please bear in mind that we have an interest in dealing with these things as part of the Community Budget, where, to a large degree, they rightly belong."
"Correspondingly, of course, cuts must be made in the relevant Budget line."
"The Council cannot get itself a savings tin for this and thus develop activities independently of the Commission and Parliament."
"There are papers to this effect in the Council."
"You may be sure that Parliament will not let that go through."
"The same goes for Europol and Eurojust."
"I do not propose to go into further detail about this."
"I wish to extend heart-felt thanks to the rapporteurs, in particular to Carlos Costa Neves and of course Mrs Buitenweg as well, for making our work together so pleasant."
"We got a bit further with the Parliamentary budget in terms of truth and clarity."
"It makes little sense to put funds in reserve for the purposes of a law, and then end up spending it on buildings."
"It is therefore more right and proper to put it straight in the Budget line for buildings where it will be used at year-end anyway."
"We will, though, have to ensure - and this is a lesson from this year's Budget procedure - that all proposals for our Parliamentary budget are presented by the Bureau as early as May."
"A procedure such as today's, with many important decisions being taken only in September and immediately before the discussions in the Committee on Budgets, is something we cannot accept."
"I still have grave concerns about the state of health of our colleagues in the various institutions."
"We had requested a report on sickness absence for this year."
"Working in certain institutions is indeed very dangerous, as a lot of people in them are off sick."
"We will have to get to grips with this and take steps to improve the health of our colleagues in the institutions in question."
"In conclusion, I really would like to ask - and Terry Wynn has already mentioned this to great effect - that we should now make progress in November on the issue of cooperation, so that, in December, we can adopt a proper and orderly Budget for 2002."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would also like to start by thanking most sincerely the three rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Costa Neves and Mr Seppänen, for the work they have put in."
"Anyone who follows the process as intensively as the coordinators sometimes do, can see how much work is actually involved."
"Hence my special and wholehearted thanks on behalf of all my group."
"I am glad that the President-in-Office of the Council is still here, as I think every year's Budget process must bring with it the opportunity to point out one thing: this Budget process is not complete."
"Its ability to contribute notwithstanding, this Parliament is not yet in full and complete possession of the power that citizens' Parliamentary representatives must have when the budget for the coming year is at issue."
"I have hinted that I will say that over and over again."
"I will do as Cato the Elder did to the ancient Romans - he was the one who wanted to see Carthage destroyed - but perhaps I will not go quite that far."
"I desire only the destruction of an undemocratic process and I will always be reminding you of that."
"This Budget process, even as regards the agricultural budget, is complete only when it has got us well and truly on board, and when we have complete responsibility for receipts and outgoings."
"I know that I am not meeting with much resistance on your part, but of course we have to develop this further in discussion and argument."
"Only then will the citizens of the European Union be able to decide by their votes whether we, this Parliament, have done well or not."
"The Council and the Commission must of course have a part in this process in future."
"We will accord them high honour for it."
"I believe, though, that Parliament, being composed of elected representatives, is the primary partner in dialogue."
"We will in future continue to point to the need for further developments here."
"We are working on Budget matters in a very restricted framework, which itself is prescribed by the Financial Perspective, to which we adhere, even though we see that additional demands are made on us which were not recognisable as such at the time the Financial Perspective was adopted."
"We must adapt to this and facilitate further developments within our Budget framework."
"At present that is surely still possible, for we see from the backdraughts at the end of every year that there is still enough air."
"So, either there is not proper implementation - a fault which will have to be tackled - or the items really were estimated too high."
"Even there it is still possible to let some air out."
"I will tell you though, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner, that we will in the foreseeable future - in other words by the expiry date of this Financial Perspective at the latest - have to talk about further developments."
"When it comes to the further development of the Financial Perspective, we will have to do some thinking about much more intensive and definite ways of meeting new challenges."
"Up until then, we will have been letting air out all over the place."
"We will be back on the launch pad, and will have to discuss what appropriate terms for this House's budget and the Budget as a whole might look like."
"We will be ready to energetically dispute over further developments with you."
"On the road to this destination, we will give the Commission the support it needs when it comes to modernising its administrative procedures."
"We will be at its disposal when needed staff are to be taken on."
"But, on the contrary, we will also be making quite massive demands."
"We will be demanding a great deal so that our programmes, which we cast in numerical form in the Budget, actually come into being in the course of the year."
"No longer will we stand by and watch payment arrears being built up."
"Progress is being made - I will admit that here and now."
"I certainly would not claim that we are where we were two or three years ago."
"But despite this progress, there is still a need for a massive amount of further work."
"As I have said, we will support you, but we will also make demands."
"In the area of individual Budget lines and categories, too, we will hold fast to that which has proved its worth."
"The people who rely on us to give support when it is needed, will be able to rely on us in future too."
"That starts in Category I, with the farmers who cannot change everything around from one day to another, but need a certain headstart."
"These people must also know that there is to be a change in this European Union."
"We, as a Parliament, will help to bring it about."
"In future, we will take an intensive look at Category I and bring in modernisation."
"We will introduce innovation."
"If there is no discernible development in these areas, which are in Category VII rather than Category I, but still affect agriculture, if SAPARD is not implemented, we will ask you to take the innovative resources that made LEADER such a success and transpose them so as to provide rapid short-term help."
"We will bring this in, and we will also take care that all the security for farmers will not prevent the consumers, too, being certain that produce will be safe for them and not injurious to their health."
"At first reading, we will vote to add the necessary resources to the reserve, resources that formerly seemed to be needed in order to properly treat BSE and foot-and-mouth disease."
"We are aware that these diseases have recently appeared among sheep and elsewhere."
"I do not know whether appropriate steps will be taken on this front."
"We will act accordingly in the first instance, until the letter of amendment has been presented and we have an overall view of things."
"We will make it our concern to meet and overcome the two great challenges presented in Category II."
"The reconstruction of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets is crucial and of the utmost importance."
"People there have relied on being able to pursue their livelihood subject to certain restrictions."
"The failure of the Morocco Agreement means that will no longer be possible."
"I am now addressing both the Commission and the Council when I say that we found that provision of these EUR 125 million, even though it was clear at the beginning of this year that the money could not be used, hardly a serious way of doing things."
"Despite this - or indeed because of it - the fishermen have a claim on help from us, and we will ensure in the Budget process that appropriate action is taken."
"The same applies to the frontier regions, which are not always rich and able to help themselves."
"I think, for example, of Bavaria; regions like that are a bit better off."
"There are other regions which really need more aid, with which we will be concerned."
"What we will be developing in Category III will be oriented towards the future."
"Developments following 11 September have shown us that developments are needed in this area."
"Europol and Eurojust must be developed further, and national sensitivities must be overcome."
"If terrorism is to be combated, all its advantages in the game must be done away with."
"We must not stand on old rights."
"There is room for progress here."
"What we want is to continue with what was begun last year, that is to say, the inclusion of people in society by means of access to the labour market."
"We must not simply forget this a year on from it having been a crucial point in Mrs Haug's Budget report, now that new problems are in the offing."
"People also have a right to social inclusion through training in modern information and communications technologies."
"This applies not only to cultivated and highly educated people, but also to those who perform very simple work."
"Thank you very much for your attention."
"I again thank the rapporteurs and hope that, in cooperation with the other two institutions, we will be able to bring this process to a successful conclusion."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, I too should like to start by thanking the rapporteurs, particularly Mr Costa Neves."
"It is, in my experience, the first time that the rapporteur has not tampered with the financial perspectives."
"I welcome this, especially since we have ended up with a budget surplus of some EUR 11 billion."
"I should like to make some observations concerning the different headings."
"I will start with the first heading. I am in favour of the reserve for foot-and-mouth disease."
"I do not know what other disasters could be heading in our direction, but I believe that the end is not yet in sight."
"I repeat once again, but I have said it so often: in my opinion, the Commission should not stop thinking about possible alternative ways of funding the fight against crises of this type."
"We can look into insurance systems."
"We can put all kinds of restrictions in place, but I do not think that we can rely on the fact that, in the years to come, there will be an annual surplus of one to two billion in the agricultural budget."
"I should particularly like to recommend the amendments on further foot and mouth research, tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, to the Council of Ministers."
"Can we develop marker vaccines, or new testing methods?"
"Can we examine whether a vaccinated animal is still infectious?"
"With regard to heading 2, I endorse the gist of the rapporteur' s policy designed to achieve an improved expenditure and commitment policy."
"I am thus in favour of the amendments which he has tabled in this connection, with only one exception: the increase in payment appropriations is rather extreme in my opinion."
"Along with the Commission, I fail to see how this can be spent in a reasonable manner."
"Consequently, I will in this connection vote differently from the way in which many of you will probably vote."
"Concerning the proposals to use the flexibility instrument in order to restructure the fishing fleet in Spain and Portugal, I am anxiously awaiting the Commission' s proposals."
"On a final note, I think we ought to bolster Eastern Europe."
"The SAPARD payment periods must be extended to 2003."
"The fact that the payment bodies have not yet been approved should not put those countries at a disadvantage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, in my capacity as Chairman of the EP delegation for relations with Central Asia, I shall confine myself to a few comments concerning those budget lines."
"What are they about?"
"In the first instance, they are about aid to the partner countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia."
"Central Asia is an unstable region and has, since the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, really been at the epicentre of world politics."
"We all know that military action on its own will not bring a sustainable solution in the region and that we will need to invest in democratic institutions, in a civil society, in socio-economic and ecological reforms, in the fight against drugs and poverty and in sound education."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is the key aim of our efforts in Central Asia."
"Hence our call to increase that budget line by 5% for commitment appropriations and by 20% for payment appropriations."
"Secondly, I should like to ask you to give your attention to the aid for victims of radiation, particularly in the Semipalatinsk region in Kazakhstan."
"In that region, the Soviet army carried out 607 nuclear arms tests between 1949 and 1999, the bulk of which were above-ground."
"The Soviets obliged the population to come out of their houses and watch the huge nuclear mushroom."
"The effects are catastrophic: the incidence of cancer is five times higher than the national average, birth defects are three times more common than the national average, many young men are impotent and twelve-year old girls suffer from breast cancer."
"Psychological disorders and suicide are very common, and the average life expectancy is around 52."
"That is the reason why, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we would like to increase the payment appropriations in budget line B7-524 from EUR 45 million to 60 million."
"Mr Vande Lanotte, you are visiting our House and attending the sitting. You said you have come to listen, rather than make any comments, and I can understand that."
"However, I should nevertheless like to draw your devoted and kind attention to these two important amendments and maybe, upon completion of this 2002 budgetary procedure, we could visit Semipalatinsk together to witness the disastrous effects of the nuclear insanity and to see how European money could be spent in a effective and useful manner."
"I would be much obliged."
"Mr President, the proposals for 2002 confirm the trend of recent years to reduce the relative value of the Community budget, as can be clearly seen from the fact that the proposed amount is the lowest in the last decade; only 1.03% of GDP."
"Because of the restrictive guidelines of the Stability Pact and also because of the problems resulting from a major economic slowdown, the Council is continuing to suggest cuts, which creates real problems for the budget' s implementation."
"This year' s procedure once again betrays true budgetary chaos, with new needs arising and the number of priorities increasing and appropriations becoming smaller and smaller, leading to cutbacks that can only be overridden by revising the Financial Perspective, which is what we have always advocated."
"Hence, by subscribing to the Council' s way of thinking, the European Parliament is doing no more than vainly attempting to disguise these needs, which are undeniable."
"This also clearly highlights the absence of clear priorities and a coherent strategy for guaranteeing the proper funding of Community policies in various fields, specifically those of cooperation, agriculture and employment."
"This is a concern that increases yet further with the creation of considerable reserves which, in the current context, can only give rise to greater doubts."
"With regard to category four, the only chapter of the budget that continues to show a consistent reduction in sums, the lack of appropriations is striking, particularly if we take account of the needs of and the commitments given to the Balkans, to Palestine, to Afghanistan, on the World Health Fund or for the conversion of the fleets operating in Moroccan waters."
"The rapporteur' s idea, which is not new, seeks to cut spending, particularly on the Balkans, in order to be able to increase the remaining aid for cooperation and to force the Council to negotiate."
"Let us hope that this does not lead to further cuts in cooperation such as those we saw last year."
"We shall see in December what happens."
"These are some of the reasons why we do not support this budget."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur as well as the rapporteur for the other institutions."
"I think that they have both done an excellent job."
"They presented a proposal to the House that is, on the whole, acceptable and which, in any case, the radical Members will support."
"I would also like to highlight the participation of the President-in-Office of the Council in the overall debate, to thank him for taking part and who demonstrates a willingness for dialogue."
"I hope that his participation will bear fruit at second reading and even that, looking beyond the budget, it will have a positive effect on other very important budgetary issues, particularly the financial regulation."
"I would simply like to make two comments on the rapporteur' s overall strategy."
"The first comment concerns the RAL."
"I fully support the strategy used to attempt to reduce their levels, which are becoming rather unmanageable, and to send a clear message to the Commission for its help in trying to do this."
"I ask myself, and I ask the rapporteur, the following question: how do you know it is right to apply this strategy to a very specific situation, that of Afghanistan?"
"The RAL are obviously related to the issue of providing aid to refugees, of providing humanitarian aid."
"I therefore wonder whether or not this could be the time, perhaps - and I put this to the rapporteur, although I understand that it may be difficult at this late stage - to put money - and, in doing so, send out a political message - in the reserve for Afghan refugees."
"Of course, this should be part of an overall strategy, which is perfectly justified, but I wonder whether or not, for this specific message, we could possibly change the strategy, in any case, at second reading."
"My second comment concerns the reform of the Commission."
"I strongly deny what James Elles said."
"Furthermore, I believe that yesterday' s Bureau meeting and the Conference of Presidents unanimously supported the proposals from the parliamentary group responsible for this dossier."
"I reiterate that this group suggested - or indicated in any case - to the Commission, and in particular to the Vice-President charged with reform, that the path that the Commission recommended was not the correct path and was not the path that Parliament advised."
"Furthermore, given the misunderstandings regarding the number of non-assigned posts, I even question whether the previous system, with one commissioner responsible for both budget and staff, was not the best approach, insofar as the overall picture can be seen."
"I therefore reiterate that Parliament supports the proposal that runs counter to the proposal outlined by the Vice-President, Mr Kinnock."
"Mr President, on behalf of my group and on my own behalf, I would like to thank the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, and the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen."
"From a budgetary point of view, by 2002, the rhythm of implementation of appropriations must have reached cruising speed: there is no overlapping with the previous programming period and there can be no delay in the implementation of programmes."
"It is a year in which the forecasts contained in the financial perspectives can be fully achieved."
"In order for the two powers responsible for implementation (the Commission and the Member States) to achieve this fully, the rapporteur offers us a strategy for reducing the backlog; in order to support his strategy, he uses the performance targets identified by the Commission at the request of an initiative presented by the European Peoples' Party for the 2001 Budget."
"It is important that this House accepts the Costa Neves strategy in the field of payment appropriations."
"Without decisive action by the European Parliament, it is going to be difficult to achieve an interinstitutional political commitment on improving the quality of expenditure, which has always been our priority."
"We also support the strategy of the general rapporteur in relation to the new demands, the Commission' s letter of amendment, where it refers to the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in order to finance the new structural needs, the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets which fished in Moroccan waters, which is awaiting the proposed funding the Commission has promised but has still not presented."
"The rapporteur has also presented both pro memoria in the budget lines for that restructuring, and also in relation to a programme for increasing the competitiveness of the border regions with a view to the enlargement of the Union."
"Let us hope that between the first and second readings, the Commission will clarify the situation of this programme and the possible funding proposals."
"Furthermore, we have the insoluble problem of the lack of financial resources in Category 4 for external action."
"This problem threatens to tarnish budgetary procedure after budgetary procedure."
"The Union takes on more and more external commitments, often without consulting this House."
"Later, unilateral cuts are decided on in the traditional external action lines under the pretext of deficient implementation, responsibility for which is always attributed to external factors and never to the functioning of the Commission or the Member States themselves."
"Parliament must therefore, year after year, become embroiled in a pointless fight to remove the cuts which both the Commission, in its preliminary draft, and the Council, in its first reading, carry out."
"This prejudices the role which must be played by such important committees as Foreign Affairs, Development and the Committee on Budgets itself."
"A very good example this year is the EUR 125 million for the never-signed fishing agreement with Morocco."
"It has never been explained why the Commission included these appropriations in the reserve, but the true consequence is that the rapporteur has had to employ (and the political groups support him) a strategy of cuts in order to achieve the mobilisation of these fishing appropriations which were never used."
"Honest interinstitutional cooperation must be based on recognition of the budgetary prerogatives of each of the institutions."
"To wait for the November conciliation to resolve fundamental issues weakens the role of the parliamentary negotiation and the role of the tripartite dialogues for the whole year."
"We in the European Peoples' Party consider essential to the good operation of the budgetary procedure, amongst other things, the harmonisation of legislative and budgetary procedures, the genuine participation of the European Parliament in the creation of the rules of the game, that is, the Financial Regulation, prior knowledge of the Commission' s working programme, more active involvement by Parliament in the budgetary element of the Commission reform, etc. All these aspirations are contained in our amendments, which we will put to the vote on Thursday, and which we hope will receive majority support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like many others, I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves."
"The cooperation has been really good."
"As 'shadow rapporteur' for the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I have also encountered a very constructive attitude, and that is something for which I am grateful."
"By this time, almost all practical proposals from Parliament have been dealt with, and I must therefore concentrate on a number of more theoretical points of view."
"The budget is the ultimate expression of democracy and social development."
"It is through the budget that we decide that our public institution needs to use tax revenue in order in some way to influence society, and it is the EU' s budget that is relevant when it comes to transnational European issues."
"It is always difficult to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the desire to do important things and, on the other, the need to respect budget discipline and to ensure that taxpayers genuinely get value for money."
"In the EU, this balancing act is unusually complicated due to the fact that it has to be carried out both by two budget authorities in tandem and by each authority in its own right."
"In the case of the Council, it even has to be performed within each and every one of the fifteen governments."
"Unfortunately, the problem is often that, with one voice - for example that of the agricultural and foreign ministers - the Council pledges a whole lot of money to, for example, agriculture and the fight against BSE and foot and mouth, to the transformation of poor regions, to fishing fleets, to the Balkans and to Afghan refugees etc, while, with its other voice - that of the finance ministers - it says no to increased expenditure."
"The problem is not made any easier by the fact that those who promise aid do not so often ensure that the Commission, which is to implement all these measures, has the resources needed to turn the promises into a reality."
"There are often considerable commitments made, but the level of implementation is low and the funding insufficient."
"In spite of this criticism, I believe that, for the most part, taxpayers get value for money."
"I am an MEP for Sweden, the EU' s most Eurosceptic country and, at the same time, the country in which the individual taxpayer contributes most money to the EU."
"This situation means that it is not always so easy to persuade people to believe that the money is in actual fact used well."
"The myth of the EU as a hopeless colossus is so strong that I am scarcely believed at home when I say that, even for Sweden, the net cost of the EU amounts to only 1 per cent of the State budget, that the budget is not increasing in real terms and that it is implemented in such a way that the Swedish exchequer gets back a large part of its contribution each year."
"Indeed, a tenth of the whole budget is in practice paid back to the Member States."
"I believe, as I say, that we get value for money, but there are still a lot of shortcomings."
"We need to do quite a lot in the future in order to convince people that the funds are being properly used."
"First of all, I believe that we must simplify the budget procedure itself and ensure that it is made more transparent."
"The new budget regulation and activity-based budgeting should contribute to this."
"Secondly, we must speed up internal reform."
"We have certainly now placed a number of services in the reserve, but the aim of this is not to slow down, but to force the pace of, reform."
"I am also convinced that, as Commissioner Schreyer pointed out in his speech, we are going to have to make the budget more flexible and increase our ability to respond to new events."
"In order to achieve this, I also believe that a new spirit of cooperation is needed between the two branches of the budgetary authority."
"Most obvious, perhaps, are the deficiencies in category 4, that of external expenditure, to which the Council has added new expenditure year after year on, for example, aid to Kosovo and Serbia, new fisheries agreements etc. This year, we have had far-reaching discussions on assistance to refugees, the Global Health Fund and other efforts to combat AIDS etc."
"In both 2000 and 2001, we solved this problem by means of the flexibility instrument, which gave us a further EUR 200 million per year."
"The problem this year is that the programmes for Kosovo and Serbia which necessarily gave rise to this flexibility instrument must still be implemented at a high level but without our being able this year to use the flexibility instrument' s EUR 200 million."
"In spite of this, the Council will prevent us from using those funds that are not needed for the fisheries agreements, and that is something I do not understand."
"Why are we not allowed to use them when we, in actual fact, have major costs for the programmes to which we have agreed?"
"This does not hold water."
"With this policy, the Council is forcing us to do something I should preferably have liked us to avoid, namely to say no to a proportion of the major expenditure on the Balkans, even if we are obviously using this to protect the most sensitive areas, that is to say Serbia and Kosovo."
"Let us conduct an open dialogue in this area, characterised by trust."
"We understand the Council' s priorities when it comes to the Balkans, AIDS etc, but then we should also ask for a certain amount of understanding for the fact that we cannot prioritise away all the issues closest to our hearts."
"We want to rescue aid to the Balkans."
"Let us get around the negotiating table."
"Mr President, the 2002 EU Budget, amounting to EUR 51 billion, appears at first sight to be balanced and straightforward."
"The increase of 5% over the outgoings of the Budget year 2001 corresponds to the Berlin agricultural guidelines."
"That is not only good but also inevitable, as no other policy is as thoroughly submitted to Community methods as agricultural policy."
"I note with particular concern, however, that this great chunk of agricultural expenditure is increasingly the object of covetous desires on the part of not a few politicians who see it as a sort of disposable object which can be moved around at will."
"If this intention is to be countered, the Financial Perspective will have to be qualified by the Commission, any kind of speculation eliminated and the across-the-board cuts that are always being sought in the agricultural budget not in fact implemented."
"The appearance of foot-and-mouth disease eleven months ago has meant a very unbalanced situation in animal husbandry, especially as regards food safety, animal protection and the internal market."
"Distorted competition in markets leads to the loss of jobs and income."
"Pricing is becoming chaotic and nobody can explain why."
"So I wish to advocate a temporary increase in the financial allocation to the market organisation for animal husbandry."
"I urge that the so-called interim balance sheet of Agenda 2000 should not be put off simply to do a favour for a particular country."
"I urge moreover that the reserve should be kept until an explanation is given of the contradiction by which we were talking about EUR 1 billion last year and only EUR 400 million now."
"Mr President, at the first reading of the 2002 budget, we would like to express our reservations about a number of amendments tabled by the European Parliament and which put increasing pressure on spending in order to meet, as explained in the motion for a resolution - and I quote 'the legitimate expectations of citizens, regions and governments of the European Union' ."
"Go on, blame the citizens!"
"In the few minutes' speaking time that I have, I will give one example; that of the B3-500 budget line, to which the European Parliament would like to allocate EUR 7 million in order to fund the so-called European political parties."
"This appropriation is without legal basis and has no moral justification."
"Of course, the citizens have never given their opinion on this, but if we asked them if they want to pay more taxes to fund political parties in Brussels, they would obviously say no."
"On the other hand, the MEPs would say yes, as this is of great interest to them."
"These European political parties are inter-party organisations that have no militant base to speak of. Their funding - provided thus far by the parliamentary groups of this House out of their administrative appropriations - has been the subject of a recent report published by the Court of Auditors."
"Because of this, the so-called European parties are seeking other sources of funding."
"And since the citizens do not seem to want to pay of their own accord, we are going to make them pay by means of tax and social security deductions, so that they have no choice."
"For reasons that I have already explained during our debate on the Schleicher report on 17 May 2001, and in my explanation of vote given on the same day, the B3-500 budget line has no legal basis, no more than the draft regulation on the status and funding of European political parties. The Council has still not reached agreement on this regulation."
"Admittedly, the Treaty of Nice provides the possibility of a legal basis by adding a second sub-paragraph to Article 191 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but there is no need to remind you - especially in the wake of the negative outcome of the Irish referendum - that there is still a long way to go before this Treaty can be ratified."
"Lastly, the draft regulation without legal basis and currently being examined by the Council aims to put in place an underhand funding system that runs counter to freedoms."
"To cap everything, the chairs of the five European parties have recently written to Council and to the Commission to demand that the funding from Europe is increased to EUR 15 million instead of EUR 7 million."
"Such is inflation!"
"We believe that the political parties in Europe must be freely financed by citizens and by the national political parties, who are themselves funded according to national regulations in line with their respective legal system and constitution."
"That is why, Mr President, the MEPs of the Mouvement pour la France group, along with the Members of the SOS Démocratie group, will vote against the B3-500 budget line."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Budget process has many problems which we know of old, and new challenges which we cannot yet, in the course of this first reading, conclusively evaluate and deal with."
"I wish at this point to return explicitly to something about which there are some rather vague conceptions in this House, namely that, since 1992, there has been a fundamental change in the common agricultural policy."
"Commissioner, in announcing a letter of amendment, you reminded me that this is the same procedure as every year, with, first, the spectre of a budgetary crisis being conjured up, and then the discovery of room for manoeuvre in the agriculture budget."
"At this point, I say an emphatic 'Yes' to a contingency reserve, but when there really is a crisis, this reserve must actually be used, for many sectors currently find themselves fighting for their very existence."
"I would very much like to take up the debate on the eastward enlargement, in order to make one thing clear: I have no problem whatever with the full integration of the acceding countries' agriculture into the Common Market by 2004, if at the same time the free movement of persons, capital, services and goods, which is part of full membership, is also made a reality, so that there can at last be a fair debate on the whole context of this topic."
"The conclusions of the Heads of State and of Government at Nice have, on the one hand, highlighted the need to start restructuring the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets."
"I support this, but would point out at the same time that we cannot, on the other hand, let a very restrictive approach in the next two years keep the remaining European fishing fleets at arms length and wasting away."
"We must have discussions with the Commission about this."
"Let me say quite explicitly that the 25 July communication from the Commission on the frontier regions was held by Parliament, in its resolution of 5 September, not to comply with the requirements laid down by the European Council."
"For that reason, Commissioner, we call upon the Commission to produce definite proposals for a regulation on the frontier regions."
"Let me now address one further point."
"We made 400 posts available in the 2001 Budget."
"We are now talking in terms of 317, which are still being kept in reserve."
"Commissioner, please just take a look at the posts in the Commission which have not yet been filled."
"I will remind you, in addition to the points we have mentioned in connection with the release of the reserve, that we spent last year reiterating that reform includes the simplification of the acquis communautaire, without the Community patrimony being substantially affected thereby."
"There is, in my judgment, a need for further negotiation on this point."
"One final point, Mr President: We expect, before the second reading, to have a comprehensive report by the Commission on the re-examination of the fundamental concepts of foreign policy, so that we have, with reference to current demands, a conclusive plan for combining conflict prevention, decisive humanitarian aid and the alliance against terrorism in a rational Community package, which we will be able to adopt at second reading."
"Mr President, I will start by focusing primarily on the Seppänen report."
"This is a comprehensive report which addresses all the problems of the final stage of the ECSC' s life, but it also takes into account the problems of the future, if it is true - which it is - that, although the ECSC is dying, the coal and steel industry must continue to develop in Europe."
"The sum set aside for the ten remaining months of the ECSC budget is sufficient, and the increased appropriations for research are in line with the forecasts for after the Treaty' s expiry."
"Parliament wants to play a leading part in our endeavours to give a reassuring response to the 357 000 workers who are employed in the sector and to provide a secure future in terms of the growth and restructuring of the sector."
"I would now like to focus, in the last part of my speech, on the Union' s general budget."
"As the members of my group have already said, starting with the coordinator, Mr Ralf Walter, our opinion of the work carried out by Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg is positive."
"There are many elements which deserve a mention here: the undertaking to improve the quality and speed of expenditure, and here I refer to the Structural Funds, which require an extraordinary measure from the European institutions to motivate, coordinate and carry out prospective and retrospective assessments so that European federalism does not fail this major test; the attention given to the issue of border regions, mentioned by Commissioner Schreyer - I, too, agree with Mr Böge when he says that it is right to clarify the concept of a border region - not least in relation to the enlargement process: regions which must not be the only ones to benefit, Commissioner, and I would stress this point, for the pilot project approved last year does not and must not, as it progresses, just concern the border regions."
"We have got off to a good start: the negotiations will take place and I feel that, ultimately, we will achieve a sound budget, but when I think of this great asset which is Europe, an asset which is ours and ours alone, a supranational political entity which others look to for guidance, as they will have to in the face of fresh challenges, I wonder whether we really ought not to review the financial mechanisms of the European budget if we want to consolidate a great supranational institution which is the envy of all and which needs more resources and a role that is more clearly defined."
"Mr President, the 2002 budget for the European Union mirrors its anti-grass roots and arbitrary policy."
"It is a budget for managing interests which presents no central objectives for resolving the problems being created by the recession, not even as a propaganda exercise."
"The draft budget makes no serious or fundamental attempt whatsoever to redistribute income to the less developed areas or to the working classes hit by unemployment, underemployment and poverty."
"The austerity imposed on the Member States and the European Union as a whole means that even the budget lines available in the past have been cut back."
"Agricultural spending is being constantly eroded, with tragic consequences for farmers, in a bid to make national budgets pay for the anti-farming policy decided in Brussels."
"On the contrary, following the terrorist attack on 11 September, the European Union is being called on to fund intergovernmental cooperation in the so-called area of justice, that is, to keep files on and prosecute citizens who go beyond the bounds of resistance and reaction tolerated by the system."
"Finally, the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will vote against the budget because, instead of resolving the current problems, it will create new problems for workers, farmers and small enterprises, instead of contributing towards peace in the world, it promotes war and an imperialist hegemony, instead of protecting individual and collective democratic, political workers' rights, it suppresses them."
"Mr President, allow me to begin by thanking Mr Costa Neves for his very good work on next year' s budget."
"It is with satisfaction that I at least observe that, for the first time in quite a few years, there has been no serious talk about revising the budget ceiling."
"That is, for me, the sign of a rapporteur who, in a real sense, chooses to respect and apply the budget as a ceiling of expenditure and not as a target for expenditure."
"That is something I think bodes well for forthcoming negotiations."
"In spite of this, there is nonetheless good cause for warning against an unduly expansive budget, especially when it comes to categories 3 and 4."
"The limited margin in both these categories is cause for concern, especially when, in the wake of the terrorist attacks on 11 September, we see an approaching need for measures of humanitarian aid for Afghanistan, as well as a need for measures in the area of justice and home affairs."
"The European Union is already expensive for taxpayers."
"I believe it to be obvious that we must ensure that it does not become still more expensive."
"I see it as self-evident that, at this stage, Parliament should create room for negotiation in relation to the Council."
"There is, however, reason for calling for a general tightening-up, on the parts of both the Council and Parliament, before the second reading so that, from a purely budgetary point of view, they are able to handle the situation that has arisen in the wake of the terrorist attacks in the United States."
"Finally, just a few brief words about Mrs Buitenweg' s report."
"The rapporteur has made progress in the preparatory work before enlargement in 2004."
"That is good, and there is cause to thank her for this."
"I must however note that a very great deal remains to be done in order to prepare and adapt the administration before an enlargement that will soon be only two years ahead of us."
"Mr President, at this stage in the litany of speakers, I feel I should focus on and scrutinise a couple of items in the budget."
"I will firstly mention an issue which I had not included in my notes: the Council is pleased that Parliament shares its concern about the backlogs, the RALs."
"If I had not lived through 17 European budgets, I would be amazed."
"In fact, it is the governments who have the greatest responsibility for the creation of RALs and the Council could make a more useful contribution to the reduction of the RALs by renouncing the systematic underbudgeting of payment appropriations, which do most damage to the pockets of the Finance Ministers."
"What really concerns me most in this budget, however, is that, in real terms, in euros, aid to third countries has decreased since 1999."
"If one thing became clear after 11 September it was precisely that it is going to be necessary to maintain and develop humanitarian aid and our contribution to development aid."
"And this is in no way guaranteed by the Community budget, despite the efforts of the rapporteur, and I salute those efforts."
"The financial perspectives are clearly not sufficient and we have a TV-addicted Council of Ministers, that is to say that their external priorities are led by the latest TV headlines."
"We have Kosovo: we have to help Kosovo."
"We have Serbia: we have to help Serbia."
"We have Afghanistan: we have to help Afghanistan."
"And the next headline will become the priority."
"And what price do we pay?"
"The price of having to make cuts in previous policies."
"We still have problems in the Balkans."
"We still have a serious problem in Africa."
"We still have problems of underdevelopment in Latin America and Asia."
"But we have to make cuts."
"The other question I wanted to raise, which is related to the last point, is whether there are first- and second-class European Councils."
"Why is Berlin more important than Nice, in terms of expenditure?"
"Why?"
"In Berlin, financial perspectives were set which had to be agreed with Parliament, but in Nice, the same European Council, composed of almost the same people, said that we had to create a special programme for the restructuring of the fleet that fished in Morocco."
"Why is that not budgeted for?"
"Why has the Council, with a Commission proposal valued at EUR 197 million, not budgeted for it?"
"It should have done so."
"And I regret that Parliament has not fulfilled its obligation, because what we have to do on first reading is budget in the way we want."
"The Council will then come in at the negotiation at second reading."
"I regret that we have not been able to do this, but I trust that we will be able to resolve it between now and December."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to reiterate that I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, and not on behalf of my political group, and that, consequently, I would like to know exactly what has happened and why I was not included on the list of draftsmen."
"I apologise if I have made a mistake, but if not, I would like to receive an official explanation."
"Having made my point, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to thank the Members of the Committee on Budgets and particularly the general rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for the attention he has given to the requests and concerns of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights."
"We asked a great deal, Mr President, and we received a great deal in return, and this is something I welcome."
"We only made legitimate requests."
"We asked for an increase in the funding granted to the European Refugee Fund, and this was given."
"We asked for an increase in the resources for measures to combat violence towards women, children and teenagers, and this was given."
"We asked for an increase in the resources to combat child pornography on the Internet, and this was granted."
"We asked for no less than six new budget lines, and these were given."
"We have a new European Migration Monitoring Observatory to enable the European Union to anticipate the arrival of waves of migrants and to be better prepared for these."
"We have a specific research and evaluation programme on respect for fundamental rights of the European Union, so that the Charter of Fundamental Rights becomes an operational reality and not just a reality in words alone."
"We have a new budget line that should enable Eurojust to become operational."
"We have funding for the Schengen line with a view to adapting the Schengen Information System to the realities of enlargement, and, lastly, we anticipated - and this, Mr President, is an urgent request to the President-in-Office of the Council - we anticipated, given the current situation, exceptional appropriations for use by Europol in the fight against terrorism."
"We are well aware of the limits of Europol' s actions, we also know that it is founded on conventions, and thus we could experience legal difficulties in using these appropriations."
"However, we would like to address a formal appeal to the Council not to allow these appropriations to escheat, to create the legal basis, which will enable Europol to become fully operational and will allow Eurojust to develop to its full potential."
"Thank you very much, Mr Deprez."
"You did not appear on the list on behalf of the committee."
"We will try to give you an answer when we can."
"Mr President, I am going to follow Mr Colom i Naval' s advice by speaking on the problem of reform, for which I am the permanent rapporteur."
"This problem is quite fundamental, because we have to reiterate on a regular basis that the European Parliament is firmly in favour of administrative reform of the institutions."
"The polemics that are currently raging between those with differing views should be less important than the fundamental problems, and the fundamental problem is to make the Union' s action clearer and more effective in meeting the public' s expectations, so that citizens start to trust the European Union again."
"You know that, in this budget, we noted several delays in implementing this reform, particularly as regards the Commission' s response - which we have yet to receive - on the rewriting of the financial regulation, and also with regard to setting up base management."
"The report's fundamental concern is with the reform of the status and organisation of a career in European civil service."
"We had to take a precautionary measure and put funds into the reserve for creating the new positions that were requested."
"This is nothing more than a precautionary measure, and I would like to reiterate that, for the time being, this is only at the first reading stage as we asked the Commission to provide clarification on the implementation of the single Statute, so that we could have very precise and realistic answers, particularly on the problem of early retirement schemes for civil servants and temporary staff, but also on the problems caused by absenteeism and vacancies."
"We believe that the Commission will be able to provide us with the answers to all these issues, but, nevertheless, I wanted to draw your attention to the fact that hypothetical positions will not help this reform to move forward."
"We have 15 countries and seven institutions, but we have only one European Union, for which only one statute is needed."
"We must not take refuge behind the reports published last year, because the linearity is no longer what it was."
"We therefore want a clear budgetary framework in order to adopt a position, and I shall repeat the request made by all the Committees of Parliament to the Council: the Council must start talking and give us answers on a regular basis so that all our procedures - and reform, in particular - progress within a framework that is efficient in terms of budget."
"This reform is vital: it must not just look good on paper, but should also be realistic and applicable over time."
"Nothing will stop when we reach 2004."
"Everything must continue."
"The reform process must provide renewed motivation and must modernise the way we work, but it must retain a European civil service that has one objective: to implement the political plans of the European Union that restore citizens' confidence."
"Mr President, Mrs Schreyer, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market devoted a great deal of attention to market integration in connection with the eastward enlargement."
"The effects that will be manifested by this integration must also be taken into account when planning the Budget."
"We see, looking at the Four Freedoms, that there will be no difficulties in some areas, but problems with adaptation in others."
"There will be no great changes to the movement of goods, because substantial liberalisation has occurred, nor in freedom of establishment, because the person or business is subject to the laws of the state in which they establish themselves."
"We will, though, have problems with integration as regards the free movement of labour and the freedom to provide services, for the precise reason that there has been to date no competition in these areas, and these markets are only regionally oriented unless they choose to be otherwise."
"The frontier regions will therefore come under particular pressure when the freedoms in question are introduced."
"Specific aid measures are therefore needed."
"The recommendations of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market make it clear that it advocates endowing the frontier regions programme that you, Commissioner, mentioned, with additional resources."
"We are grateful to the Committee on Budgets and especially to the rapporteur for their accepting these suggestions and, in part, adding to them."
"One point in particular is of importance to me: the instruments proposed by the Commission are not sufficient to strengthen competitiveness in the frontier regions, as they promote only cooperation between East and West rather than the specific situation of the frontier regions themselves."
"A specific programme is therefore needed, and so we request the Commission to present a legal foundation for it; I take their statements to mean that they are prepared to do this."
"Mr President, to begin with, I should like to protest against the fact that the offices did not actually consider our opinion as such, for the reason that it mainly consists of amendments."
"They apparently considered our opinion as individual amendments tabled by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"I hope that this kind of procedure will run more transparently in future."
"With regard to the budget, thanks partly to a tremendous effort by our rapporteur, this has become a budget of consolidation."
"There are, of course, always disagreements about all kinds of sections of the budget, but we have been through worse."
"I also have to say that there are clearly fewer disagreements at the level of our committee, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"Also, the Council has made far fewer attempts at scrapping sections than has previously been the case, so, as far as that is concerned, my congratulations to the Council."
"In my view, the problems that remain are at the level of open coordination."
"The Council is still tempted to say that that should be financed from the coffers of Parliament."
"However, Parliament must rubber-stamp this budget, yet it is not allowed to let its voice be heard fully on that score."
"We will need to hold extensive discussions on this matter once again in the years to come."
"We have a number of differences of opinion on this, and I hope that those can be settled in the next couple of years."
"There is another problem concerning EQUAL, one of the components of the Social Fund."
"Once again, the Council has made some serious cutbacks in that area too."
"Despite this, I hope that it is possible to restore the Commission' s preliminary draft in this respect."
"That seems extremely important to me."
"I gather that the Commission has thought very carefully about how precisely that proposal should be structured."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every year, in the context of public health provision, we consider tobacco subsidies, which are, basically, nothing other than direct income support for the interested parties."
"It can be done another way."
"So, as every year, we urge progressive reduction of tobacco subsidies and their replacement by increased aid for rural development with a view to alternative forms of income, which could benefit workers upstream and downstream in the regions."
"The same thing happens every year, yet so far nothing has changed."
"But we must always hope."
"As regards the NGOs, we are always advocating support for them."
"We want to know, though, what is done with the money that is granted to them, which is only right and proper."
"We therefore demand that information on them be made accessible to the public on a regular basis."
"Only then will we have a chance to check whether our financial support for them is justified."
"Believe me, we already find it extraordinarily difficult to get any kind of overview on what organisations we are supporting."
"Equally opaque, though, is the Commission's decision to stop funding the environmental organisation 'Globe' ."
"This is quite unjustifiable and so seems positively wilful."
"It must be added that the funds accorded 'Globe' in the current budget year were not paid out."
"Yet even NGOs need to be able to plan ahead with certainty in order, for example, to be able to carry on paying their office staff."
"The Commission's action in this regard is anti-social."
"Where there is political will, Commissioner, one can find a way, or another budget line for the future."
"As regards the agencies, it does indeed appear as if some agencies had already developed active lives of their own a long time ago."
"They simply exist."
"So we finance them; more money every year, irrespective of output."
"That seems to be all that matters."
"This cannot go on, for this money is needed elsewhere."
"Our task is to ensure that the organisations we support work efficiently."
"Efficiency and effectiveness are not achieved merely by blindly piling-up resources, but by regular observation and monitoring, on the basis of which any necessary adjustments can be made."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have the honour to speak for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I would like to start by thanking my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for the fact that nearly all the amendments produced by this committee were adopted."
"We have reinstated the substance of the budget estimates for regional and transport policy that you, Commissioner, proposed."
"I really must appeal to the Council not to be such a two-faced split personality."
"It is not tolerable for a great hullaballoo to have been made at the Göteborg Summit about our desire for a sustainable transport policy, only for the Council to cut resources in the area of sustainable mobility."
"This sort of ambiguity cannot go on, and we hope that the Council will admit that."
"If you want to have a rational, environmentally responsible transport policy, you cannot cut funds that are allocated for that purpose."
"My main point, though, is to do with tourism, something which did not, unfortunately, meet with favour in the Committee on Budgets."
"I would, though, just ask you to think again about it."
"We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe."
"You all know about the debate over many years about the 'Philoxenia' programme to attract tourist from overseas, with its slogan 'tourists to Europe' ."
"This topic has taken on a whole new dimension since 11 September."
"Not only are the airlines getting 20%-30% fewer customers, but so are hotels in Brussels, Berlin and in all European cities."
"The same is true of restaurants, souvenir shops and boutiques."
"We are seeing a massive slump in tourism, specifically from the USA and Canada."
"This situation is leading to major difficulties in the economy and putting jobs at risk."
"I put it to the Council and the Commission that, if we are to discuss the consequences of 11 September next month, we should re-examine the question of what we are to do to promote tourism in Europe."
"Mr President, at the very outset, I wish to thank Mr Costa Neves for being so understanding, as he has worked on the questions we are discussing with really great care and interest."
"I am deputy chairman of the delegation to Slovakia, and we were in Slovakia last week."
"Our programme included, among other things, a visit to the 'green frontier', the Ukrainian border near Kosice, where we saw that a very large number of refugees, especially from Afghanistan, were crossing the border, probably not with a peaceful purpose; it is estimated that 10% - 30% could have other activities in mind - of a terrorist or military nature, for example."
"So I wish to ask the Commission and the Council, as a matter of urgency, to do everything possible to secure our borders, in particular, by immediately using the pre-accession support framework to make available the necessary apparatus on the borders that candidate States share with States not in the EU."
"We are talking here about basic equipment such as night vision devices and motor vehicles, so that these frontiers can be better watched with immediate effect."
"Secondly, the Committee concerned itself intensively with problems in connection with the support provided by the PHARE programmes and with the Toth case."
"The Committee decided, from both a Slovakian and a European standpoint, not to put funds in reserve."
"In Slovakia, the inevitable conclusions were reached."
"The deputy prime minister with responsibility for this has resigned, which represents the political outcome."
"The director dealing with the case has also resigned - a replacement has been appointed - and, in addition, the Slovak parliament has just passed a new law on financial monitoring and internal auditing."
"So we will, I am sure, be able to take these funds out of the reserve by Second Reading."
"Mr President, I just want to raise two points this evening at the same time as praising the rapporteur for the very sensible and courteous manner in which he has run the budget in advance of next year."
"My first point is addressed to the Commissioner and concerns B-1 items where the Commission pays an enormous amount of money for subsidies for growing rice, bananas and the distillation of wine."
"These are items I would have thought we were by now starting to reduce the payments for."
"I would ask her to look at them."
"I tabled many amendments amounting to hundreds of millions of euros."
"I hope that rather than compulsory expenditure like that, being left to grow year by year, it should be looked at very closely."
"Perhaps I could ask her to do that in advance of future budgets."
"The other matter is a perennial matter which comes up each year: the European women's lobby and finance for women's organisations generally."
"We tabled an amendment, and so did Mrs Avilés Perea of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, to say that the money that is voted for lobby organisations for women following the Beijing conference should not all go, as it has for many years, to the European Women's lobby."
"I know many of my colleagues in the Chamber receive all sorts of letters and e-mails from around Europe saying it all must go to this one organisation."
"This is wrong, we need to encourage new organisations in this very important field."
"It is right and proper that the amendment that was put forward by the United Kingdom delegation was in fact passed."
"This made it clear, in the remarks column, that one organisation, any single organisation within that spending line should not get more than 65%."
"I trust that the approved amendment will be held to when the budget comes out."
"I thank the Commissioner for her consideration."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Costa Neves for his efforts on behalf of all of us in this procedure and to say that it is a very technical and difficult task he took on: he has discharged it with great skill and shown much patience and kindness to all of us who wanted our ideas taken into consideration."
"I have not known a Commissioner who has followed the proceedings so closely or who has spent so much time with the Committee on Budgets as the present Commissioner."
"Of course, in many ways this is a highly technical exercise and, unlike national budgets, it does not have much effect on the course of economic development in the European Union."
"It is too small for that, even in the area of Structural Funds, for even the most generous beneficiaries receive a very small percentage of GNP."
"Ireland, at the best, was getting 2%, Portugal and the poorer areas of Spain are getting between 1% and 2% of GNP."
"It is not a very generous outlay of money, but if we can use it in order to guide their economic policies in the direction that we think is best, then the money can be usefully spent."
"There is one idea and one hope that I have always entertained."
"I believe I said some years ago that compared to national parliaments we were like children playing shop."
"The amount of resources at our disposal is so small and there is so little we can do with them, but there is one area that I would like to see developed."
"I do not want to see an expansion of public spending at European level."
"But in the area of economic cooperation and development, if we could only pool at European level the resources which the countries of the European Union and the European Union itself devote to international cooperation and development cooperation, we could convert individual national efforts into a common European effort without increasing the sum of taxation."
"This is essential if we are to develop a common foreign and security policy."
"I believe we could have a much greater impact on the development of the poorer countries and redirect our foreign policy in a way that we could help the poor, help to establish peace and give us real influence in the world."
"If there is one area in which we should demand subsidiarity from the national states to the European Union, it is here."
"Mr President, as in previous years, this debate is characterised by two elements which we could describe as endemic."
"One relates to the general amounts and the other to the deficiencies in the rules on budgetary management."
"Our differences on each of the spending categories are clear and I am not going to go into the detail."
"Commissioner, representatives of the Council, we need the budget to be an effective and credible tool which works for employment, for research, for support for small businesses and for the construction of a genuine area of justice and security."
"Parliament has shown flexibility and austerity in this procedure and it is therefore in a position to ask the Council not to be politically autocratic and to show unequivocal signs that it is prepared to negotiate."
"I trust that you will take advantage of the flexibility demonstrated by our rapporteur, Carlos Costa, whose work - as well as the efforts of the other two rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen - deserves to be congratulated."
"With regard to the resources intended for external Union action, we demand that this Parliament' s undeniable political objectives are guaranteed, and these include providing resources for areas which are essential to world balance, such as the Mediterranean and Latin America."
"In this procedure, the Commission proposes using the flexibility instrument to finance the restructuring of the Community fleets which fished in the area of the defunct fisheries agreement with Morocco."
"This decision is fair, technically correct and necessary."
"It deals with a very serious problem which affects employment and a key activity of many regions, and which arises in a context of crisis."
"We must remember that we are about to implement a new common fisheries policy which has been dogged by intolerable discrimination for decades when compared to other economic activities, from the point of view of internal market rules."
"As for budgetary management, this Parliament has repeatedly condemned the Commission' s inability to put an end to the problem of the so-called anomalous RAL."
"In this respect, we have produced a good strategy, which our rapporteur has mentioned, which is closely related to the reform of the Commission."
"We must bear in mind that in the last three financial years very high payments were not used."
"We must therefore find rules which work, methods which allow faster implementation and rules which shorten the cycle of projects."
"As the last speaker, I hope that the Commission and the Council obey the evangelical maxim when it comes to paying attention and that the last are put first, not only in the Kingdom of Heaven, but also here in Parliament."
"Mr President, I will pass on your answer to the chairman of the Committee on Budgets."
"He had asked me to wait for it."
"On a personal note, I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to our President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Vande Lanotte, above all, who has been here with us throughout the whole of the discussions on the Budget."
"Things like that do not happen all the time."
"So, without wishing to seem presumptuous, I would again like to express my most heartfelt thanks to you, not only for showing us so much respect, but also for demonstrating your interest in working with us."
"Many thanks!"
"Thank you very much, Mr Walter, for such a constructive point of order."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10.00 a.m."
"EIB: Community guarantee against lending losses"
". (FI) Mr President, the European Union has an easy way of helping other countries: the European Investment Bank receives guarantees for loans it grants to other countries."
"The recipients of loans benefit from the EU guarantees in the form of interest rates that are lower than market rates."
"This is also the case here as we are debating a loan guarantee in respect of loans granted by the EIB to Russia for environmental investments."
"The maximum amount of credit is envisaged as 100 million euros."
"The bank is imposing the criteria according to which the loans are to be granted."
"If Russia fails to propose projects that fulfil the bank' s criteria the loans will not have to be granted."
"This is a new, positive initiative that will put new life into the notion of the EU' s northern dimension, which has become rather anaemic."
"The loans will be used to try to improve the state of the environment throughout the Baltic region and, eventually, therefore, the Member States of the EU also."
"Parliament has not called into question the matter of loans to Russia."
"The proposal has the broadest possible political support."
"Problems have nonetheless been caused by the way in which the Council and the Commission are taking the matter further."
"In the summer, the Commission submitted a proposal to Parliament that the loan guarantees should be issued in the same way as other EIB loans guaranteed by the EU, and that the guarantee in question should be 65%."
"That is still the only proposal that the Commission has submitted to Parliament."
"The Council, however, decided later to take exceptional action and insisted on adopting a full 100% guarantee in respect of the loan to Russia, rather than one of 65%."
"Russia has therefore been treated differently from other recipients of EU loan guarantees."
"The Commission endorsed the Council' s proposal, but it has not submitted a new proposal on the matter to Parliament."
"Consequently, we, in Parliament, are debating the Commission' s original proposal for a 65% loan guarantee."
"Parliament demanded a new round of consultations as a result of the revised proposal."
"After all manner of talks with representatives of the Council and the Commission we have received a letter from the Council that may, with a little goodwill on our part, be interpreted as a rehearing of the Parliament."
"The Commission also has indicated in writing that it has approved the 100% guarantee."
"As this is a deviation from the general rule, the Committee on Budgets would have liked to have an entirely new proposal from the Commission."
"The Commission said it could not submit one in time."
"In this case 'in time' means it would be most beneficial to all parties if a decision could be taken on the issue this year."
"There is a ceiling for EU loan guarantees, which is formed by a special Guarantee Fund."
"Funds are gradually transferred to it from the Guarantee Reserves as guarantee commitments are made."
"This year the ceiling is 208 million euros."
"The guarantees in respect of the loans to Russia fit into this year' s envelope even though the 100% guarantee takes a larger part of it than a 65% guarantee would."
"A decision is needed this year, as there are so many commitments for next year that there will be no room then at all in the Guarantee Fund for new guarantees - not for loans for environmental investments in Russia either, which is the case here."
"It would take consensus on the part of all the EU institutions to raise the ceiling for guarantees and it is not always a simple matter to achieve that."
"If, therefore, we want to ensure that the EIB loans will be used for Russia' s Baltic Sea basin environment, it is best to take the decision this year."
"The Committee on Budgets has been ready for it, even though the action of the Council and the Commission cannot be deemed to be completely appropriate."
"Thus, the committee is working on the principle that there should be no precedent set here and that similar matters should not be dealt with in this way in the future."
"Parliament insists that account also be taken of the priorities it has set."
"As the permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees in the Committee on Budgets, I would like once more to draw attention to the fact that next year there will be no margin whatsoever in the Guarantee Funds for new and unexpected aid actions."
"The Commission must take action accordingly."
"Mr President, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy warmly supports the Council' s decision to grant a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under a lending action for environmental projects in the Baltic Sea basin of Russia."
"We feel considerable unease faced with the environmental situation in that area, which is in immediate proximity to the European Union."
"We believe that environmental investment in that area is required urgently and, in certain cases, even as an emergency measure."
"We note that the European Investment Bank has already begun negotiations concerning participation in projects for dealing with waste water from St Petersburg and Kaliningrad."
"It is important that the problems in these areas should be solved as soon as possible."
"There is also reason for pointing out that environmental investment in this area can be more effective than many other investments within the Community and that major positive effects on health and the environment can be achieved for people in the European Union."
"We, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, can therefore warmly support the proposal tabled."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the draftsman and express my support for Mr Seppänen' s report."
"In certain parts of the immediate surroundings of the European Union, the environmental problems are genuinely alarming, especially when it comes to the water in the Baltic."
"EU countries are naturally affected just as much by these problems as large parts of Russia, Poland, Kaliningrad etc. To obtain clear water in the Baltic, it is crucial for us to cooperate across borders."
"I, myself, live in an administrative district on the Baltic, Norrköping, where one of the greatest problems we have when it comes to water quality is that we still receive so much untreated waste from the candidate countries and from Russia."
"This is a very big problem for the EU Member States too."
"We know, for example, that untreated waste water from 3-4 million people in the St Petersburg region is still being released and that the situation around Kaliningrad is much the same."
"Such conditions affect us all."
"In order to develop this region and to get to grips with the major problems, especially at a specifically environmental level, we have created the Northern Dimension, covering a very large area from Iceland in the west to Russia in the east."
"Restoring the balance in the Baltic is a measure to which exceptional priority should be given."
"The matter is urgent, and that is why I am pleased that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has also expressed its wishes."
"For myself, coming as I do from the Committee on Budgets, it is also a question of presenting the financial aspects of this proposal."
"From the Committee on Budgets, we should like to sound a warning note in this House."
"The guarantee reserve that exists to cover possible credit losses is seriously stretched, both this year and next year."
"The scope for this loan to Russia is really created simply through our not successfully implementing other commitments."
"We have had to postpone other promised projects. Otherwise, we should not have managed to grant this loan within the framework that had been set."
"If we are neither to renege on our promises in the future nor to give up our new ambitions, the Council and the Commission will therefore have to review the guarantee reserve ceiling relatively soon."
"The situation is slightly reminiscent of the discussion we had in the budget debate earlier about the fact that the Council is happy to issue promises but then does not arrange satisfactory financing."
"I should therefore like to ask Mr Solbes Mira what the Commission' s plans are when it comes to tabling proposals concerning the future of the guarantee reserve."
"I assume the Commissioner agrees that there is a lot of pressure upon the ceiling for this reserve."
"Commissioner, Mr Arvidsson, I can agree with everything that you, Mr Arvidsson, said about the importance and environmental significance of this decision."
"We also know that the decision we are now discussing probably concerns the most important individual position to emerge from the meeting of the European Council in Stockholm."
"I would again point out that it is the north coast of the Bay of Finland that has to receive all the waste from St Petersburg, something which leads to a particularly high degree of algal bloom."
"I therefore wish to declare that I have a major interest in this issue and that the waste water from 3.5 million people has a very profound effect upon the environment and archipelago in my native Finland."
"We have set a ceiling of EUR 100 million."
"These funds are to be used for selected projects which have clear environmental objectives and are also of considerable interest to the EU."
"I believe that this is one of the critical points, if account is taken of what emerged from the discussion yesterday at the meeting of the Northern Dimension in Finland."
"One Russian minister said that there is criticism of the selection criteria and wants international funding organisations to play a larger part in the project planning."
"At the same time, we know that the budget of the North West Sewage Treatment Works has significantly exceeded Finland' s and the Nordic Investment Bank' s estimates."
"I believe we must give a one hundred per cent guarantee."
"I do not believe that EUR 100 million will solve the problem."
"We know that the Russian Federation does not give guarantees and that the guarantees of the city of St Petersburg are completely used up."
"I, therefore, appeal to my fellow MEPs to show solidarity on this issue."
"Give a one hundred per cent guarantee for this project."
"It would be in our interests, and we should be gradually paving the way for greater environmental awareness in St Petersburg, something to which we must always be attentive."
"The situation is significantly more complicated than Mrs Wallström imagines."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Parliament for its willingness to adopt a report on this special instrument within the Union' s Northern Dimension."
"This will provide a Community guarantee for EIB loans, to a value of EUR 100 million, for the purposes of environmental projects in Russia, as you have pointed out."
"As you know, this decision was adopted in a very specific way."
"This is the first time that financial operations in Russia have been accepted and the operation is not only of interest to Russia but also to the bordering Union countries."
"The Commission had proposed the 65% guarantee normally considered for this type of operation laid down in the general mandate of the European Investment Bank."
"However, we know that the Council, for a series of reasons relating to the unique nature of this operation and the need for greater transparency, suggested that in this case a special Community guarantee of 100% was required."
"The urgency of the use of resources this year has led the Commission to accept this 100%."
"I do not exactly know the procedural problems which have led to the information reaching Parliament excessively late, but, according to my information, the Council informed Parliament on 20 September of the amendments under consideration, on 12 October the Belgian Presidency explained the changes in greater detail and, on the same day, the Commission sent the Committee on Budgets information on the reasons why we were accepting the Council' s amendments."
"With the unanimous decision of the Council and with the Commission' s acceptance, there was no need for the Commission to present a new proposal."
"We believe that it is urgent to approve this decision during 2001 for the same reasons you have raised."
"A delay until 2002 would clearly hinder funding given the narrow margin for manoeuvre we have for next year."
"However, this decision is not going to affect any other type of operation."
"In his report, Mr Seppänen made references to other fundings: the Turkish case is the most obvious, coming from the 2000 contributions."
"Actions in 2000 and 2001 have already been financed and problems of this nature do not arise."
"However, another longer-term problem does arise: how are we going to handle the funding capacity of the European Investment Bank within our lending mechanism?"
"Mr Färm also asked what we intended to do as a Commission."
"I wanted to tell you firstly that the Commission is grateful to Parliament for raising this problem of the limited capacity for indebtedness that we have within the mechanism of the Guarantee Fund."
"The Commission has already raised this problem in the Council and also here in Parliament on various occasions, and we believe that, if there are new initiatives in the context of 2002, current problems will become more serious and it will be essential to take certain decisions."
"The Commission is currently weighing up various options and we intend to approve an initiative relatively soon by means of a Communication which we will send to the Council and to Parliament."
"I cannot respond to Mr Färm by indicating which option we are considering at the moment but I can point out that in the past we proposed a reduction in the level of coverage from 65% to 60%."
"This could be one of the instruments, like any other which may be necessary, for creating a greater margin for manoeuvre in future actions."
"This is what I can tell you at the moment and I would like to thank you for your cooperation in the debate on this report."
"Thank you very much, Mr Solbes."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"EBRD: Community contribution to Chernobyl Shelter Fund"
"Mr President, as we all remember, the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl occurred on 16 April 1986 and it is still history' s most serious nuclear accident."
"Radioactive contamination affected people and nature over vast areas in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, and, furthermore, some present EU countries also suffered."
"Around the destroyed unit a nuclear shelter was constructed hastily, given the conditions, to halt the spread of the pollution."
"Inside the deteriorating shelter there are still more than 200 tons of uranium and almost a ton of radionuclides, of which 80% is plutonium."
"The Chernobyl Shelter Fund was set up in December 1997 to finance the Shelter Implementation Plan, whose purpose it is to protect people and the environment from any new radioactive contamination."
"The preliminary estimate of the cost of the project for the period 1998 - 2005 was around USD 758 million."
"The first conference of the parties funding the project was held in New York in November 1997."
"A total of USD 400 million was obtained in the form of pledges from twenty-five countries, of which USD 50 million was payment in kind from Ukraine."
"This sum was sufficient for the first stage of the Shelter Implementation Plan."
"The European Union at the start financed the shelter work with a payment of USD 100 million, which was pledged at the Denver Summit in 1997."
"This amount came out of the general budget for 1998 - 1999."
"A second pledging conference was held in Berlin in July 2000 to organise a final contribution to the scheme."
"At that conference 22 countries in all decided to pledge around USD 320 million and the European Union pledged a further EUR 100 million for the period 2001 - 2004."
"The report being discussed concerns a proposal for a Council decision on a second contribution by the European Community to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund."
"The matter before us is thus Parliament' s opinion on the adoption of this regulation."
"The current financial situation is as follows. In all, USD 716 million has been pledged to the Chernobyl Shelter Fund and this includes USD 50 million from Ukraine as an in-kind contribution."
"Consequently, the fund still lacks money, as the estimate of costs is rather higher, totalling at least USD 720 - 750 million."
"For this reason - as this issue is being taken forward - it must be assumed and expected that Ukraine will also be able to organise this second contribution of funds."
"The problem here is that the budgetary authority in 1998 set a 13% ceiling regarding the use of TACIS appropriations in respect of nuclear safety projects."
"If this were to apply, the decisions could not be taken at present in the way the Commission and the Council have proposed."
"However, I support the Commission' s proposal to set aside EUR 100 million for the Chernobyl Shelter Fund as this project' s implementation is of vital importance to the people of the European Union and their safety."
"I also support the Commission' s proposal that there should be a special budget heading created for it so that the way in which the funds are being used can be monitored."
"Clearly, it will be difficult to use these funds as people will be working in difficult conditions in which there is a huge number of international players and where the situation is to some extent still vague in the administration of the Confederation of Independent States."
"All in all, I would nevertheless support this Council proposal, with certain amendments."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of the PSE Group in support of the Virrankoski report, which gives Parliament the go-ahead to grant a further contribution - as the rapporteur himself explained - to complete the Chernobyl Shelter."
"I endorse Mr Virrankoski' s reasons for his choice and, in particular, I endorse the European Union' s decision to contribute practically to creating safe conditions in the wake of the 1986 disaster."
"The European Union has been the largest donor by far, not just as regards Chernobyl but also with regard to safety and preventing the nuclear contamination of the Newly Independent States."
"We were right to do this: none of us can forget the 1986 disaster and nobody is yet fully aware of the devastating effects it has caused and, I regret to say, may still cause."
"As Mr Virrankoski pointed out, the tomb of Chernobyl still contains 200 tonnes of uranium and a tonne of plutonium, which represent a permanent danger which might - and I stress, might - also be a prime target for traffickers."
"However, this was and is still a transparent, legitimate choice in legal terms: indeed, the new Tacis regulation states that the contribution to the initiatives supported by the European Union, such as the initiative on the closure of Chernobyl, will be one of the nuclear safety priorities."
"In conclusion, this was and is, above all, something which the European Union has a duty towards the new generations to do."
"Mr President, I wish to address two points - first the political dimension and, secondly, the issue of cost-effectiveness and control by Parliament."
"As far as the political dimension is concerned, the Chernobyl disaster showed us that the use of nuclear energy involves risks beyond our control."
"No national budget can cope with such a calamity."
"At present, then, discussion is limited to the securing of the casing, which is urgently needed."
"This is only a fraction of the money needed to deal with the disaster as a whole."
"Neither the contamination of the soil and of the water underground, nor the harm done to the health of the population are capable of being dealt with within the Ukrainian budget, and it is in a situation like this that, for reasons beyond my understanding, aid from the EU runs out."
"This means that these problems will remain unresolved for generations to come."
"It might be added that no Western state budget - even that of a rich Western state - could cope with such a catastrophe without international aid."
"This report therefore meets with the unreserved support of us Greens and regionalists."
"We do not believe, though, that this will be the last contribution towards overcoming the after-effects of Chernobyl, which will be a financial burden on East and West for generations."
"This report therefore invites the question: would it not be a practical preventive measure to at last bring in a European strategy for abandoning nuclear energy?"
"The question also arises of whether the nuclear industry itself ought to be compelled to contribute to a fund to help deal with the disaster, for it, now as then, derives profit from East European nuclear energy."
"My second point is that it seems to us that the solution for implementation is not the European Development Bank, which guarantees neither control by Parliament nor affordable solutions, for Ukrainian firms are not considered when it comes to applying the resources."
"We therefore urge the Commission to avail itself of all sources of information, and not only the Development Bank, in order to supply Parliament with comprehensive and up to date information."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Virrankoski, and also Mr Pittella and Mrs Schroedter for their comments."
"Given the threat to the environment throughout Europe posed by the current state of Chernobyl, it is clearly extremely important that the shelter project, or protection system, continues to be corrected, is completed and fulfils its objectives between now and 2007, as was the intention with the initial project of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development."
"To this end, the contribution of the European Union is essential."
"You have said, quite rightly, that the scale of the disaster makes funding by a single country impossible."
"According to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the promised contribution now amounts to approximately USD 720 million, and therefore, also according to the Bank' s assessments, the intended timetable and costs can be met, even though certain secondary activities may be delayed."
"Furthermore, certain important steps have already been taken, such as the most urgent stabilisation work, which, undoubtedly, were a great concern."
"The Commission is monitoring the application of the implementation programme for shelter and is attending the meetings of the assemblies of contributors."
"We have already presented a second situation report, in accordance with Council Decision 98/381/EC, and also in accordance with the guidelines contained in the report by Mr Gordon Adams on the first contribution."
"In this respect, I would like to reassure Mrs Schroedter and point out that we will keep her informed."
"We will keep Parliament informed."
"It is true that the EBRD is not subject to Parliament' s control, but the Commission will keep Parliament informed of all activities which are being carried out by means of Union funds."
"With regard to the proposals of the Committee on Budgets, the Commission believes both proposals to be acceptable, and that they enrich the Commission' s proposal."
"I would, therefore, like to thank you for your contributions and for the work you have done on this issue, which is essential in preventing the risks that could have arisen in addition to the already serious effects we have suffered as a result of the Chernobyl disaster, that Mr Virrankoski has expressed so well in his initial presentation."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you for your contribution, Commissioner."
"We hope that you can re-gather your strength and be back with us at 11 p.m."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"ESF (2000 - 2006)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0328/2001) by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Communication from the Commission on the implementation of innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund Regulation for the programming period 2000-2006 (COM(2000) 894 - C5-0341/2001 - 2001/2141(COS))."
"rapporteur. (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the concept of innovation is increasingly present in our objectives and policies at European and national level."
"However, we have a unique opportunity, within the framework of the Commission communication on innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund, to approach innovation in the strategy for employment, rather than solely within the bounds of the application of new technologies."
"In fact, innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund can play a vital role in increasing employment and enhancing regional and social cohesion, the sine qua non to our strategic objectives, and we must not just make use of them, we must also take action to make up for lost time and lost resources, because the guidelines for innovative measures were only finally adopted a full year after the adoption of the structural fund regulations, which made delays in implementation unavoidable."
"And, apart from limited funding, resources totalling EUR 104 million have been cut from innovative measures and technical assistance in order to cover old liabilities from the previous programming period."
"Similarly, despite the swingeing cuts in these resources, the Commission failed to commit some EUR 31 million during the 2000 financial year and allowed these appropriations to be cancelled instead of transferring them to the following financial year."
"Today, we wish to express our satisfaction at the fact that the European Commission has responded to the call by the European Parliament for a new plan on the content of innovation, how it is to be managed, how the measures implemented are to be evaluated and the strategy for disseminating the results."
"However, we also wish to express our concern as to the efficiency of this proposal, which is vaguely worded and riddled with weaknesses."
"We understand, Commissioner, that innovation is a multidimensional, composite concept and, as such, hard to define and confine to specific sectors or lines of action."
"At the same time, we find that there has been no fundamental evaluation of previous innovative actions, which could have provided a basis for future planning."
"We also find that social partners and social agencies are lacking in experience and face difficulties in their attempt to approach this concept and design innovative measures."
"That is why we propose that the European Commission should adopt fixed criteria to be taken into account in fixing support priorities for and selecting projects and to state them clearly in calls for proposals."
"These criteria are: the direct relevance of projects when it comes to increasing employment, really innovative features as regards the planning and implementation of the measure, the quality and viability of the measure and the potential for the circulation and dissemination of the results within the framework of the European Social Fund."
"The European Commission is also vague on the question of complementarity."
"Complementarity in European policy is extremely important to the sound management of resources and their multiplier effect."
"The importance of complementarity is clear from this morning's debate."
"However, I believe, Commissioner, that complementarity should under no circumstances mean that innovative measures will lose their specific and distinctive character, nor should it mean the deletion of budget lines referring to related but separate sectors of activities."
"The description of thematic fields is also vague, especially when it comes to the social partners."
"The social partners have an important role to play."
"We all support it but they themselves are ignorant of it."
"They themselves are ignorant both of the potential which European policy affords them and of the extent of their responsibility for creating a real European job market and increasing employment at local level."
"We need to help them, perhaps with some clearer guidelines and examples."
"It would be more helpful as regards the substance of innovative measures if, when defining the thematic fields for 2002 and subsequent years, the European Commission consulted the European Parliament and the Committee on the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee before announcing the thematic sectors."
"We particularly welcome your reference, Commissioner, to equal opportunities and believe that this principle should distinguish not just how men and women are treated but also access to the policy on innovative measures by regions which lack innovation and face particular structural problems, such as mountain and island regions."
"If we believe that a quantum leap beyond our standard policies is needed in this sector of activity by the European Social Fund, then this also needs to be expressed in the policy for evaluating and disseminating results."
"We believe that the European Commission should design pioneering methods which are more penetrating and efficient than those applied to date."
"Setting up a special unit to manage innovative measures is a good move and we hope that it will be suitably staffed by officials who can help it carry out its duties."
"Of course, your efforts alone will not suffice and the Member States must not be left out of this process."
"The dissemination of information and technical assistance for interested parties need to be promoted through specially staffed units operating in an optimum manner at regional level."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this report on the implementation of innovative measures laid down in the European Social Fund, which has been so well produced by the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, considers innovative measures and pilot projects on a European level relating to labour markets, professional employment and training, study, exchange of experience and also Community dialogue, which is an extremely important instrument for the creation of jobs and social cohesion."
"The priority objective of the European Union, as laid down at the Lisbon Summit, is to turn the European Union into the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic development, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion."
"This objective, which we all wish to achieve, demands innovative measures to integrate groups with special difficulties into the labour market."
"Notable in this respect is the need to maintain the objective of equal opportunities, since the presence of women in the labour market is still insufficient."
"The partnership between the different actors in the economy, as well as the choice of issues to be tackled, will help to achieve the proposed objective. Thank you very much."
"Mr President, this Commission communication is for the most part disappointing, especially because it lacks a clear, concise description of the substance of the intended innovation."
"Precisely this defect can prove detrimental to the effectiveness of the Regulation."
"From the point of view of subsidiarity, these innovative actions are to be called into question."
"What is the specific added value which these actions should yield?"
"In this respect, the communication is bogged down in vague descriptions."
"There is thus a major risk of the Commission backing useful actions which would also be implemented without ESF subsidy because national or local authorities have already recognised their usefulness."
"The fact that there is still no assessment report on the innovative actions in the previous programming period (1994-1999) should ring alarm bells with the budgetary authority."
"Furthermore, the Commission has planned considerable economy measures for the period 2000-2006."
"Can the Commissioner indicate the reason for these measures?"
"And can the Commissioner also explain why the assessment report is still pending, and when it will be submitted to us?"
"I share the critical tone of the report."
"A weak area in the report is the pursuit of a European labour market."
"This is still pie in the sky, given the language barriers, cultural differences and the different national systems for taxes, social security and pensions."
"Europe' s most important trait is its diversity, and that is why Europe cannot be compared to the United States of America."
"Experiences with ESF subsidies in the Netherlands indicate that it has been unclear on more than one occasion as to what can and cannot be subsidised."
"According to the Dutch Court of Auditors, this is partly due to the loose and opaque wording of EU legislation."
"Even if a conflict of interest is unlikely in connection with support for innovative actions, I still wonder if the present communication has been tested sufficiently for the risk of exploitation and improper use."
"I should like to congratulate Mrs Kratsa on her report on innovative measures under Article 6 and to agree, both with Mrs Kratsa and the other speakers, that there are two basic issues in which we share an interest."
"The first is optimising the application of Article 6 and the second is having the best, most efficient relations between the European Parliament and the Commission."
"As far as the application of Article 6 is concerned, the unit which deals solely with Article 6 was created, staffed and started operating in December 2000."
"This means that we were able to focus on implementing it and we have made satisfactory progress."
"The first stage of the programme has already been announced with the call for proposals on the subject of adapting to the new economy within the framework of social dialogue."
"This was announced in February 2001."
"A second call for proposals on the subject of local strategies for employment and innovation is also ready and is due to be published at the end of October."
"The first call was a complete success."
"A large number of transnational plans was received in which social partners, trades unions and employers, as well as local authorities and companies played a very important part."
"The evaluation of these plans was strengthened at the European Parliament's request and now we do not just evaluate each plan individually, we also evaluate the measures as a whole so that we can assess their complementarity."
"I must say that particular account was taken in the calls for proposals of the 4 points on which Parliament also focused."
"As far as working with Parliament is concerned, I can tell you that we are about to officially submit the first report on the implementation of the previous Article 6 period which is now ready - a copy has already been sent to Mrs Kratsa through official channels - and the communication makes provision for an annual report from the European Social Fund to the European Parliament on the application of Article 6."
"The first of these reports is being drafted and should be submitted to you within the next few months."
"Of course, there are other ways of working together and exchanging more views."
"I think that Article 6 and its implementation could be a special item for the joint parliamentary and Commission committee on the European Social Fund, but there are other fora in which views can be exchanged."
"One of these is due to take place on 18 December and everyone in charge of the social dialogue plans selected will be invited. Naturally we hope Parliament will also attend."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Equal treatment for men and women in employment"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0358/2001), by Mrs Hautala, on behalf of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, on a Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and working conditions (9848/1/2001 - C5-0387/2001 - 2000/0142(COD))."
"Mr President, in this second reading I would like to present a legal report that is broad in scale."
"Its purpose is to bring up to date the European Union' s most important directive regarding equality at work, which was originally enacted in 1976."
"Society has changed a great deal in a quarter of a century, so the Committee has worked hard to bring all the issues being raised in modern times to this report."
"I would like to thank my colleagues and the other political groups for the intensive, fruitful co-operation we have had prior to this second reading also."
"Firstly, for the first time, the Commission has proposed binding action for the Member States to adopt in order to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace."
"Up till now there have just been recommendations and there have been very different practices among the various Member States."
"Now the European Parliament is repeating its demand, which the Council has not approved, that the Member States should oblige employers to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace."
"The Committee has found that a certain system that may be very useful in preventing and remedying damage resulting from sexual harassment is that each workplace should have a confidential counsellor people can turn to in such cases."
"Another important issue is that the directive seeks to strengthen rights associated with maternity, adoption and parenthood in general and to protect mothers in particular - but also fathers - from the sort of discrimination shown to young parents."
"Every day we hear examples of how employers still ask young women whether they intend to have children in the next few years, and this is how a very large number of people seeking employment might become the victims of serious discrimination."
"This has already been illegal in the past but this discrimination must still be absolutely prevented."
"The European Parliament is proposing that this directive will serve to bring this about once and for all."
"This also covers the issue whereby a person must have the right to return to the same job, or at least a similar one, and with the same terms and conditions of employment, after a period of maternity leave, for example."
"As rapporteur, I have tabled an amendment in which I also want to emphasise that the unfavourable treatment of fathers must be declared to be discrimination forbidden under this directive."
"It is absolutely vital that Parliament tomorrow adopts the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and some groups, in which both fathers and mothers are protected and which refer, for example, to exercising the right to parental leave, so that discrimination cannot take place. We all understand how important co-ordinating work and family life is for young families and our children too."
"It is excellent to see that recently the Commission has also realised that day care is an important matter and that it will be possible in this way to raise the employment rate for women to that for men in order to increase the number of employees."
"That obviously does not happen unless there is a good system of day care."
"This directive does not lay down legal provision for new rights, but seeks to protect those who want to exercise their rights - both fathers and mothers - from discrimination at work."
"Parliament is proposing that the plans for equality in the workplace be adopted."
"This is a very strategic proposal, as equality must be actively and systematically promoted at grassroots level, in other words, where people work."
"It has been a joy to see that employers' organisations have also actually approved this idea."
"I hope that we will get wide support for this proposal."
"I would like to thank the Commission for its very constructive attitude."
"I believe that, united, we will see a decision taken on this directive soon."
"If the Council does not approve all Parliament' s proposals legislative conciliation may be begun very swiftly."
"Mr President, there is a German proverb that says good things are worth waiting for."
"However, I remain to be convinced, especially now that I have heard what the rapporteur had to say, that everything will turn out for the best in tomorrow's vote on the recommendation for a second reading on the directive amending the important 1976 directive."
"I honestly have to say that the progressive Council common position came as a pleasant surprise after the botched first reading in this House, which my group had very little to do with."
"I could even have lived with the text proposed by the Council."
"We could have avoided the risks of having too many new amendments at this stage and wasting valuable time on laborious negotiations on resolutions."
"But that was not to be, since the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities once again failed to recognise the truism that the better is the enemy of the good."
"Because of our persistence, Mrs Ghilardotti and I, the spokespersons of the two major groups in this House, which are needed to muster 314 votes, have succeeded in persuading the rapporteur not to table yet more superfluous amendments which really give women out there very little except semantic self-opionatedness and confused ideology."
"We now have before us a number of new amendments from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, to which the rapporteur belongs."
"This directive is one of the EU's most important pieces of legislation."
"It needs to be clear and legally tenable."
"Above all, it should not be overloaded with excessive verbiage that really has no place in a legal text which will have to be interpreted by the judges of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg."
"Those judges to whom I have read the newly tabled definitions of harassment and sexual harassment in the workplace are totally horrified."
"In particular, I wish to emphasise that the Council has recognised men's right to paternity leave."
"We really had to use our powers of persuasion to convince the rapporteur not to include in the text the idea that not only any discrimination against women but also against men in connection with pregnancy or maternity should be regarded as discrimination in the context of this directive."
"However, we ultimately succeeded in making it clear that men can still not become pregnant and accordingly cannot give birth!"
"At the last moment, the rapporteur - who tabled an amendment contrary to the agreement we had reached - wanted to reinsert a provision to the effect that discrimination against men and women in the context of reconciling family and career duties counts as discrimination for the purposes of the directive."
"This would have no benefit at all, apart from encouraging litigation, and especially litigation advocated by people who exploit woolly provisions of this kind."
"Many of us still have problems with legal actions taken by associations and the requirement for employers to produce complicated annual reports and statistics."
"Then I would like to mention equal pay."
"There is a directive dating from 1975 on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value."
"That directive is certainly in need of improvement, but in its own context and not this one."
"We are calling on the Member States to take measures to ensure that employers promote equal pay for equal work in a planned and systematic way."
"That is mistaken for a number of reasons."
"First of all, there is the autonomy of the two sides of industry - the employers and the unions."
"In this context, any demand that employers should promote equal pay for equal work would fall short of the provisions of the 1975 equal pay directive."
"There is a French proverb that says 'Superflue, chose très nécessaire' ."
"However, that does not apply to legislative texts."
"I hope that in the interests of equal treatment of men and women we will concentrate on the essentials and eliminate anything superfluous when we vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, for her willingness to take into account the considerations and the work of all the political groups."
"The report she is tabling today and upon which we are to vote tomorrow shows that Parliament has focused on the most important points, which will improve the common position, in order to achieve the adoption of the amendments to the directive with all speed."
"Although the common position recognised Parliament' s position at first reading on a precise definition of direct and indirect discrimination - which we welcome - we feel that it is necessary - and this is an important amendment - to provide precise definitions of harassment, sexual harassment and the procedures for combating it, including preventive measures."
"We also feel that it is important to keep our amendment reducing the derogations provided for by the Commission and the Council in respect of the implementation of the directive, and that it is necessary to reinforce protection of maternity and paternity rights, including in cases of adoption, providing effective safeguards against discrimination against parents using the rights they are entitled to."
"There is one point which I am sure will be discussed in conciliation, for the Commission too expressed reservations regarding this point in its amended position, and it is the provision for positive measures laying down specific advantages."
"We felt that it was important to include them because that consolidates the provisions of the Treaty."
"Another important point which we feel should still be included is the laying down of effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, leaving it to the Member States to identify procedures, an issue which we have also addressed in other debates in this very Chamber and which we endorsed with the vote on the report on information and consultation."
"Moreover, it is necessary to make clear, as we have done, the concept of protection for victims, the extension of this protection to trade union representatives and the need for the bodies created to apply the principle of equality to be provided with adequate resources so that they can lend appropriate legal and other assistance to the victims of gender discrimination."
"We must also clarify the provision made for collective action to be brought in the event of breaches of the directive and the requirement for employees to draw up equal opportunities plans."
"The Socialist Group will vote for all the amendments adopted in committee."
"Regrettably, however, I have to tell the rapporteur that we do not support the two amendments she tabled together with the Liberals and the GUE, not so much as regards the content as because we feel they do not achieve anything substantial in legislative terms and, on the contrary, inappropriately go against the compromise reached, which I hope will be confirmed tomorrow with a very wide majority in this House to give us more power in conciliation."
"Mr President, the rapporteur has made every effort to reach consensus."
"She therefore deserves all credit for the emphatic result that is now before us."
"Many necessary improvements have been made to the measures against sexual intimidation and in connection with adoption leave and a woman' s right to return to her old job after maternity leave."
"If the Commission and the Council are serious about the equal treatment of men and women, they would do well to adopt all these amendments."
"I was astonished to find out from my Christian-Democratic counterparts that pregnancy is a purely female issue."
"On the contrary: it is of the utmost importance for men to be given the opportunity to be more involved in the new life that they have helped create."
"The joint amendment that is before us does not create new rights."
"We simply do not want men who wish to make use of their existing national rights, for example, to three -days' leave, to be prevented from doing so."
"In the view of the liberal group, unlike that of the two major groups, it consequently seems hardly too much to ask for men and women to be able to make use of existing rights to combine work and care tasks without experiencing discrimination."
"We do live, after all, in the twenty-first century."
"Needless to say, the green-liberal-GUE amendment on mainstreaming is also an important addition."
"I therefore hope that the others will also support us in this and that we indeed face a more equal future backed by a broad majority."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the original Commission proposal, with the exception of a few positive measures, has to be described as extremely weak, to put it mildly."
"It contains a number of major failings."
"There were hardly any innovative ideas in it, except for how to tackle sexual violence, something which, for a directive which is already 25 years old, is telling."
"However, it is, of course, positive that sexual intimidation is recognised as a form of discrimination, particularly against women, but recognition is as far as it goes."
"There is no regulation providing for a possible preventative policy, and the protection of witnesses is not regulated properly either."
"In addition, there is no coherent regulation of sanctions in the event of this form of discrimination taking place."
"It can be likened to driving through a set of red traffic lights."
"You are allowed to drive, no one is stopping you from doing so, and no measures are taken."
"Moreover, the penalty is extremely lenient."
"In order to protect women better after pregnancy, in those countries where this is regulated, fathers should be given the same protection as mothers, so that work and family life can be combined."
"Hence, also the green amendment to establish one regulation for both mothers and fathers so that fathers can look after their children more but are also protected in the same way."
"There is a clear majority in this House in favour of regulating a number of more specific matters."
"Most of these matters, however, belong in other and separate directives, such as the pregnancy directive and equal pay for equal work."
"In recent years, the Commission has proved unable to draft a number of amendments to directives which are more tailored to the current needs of women."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance therefore urges the Commission once again to table amendments of this kind to existing directives, possibly in the form of a codification of the male and female equality acquis."
"We are meanwhile awaiting the Commission proposal on male and female equality outside the employment process with bated breath."
"Finally, I should like to express the hope that the Belgian Presidency, given its own progressive legislation in this respect, succeeds in convincing the Member States of the importance of approving the directive by 2 January and that it can approve this directive under the Presidency of Mrs Onkelinkx."
"Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala for her unstinting effort, prior to the summer and also today, in wanting to give the Commission' s proposal some structure, whilst reiterating the need for specific directives, such as equal pay, protection during pregnancy and motherhood, and now the recognition of types of harassment, and that of the reconciliation of family and working life."
"Thank you, Mrs Hautala, for having done so much work, which was not easy."
"I would now like to explain why the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party and I support the amendment by Mrs Hautala."
"The Commission is certainly willing to recognise the right of fathers to look after their children."
"We have the recommendation on the protection of workers who look after their children."
"Why stop, though, when things are going so well?"
"We now need, and this is the purpose of our amendment, to acknowledge that inequality, or discrimination in other words, can exist, with regard to fathers, when they want to look after their children."
"Why did the Committee on Women' s Rights not go this far?"
"Personally, I do not understand this and I would hope that we are a little more reasonable in the future."
"What will happen if we are?"
"Not only more quibbling, as Mrs Lulling believes, but, quite simply, better recognition of what is needed - not only by women, but by men as well - in order to be able to have both a family and a career."
"If we do not do both, we are not living in the twenty-first century, as Mrs van der Laan said."
"That is why I believe that this amendment simply provides the possibility of extending the right of fathers, something that we also hope for and want to acknowledge."
"That is why I think it is important to support this amendment."
"In addition, I would now like to highlight several points that are new in these proposals for amendments."
"On the one hand, the introduction of adoption is very important, this is something new, which we must weigh up."
"Next, I must say that my group supports the need to set out some positive measures."
"We must not be satisfied with dealing with this at arm's length, we must clearly define these measures and this is what has been done, as a solid legal instrument will be the result."
"I feel that we must also support the possibility of associations and organisations commencing proceedings."
"In doing this, we recognise that there will not just be individuals faced with a law or faced with proceedings, but also bodies which can support these individuals."
"This may be the reason that, whilst it is worthwhile, and whilst we can welcome the protection of workers' representatives who support complainants against discrimination, on the other hand, we have done away with the protection of possible witnesses, or of individuals who witness the harassment or discrimination that some individuals experience, and I think this is a real pity."
"I personally deplore this, even though we did not table an amendment on this for tomorrow."
"Mr President, Mrs Diamantopoulou, ladies and gentlemen, these are the points that I wanted to make, on behalf of my group."
"Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur for her work."
"Parliament has stressed on many occasions that equal opportunities for men and women must be more than just a principle."
"Equal opportunities is a concept, a definition which must be translated into a genuine effort by the institutions to ensure, first and foremost, genuine equal treatment of men and women as regards access to work and professional training."
"What is more, working women must also be able to choose whether to take the opportunity to have a family and bring up children without this jeopardising their professional careers through no fault of their own."
"Indeed, society must be re-educated to see motherhood not just as a woman' s right but also as an opportunity for society as a whole, considering, not least, that one of the causes of the falling birth rate is precisely the fact that many women are discouraged from having children by the rigid mechanisms of the employment world."
"For precisely this reason, we need not just to ensure that a woman has the right to resume her job when maternity leave comes to an end but, in order to genuinely protect working mothers, we need to be able to provide them with more flexible legislation on parental leave, allowing fathers to benefit from paternity leave too so that they can attend to the child during its first few months of life."
"In conclusion, Mr President, the European Union should increasingly promote all such instruments - social, legal and economic - which can provide strong, practical - as opposed to theoretical - support for women, especially working women, and thus provide strong support for families."
"Mrs Lulling, I would like to thank you for livening up this evening' s sitting. These sittings can sometimes be rather monotonous, but I would like to remind you of our Rules of Procedure."
"You must, in principle, wait until the end of the debates if you wish to make a personal statement, and you have limited speaking time."
"You spoke for more than two minutes."
"I think, however, that your fellow Members now have a much clearer understanding of your position."
"We shall now take the speakers who wish to make a personal statement, beginning with Mrs Avilés Perea."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with the second reading of a directive which is important for the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women, in terms of access to employment, training, professional promotion and working conditions."
"This directive has led to many hours of work, meetings and agreements between the different groups in order to achieve a text that is acceptable to the majority of the House, as well as the Council and the Commission."
"It has not been easy, but foremost has been the desire for a legal text which is a good instrument for providing women with equal access to the labour market under equal conditions and for allowing them to reconcile family and professional lives, which still causes women enormous problems, especially young women."
"Article 1(2), which guarantees that women retain their job after maternity leave, is of the greatest importance."
"Not because it is an innovation, since it is included in most national legislations, but because, despite this, retaining jobs and continuing professional promotion after maternity are still creating enormous problems for women."
"These problems principally affect women, but the directive lays down that, when a father has paternity leave, he can have the same guarantees as women, although this leave is after the specific leave for childbirth, which is exclusive to women."
"Also included are positive measures which promote the presence of the least-represented sex in a specific working sector, in order to allow greater equality between men and women."
"It is also important to stress that the directive deals with a work problem which unfortunately affects women more than men: sexual harassment, which will not only be prosecuted and punished, but prevention measures will also be adopted in companies."
"Although we are aware that small companies may have problems complying with this directive, we believe that it is an important achievement for equality between men and women."
"I hope that in the end it will help women and not create additional problems for them."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Hautala very sincerely for the enormous amount of work that we have achieved together here."
"This proposal became necessary because appeals had been made to the European Court of Justice in over 40 cases."
"The most prominent cases, which we in the European Parliament have also been very much involved in, a point I would like to reiterate, were the Kalanke and Marshall cases."
"These cases have important ramifications not only in Germany, but have also led to a degree of legal uncertainty throughout the Union."
"The anti-discrimination provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam and Articles 141 and 3 give us a clear legal basis for amending this directive now so as to improve the position of women."
"Many of the extensive amendments at first reading are reflected in the common position."
"That is our first achievement."
"Direct and indirect discrimination, sexual harassment in the workplace, positive action - these are now all covered by the common position."
"Nevertheless, we are now going a step further."
"We want to protect not only mothers but also fathers, something that, as is reflected here, originally met with some resistance in this House."
"But that is what we expect."
"I think that we now need to find some clearer wording."
"In the course of various extended working sessions, we have managed to achieve a broad consensus in this Parliament on 15 compromise proposals."
"I accordingly wish to recommend that my group should stick to this compromise."
"Our objective remains that of rapidly improving the position of both men and women who are committed to their family, and working towards reconciling professional and family commitments."
"We want to create a clear legal framework."
"That is why if it proves necessary we want to initiate the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible."
"We hope that the compromise before us here will hold up and that the Commission and the Council will accordingly also display a willingness to agree, for the benefit of women."
"The report by Mrs Hautala tackles the subject of equality between men and women as regards access to employment."
"As far as access to the floor is concerned, this equality has not been respected this evening."
"Rest assured, this is something that I regret, as we had 16 female speakers to just one male speaker."
"We shall therefore listen even more closely to what he says over the next two minutes."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Hautala for a good piece of work."
"If it had only depended upon herself, the result could certainly have been still better, but we have to be able to live with compromises, and these are important steps that are now being taken to move closer to equality in Europe."
"The right to equal conditions at the workplace is a fundamental right and should go without saying."
"That is unfortunately not the case."
"The issue is one of human dignity and of avoiding harassment, something with which everyone ought to agree."
"In spite of this, we know that many women in Europe are at present exposed to sexual harassment on a daily basis."
"A genuine change in attitude is needed, but also clear and vigorous legislation if we are to create equal opportunities in working life."
"The present values also lead to large discrepancies in salaries between men and women."
"I nonetheless think it is important to say that equal opportunities for men and women are not in actual fact only a women' s issue."
"It is an issue that affects us all, irrespective of our gender."
"Rights are needed which make it possible for both mothers and fathers to combine professional and family life."
"Maternity and paternity leave must obviously be brought into line with each other."
"My own experience teaches that equality must begin in the home."
"I sometimes think that the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities does not do enough to include us men in its view of equality."
"I think that that is a pity and is in danger of delaying more resolute work for equality within the European Union."
"I should like to conclude by saying that I feel dissatisfied with Amendment 7."
"I do not think that the wording goes far enough."
"Every mother and father must be entitled to return to her or his own work after parental leave."
"I emphasise his or her own work. The wording, work of equal value is not enough, for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave."
"Unfortunately, there are many such examples in my own country, too."
"I should therefore have liked to have seen clearer wording."
"Allow me an additional ten seconds - given that Mrs Lulling was given an extra two minutes - and allow me to say to the latter that my marriage would never have survived if my wife and I had not shared the parental leave equally."
"In view of the fact that Mrs Lulling spoke so clearly, all of us in this House understand that Amendment 17 will of course be supported by Mrs Lulling, and for that I am very grateful."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, I should first of all like to thank Mrs Hautala but say at the same time that the best is often the enemy of the good."
"The two amendments that were tabled subsequently by Mrs Hautala have caused a great deal of difficulty, for a large majority of people who are already unhappy about this directive have found in these amendments a reason to vote against a whole host of things."
"And in the knowledge that 314 votes must be attained, you should have acted more wisely."
"Approval of the present compromise is far more important than submission of your two additional amendments."
"I should like to make this clear to you: it was a poor strategy."
"For my second point, I should like to address the Commission."
"Back in 1993, I drafted a Royal Decree in which I made it compulsory for businesses to draw up an annual report about equal opportunities for men and women in their businesses."
"That Royal Decree goes beyond what is stated in the present text, since the latter merely encourages them, whereas my piece of legislation was binding."
"Commissioner, I have to say, if you want this to yield results, there will need to be consultation with the social partners - much more so than is now the case - and there will need to be agreement with them to apply the provisions of the laws and the directives."
"For our big problem is not the legislator."
"He will faithfully transpose what is in the European directives, sometimes too late, but it is done, anyway."
"Our big problem is the application in the field, and that is in the hands of the social partners."
"Equal pay and the equal treatment, and whatever else, of women is never a priority for trade unions and employers."
"In my opinion, the Commission and the Member States would do well to emphasise this."
"Mr President, imagine if men in Europe earned 25 per cent less than women."
"Imagine if one in two men were subject to sexual harassment."
"Imagine if European men were over-represented in precarious, low-skilled part-time jobs and were given their notice when they told their employers that they intended to have children."
"Imagine if the proportion of men in Europe' s national parliaments were only 20 per cent."
"The mind boggles."
"However, it is women, and not men, who are discriminated against in this way."
"'A new way of thinking is required in order to solve the problems created by the old way of thinking,' as Albert Einstein once said."
"I want to congratulate Mrs Hautala who has worked to find a new way of solving the problems entailed in the EU' s out-of-date Directive on Equal Treatment."
"The proposal on which we are to vote tomorrow lays the foundation for clear and effective legislation in the Member States to protect women and men from gender discrimination at work."
"Countries must take active measures to promote equality in practice."
"What is perhaps most important is Mrs Hautala' s demand that public and private employers in Europe must, in a planned and systematic way, prevent gender discrimination, harassment and unequal treatment."
"It is no longer enough to react after the employee has complained."
"Employers are encouraged to draw up annual equality plans with statistics concerning differences in salaries and the proportion of women and men at different levels and with proposed measures to combat this state of affairs."
"Employers should be responsible for ensuring that their employees are not harassed and that they have equal wages for equal work and the opportunity to pursue careers and, especially, to combine work and family life."
"I assume that the Council is prepared to approve our proposals."
"Only then shall we have an instrument for removing the extensive discrimination against women in working life."
"Mr President, the amendment to the 1976 directive is a very important move and illustrates the Commission's sensitivity on the question of equal treatment for men and women."
"For its part, the Committee on Women's Rights, thanks to the sterling efforts of our rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and other honourable Members, has helped to produce an improved text today which attracts a broader consensus."
"That is why we expect it to be warmly supported by both the Commission and the Council."
"The new directive certainly responds to the change in the situation which has taken place over the last twenty-five years as regards women's employment and vocational training and replaces an outdated legislative framework which has done what it can to combat discrimination against women, serious infringements of the principle of equality, higher unemployment rates, the exclusion of women from numerous professions and the general division of the job market along gender lines."
"I should like to inform the House that the Greek Parliament recently voted almost unanimously to replace a similar article in the Constitution allowing derogations from the principle of sexual equality on the labour market."
"The Hautala report suggests a new, better, framework and introduces new types of measures, such as measures to prevent and combat sexual harassment in the workplace, efficient protection for workers from unequal treatment related to pregnancy and maternity, judicial protection, positive measures to apply equality in practice, as other Members have pointed out, and sanctions to punish infringements of the directive."
"However, I feel that the directive could be clearer in defining purely objective selection criteria for all jobs and should not leave loopholes for gender-based exceptions and exclusions."
"Mr President, this directive is tremendously important to the future of Europe because it regulates matters which concern the whole of society - men and women alike - and is a way of achieving fundamental strategic objectives of the European Union, as laid down in the EC Treaty, Articles 2 and 3, and the European Social Agenda."
"It absolutely must update this directive if it is to be an efficient means of achieving these objectives."
"The reform of the directive has been a dogged and, at times, difficult procedure, as happens when we try to adopt a correct, binding and efficient text."
"Both the rapporteur and all the political groups showed willing, although it was difficult to strike a balance between the ambitious objectives set by the European Union for women's employment and the quality of jobs, the already high acquis communautaire on equal treatment for men and women and the exceptional, high-level performance by certain Member States which have gone beyond the proposals for the directive (Mrs Karamanou and Mrs Smet referred to experiences in Greece and Belgium) and the real need to maintain flexibility and the status of female employment during a downswing in the economy and on the labour market, help speed up cooperation with the Council and the European Commission and avoid overburdening the text with important women's issues such as equal pay, which are dealt with elsewhere, and achieve the consensus and majority needed."
"In my personal experience, this procedure has given all of us, European institutions, national governments, social partners and social agencies, a more responsible attitude to women's problems and to the importance of female employment to our development objectives."
"I think that this mature attitude will also find expression in tomorrow's vote."
"The views of my political group have been stated and I share them."
"Personally, I support Amendment No 17 on the recognition of paternity as a factor in the strategy to promote new working conditions, as a factor in the balanced participation of men and women in family and professional life and as acknowledgement of the social values of family life and support for women in their multiple and simultaneous roles."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion is a stated objective that we all share."
"The only disagreement is about how we should achieve this, and there is ultimately the question of how effective individual measures are, or whether such measures just mean more rules and regulations, and extra expenditure and bureaucracy, which we certainly do not need."
"The Council has not taken all Parliament's demands on board in its common position."
"Nevertheless, it is true to say that the text of the original proposal has been considerably improved upon."
"This means that we have taken an important step on the road to updating the Community legislative framework."
"However, a number of issues and problem areas remain to be resolved."
"The Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities has closely examined all these unresolved questions, and a decision has been reached between the groups not to re-examine all the outstanding demands, but rather the most important."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, has made enormous efforts in order to work out viable compromises."
"We have the result before us."
"It emerged from the first reading debate that paternity rights cannot be the same as maternity rights."
"The compromise accordingly does not affect Member States' freedom to recognise the right to paternity leave within their borders."
"Both mothers and fathers should have the option of devoting themselves to family duties."
"This - in contrast to the opinion that we have heard expressed here - is undeniably the stated objective of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats."
"Furthermore, the formula whereby a woman on maternity leave should be entitled, after the end of her period of maternity leave, to return to her job or to an equivalent post must be taken on board."
"However, we have problems with the definition of sexual harassment."
"We seem to have ended up with a rather woolly form of words here that is not helpful for any judge or other person that has to make a decision on this."
"Lastly, I would like to make one further brief comment opposing the annual reporting arrangements for employers on progress with equal treatment."
"Bureaucracy alone will not promote equal treatment."
"We also need to think about small and medium-sized enterprises so that they too accept women looking for jobs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, this evening, we are discussing the equal treatment of men and women with regard to access to employment, occupational training and chances of promotion, and with regard to working conditions."
"In actual fact, it is astonishing that we should still be discussing this topic, because we have been discussing it for so long, and virtually everyone is convinced, both men and women, that such equal treatment is fair and does not and should not have to be justified."
"However, we are not yet that far advanced, unfortunately."
"To this day, women are being treated as inferior and discriminated against, also in working situations."
"The combination of work and care still poses problems in many cases."
"That is why I am pleased with this report."
"I am also pleased that we were able to find a compromise text concerning a number of important points."
"I therefore hope that the voting tomorrow will be positive so that it can truly represent a step forward in the process of equal treatment."
"The report encourages States and organisations involved to take measures in favour of equal treatment and to combat sexual intimidation."
"Better legal protection is given and, for example, opportunities are given to return to work following pregnancy or in connection with adoption."
"In addition, we will gain a better insight into the actual situation concerning participation of men and women and we shall have access to better, updated statistics."
"That is why I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commission for the initiative."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur warmly for all her efforts to persuade us to sing from the same song sheet, but a special thanks goes to all those who have worked hard on this broadly-based text."
"I should like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Hautala, and I would like to thank all the Members of the committee for their efforts and excellent contributions in this difficult and complex area."
"I am aware of your concerns to improve the text of the common position on which there was unanimous agreement in the Council on 11 June 2001."
"As you know from the first reading, the Commission accepted in spirit the majority of your amendments - 49 amendments of a total of 70 - and consequently drew up an amended proposal which reflected this position."
"In general it should be stressed that the common position considerably enhances the text of the initial proposal and responds to the desire to update the text of Directive 76/207."
"We must now focus on the most essential issues of the directive and make a concerted effort to find possible solutions to improve even further the common position."
"As you know, the Council only reached an agreement after long discussions on issues such as the precise wording of the definitions and the article on maternity and paternity leave, on which it was very difficult to reach agreement in the Council."
"The compromise therefore is extremely delicate."
"On the other hand I feel that the Council could make further compromises in areas such as equality plans, the role of bodies for the promotion of equality and the introduction of preventive measures to combat sexual harassment."
"In this context the Commission can accept the following amendments. On Amendments Nos 1 and 5, on preventive measures against sexual harassment the Commission can accept in part the idea of introducing measures for preventing sexual harassment by reformulating the text."
"Instead of obliging employers to introduce preventive measures, it would be preferable to encourage employers to do so."
"On Amendment No 8, on positive measures, the Commission can accept this amendment in part if a definition is contained in the recitals instead of the article of the directive."
"On Amendment No 9, on provisions in contracts and agreements, the Commission accepts that annulment should be obligatory but rejects the removal of the possibility for amendment of the contract."
"Here there is the need for flexibility."
"On Amendment No 13, on the role of the independent budgets, the Commission can accept this amendment in part by reformulating the proposed text."
"The text of the common position could be improved by strengthening the role of bodies for the promotion of equal treatment and by adding to their tasks the monitoring and follow-up of Community legislation in the field of equal treatment."
"The Commission can also accept a reformulation of Article 6(3), by expressly mentioning that designated bodies acting on behalf of victims have an interest in ensuring that the provisions of the directive are complied with."
"On Amendment No 14, on equality plans and the company level, the Commission can accept this idea in part, but with a new formulation for Article 8(b)."
"On Amendment No 15, on reporting on positive action measures, the Commission will propose an alternative text so as to report on positive measures only every three years."
"On Amendment No 16 on gender mainstreaming, the Commission accepts this amendment partially and in spirit, but only to the extent that it respects the wording of the Treaty."
"Now I should like to turn to those amendments which cannot be accepted by the Commission."
"Amendment No 4, rewording the common position's definition of sexual harassment, in order to take into account Parliament's definition of sexual harassment."
"Amendments Nos 7 and 17 reformulating the text of the common position on maternity and paternity leave by reintroducing inter alia the idea of maternity and paternity leave where children are adopted."
"The common position was hotly debated in the Council on this issue and a delicate compromise was reached."
"It is unlikely therefore that any further change would be accepted."
"Here I would just like to remind you that there is, of course, the paternity leave directive - the first to be adopted following an agreement between the social partners."
"The Commission did not accept Amendment No 11 on group action in cases of discrimination - especially without the consent of the victim of discrimination."
"On Amendments Nos 2, 3, 6, 10 and 12, the Commission considers that the content of these amendments is already covered by the common position."
"To sum up, the Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16."
"It rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Diamantopoulou."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"6th, 7th and 8th EDF discharge for 1999"
"The next item is the second report (A5-0337/2001) by Mrs Rühle, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on the discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year."
"I shall now give the floor to Mrs Rühle, who has five minutes' speaking time."
"Mr President, I am today proposing that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year."
"Unfortunately, we had to postpone the discharge in the spring, because I as rapporteur had received insufficient information from the Commission."
"This information is now available and I would like to specifically thank the Commission for its cooperation."
"I can recommend discharge today without any reservations."
"Nevertheless, I hope and indeed expect that the fruitful cooperation which we have had with the Commission since the spring will continue when it comes to future reporting relating to the Development Fund, because such cooperation is needed to jointly solve problems in this area."
"However, my report is still a very critical one."
"It refers to 1999, and 1999 was the first budget year for which the new Commission was fully responsible."
"However, full responsibility does not mean that the Commission can be blamed for the mistakes of the past."
"We all know that reforms take time and we can see that the necessary measures have been initiated."
"Despite that, I would like to briefly reiterate my criticism."
"It is implementation that is at stake here. For example, there was a gap between commitments at EUR 2.69 billion and payments actually made in 1999 at EUR 1.27 billion."
"Unfortunately, the same also applies to the implementation of the debt relief initiative for the poorest countries in the world."
"I am, of course, aware that this reflects the general crisis in development aid, and that this situation is not unique to the Development Fund or to the Commission's work, and that all the Member States, together with the Commission and the Parliament, need to consider new approaches to development policy."
"The problem is a failure of political will to provide aid on a generous scale, combined with a lack of instruments to effectively implement the available funds."
"That is the problem in a nutshell."
"In view of the lateness of the hour, I do not want to go into great detail, but I would like to emphasise that the Commission's approach to solving this problem is a step in the right direction."
"It involves strengthening local delegations, providing them with better equipment and preparation, in short, making local delegations more competent."
"However, I would also like to make an appeal to Parliament in this context."
"In the Committee on Budgets, we had protracted debates on the need for higher staffing levels, particularly for delegations, and the Committee on Budgets put pressure on the Committee on Budgetary Control to make these posts available and not to play spurious political games with a view to making the Commission deliver reforms before we approve staff changes."
"This is absurd of course, because these posts in local delegations are needed above all else so that reforms can be made in the first place."
"The further efforts at reform described in the Commission's internal audit report are also important and need to be discussed in detail between the Commission and the Parliament."
"I would like though to briefly mention a couple of expectations following on from the report of the Court of Auditors. I hope that in future these will be the hallmark of the discharge process and of cooperation between the Parliament and Commission."
"One important point is that we need an ongoing assessment of progress in implementing measures to reform public administration in the ACP States."
"We need to monitor progress achieved in the key sectors of health and education, using meaningful indicators such as the increase in the number of teachers or doctors, thus providing more qualitative checks instead of quantitative checks."
"This would also mean the discharge process in the Parliament itself having to change."
"In order words, we would have to shift our examination towards quality control and refrain from making a great hue and cry about points of detail."
"We would also have to carry out an annual audit of accounting and sound management of resources on the basis of samples and, lastly, apply clearly defined sanctions - such as the reduction or suspension of payments - in cases where the agreed reform measures are not complied with."
"If we implement these measures together, then I believe that we will be jointly taking an important step towards enhancing the structure of development aid, and that we will be better placed to convince the EU's taxpayers and to secure approval for the necessary expenditure."
"I say this because the situation prevailing since 11 September has demonstrated how important development aid is."
"It will be a pivotal factor."
"Furthermore, the EU has now become the world's largest provider of development aid."
"That is why we urgently need this joint reform."
"draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. (ES) Mr President, the difficult circumstances which have accompanied the management of the 1999 budget, of which we are all well aware, have especially affected funds for external relations and, even more, aid to third countries, including the European Development Fund."
"For the Socialist Group, the good management of the European Development Fund is not only essential for reasons of correct and transparent accounting, but because this fund and all Community aid resources are essential if we are to contribute to reducing poverty, which is one of our priorities."
"We are therefore closely monitoring the Commission' s action in this area."
"The eventful journey of this report through the competent committees, leading to its approval, is a testimony to this interest."
"Last year we made our 1998 discharge conditional upon the orientation of Community spending towards reducing poverty and we improved the structure of the budget in this respect, in order to reduce the risks of dispersal of aid funds."
"This year we have delayed, on one occasion, the discharge, while awaiting a series of reports from the Court of Auditors."
"We are now in a position to approve it, now that the Commission has adopted a series of measures to improve the effectiveness of aid, in particular the creation of Europe Aid, but at the same time certain data leads to some reservations: in 1999 the level of payments from the EDF was disappointing when compared to the level of commitment appropriations and payments achieved in previous years, as Mrs Rühle has said."
"Initiatives such as the reduction of the debt of the least-developed countries are not being complied with in accordance with the commitments the Commission has made."
"Contracts funded by the EDF essentially benefit companies in the Member States, to the detriment of local companies and organisations."
"The Commission is not yet sufficiently directing its aid towards reducing poverty."
"We want simplification of procedures, integration of the cycle of cooperation, transparency in management, assessment in such important sectors as health and education."
"We will monitor compliance with the recommendations of the resolution we are debating today."
"The Commission knows that it has the support of the Socialist Group in its efforts to improve the management of the EDF and the Socialist Group trusts that we will see these improvements during the coming financial years, so that we are able to discharge the budget with fewer problems and conditions than has been the case so far."
"Thank you very much."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Rühle's report on the discharge for the European Development Funds presents an honest picture of the contradictions in our development policy."
"On the one hand, there are complaints that we are not willing enough to make generous development aid available, and, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the money actually made available is often only disbursed very slowly."
"There must be something wrong with a system under which at the end of 1999 resources of almost EUR 10 billion had been promised and made available without any specific deadlines, but had not been taken up."
"The Commission will, of course, say that since then there have been signs of improvement here and there."
"Nevertheless, it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach."
"The aid we offer through the Development Funds is reaching its limits, because it is geared towards supporting states that in some cases only exist on paper."
"There is often a lack of an even semi-functioning public administration, there is a lack of democratic control of those in power, and many countries are in a state of open civil war or on the verge of it."
"In a civil war situation, we first need to concentrate aid on conflict resolution and on humanitarian aid."
"In other cases, we should concentrate our efforts to a greater extent than before on establishing properly functioning public administrations, which are a prerequisite for meaningfully applying aid from the EU or other donors in the international community."
"Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens."
"Our aid must therefore always be linked to reform programmes for public administration."
"If these reforms make progress, aid is given, but if they do not progress or if there are setbacks we should not be afraid to turn off the tap."
"I know that is a difficult thing to do, but it is precisely in such circumstances that the Commission needs to stand firm and adhere to its principles."
"Finally, I would like to say one more thing about this discharge procedure."
"The discharge had to be postponed because the Commission did not initially provide the necessary information."
"Furthermore, there was again the problem that certain confidential information was only forwarded to the committee chair and to the rapporteur."
"As I have often said before, and I shall say it again now, this leads to two classes of Member of the European Parliament - those with and those without access to information."
"The committee made it patently clear in its report that this situation should not be allowed to recur, and that the provisions of our Rules of Procedure in respect of the discharge procedure should be fully implemented in future."
"In other words, all Members of this House should have access to all confidential information."
"Mr President, the Commission is now to be granted discharge for 1999, but Parliament has, in actual fact, achieved a lot by postponing the discharge first time around."
"The Commission has been pressed to take initiatives it would not otherwise have wished to take."
"I think the rapporteur has delivered a splendid piece of work, but I also think the Commission deserves to be warmly congratulated when it makes progress - as, I believe, it has in fact done."
"I would therefore recommend, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we grant discharge for the development fund. At the same time, I want to assure the Commission that all the outstanding problems will be followed up in the discharge for the year 2000."
"The Commission has carried out a major investigation of the counterpart funds and of the roles and responsibilities of the delegations."
"An investigation has been carried out into whether the delegations have complied with their responsibilities, and it would appear that they have done so, for disciplinary enquiries are not to be carried out."
"I can, of course, ask Mr Nielson if the Commission will confirm that disciplinary enquiries will not be carried out on the basis of its investigations."
"I can also - perhaps rather teasingly - ask if the Commission will confirm this report, which will not be sent to Parliament."
"The internal audit service has done good work from the start with its investigations of the counterpart funds."
"It is a good report which is critical about the way in which the system operates."
"The counterpart funds amount to direct budgetary support, and neither the Commission nor the delegations in the beneficiary countries have any direct control over the money."
"The report emphasises that direct budgetary support is risky, irrespective of what is done."
"Mr Nielson has said that that form of subsidy should nonetheless be maintained."
"How, though, does he think that control over the funds can be improved?"
"The Commission must also be praised for sending this report to Parliament immediately."
"It shows it has learned something from this whole course of events."
"Discharge was postponed primarily because there were problems with the supply of information. Reports were sent to the wrong people, were seriously delayed or never arrived."
"I think, however, that it is a good result we have achieved, and I therefore recommend discharge for the Commission."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to pay Mrs Rühle a compliment."
"It is clear that her instincts were good when she postponed the discharge for the European Development Funds back in spring."
"We in the Committee for Budgetary Control had at that point not received any substantial information at all on follow-up measures in connection with cases of fraud discovered in 1999."
"However, we now very definitely know what we could only assume at that point, and that is that both the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, have had to lower their sights."
"For example, fraud in the health sector in the Ivory Coast was discovered in 1998/1999."
"Medical equipment including disposable syringes and baby scales had for years been claimed at many times their actual value."
"The loss was estimated at around EUR 27.4 million."
"When this case came to light, the, at that time, newly appointed Commission said that this money would of course have to be repaid."
"We now know that this money has not been returned to the European Development Fund."
"According to the Commission the reason for this is that it was legally impossible to demand the money back!"
"I do not want to go into any further detail here, but this demonstrates how difficult it is to take corrective action once money has been transferred."
"Furthermore, in the ACP States, OLAF does not have the same powers of control as it has in the EU Member States, not to mention the fact that it purely and simply does not have the staff to run a comprehensive anti-fraud operation out of Brussels."
"It is therefore vital for us to exert pressure to ensure that there is a general improvement in the way public money is looked after in the recipient countries."
"Countries that cannot protect their own tax revenue against fraud, corruption and waste are unlikely to be able to provide effective protection for EU funds."
"However, for the Commission this also means that it should step up its presence in the recipient countries - and on this point I am in agreement with the rapporteur - but not only by increasing the number of officials in the delegations, but, also, by giving those local delegations more authority."
"It should not, after all, be possible to circumvent local delegations in practice by coming to special arrangements direct with Brussels."
"Once again, my heartfelt congratulations on your report, Mrs Rühle. We are very happy to vote for it."
"Mr President, the closure and the reduction of the status and the staff of twenty-odd delegations in ACP countries, recently decided by the Commission, deals a harsh blow to the commitments to development given in the Cotonou Agreements."
"If there is one lesson that we have learnt about monitoring the Community' s external action for development, it is that the key to its success is the existence of a strong, responsible, independent and credible presence in the recipient countries."
"The arguments of budgetary neutrality used by the Commission are fallacious, because opening a delegation in countries such as Saudi Arabia cannot be compared with the overall costs of maintaining a European presence in those countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific."
"Furthermore this is not only a question of looking at the cost of a delegation, but of looking at the very real damage done to the effectiveness of public spending as a result of not monitoring such spending."
"The European Union cannot do without an autonomous and meaningful policy for the less developed world and replace it with a form of regionalisation undertaken in agreement with some of the former colonial powers."
"I hope that the Commission rethinks this course of action and treats the ACP countries and the management of the EDF with the importance that they deserve."
"Mr President, firstly, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent and very serious work on this discharge exercise covering EDF 1999 which was the year in which this Commission took office."
"This means that I feel especially responsible for the last four months of that year."
"Mr Blak mentioned that Parliament has gained much by having this discharge delayed."
"I think this is true, but it should be noted that the Commission feels equally pleased with the outcome."
"This is like a good love story - it is always worth waiting for."
"But it was wrong that the delay had to do specifically with information being held back in contradiction to the agreement between the Commission and Parliament."
"The main reason for the delay was that the report from the internal auditor service was not finished and could not be finished because we, on both sides, found it necessary and a good idea to broaden its scope in order to get a serious and deep study of how to handle this method of development cooperation."
"So we have solved problems that went beyond what is normally dealt with in the discharge process and this is what we can congratulate each other on tonight."
"One remark to Mr Bösch concerning the Ivory Coast - we did get full recovery even though they had a military coup!"
"We grilled them. We stuck to what I told Parliament: that we wanted to maintain a position of zero tolerance, and the new military dictators in the Ivory Coast accepted their obligations within the deadline."
"We have not, in my time as Commissioner, experienced any case so far where we did not manage to get full recovery when the audit results indicated the need for that."
"Our cooperation through the EDF has kept growing, while the support of other major donors for developing countries and especially for the least-developed countries has been declining."
"The Funds constitute an increasingly important source of finance for these countries and so, of course, we owe it to them, and to our European taxpayers, to use these resources as effectively as possible."
"By the same token, the Commission should be concerned to verify that the beneficiary countries are doing all they can to improve their own capacity for effective budgetary and financial management."
"This has been a major theme of this discharge exercise, and it has succeeded in focusing attention on an important area of development cooperation."
"The question of sound financial management of budgetary support is, I think, better understood, as a result of the work carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Commission' s internal audit service, in cooperation with the various Commission services responsible."
"I do not see any need to amend the Cotonou Agreement to reflect this."
"I am confident that there is a clear consensus between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and Parliament on the right way ahead, and in particular on the importance of budgetary support."
"This is a key tool to enhance stability and economic governance."
"By doing this in cooperation with other main donors and in a manner that emphasises the responsibility of the recipient government, we are playing a very important role."
"I am deeply grateful to Parliament that this perspective has been understood for this budget period."
"We need to continue to do this."
"No other donor is able and willing to meet this challenge as we are."
"Of course, we cannot turn a blind eye to the cases of corruption or of negligence in the management of public funds, and I can reassure you that we will continue this policy of zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption."
"But we have to be aware, as you must, that the strengthening of financial control systems in these countries is a long-term process. It has to be tackled with realism."
"We have to make an assessment of the risks involved in each action that we consider for EDF finance, and go into action with a clear understanding of those risks."
"It has to be based on a common approach with other donors."
"An isolated approach by the Commission would be unrealistic."
"It must rely on the development of internal accountability."
"Cooperation with other donors in this field is better than ever."
"We all need improvement, and this is definitely being pursued in good cooperation."
"This covers the discharge for 1999, and the performance for 2000 is in several ways somewhat more encouraging."
"One of the main objectives of the reform of the management of the Community' s external assistance programmes is, of course, drastically to reduce the gap between commitments and payments."
"The Commission has been implementing measures since May of last year to tackle this problem."
"For instance, we pressed ahead with the closure, wherever possible, of old and dormant commitments, and we proposed also the introduction of a so-called 'sunset clause' to limit the time during which funds allocated to an action can be used for contracts."
"We, therefore, have reason to hope that the situation will gradually improve."
"In relation to the slow rate of payments, the figures already available indicate that payments in 2000 increased from EUR 1.27 billion to EUR 1.55 billion."
"We still have incredible inertia in the pipeline, in the way in which these figures move."
"We have been increasing the total volume of what we do in this area and this is something that will gradually occur as a result of more and more activity year by year."
"This is, of course, the challenge we are facing."
"I have said, on several occasions, that the lack of comprehensive data about our operations is a real embarrassment."
"We have made some progress towards more effective management information systems."
"I know that Parliament, and particularly the Development Committee, is anxious to see us make progress in this area, and we are doing our best."
"Nevertheless, there is still much to do and we are very conscious of the need to press on with reforming the management of our programmes."
"In particular, we are concerned that the process of deconcentration, or delegating to delegations as I prefer to call it, should move ahead smoothly."
"The Commission has been asking for additional staff, but the numbers required have been assessed on a very conservative basis and we need every single post."
"I therefore hope that Parliament in its decisions on the budget for 2002 will support us in this effort."
"It was encouraging to listen to Mr Casaca in this respect."
"I thank you for your enthusiastic support and hope you can deliver. We are determined that the deconcentration exercise should not end by simply exporting from Brussels to the delegations the problems caused by inadequate staffing."
"This is serious."
"Concern is expressed in the resolution about the percentage of EDF contracts going to companies from the ACP countries, and it requires the Commission to increase this from some 25% to 40% in five years."
"The ACP countries win a much higher percentage of contracts under the EDF than from almost any other major donor."
"This should not be forgotten."
"ACP companies already benefit from a substantial preference margin in cases where offers are technically equivalent."
"If it is to operate a transparent and fair tendering system, the Commission cannot envisage any kind of fixed quotas which would discriminate against European companies, and which would be contrary to WTO rules."
"Nevertheless, we share the political intention of Parliament to maximise the benefits of our aid for local economies, particularly where there is a technically competent and well-structured private sector."
"I would point to the new investment facility, part of the Cotonou Agreement, EUR 2.2 billion, which is architectured in order to stimulate the emergence of this activity in our partner countries. This is a way in which they may improve their position in exactly this respect."
"We have already identified this as an area where we should push forward."
"I am anxious to reassure Parliament that the Commission is strengthening its monitoring procedures on the follow-up of audit."
"This is an important part of the reform of the Commission' s financial management and control."
"We also plan improvements to the presentation of the accounts, in response to the comments from the Court of Auditors."
"We are ready to enter into a direct dialogue to find out how this is best done."
"I will say a few words on the points in the resolution which refer to the transmission of confidential documents."
"The respect of confidentiality and the application of correct transmission procedures remain crucial."
"The 1999 discharge procedure showed that the framework agreement provides an effective and satisfactory framework for cooperation between the Commission and Parliament."
"What we are discussing tonight has been following that set of rules."
"I want to make that perfectly clear."
"The 1999 discharge procedure was the first to which this framework agreement was applied."
"The Commission sought to apply the agreement fully and loyally throughout that procedure."
"In the Commission's view the framework agreement has proved to be an effective mechanism, one benefit being that it allows Parliament to receive confidential and similar information."
"The understanding of the importance of development aid seems to be growing as we understand more and more about globalisation. And in the light of recent events we have come to better understand the reality and urgency of interdependency in this world."
"We cannot act alone. The challenge of reducing poverty is one in which the whole international community is involved and we share with others the framework for providing aid and for assessing the results."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"Mr President, I was rather surprised to hear the Commissioner state that we have recovered the money from the Ivory Coast."
"I would be very grateful to the Commissioner if, within or without the framework agreement, he could inform me - in writing if necessary - where all this has been recorded, so that we can understand this."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I can see that Mr Nielson is in agreement."
"You will without doubt receive all these details as soon as possible."
"Classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)"
"The next item is the report (A5-0335/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) (COM(2001) 83 - C5-0065/2001 - 2001/0046(COD))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"On the basis of a Commission proposal with the best of intentions and leading us in the right direction, I believe that the rapporteur presented the committee with a good draft report and that the result achieved by that committee, as the rapporteur pointed out, is highly satisfactory."
"It would be a good thing if the Commission and, subsequently, the Council could take up the proposals of this Parliament' s Committee on Regional Policy."
"Europe is constructed on the basis of agreements and consensus."
"We are dealing here with an example of what, in many cases, this way of operating has consisted of: gentlemen' s agreements."
"But from now on many of these agreements must be reflected in the Treaties, with a relevant legal basis."
"This is an extremely important issue, as the rapporteur has pointed out very effectively."
"We are dealing with European territorial construction."
"For this we need clear, homogenous and geographic criteria."
"These criteria must be based on politico-administrative criteria - forgive my repetition."
"We must not create fictitious units which, in the end, only lead to a lack of confidence in European construction on the part of the different States, the different regions and the citizens."
"I am therefore pleased with the proposal from the committee."
"I would lastly like to point out an amendment which rather reflects what we are talking about: the amendment by Mrs Cerdeira on the division of the cities of Ceuta and Melilla, which are politico-administrative units, each with its own status."
"In this specific case I would like to point out how Mr Hernández Mollar, from my group, also fought for this recognition for a long time, and I believe that tomorrow, when the report presented by the Committee on Regional Policy is approved, we will have achieved a satisfactory result."
"This is an example and a reflection of what we want in terms of the division and structuring of Europe."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the classification of territorial units for statistics is not a formality, as might appear at first sight, it is not a technical debate about statistical terms, it is a material question because adopting any classification has direct repercussions on how the development of each territorial unit is supported."
"With the forthcoming enlargement, or to be more precise, enlargements, given that candidate countries will integrate in groups, we need to move towards objective criteria for classifying territorial units, so that new members know the rules of play."
"The simplest way would be to adopt fully unified criteria for each classification level and for all the Member States."
"However, the many and varied specific characteristics of the countries in the Union make this idea unfeasible and impracticable."
"So we must agree with the rapporteur and endorse her satisfaction with the Commission initiative which, with the proposed regulation, creates the legal basis for classifying territorial units for statistics."
"We should also congratulate the rapporteur who, with her sense of moderation and what I would call female perspicacity, has proposed and accepted feasible improvements to the Commission opinion in order to achieve a better approach to the basic objective, which cannot be but to formulate truly comparable territorial units, in every sense of the word, so that we can establish a universal European statistics system."
"Given past injustices, the reasonable doubts of European citizens should not be brushed aside with replies along the lines of ""this area is supported, even though it is better off than yours because it is a NUTS II territorial unit, whereas yours isn't""."
"Rationalisation at all operational levels in the Union should be our basic and fixed aspiration."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Miguélez Ramos, for this excellent report."
"She has raised important questions and also taken the proposals of others into account."
"Our group supports the Commission' s proposal and, furthermore, the rapporteur' s view regarding the creation of a proper legal basis for verifying nomenclature."
"The issue is also a timely one, as the applicant countries are receiving guidelines for verifying territorial classification in their own countries."
"With the present NUTS classification system one problem is that classifications by country have shaped themselves according to each country' s own needs and traditions."
"One cause for criticism is the fact that the land area of regions has not been used as a basis for statistics."
"Units vary in size and, for example, a low population density or gradual depopulation are overlooked."
"The aims of the regulation regarding clear rules, comparability and impartiality deserve support."
"It is also important to determine rules for dealing with amendments and to ensure that the NUTS classification does not change too often."
"We would ask you to support our group' s amendment, whereby islands and the outermost regions are added to the Subparagraph of Article 3 (4) in order to avoid unnecessary reclassification."
"Our group stresses the importance of also having flexibility in classification so that administrative factors and, for example, geographical, social and economic circumstances will be taken into consideration as appropriate."
"Our group supports the rapporteur' s opinion that the Commission should investigate the inclusion of a new level NUTS 4 in the regulation."
"The goal relating to the comparative classification of territories will be difficult to achieve, and will take time."
"It is essential, however, that we establish a fair classification, which will help to allocate the right actions to the right areas."
"Mr President, it is a great pity that Mr Barnier is not here himself, because the NUTS classification is not just a purely technical or statistical question, it is one of the most important political issues for our future cohesion policy."
"It is about whom will receive European funding in future, how much they will receive, and about who decides how it will be spent."
"These are pivotal issues for the future of the European Union and of the cohesion policy, and that is why this subject, which we are now discussing at the midnight hour, is more important than has been evident hitherto."
"The Commission has always adhered purely to statistical criteria for the classification of territorial units and has not taken such political issues into account."
"So there was ultimately always a tendency to distribute resources from the structural funds using a scattergun approach, rather than concentrating these resources in any efficient way on the regions in greatest need."
"Looking at the candidate countries, the Objective 1 areas have been extended to include high-income regions and centres such as Warsaw and Riga, and these regions receive just as much by way of funding as the poorest regions of the enlarged European Union, Latgale and Masuria."
"I am sure that cannot be right."
"This runs counter to a credible cohesion policy and I regard it as being totally absurd!"
"That is why I would like to ask whether the same agency that grants the authority aid funding should also be the control agency."
"As I see it, the proposal before us does not adopt a bottom-up approach."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I regard the proposal for a regulation on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics, NUTS, as being sensible and clear in terms of both statistics and administration."
"However, we must ensure that any amendment to the classification also requires the prior approval of the Member States."
"We must also ensure that the definition of employment market regions under the 'shared-task' mechanism can also deviate from NUTS level III in future."
"The two-year period provided for between an amendment to NUTS being accepted and coming into force should either be significantly reduced or else totally dropped, as Commission financial support for the Member States can depend on the regional structure."
"Otherwise, I am completely satisfied with the Commission proposal, and would in fact be happier without the rapporteur's amendments that were adopted by a majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"Although I said 'by a majority' , they were in fact adopted unanimously with one abstention, and that abstention was mine."
"I voted against certain amendments in committee."
"This was because the report repeatedly referred to the adoption of additional criteria for the definition of regions as an objective."
"I regard that as a problem, as taking account of, say, economic, geographical and social criteria in the case of non-administrative units will lead to a blurring of these clear criteria."
"I believe that a key criterion for the definition of regions should be the number of people living in a region, as in the final analysis they are affected by any decisions regarding the NUTS classification."
"When the rapporteur says in one recital that there should be at least three hierarchical levels, the use of that little phrase 'at least' implies that further levels ought to be created for classifying territorial units."
"However, it needs to be borne in mind that the introduction of new statistics for the areas affected would involve a significant additional administrative burden, something that I believe should if anything be limited."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Miguélez and everyone who has spoken in this debate."
"I would like to start by clarifying two points that seem essential to me."
"It is up to you to interpret whether statistical classification can have a political impact or not; but I can assure you that that is not the objective of this document, nor was it the Commission' s intention."
"The document is based on a Eurostat proposal which intends to achieve the most equitable treatment possible for all the countries and regions of the European Union."
"Nor does this document in any way prejudice regional policy: we do not know who will be objective 1, who will be objective 2 or whether the current regional policy system will be the same in the future."
"We are talking about statistics here; and we are talking about making the statistics better and as equitable as possible for all the countries of the Union."
"What is our intention?"
"Our intention is that a practice we have been applying up until now should become a rule."
"And we want to do this because it seems essential to us to give a legal character to something which so far has been a consensus between the Member States and the Commission."
"But it also seems essential to us as a means of establishing principles for enlargement and in order to continue applying the same criteria that have been applied up to this point."
"Until now, the NUTS had no legal basis, now they are acquiring it: this is the objective of the present regulation."
"What criteria have we used for the definition of the NUTS?"
"Our document is essentially based on three principles."
"The first is that the NUTS are legislative regions; we have therefore tried to define their territory in accordance with existing legislative political definitions: a good definition, recognised by the Member States, of units which in many cases already have governmental structures and comparable statistics, which makes them sufficiently reliable."
"The second principle is that we propose three hierarchical levels of NUTS."
"In your amendments you have gone further and asked for at least three levels."
"With our current room for manoeuvre, from the point of view of producing statistics, to work with more than three levels would create financial problems for Eurostat."
"This is one reason, but, furthermore, we believe that three levels will provide us with sufficient and valid information."
"The third principle is to try to make the regional statistics comparable."
"This is why the size of the NUTS has to be as homogenous as possible."
"But we are also aware that there are historic realities and legal situations in each of the countries which mean that this principle cannot be applied in an automatic or mechanical way, and that specific situations have to be taken into account."
"There is a consensus between Member States that these principles we have been using until now should also form the ideas behind the new regulation, as I have already mentioned, not only for application in our countries as they stand, but also in the countries which are going to join us in the coming years."
"That is why the regulation responds to a series of objectives which you have been able to debate in depth and for which you have made some corrections."
"We are heading towards having NUTS that are classified in accordance with the current regional systems, because we believe that this is the most effective instrument we have today for the collection, calculation and diffusion of regional statistics."
"Furthermore, in the regulation we set criteria for defining regions in such a way that the candidate countries will have guidelines for regional classification within their own territory."
"This objective is essential at this time."
"I would also like to stress the need for statistics to be as comparable and as impartial as possible."
"These statistics must not be produced and used for political ends, whatever they may be."
"It would be very difficult to establish political interests which undoubtedly would lead us to clear contradictions."
"This issue is essential for the Union' s regional policy, but, as I said before, statistical classification must not prejudice the nature of the Union' s future regional policy."
"We intend to create clear rules for future modifications to the classification of NUTS because this will prevent future disputes, which have arisen in the past."
"Modifications are inevitable."
"We cannot speak of absolutely permanent situations, but NUTS must not be modified too often and of course we must have a system which is based on certain rules and certain pre-established principles."
"We therefore believe it to be appropriate that modifications would not take place within a time period of three years, or else we will be faced with monitoring problems."
"The regulation, as it is drawn up, allows us to move forward and improve on what we have at the moment."
"You have contributed 11 amendments which, in our opinion, help to clarify and improve the regulation."
"The Commission can therefore accept the 11 amendments presented by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism."
"I would like to end by stressing that the NUTS Regulation will be an important instrument for achieving comparable and impartial regional statistics in the European Union, on which we will be able to base the regional policy which we will decide on, politically, at the appropriate time."
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you so much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.09 p.m.)"
"Madam President, I want to raise an issue on the floor of the House which I am sure will be welcomed. I do so as the Labour Party spokesperson on Northern Ireland."
"The House would surely like to welcome the news on the peace process in Northern Ireland and the decommissioning of weapons."
"It serves as an example of what can be achieved through peaceful negotiation."
"Tribute must be given to those involved in the difficult times of the peace process and the ongoing negotiations."
"Mention must be made at the determination of those involved, including David Trimble, and not least a Member of this House, John Hume, who has fought for peace for over three decades."
"Mr Cashman, I am even more pleased to hear this good news because I was on an official visit to Ireland last week, and, naturally, we were all waiting for this announcement."
"Thank you for your comments."
"Madam President, as you were informed earlier this week, I was in Scotland protesting against the Trident nuclear submarine base there and I was arrested."
"What is the situation concerning our immunity in other Member States?"
"I understood that we could not be arrested in such circumstances."
"I have nothing against the Scottish Police."
"They were extremely courteous."
"They were aware of the concept of peaceful demonstration."
"Maybe they should train the police in places like Genoa and show them how to react to peaceful protests."
"What is the situation regarding our immunity?"
"I was not breaking the peace, but trying to keep the peace by helping to rid the world of nuclear weapons."
"Secondly, in relation to my immunity: Does that not count when I am in another country?"
"Mrs McKenna, I had, of course, been informed of the situation that you were in and I am pleased to see that you are back with us."
"We shall thoroughly examine the issue regarding protocol."
"I shall of course take the appropriate steps to ensure that Members are properly protected, if this is necessary."
"Madam President, after that intervention inspired by naked self-interest, may I come back to more important matters of the day."
"I would like to support my colleague, Mr Cashman, and in particular point out that this Parliament has been a very active supporter of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland."
"It has been a long, and at times faltering, road to achieving peace and no one knows that better than our own Nobel Peace Prizewinner, John Hume."
"I grew up in Northern Ireland in the shadow of violence, terrorism and intimidation."
"We are now witnessing another milestone in the return to peace for future generations."
"May I ask you therefore to write on behalf of the European Parliament to all those involved and congratulate them on this major initiative?"
"I would also hope that the Belgium presidency would do the same on behalf of the Council for the 15 Member States."
"Mrs McCarthy, I shall certainly do what you ask."
"I can tell you that all those I met were more than aware of the European Parliament' s long-standing contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland."
"Madam President, I do not wish to delay proceedings, but just to follow up on the point, which has been made on a number of occasions, about parliamentary immunity."
"I could be wrong, but my understanding is that the purpose of parliamentary immunity for Members of Parliament acting in the Parliament - not outside the Parliament - is to allow you to represent the people who elected you."
"It is not so that you can necessarily represent your own views in whatever manner you choose."
"In other words, when you are outside this House, you are just the same as anyone else."
"You are on your own."
"Mr Beazley, questions of immunity are always very delicate, as you know, and Mr Duff has been appointed to draft a report on the issue."
"I suggest that he also take account of all the very interesting points that you have both brought up, so that the document written on this is as comprehensive as possible."
"I would like to thank Mr Duff for doing this."
"Madam President, as an Italian, I would like to thank Mrs McKenna for urging the Italian police to follow the example of the Scottish police."
"I would also like to express my sorrow at her unfortunate experience and my appreciation of her commitment to social concerns."
"I would like to thank her on behalf of the Italian police, which, however, I feel is no worse than any other police force in Europe."
"In all probability, the Scottish police were polite and courteous because, if one police force should imitate another, it may be that protesters should imitate other protesters too."
"What I mean is the Scottish police were polite and courteous because the protesters who were with Mrs McKenna did not follow the example of the protesters in Genoa."
"Thank you, Mr Santini."
"European Council meeting (Ghent, 19 October 2001)"
"The next item is the European Council report and the Commission statement on the meeting of 19 October 2001 in Ghent."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, true to tradition, I have come here today, a few days after the meeting of the European Council in Ghent, to report on the discussions we held there."
"And rest assured: I shall be brief and to the point."
"This European Council in Ghent was, in fact, already the second meeting under Belgian Presidency, and was, like the previous meeting on 21 September in Brussels, overshadowed by the effects of the attacks in New York and Washington. That was, of course, to be expected."
"The events of 11 September will be etched on our minds forever, and the international community and the international alliance have meanwhile taken concrete action against terrorism."
"Originally, as you know, the Ghent Summit was conceived as an informal platform for exchanging ideas about the Union' s enlargement and particularly the Laeken Declaration, which is to structure and launch the debate on the future of Europe later on in the year."
"In addition, it was our initial intention to carry out a final assessment of the introduction of the euro."
"Indeed, in my opinion, it was up to the Council, as a kind of benign father figure, to carry out a final check to ensure that all preparations were in place for a successful introduction of the European single currency."
"However, as is often the case - that is, in any case, what I have gleaned from people who have far more experience as Presidents of the Council - the news has somewhat played havoc with that agenda, and with good reason, in my view."
"The events of 11 September are of unprecedented and immense significance, and I think that as the days go by, it is becoming increasingly clear that the world after 11 September will never be the same."
"A new, global order is upon us. It is a new, multipolar world within which the European Union will need to play a more prominent role."
"Yesterday, I was able to give my initial views on this in Poland to mark the start of the academic year of the Europe College."
"However, to have major views on something is, of course, one thing, yet to involve the Union in this crisis as a united front, is quite another."
"A month ago, on 21 September exactly, we managed to persuade the Union to adopt one clear, unambiguous and common position."
"At the same time, we rubberstamped a far-reaching and detailed action plan against terrorism."
"From the Council' s final declaration last Friday in Ghent, it appears that we have managed to sustain this unanimous approach fully."
"Three elements are essential in this unanimous approach and I should like to outline them briefly."
"The military action which started on 7 October receives our unqualified support."
"The action is justified by resolution 1368 of the UN Security Council and we attach the greatest importance to protecting the life of civilians in the process."
"After the conflict, we also want a normal government to be established in Afghanistan, a stable government, a representative government that respects human rights."
"A government of this kind will be able to count on extensive European aid for the reconstruction of that country."
"Meanwhile, we, along with the Union, will - more than ever before - commit to granting humanitarian aid to the many millions of Afghan refugees."
"Our commitment in this respect is to ensure that no country in the region becomes the victim of this conflict as a result of the influx of displaced."
"In fact, the presidency received from the Council the mandate to visit that region to obtain political support for the replacement of the Taliban regime."
"The prompt and comprehensive implementation of the action plan against terrorism is the second element that I wish to underline briefly."
"With regard to the creation of a European arrest warrant, I believe it is safe to say that we have reached a break-through."
"The abolition of dual criminality was now accepted by everyone in the Council, not only for terrorist acts, but also for other serious crimes."
"As far as the list of terrorist organisations is concerned, it was decided that that should be completed and laid down by the end of the year."
"In addition, we discussed the proposals submitted by our American partners in the Council, and it was agreed in the Council to reinforce our action plan, if necessary."
"At the end, the Commission and the Council were also commissioned to draw up a programme of cooperation among the Member States to fight terrorism involving biological and chemical weapons."
"In that programme, a European coordinator for civilian protection will be appointed, among other things."
"Thirdly, the Union has a more active role to play in the prevention of, and fight against, hotbeds and conflicts."
"Mr Javier Solana, Mr Louis Michel, myself and the Commission, of course, will try to crank up a new dialogue in the countries of the Middle East or at least try to create the conditions for resuming the peace process."
"In this connection, the Council sent a clear message on Friday that it takes at least two States for peace to be possible."
"Moreover, we, along with the Council, have once again warned against the risk of the Islamic world embracing terrorism."
"We should instead intensify the dialogue between Europe and the Arab and Islamic world."
"Allow me to say, Madam President, that last Friday' s clear-cut decisions immediately put the 'incident' surrounding the preliminary meeting of the French President, the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor into perspective."
"The impression of a triumvirate in the making, one which would probably not have been around if the meeting had taken place elsewhere or at a different time - was reduced to its true proportions after the three people involved assured me that the consultation was one about purely technical-military matters."
"I have accepted that explanation, partly to prevent this issue from dominating the European Council in Ghent, and I have repeated in the Council that it is the fifteen Member States who establish the positions jointly in the European Union."
"(FR) Madam President, last Friday' s discussions were not restricted to current international events."
"The work session on Friday afternoon also dealt with the economic situation and the imminent introduction of euro notes and coins."
"The slowdown in growth, which, we must reiterate, had already started before 11 September, and the longer-term uncertainty tell us that we must be careful."
"The foundations of the economy, however, remain healthy, which inspired both myself and the Council to be cautiously optimistic."
"It is essential that Europe - which has no budgetary surplus - observes the Stability and Growth Pact."
"Low inflation and permanent wage moderation are enabling the EU to make room for manoeuvre on monetary policy."
"We must, however, intensify our efforts in terms of structural reform and accelerate the Lisbon process in order to strengthen the growth potential of the European Union."
"With regard to the physical introduction of euro notes and coins, preparations are well underway."
"We have, however, identified a few problems, particularly concerning preparations by local authorities and small businesses."
"We do not want consumers to experience any negative effects."
"The introduction of euro notes and coins must not bring about price increases."
"The European Council additionally asked the ECOFIN Council to adopt a regulation before the Laeken Summit to ensure that the costs of cross-border financial transactions are reduced and brought into line with national rates."
"During the second part of our meeting, we discussed the issues relating to the future of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration."
"I think it is true to say that we made significant progress."
"There is now broad consensus, also at the specific request of the European Parliament, on the principle of a convention."
"This Convention will be able to begin its work in March of next year."
"I believe that we have agreed on this approach."
"We also agreed that the candidate countries would fully participate in this Convention. However, they will be unable - and I think this goes without saying - to question the proposals on which the Fifteen have already unanimously agreed."
"I also believe that the key to the success of this Convention lies in it having a very small leadership and a limited number of delegations."
"Furthermore, in the near future, I plan to invite the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs of the European Parliament, in order to have a frank and detailed exchange of views with them on the future of the European Union."
"Madam President, I do not believe that the Laeken Declaration must be a conventional declaration, and it must, above all, be a source of inspiration."
"First of all, it must be based on a critical analysis, in order to reveal the true challenges facing an enlarged and competent Union, which include the redistribution of competences in both directions - in other words, towards the European Union as well as towards the Member States - a solution to the proliferation of instruments in the European Union, institutions that are more democratic and which ensure, amongst others, a full co-decision procedure involving the European Parliament, the first steps of a process that leads to the treaties being divided into one fundamental treaty and several executing treaties and, lastly, a new position and a new role for the European Union on the world stage."
"In my view, there are no taboo subjects as far as this Convention is concerned and no stone can remain unturned."
"At Ghent, we also - and lastly, because this was the final topic we dealt with - gave an update on the progress made in the negotiations with the candidate countries."
"The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, presented a positive report to us on this issue."
"There is no reason to fear, in my view, that the proposed schedule will not be observed."
"In any case, I intend to send an additional message to the candidate countries in my speech at the Laeken Summit."
"I met the new Polish prime minister yesterday and urged him to step up efforts so that Poland can once again take up its rightful place in the negotiations, because, following the events of 11 September, enlargement is needed now more than ever before."
"I would now like to give a general report on the Council meeting."
"The streets were calm."
"Ghent has, however - this is the truth, and I know as I live there - a rather turbulent history."
"The reason for this may be because Charles the Fifth was born there!"
"Whatever the reason, my overriding desire is to continue dialogue with the anti-globalisation protesters."
"I think it is true to say that the term 'anti-globalisation' is, in fact, inaccurate."
"We must take a different approach - not towards blind globalisation or anti-globalisation, but rather towards a well-defined globalisation."
"This is a different kind of globalisation; it is an ethical globalisation."
"Madam President, I am organising a debate on this subject at the University of Ghent on 30 October 2001."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the next European Council will meet in exactly 50 days."
"Ghent was an informal Council in the true sense of the word, which will certainly help us to make great progress in Laeken, in other words, to develop a common policy on asylum, immigration and justice, to declare operational the common foreign and security policy, to move closer towards enlargement and - which I think the most important thing - to adopt an ambitious declaration on the future of Europe."
"Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by saying that the Commission welcomes with great satisfaction some good news, at last, which has come in recent days, namely that the Irish Republican Army has started to decommission its arms in accordance with the Good Friday agreement."
"The Commission will follow the consolidation of the reconciliation process in Northern Ireland closely, not least through our Peace programme."
"Following the attacks on 11 September against the United States - our longstanding allies - the European Union has publicly committed itself to doing all it can to help bring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these acts to justice, and to holding accountable those hiding, supporting or harbouring them."
"We thus pledged our complete solidarity with the government and people of the United States."
"Over the days that followed, I was very pleased to see this declaration of solidarity translated into swift, concerted action at European level."
"Mr Patten, the Belgian foreign minister, Mr Michel, and Mr Solana went first to Washington and then on to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria to help build a global alliance against terrorism."
"European authorities began rapidly stepping up intelligence and police cooperation, both within the EU and with third countries, especially the US."
"On the basis of emergency legislation agreed at Community level, the European Union froze over EUR 100 million of assets of people suspected of terrorism."
"It drew up uniform, Union-wide standards to improve security for air travellers."
"It tabled proposals for a common definition of terrorism, for a system of EU-wide penalties for terrorist offences and for a European arrest warrant."
"These proposals were firmly supported by the European Council at its extraordinary meeting on 21 September."
"On that occasion, the Council called upon each European Union country to 'contribute according to its means' to the new global campaign against terrorism, and this is, indeed, what has been happening, with some countries mobilising or offering troops and others providing intelligence or making available air bases."
"Despite the importance and success of this joint action, the fact is that media attention has largely been focused on what individual countries have been doing."
"This has somewhat obscured and tainted the ongoing debate on the specific role Europe as a whole should be playing on the international stage."
"That is precisely the issue I want to focus on today."
"From the very start of my term of office, one of my Commission' s objectives has been to consolidate Europe' s influence in the world."
"This has become even more urgent in the light of the new world situation."
"If the European Union is to be a leading actor on the world stage, it must speak with a single, clear, dynamic voice and it must support its words with unified action."
"The Union has made progress in this direction, it cannot be denied."
"You only have to compare, for example, the disparate attitudes of our Member States to the Gulf War, a decade ago, with our recent united stance on the situation in the FYROM and our present coherent response to terrorism."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Belgian Presidency for the excellent work it has done to promote this process and for the courageous and intelligent way in which it has maintained support for the Union' s common, shared goals."
"However, we are still a very long way from achieving the genuinely common foreign and security policy we so badly need."
"I am therefore very glad that, in the Union' s declaration of 14 September, we publicly committed ourselves to developing our common foreign and security policy and to ensuring that the Union really can speak out clearly and with one voice."
"A common policy is not, of course, the same thing as a single policy uniformly adopted by every Member State."
"No, a common policy pools the different strengths of the individual countries, enabling them to pursue shared goals using shared instruments."
"Has Europe been 'absent' , as some people allege?"
"My answer is 'No' although we need to make a certain distinction here."
"Europe is taking very specific, effective action in those fields where integration is a possibility or a practical reality."
"This is not at all surprising, since the Community method has, for the last fifty years, ensured that Europe can act effectively, rapidly and visibly in all the fields in which this is possible."
"It is in areas where Europe is less integrated, where the Community method is virtually or wholly absent, that the European Union seriously lacks effectiveness."
"This hard fact should make us even more resolute in our preparations for the major future political developments in the Union."
"A common policy ensures that the different national policies are co-ordinated within a Community framework according to the Community method so that they serve the interests of the Union as a whole."
"In the field of the common foreign and security policy we have not yet reached that point because the necessary consensus has not yet been achieved."
"We are in a transition period, so to speak."
"However, that must be our objective. We must lose no time in establishing a policy that builds on our experience of Community action and makes full use of the tools available to us."
"Our first priority must be to be united in our action."
"In my view, individual action taken by only a few countries is in the interests neither of the Union as a whole nor of its individual Member States, be they large or small."
"At Ghent, I noted that no Member State wants to move in that direction, but the Commission will remain vigilant, on behalf of us all."
"Secondly, we need specific institutional mechanisms for taking policy decisions."
"That is the kind of common foreign and security policy we must develop, building on the progress we have already made, and we need to develop it fast if we are to make any useful impact on the world now emerging after the tragedy of September 11."
"I am pleased to note that Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs has discussed at length and with great care the implications of the common foreign and security policy for the functioning of the institutions and, in particular, of the Council."
"I welcome the proposals put forward in the Poos report and I commend Mr Poos for his achievements in addressing these so very delicate and sensitive issues."
"I call upon this House to endorse them fully today and upon the Council to undertake to implement them as soon as possible."
"The Commission is ready to play its full part in this necessary process."
"The statements issued on 14 September have important implications for the Union' s foreign policy priorities."
"In the short to medium term, we must focus even more on our dialogue with the Arab and Islamic worlds, on the Middle East peace process, for the Middle East is at the centre of the current world events, and on exploiting the full potential of the Barcelona process - and this is where our task lies."
"The time has come to make new moves in our Mediterranean policy."
"The results we have achieved so far have not been altogether satisfactory, though this has not always - or rather has often not - been our fault."
"We must now take full advantage of all the opportunities open to us to ensure genuine progress."
"The Euro-Mediterranean region must aim at genuine economic integration and at setting up institutional mechanisms for taking common decisions."
"We are also widely expected to play a new role in the Middle East."
"We must take practical, joint action to respond to this challenge which, although tough, is within our capabilities."
"Further afield, we need to review our policies on trade and co-operation with Pakistan, India and Iran as well as with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States."
"Tangible progress has been made with regard to Pakistan in recent days."
"I also believe we should be ready to respond to the renewed signs of interest in joint action on shared goals - such as the fight against AIDS - coming from countries like Libya."
"This is a completely new development."
"Once again, Europe is in an excellent position to respond to these political signals and to help such countries join our alliance."
"We also need to work energetically to develop a consistent, active policy in relations between the Union and all its neighbours. Partnerships with specific goals, institutions and resources, particularly in our relations with Russia and the Ukraine."
"Partnerships that will ensure lasting stability in our continent. This time of change is also the right time to boost these policies."
"Lastly, world wide, we have to build fresh confidence, and one key way we can do so in the immediate future is to successfully launch a new round of world trade talks."
"At the same time, we must work harder to offer the world' s poorest regions a genuine chance of sustainable development."
"I have said it before, and I will say it again: we must guide the process of globalisation so that it works for the good of all, poor as well as rich."
"We Europeans must be proud of the policies we have been pursuing as we prepare for enlargement, for they are the only democratic globalisation policies thus far developed in the world, and I would stress that: the European Union project is the only democratic globalisation process in existence."
"We therefore have to tackle, energetically, boldly and imaginatively, the global issues that breed resentment and discontent such as poverty, widening gaps in income and the now intolerable economic and social imbalances."
"These are the things that sow frustration and tension in relations between the developing world and the West."
"The anti-terrorism alliance must advance hand in hand with a development alliance, with the Union leading by example."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Extraordinary European Council Meeting of 21 September asked the Commission to analyse the economic impact of the terrorist attacks."
"We did so immediately, and the Commission presented its report to the Ghent European Council."
"The European economy was clearly slowing down even before 11 September."
"The immediate consequence of the terrorist attacks was a further loss of consumer confidence and a widespread sense of uncertainty."
"However, there are several positive factors to bear in mind, factors that enable us to face the current shock much more calmly than in similar circumstances in the past."
"Firstly, the fundamental aspects of our economy."
"The European economy, unlike that of the United States, is free of trade imbalances and Europeans still have a very strong tendency to save."
"Moreover, unlike in previous crises, the Union has been largely protected from possible shockwaves of devaluations and counter-devaluations of currencies by the existence of a solid, reliable single currency, the euro."
"Just think what would have happened if we had not had the euro!"
"The events of recent weeks should make us even more proud of the quantum leap forward that the euro has allowed us to take."
"Secondly, our programme."
"We are undertaking structural reforms, following a strategy carefully defined at Lisbon."
"The reforms are far from complete, but the present crisis should strengthen our political resolve to see them through."
"I therefore call upon this House and the Council to stop hesitating and to speed up the approval of all the decisions taken at and after Lisbon to make the European economy more efficient."
"Only if we meet the Lisbon objectives and targets will we be able to minimise the extent and duration of unemployment and maximise growth potential in the medium and long term."
"Thirdly, our instruments."
"We have achieved significant control of taxes that will still give us some room for manoeuvre during the slowdown."
"However, the problem of coordinating our economic policies arises at this stage in all its severity, and it arises because, in this sector too, we continue to have difficulty in applying the Community method."
"On the basis of this, I conveyed to the European Council two messages."
"Firstly, the information currently available shows that our economy is genuinely resilient."
"If not an optimistic message, this at least gives no cause for concern."
"Secondly, however, we need to continue to monitor economic trends closely, not only in the Union and the euro zone but also worldwide."
"If the situation changes we must be ready to act using the instruments available to us."
"Once again, let me stress the importance of co-ordinated action."
"With the current degree of integration, all action must be properly co-ordinated at Eurozone and European Union level."
"In the present uncertain situation, we must show that we are acting in a co-ordinated manner and that we have the will to use all the available instruments."
"Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, this is a time for the greatest possible unity, determination and resolution."
"We must ensure that lasting hope comes out of the evil of 11 September."
"Our peoples' reactions to the recent events show that Europe needs to be more, not less present."
"If Europe is to fully live up to its pledge of solidarity - solidarity with the United States but also the safeguarding of global solidarity - the Member States of the European Union must genuinely act as one Community."
"The Commission will continue to work tirelessly to achieve this."
"(Loud applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the Ghent statement on terrorism, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we also say that words must now be backed up by deeds."
"It is not acceptable that this is the second time that the Heads of State and Government have made recommendations which are then not promptly put into effect by the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice."
"We call upon the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice to act with speed."
"We also say, above all, that cooperation merely between States cannot continue as at present."
"Important issues of home affairs and justice policy must also be dealt with on the basis of Community law, and the Commission must have a central role in observing the situation and implementing Community law."
"Continuity is not achieved by the Presidency of the Council rotating every six months."
"Continuity must also be ensured by the European Commission and the European institutions."
"I ask you also, in your capacity as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium, to resolve the issue of the security of the European institutions, including the European Parliament in Brussels, with a solution that will be satisfactory both in principle and in practice."
"We have to make Europe's voice heard more."
"It was surely right for prominent individuals from the European Union to go to visit the American President, but I find it no longer acceptable that, for example, the situation arises where the American Secretary of State appears before the television cameras with three prominent Europeans alongside him."
"We will have to learn lessons for the future from this; a crisis is always also an opportunity. We need one European face to represent us to the world!"
"(Applause)"
"We now have a coalition against terrorism."
"Our group supports it unreservedly."
"We now, though, also need a coalition to rebuild Afghanistan."
"I welcome the position you have taken on this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council."
"Afghanistan has been suffering for twenty years."
"We must make an effort as a Community, also at an international level, to give Afghanistan a good future."
"You and the President of the Commission have spoken rightly about the Middle East."
"Our group rejects the deliberate killing of people, be it in Palestine or in Israel."
"We call on the parties involved to at last give a signal for peace."
"We want there to be cooperation, we want there to be a Palestinian state and we want Israel to be able to live within recognised and secure borders."
"We urge all those involved to take a step away from the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and towards one of cooperation, peace and mutual understanding."
"(Applause)"
"We see the Mediterranean dialogue as an important challenge."
"It is for that reason that we have proposed the Euro-Mediterranean Meeting in Brussels on 8 November."
"I wish to thank Mrs Fontaine for promptly implementing our joint decision in the Conference of Presidents."
"We hope that this will send a message about cooperation with the Arab and Islamic world."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are in broad agreement with you as regards Laeken, but please ensure that the Convention does not only have the task of enumerating options."
"Its task will be, rather, to present a majority proposal."
"There may of course also be a minority vote."
"This must not lead to negotiations without binding effect."
"That is not what we expect of the Convention, but rather a proposal which can then go to the Heads of State and Government for discussion."
"We also expect this Convention not to have too large a bureau."
"It is crucial that five persons should be represented in it: the chairman/chairwoman and the representatives of the four institutions involved."
"This body must exercise real leadership, taking the Convention into a better future."
"We would like to see this Convention's work timetabled in such a way that it can conclude a Treaty in 2003 under the Italian Presidency, a Treaty that we hope will lead to the fundamental treaty of which you have spoken."
"Let me make another observation, a very practical one."
"In Ghent, you discussed transfers between bank accounts in different countries of the European Union, a question which one might think not to be so important."
"Our Parliament, though, has put forward a proposal by means of Mrs Peijs' report."
"We have made clear that the high costs incurred in bank transfers are not acceptable."
"I think that the Heads of State and Government have done the right thing in taking this issue on board."
"Please permit me one final observation: there has been a certain amount of friction between the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, which is very regrettable in view of the Presidency of the Council being held by Belgium."
"At issue was our common presentation of ourselves to the public - who said what, and when."
"There was a certain annoyance because three Member States had met together."
"I want neither to play that up nor to ignore it."
"I would, though, like to point out to all the European institutions that our Europe is so complicated that it must not be a Europe of vanities or a Europe of dominance, but all the institutions must meet each other halfway."
"It is important that we understand each other and work together, for our common European future is at stake."
"I hope that the crisis in which the world currently finds itself will bring the European institutions together and lead them to common action for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, following the European Council in Ghent, my group feels both hope and concern."
"Hope, because in Northern Ireland arms are being entombed in concrete, and concern, because we are facing a long fight against global terrorism, which we must pursue with conviction, perseverance and courage."
"This fight is not limited to what appears in the television pictures, whether they be from Al Jazeera or from CNN."
"We must deal with the response measures authorised by the United Nations, but we must also make a significant effort in the humanitarian field and in terms of reconstruction and stabilisation, both in Afghanistan and in many other parts of the world."
"The European Union can play an important role in this context."
"With regard to what the President-in-Office of the Council said about the Ghent meeting, I would like to point out that in Helsinki the European Council decided to create a rapid intervention force which is still not operational."
"The prior meeting of certain Member States was inappropriate."
"I also believe - and I address this to both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission - that we must show unity at all times and it is highly significant that, after a European Council, the President of the Commission should appear shoulder to shoulder with the President-in-Office of the Council to announce the decisions adopted."
"With regard to the relationship between the European Council and the specific Councils, I would point out that the European Parliament is making an effort to speed up the negotiation of the measures you have proposed, but this is not being treated in a corresponding fashion by the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would recommend that, before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken, you read in detail the report by my group colleague, Mr Poos, who is the person with the most historical experience of the Council."
"It may help you to present interesting proposals."
"With regard to our relations with the Islamic countries and the Arab world, we believe that the forum we are going to relaunch at the beginning of November may be positive."
"My political family is also trying to re-establish links and the new tour of the Middle East which you have announced is very important, with an active approach by the Union to the resolution of this absolutely key conflict."
"As for the economy, please allow me to make a brief point: inflation is decreasing, there are margins, but the European Union' s policy must be active and anti-cyclic, and we still have a Central Bank which takes decisions and a Council which makes recommendations."
"The Union needs economic leadership."
"And since you have said that you are going to the University of Ghent for a debate on globalisation, I would also ask you to take the European Parliament' s report on the reform of the international financial system."
"With regard to the Tobin tax, your political friends have voted against what was proposed in ECOFIN and what my group presented as an amendment."
"As for the future of Europe, I would like to point out that the Convention is not a war of opposing positions, but must be a joint effort."
"We are making progress and you are gradually retracting, and that is not good."
"I am grateful that the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs have been convened."
"On behalf of my group, I can tell you that we have two concerns: one, that there should be balanced representation between European parliamentarians and those of the Member States, both in the Convention and in the Presidency; secondly, that the Convention should make a difference and not just be a talking shop or a debating club, and should make coherent proposals."
"Lastly, the proposals should lead to a decision by the Intergovernmental Conference before the 2004 elections in order to honour our commitments in the field of enlargement."
"And in relation to enlargement, I must say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council - and here there have also been some interpretation problems - that the final exam will be taken at the end of 2002."
"I am pleased that you were in Poland yesterday."
"I was there on Saturday and I would like to say that I am surprised that the conservatives of the Union are beginning to say that Poland is becoming a problem because a party of the Left has won."
"Poland was a much bigger problem before, because it did not have a solvent government and I believe that, although there always has to be a degree of political competition, we must support Poland, which now has a strong government with a clear desire to take part in the future of Europe."
"Madam President, I should like to begin - as other colleagues have done today - with a reference to the milestone event in Northern Ireland."
"The verified decommissioning of IRA weapons has been a necessary and required act for a considerable period of time."
"It was long overdue, but now that it has happened, it is hugely welcome."
"Particularly since 11 September it has been increasingly inevitable that such an act should take place."
"I hope it represents a new dawn, a rebirth, a renaissance for the peace process in Northern Ireland and that all the political actors will now seize this moment to ground and root the peace in the institutions of that agreement."
"I add my voice to those who have asked all the institutions today, in the clearest terms, to welcome what has happened on behalf of the European Union."
"I want to say to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, with regard to the Ghent Council, that my group totally supports the clearest and most unequivocal assurances you have given of total solidarity with the United States."
"That is an important act of solidarity, and an important point of departure."
"I reiterate, for my group, that we totally support this."
"If I do not dwell on this, it is simply because there are one or two questions I should like to raise with you, Mr President-in-Office."
"In particular, we have had rather a long debate about the potential humanitarian crisis."
"Clearly for areas within control of the Taliban, we cannot blame the world community for Taliban unwillingness to engage with the United Nations, NGOs and others."
"But I would like to know what specific initiatives we, as the European Union, with our commitment of resources in this area, are now taking to urge Pakistan to open more space for refugees."
"I appreciate the enormous difficulties."
"I appreciate they already have two million or more Afghanis within their territory, but can we not, with our financial and organisational capacity, reassure those authorities that if the borders are opened to cope with this crisis they will not be left alone or have to pick up the tab on their own?"
"I should like to turn to the question of the role of the Council of Ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism."
"In particular, I note the strategic leadership which you offered through the Council at the extraordinary meeting on 21 September."
"There you made a clear plea to the institutions to seize that moment and act."
"Here I congratulate the Commission for taking the European Council at its word and bringing forward with extraordinary speed a comprehensive measure to freeze the assets of terrorist organisations."
"I can tell you in this Parliament that within 24 hours of receiving that, and with the proviso that we should review it in the lifetime of this Parliament, we too seized the moment."
"That had no precedent ever in European law making."
"It was with some regret then that one noticed that, if there was a delay, it was among your 'line managers' from the European Council down to the Council of Ministers."
"I have a number of questions: What is the Council doing on the freezing of assets?"
"But I have an important question around it."
"Can you explain to me, Prime Minister, what does this mean about the quality of governance in the European Union?"
"After all, the Council is there to give a strategic lead."
"You gave it, the Commission followed; this House followed."
"The question is: Why did the Council of Ministers not follow with the same alacrity?"
"I would like to pose one other question in relation to the Convention."
"The Prime Minister has explained to us that the candidate states will participate."
"I very much welcome that."
"I ask the Prime Minister to clarify, in the light of the agreement at Helsinki, that all candidate countries will be treated on an equal basis."
"Does that invitation extend to Turkey?"
"It is important that Turkey should be included, based on the principles clarified at Helsinki."
"I know it is not a negotiating state, but Helsinki established a clear principle of equality of treatment for candidate states."
"To summarise: What will we do with Pakistan and humanitarian aid?"
"What does the example of the freezing of assets tell us about the rather dysfunctional quality of governance?"
"Will Turkey be a participant in the process?"
"Finally, I am glad to see that the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office, today at least, are sharing a platform in the European Parliament."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, we know that when all European Councils draw to a close, they either give us grounds for satisfaction or grounds for disappointment."
"One of the grounds for satisfaction is always the number of well-intentioned declarations, and one of the grounds for disappointment is usually the way these are implemented."
"I shall restrict my comments to the chapter on the follow-up to the 11 September attacks and the fight against terrorism and I would like to give my views on this on behalf of my group."
"We welcome the statement that humanitarian aid for Afghanistan and neighbouring countries is an absolute priority, but unfortunately, we do not welcome the specific actions taken."
"If we want to take specific action and provide vital and essential food aid to the civilian population at risk, we must respond to the appeals by numerous key figures and NGOs and suspend the bombings."
"We have had enough indications and warnings, spelling out that a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent, as winter in Afghanistan is approaching, which is usually extremely harsh."
"We now know that the civilian population is paying a high price for the war, and the Council, in declaring its staunchest support for the military operations, is turning a blind eye to this situation."
"The pre-summit meeting between the Heads of State and Government in Ghent, other than the fact that, to my mind, it is a failure compared to the real summit, demonstrated that the Heads of State and Government give military cooperation with the United States priority over a concerted political approach at European Union level. It also relegates the humanitarian, diplomatic and all other types of initiatives to the background."
"With regard to the commitment to fight against terrorism and to protect the population against these acts of terrorism, it goes without saying that the commitment made by the Council is to be welcomed, but an unambiguous definition of terrorism is clearly needed as far as legislative initiatives are concerned in order to avoid any confusion and the criminalisation of any anti-establishment behaviour or activities, which are, however, political in nature and legitimate nonetheless."
"Our group has a number of concerns regarding the declaration in which the European Union states that it is willing to undertake reciprocal initiatives with the United States, particularly to facilitate judicial assistance and extradition."
"Regarding extradition, we are aware that the death penalty is still in force in the United States and therefore this poses a huge problem for the European Union."
"Regarding judicial assistance, we are concerned about ensuring that civil liberties are protected and that personal data protection is not diminished as a result of this cooperation with the United States."
"One of the important chapters concerns the protection of the population, and we welcome the joint efforts made with regard to non-proliferation and export controls on weapons and chemical, bacteriological and nuclear substances capable of being used for terrorist purposes."
"Therefore, intensifying our joint efforts is a very positive move, but we may wonder why the important question of industrial activities has not been mentioned at all, particularly with regard to nuclear power stations and re-processing plants, where large quantities of radioactive and fissile substances are stored, which could cause an ecological and social catastrophe in the event of an aircraft crash, intentional or otherwise."
"The Council statement does not contain a single reference to this issue, and I think that this is a serious oversight."
"To sum up, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, I think that it is true to say that we are particularly disappointed by the outcome of this Summit."
"I do not wish to have to relive this disappointment at the Laeken Summit, and I am pleased to note that Mr Verhofstadt is determined to give the European Union a new role and to open up genuine dialogue on a topic that has been slightly overworked in recent weeks, in other words, globalisation."
"I am pleased that he has changed the vocabulary he was using to refer to this matter, since he has rejected the term 'anti-globalisation,' which was essentially inappropriate."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, President Prodi, firstly, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the comments that have been made by colleagues here this morning and by you, Madam President and President Prodi on the good news from Ireland on the decommissioning of arms."
"I very much want to put on record once again the important part Parliament and the Commission played in helping the peace process at a time when this help was very much needed."
"We have had a dramatic breakthrough in the last 24 hours, but let nobody here take it for granted that the road to peace - a just and lasting peace - is going to be easy."
"Of course, the great majority of people on the island of Ireland are genuinely in search of this just and lasting peace, but, regrettably, a small minority will do their best to try and derail the process."
"We must all be on the watch for that."
"I very much welcome the fact that the European Union leaders unequivocally stated their full support for the action that has been taken in the fight against terrorism in all its aspects and reaffirmed their solidarity with the American government."
"They have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a United Nations framework."
"I believe that the United Nations has a very important and leading role to play in this regard."
"Present and future actions in the fight against international terrorism should and must emanate from the membership of the United Nations."
"We are all concerned that civilian populations must be shielded from the attacks which are taking place in Afghanistan at this time and, in a war situation, there is nothing more sickening than one hearing commentators refer to civilian deaths as 'collateral damage'."
"We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected."
"Humanitarian aid for the Afghan people must be a priority and such aid must cover the needs of the Afghan population and Afghan refugees, EU governments are fully committed to ensuring that such aid reaches these people in need."
"We want to ensure that this is done."
"Winter is due to start very shortly in Afghanistan, and these winters are exceptionally cold and difficult."
"I believe that the international community, including the European Union and the United Nations, must estimate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the next few months and ensure that all the necessary humanitarian aid is delivered."
"We must also, remember that the war against terrorism is being fought on many different fronts."
"Within the Union, there must be formal adoption of the EU directive on money laundering."
"We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations."
"We can confiscate the financial proceeds of drug barons in Europe and we must be able to extend these powers of confiscation to other financial proceeds of crime."
"There must be a speedy ratification by the Union's Member States of the United Nations Convention for the suppressing of the financing of terrorism."
"EU governments at Ghent supported the implementation of a common European arrest warrant, and our EU Justice Ministers are due to meet on 7 December 2001 to put in place the final terms governing the operation of this warrant."
"It is very important, in my view, that there is a clear definition of terrorist acts, as a national cannot and should not be extradited from one country in Europe to another unless the specified crime is a crime in his or her host Member State."
"Finally, we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile."
"The present instability and violence cannot and must not continue indefinitely."
"I believe that the Israeli troops must withdraw from the territories of the Palestinian Authority."
"I would appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to do everything possible to negotiate a settlement based on the recommendations of the Mitchell report."
"Madam President, Prime Minister and President of the Commission, at the Ghent Summit we saw the trinity, or 'dictorium' , of the big three countries make an appearance."
"The preliminary meeting between Great Britain, France and Germany suggests a model that is as far from the federalists' vision, or illusion, of a democratic federal State as it is from the Eurosceptics' more realistic desire for a Europe of democracies."
"Cooperation between the big three is engaged in on an intergovernmental basis, behind closed doors and without democratic control."
"In this way, the big three decide what the others are to think."
"For the small countries, intergovernmental cooperation between the big countries may come across as supranational dictates."
"The summits are also conducted behind closed doors and without democratic control."
"European integration is now modelled on the way in which private holding companies operate."
"A minority of the largest shareholders is able to make decisions on behalf of the majority."
"Cooperation can thus be intergovernmental and supranational at one and the same time and combine the defects of these arrangements with the maximum lack of openness, democracy and proximity to the people."
"The summits must be transformed into well-prepared meetings in which small and large countries and all parliaments have an equal part to play in the preparations."
"Summits must be opened up to elected representatives so that representatives of the national parliaments are able to exercise democratic control by being present there."
"Summits should also be opened up to the press whenever prime ministers discuss legislation and other issues which, in our Member States, are dealt with openly."
"Mr Verhofstadt is still a young prime minister from a country that has traditionally opposed the big countries' dictatorial way of thinking."
"Have nothing to do with this, Prime Minister!"
"Invite elected representatives to the next summit in Laeken."
"Do not make a decision to begin a constitutional process without its first having been discussed with the electorate in our countries."
"Let the next treaty be formulated through the input of grassroots contributions instead of its coming like a thief in the night to limit our democracy."
"Make sure, too, that the 49% of the electorate that voted against Maastricht in France and the majority of the electorate who recently voted 'no' in Ireland and Denmark can feel they are properly represented in the forthcoming convention."
"Promise, above all, that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the countries. In that way, you will be obliged to design a treaty that can be adopted, that is to say, a treaty characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people."
"President of the Commission, I am speaking on behalf of the European radical Members of the Bonino List."
"We welcome the European government' s support of the United States institutions, although we hope that they will manage to continue to resist the anti-American, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist instincts which are so powerful within the political groupings in Europe."
"However, we would criticise the delays in presenting a humanitarian aid plan and its lack of practical content in the face of a potential humanitarian disaster."
"On a more general note, it is not right to focus on the difficult nature of the European Union' s political role without addressing the issue of the democratic nature of the institutions themselves."
"We have talked about how important it is for the Fifteen to act in unity and with all speed and to assume a common position."
"In our opinion, unity between the Fifteen is valuable when it is achieved through public - and therefore accountable, democratic - debate."
"It is of much less value when it is reached in closed meetings held in secret meeting rooms which are inaccessible to democratic scrutiny."
"An example of this is cooperation in justice and home affairs."
"We are all in favour of the European area of justice and police cooperation, but these are extremely sensitive areas which involve fundamental rights and freedoms and the 15 penal codes of our Member States."
"It is unacceptable for any democratic debate to be dispensed with, either in the national parliaments or the European Parliament, on issues relating to rights guaranteed by constitutions, in the name of the need for rapid action."
"That is the real obstacle: the real obstacle is the democratic nature of the European Union!"
"We would make this clear, in particular, to Mr Schröder and Mr Chirac, who publicly lamented the lack of rapid action."
"Be careful: fundamental rights and freedoms are involved!"
"The democratic nature of the institutions of the European Union is at stake."
"Madam President, as someone who was born and bred in Ghent, I should first of all like to express my satisfaction at the peaceful process of the demonstrations during the European Council in Ghent."
"What went wrong in Gothenburg and Genoa did not in Ghent."
"That is undoubtedly linked to the changes since 11 September, but also to the sound preparation, the sensible approach by the police and certainly also to the open dialogue that has led to a different atmosphere."
"As Mr Verhofstadt has already underlined, the original intention of this informal summit was to prepare for the Laeken Declaration."
"The Fifteen defined the parameters and the timeframe for the convention."
"As the European Parliament, we should be able to recognise that this was a true tour de force. Six months ago, this would have been absolutely unthinkable."
"Another positive development is the fact that the Union has taken a unanimous and firm stand in the fight against terrorism, has emphatically confirmed its solidarity with the US, but at the same time, has highlighted its own political role."
"Strictly speaking, Ghent has thus fulfilled the expectations. But the way in which European unanimity was brought about has once again exposed the cracks in the European edifice."
"Ghent has also painfully accentuated the fact that Nice' s two areas of tension, namely that between the large and small countries, and that between the intergovernmental and community approach, is still heavily mortgaging the European Union' s future."
"This applies first and foremost to the CFSP."
"The French President is right, strictly speaking, when he states that the European Union is not authorised to deal with military matters. However, the question is whether we are prepared at all to change this."
"The three largest Member States should realise that they cannot continue to be only half-committed to the cause."
"This ambiguity cannot remain concealed behind fine sounding final declarations in which attempts are made to keep up appearances of European unanimity."
"Let us hope that 11 September and the need to reform the institutions prior to enlargement will encourage Member State governments to look beyond their own national policies and return to the roots of the European Union, namely to promote peace and security in Europe and in the world by intense cooperation between the Fifteen, rather than just three, Member States."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all like to congratulate the Belgian Presidency, as I think that the excellent way in which the Ghent European Council fulfilled its duties and its responsibilities is a positive and hopeful sign that our institutions are working well."
"I believe that this European Council was worthwhile, and was acting perfectly within its powers, in other words, in the role of providing guidance."
"I would like to make three points in relation to this."
"The first point concerns the issues that are called JHA in our jargon."
"These issues involve a great deal of intense and difficult work, and the Ministers for Home Affairs and Ministers for Justice of each of our Member States will not be able to make progress on these, unless they have before them bold proposals such as those that Commissioner Vitorino made, and unless they are constantly reminded of the political direction favoured by the European Council."
"These are difficult subjects, which require will and political determination in order to make progress."
"Thank you, Mr President, for giving these conclusions."
"As for the economic situation, I think that the European Council worked hard to point out where the room for discussion between the economic and monetary authorities must be."
"If we really want to put in place a policy to support growth, and this is, without doubt, necessary for the European Union, we need everyone to shoulder their responsibilities, to fully utilise the room for manoeuvre in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the monetary policy, to mobilise the European Investment Bank, so that we finally get across the idea that this is a major undertaking, even if it means going back to square one."
"This is also the direction that you described, in relation to the launch of the WTO negotiations."
"We must not, however, forget our responsibilities, the contribution we can make, for example, to a subject as important as that of cancelling the debts of developing countries."
"The third area on which you gave some guidelines, and I would like to thank you for doing so, is that of cross-border payments."
"Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the delicate issue of cheques."
"At a time when we are changing over to the euro, we know that these cheques are used primarily by vulnerable sectors of society."
"So, let us stop creating obstacles and let things take their course, as, for once, we are not in a great rush."
"Lastly, Mr President, you stated that you hope the question of Europe' s position on the world stage will be discussed openly at Laeken."
"And Mr Prodi, you asked if Europe was absent from the world stage."
"No, Europe is not absent!"
"Europe did everything it could do and everything it should have done."
"The only difficulty is that Europe is not always heard that is the problem."
"At Durban, we made ourselves heard, but when it comes to having a real influence on the political, diplomatic and military situation, we still lack the support from the European Union."
"We are expecting a great deal from the Convention in this respect."
"Mr President, when the two planes crashed into the World Trade Center they demolished more than the twin towers."
"We also saw the destruction of the European Union's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht and our response today requires a fully integrated approach involving trade, finance and security."
"The Ghent European Council showed that the Union enjoys both the capacity, and the will, to provide an increased sense of European security, solid in support of American self-defence, and sharing in the campaign to combat terrorism."
"This is a European Union increasingly active in its civilian role and far more present in the Middle East peace process."
"For us to succeed, we need to put aside our petty squabbles and the interinstitutional rivalries."
"The Commission and Council should reflect the impressive cross-party consensus that we have created in Parliament."
"In that context I would like strongly to congratulate the Belgian presidency on brokering such a successful deal on the setting up of the convention."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of this House, ladies and gentlemen, the President-in-Office was right to express with some pride that, fortunately, after Gothenburg and Genoa, Ghent was a different G."
"We were able to catch our breath in peace for a while."
"In fact, Ghent was a ghost town."
"When I protested there along with the so-called anti-globalists, Ghent had been totally stripped of its character of a bustling city."
"Nevertheless, I am pleased with your statement about the dialogue with the world of the anti-globalists, which is an incorrect way of saying that a growing number of people are concerned about the direction that the world is taking."
"We want to move away from the privatisations and liberalisations which are plunging large parts of the world into de facto exclusion."
"What action will the Belgian Presidency be taking in order to reform the WTO, for example?"
"We are looking forward to your efforts, for the introduction of the Tobin tax is a promise which I may have heard in Belgium, but of which I have seen little evidence on the international forum."
"However, the spectacle involving the European institutions was not a pretty sight, and I am very disappointed about this."
"The Council was overshadowed by the triumvirate of the United Kingdom, France and Germany."
"Is that what other countries can expect from a Council?"
"The Big Three running the show - is that the kind of Europe we want?"
"The Commission is failing to get a grip on events and the frustration in that respect is culminating in a row about speaking times and the threat of an empty seat in Laeken."
"Does the President of the Commission fear that Laeken will be a failure?"
"The European Parliament is still feeling marginalised, and I am uncertain as to whether a convention can have any real effect in this."
"Many people have witnessed the start of the war in Afghanistan, but we do not know where it will take us or how it will end."
"We are facing an economic crisis."
"We cannot afford failure at Laeken."
"Europe simply has to succeed, and the three large institutions must cooperate with that goal in mind."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, I have noted with satisfaction that preparations in Ghent for the Laeken Summit also included a debate on the complex subject of 'The Future of Europe' ."
"You, Prime Minister, announced that the Laeken statement on this theme would not be a classic statement but an ambitious one that would acknowledge the EU's weaknesses and its citizens' fears and would clearly point out the way to be taken by the enlarged EU in the world of the future."
"I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will do everything possible to bring about a resolution in December that really will live up to this high aspiration."
"In my judgment, there is an absolute need for the following to be taken into account when calling a Convention to prepare the next Inter-Governmental Conference: First, the balanced proportional composition of the Convention with representatives of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament analogous with the Convention to draft the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Secondly, members of the national parliaments and representatives of the acceding countries' governments must be involved to the full in the Convention's work and have at least observer status."
"Thirdly, the composition of the Convention must ensure that the principle of political pluralism is guaranteed."
"Political debates need arguments on both sides which alone ensure that the debates come alive and are interesting, and only if the most diverse political forces from the Member States really work together can a politically sustainable result be achieved which will then enjoy popular support."
"Fourthly, there must be complete transparency in the Convention's work, both as regards the conduct of its debates and discussions and also public access to its documentation, which must be guaranteed by all means available."
"There is, fifthly, a need for a purposeful and structured dialogue with civil society, and I hope that the Presidency's proposals in this regard will find support among the various governments."
"Mr President, I must say that the Ghent Summit was very revealing, both in terms of the process and of the content."
"It was revealing in the sense that it, to a fault, confirms the objections on grounds of principle which we Eurosceptics and opponents of the EU have been entertaining."
"The very procedure is, of course, based upon its being the big countries that decide."
"A secret summit is held in which an agenda is set, effectively preventing the small countries from independently making known their opinions of the political decisions, and that naturally applies first and foremost to the decisions made in the light of the events of 11 September."
"Unconditional support is declared, a total acceptance of the United States' s arrangements."
"In that way, the objections and reservations that are undoubtedly entertained among the small countries and that find expression in growing opposition to the American strategy are successfully stifled."
"The summit' s reference to resolution 1368 is absurd."
"As if it legitimised anything!"
"We are concerned here with a war of aggression contrary to international law."
"That is something to which the United States' s allies should be alerting people."
"The resolution does not legitimise any intervention or any armed attack upon a foreign state."
"As for the crucial issue here, namely the interventions and follow-up provisions where policing and the law are concerned, we are being faced with a demand to implement the most far-reaching infringements of legal rights we have seen in the history of the EU, and they are to take place almost overnight without any preparation."
"I would thank the architects of the summit. It has been an eye-opener."
"Mr President, we approve the approach of the informal Ghent Council, which reaffirmed its solidarity with the United States, and confirmed and strengthened the implementation of an action plan containing 79 measures to combat terrorism."
"On this issue, I can only reiterate what I said on 3 October 2001 in this Chamber, when I called on the Council to give priority, from now on, to security, to review the former strategies that have become inappropriate, to recognise that the controls do not restrict freedom of movement, that they restrict criminals and protect the freedom of our citizens."
"At the time, I called for a review of the disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which demands the systematic abolition of controls on third country nationals, when crossing the internal borders of the European Union."
"In response, Mr Michel told me that my ideas - and I quote 'would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms' ."
"In my view, this unjustified accusation - which I naturally refute - illustrates the reservations and the obstacles we can encounter in our fight against terrorism."
"Fortunately, the Council appears to have overcome these obstacles, at least partly, since in the road map published by the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, there is a discreet proposal for the Council to study 'arrangements for coordinated recourse [...] to Article 2(2)' of the Schengen Convention."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, what is Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention?"
"It is, as you may have guessed, the safeguard clause that my friends and I defended so staunchly, which will be so useful in the future and which enables internal border controls to be re-introduced."
"Mentalities are now changing, so all is not lost."
"Obviously, we must differentiate between withdrawing freedoms and controls, particularly at borders, which, within the framework of our democratic values, seek to preserve our freedoms."
"This distinction is essential."
"I hope, and I want to believe, Mr President, that the Council understands this."
"Mr President, we evidently need major disasters to illustrate how much a too fragmented Europe is still failing in its ability to shoulder responsibility."
"The coalition against terrorism will not function properly if the central player, the United States, is surrounded by only fifteen satellites."
"Unfortunately, the European Union has in certain ways still not outgrown the satellite stage."
"That particularly applies to the second and third pillars, which are precisely pertinent when we consider international terrorism."
"Wherever matters are regulated well at community level (the first pillar), things are much better."
"In other words: Europe is good at paying, but not good at making decisions."
"That was evident in Bosnia and is now again evident in the fight against international terrorism."
"The Union is often not very visible, and I am also delighted that Mr Verhofstadt has explained how seriously he has taken the irregularities that have taken place on this score in Ghent."
"That is why we are happy to encourage the Council to give Europe a clear profile in terms of foreign and security policy as soon as possible."
"Moreover, the willingness to make the necessary Community changes in terms of justice and internal affairs is also leaving something to be desired."
"I am pleased to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council that there is wide agreement among the Heads of Government about the fact that measures must be taken."
"Reprehensible, however, are the improper objections which are being lodged by some Ministers for Justice, for example, the Minister in the Netherlands, about Europe' s interference in major issues at national political level, such as, in respect of, the policy of tolerance with regard to drugs, the policy on euthanasia and such like. That is not at issue at all."
"Mr Vitorino, too, has made it abundantly clear that he is closely monitoring subsidiarity on this score."
"If the aim of the Ministers is to protect their own official or ministerial scope, then the public will not be served by that."
"I would therefore like to warmly congratulate the Council with its statement that our policy to the outside world, also in the framework of globalisation, must be ensconced in ethical, social and ecological standards and must take account of Third World interests."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to make a few observations on three external points, starting with the Middle East."
"We have experienced the murder of Israel' s Minister for Tourism as a new low."
"Subsequently, Israel invaded the autonomous Palestinian regions, which was, of course, an unacceptable violation."
"We are all justified in asking for immediate withdrawal."
"At the same time, the spokesmen for Mr Sharon, on the one hand, and the Palestinian Authority, on the other, mete out relentless and draining rhetoric of black and white thinking."
"The others are 100% responsible, they are to blame for everything."
"The representative of Mr Sharon has almost stated that the tanks which enter the Palestinian regions are a kind of peace dove."
"Conversely, Hanan Ashrawi lays all the blame with Israel."
"Neither of them leave room for concern or take any steps towards bringing the conflict to an end."
"It appears that, for the time being, there is no chance of returning to the Oslo Agreements or the Mitchell report which is before us."
"Needless to say, the neighbouring states play their part too."
"Countries such as Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi-Arabia are all very important players who have often used the Palestinian issue to their advantage to keep enemies out, but not to do anything of any consequence at home."
"There is now scope for Europe, the Commission and the Council, in tandem with the US, to take a very unusual new step and simply to combine our economic and diplomatic power, and our UN responsibility and military power and to say: we are tabling a firm, fresh peace proposal."
"For we as the world community, in the light of 11 September, can no longer afford to be dragged down in this continual downward spiral."
"As we are well placed in Europe, we can also use intense diplomacy to persuade the countries in the Middle East to take part in the peace accord. We have money."
"We have trade. We have the UN."
"We have resources in that region."
"We can be of real significance there. In this respect, my suggestion would be to adopt a reasonably hard-handed approach towards both parties, for we need to table such a proposal now."
"That is my first plea."
"My second plea concerns Afghanistan."
"The Socialist Group gives the UN resolution, which is very clear, its 100% backing."
"The aim of the resolution is to trace both the perpetrators and the sponsors, as well as the countries harbouring them, and to bring them to justice, but also to ensure that we come out alive."
"The EU has no military presence in Afghanistan."
"That falls within the remit of other bodies: the UN and NATO."
"However, we are the body that has the diplomatic power to unite the surrounding countries in that region that play a key role, namely India, Pakistan and Iran, so that they, together with us and the US, give the different parties in Afghanistan plenty of room."
"Afghanistan' s key problem is that we will not reach a solution with the Northern Alliance, nor with anyone else."
"History has taught us that."
"What we need is a conference, wherever that may be in the region, involving the different forces - and I particularly refer to the social forces, such as the women' s organisations - which, together, will shape a new broad government, in exile and only as a first step, if necessary."
"However, we must take that political direction. It is the only way to get rid of the Taliban."
"It is the only way to catch Bin Laden."
"Prime Minister, your presidency, which was already reasonably complex, is certainly being tested by the attacks in the United States."
"Do not, therefore, take any notice of people who say that a meeting of three of your colleagues immediately before the summit was a put-down."
"Such a meeting is, of course, never pleasant for a presidency, but it proves at the same time how desperately we need a European framework within which external security, conflict prevention, our diplomacy, but also our internal security, legal and police cooperation can be regulated."
"That is important for small Member States such as ours."
"However, it is apparently difficult for everyone to understand that if one considers the Union after 11 September, it is, in fact, only small EU Member States that have taken any individual action."
"You did not get sidetracked in Ghent."
"I would ask you to ensure that this convention - the mere fact that we now have an agreement on this is already quite an achievement for the presidency - is given the appropriate assignments in Laeken."
"I should like to say this about Afghanistan: humanitarian aid is only possible if the Taliban regime is removed from power and unfortunately, we need war for this."
"And finally, thousands of people were able to protest in Ghent without any incidents. It has not always been like that."
"In my opinion, we should draw attention to this for a change."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the decision of the Council at Ghent to give immediate humanitarian aid totalling EUR 320 million is unusually welcome."
"The same applies to European solidarity in the campaign against international terrorism."
"The next thing to do is to achieve a speedy halt to the fighting, above all to protect the population of Afghanistan."
"The world is still in shock from the attacks on New York and Washington."
"Two things strike me as being of particular importance, quite independently of the steps taken to date."
"The first is the complete explanation of the background to these crimes and the publication of the results."
"Without these, there is the risk that the attacks will give rise to legends which could poison many people's minds."
"This would represent an enduring victory for terrorism."
"What strikes me, secondly, is that the future reconstruction of Afghanistan presupposes, importantly, knowledge of the events in that country over the past twenty-five years."
"As we know relatively little about this period, I propose that this Parliament should set up a group to look into the region and comprehensively document the past three decades in that country."
"We could perhaps thereby take the first step towards a peaceful solution and a forward-looking outlook for Afghanistan."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has become clear, particularly in these last weeks and months, that common action by the Member States of the European Union as the European Union brings added value for every one of the EU's members."
"When I see, for example, that the troika not only made a very successful contribution to the creation of the coalition against terror in the Middle East but is also responsible for this happening at all, this is important evidence for the truth of this."
"So I regret all the more that individual Member States have an ever-increasing tendency towards bilateralism."
"For example, the troika was in Washington at the same time as the President of France, the German Foreign Minister, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain."
"I do not find that the right way to go about presenting a clear picture of the European Union as a whole."
"I also think that the meeting of the three Heads of Government in the run-up to the summit can only give rise to suspicions that we are moving towards an outcome managed from the top downwards."
"All the European Union's Member States are basically equal."
"The European Union can only exist as it does now in so far as competencies reside in the supranational institutions and the smaller countries do not feel that they are controlled by the larger ones."
"We will get into serious difficulties if this principle is not accepted."
"Let me raise another point."
"As the Chairman of my group has already observed, there is the danger that, in the realm of internal security, good decisions by the Council will be ground down in the mills of national bureaucracies."
"I would like to suggest that the Belgian Presidency, which has done such excellent work in the past few weeks, should take a look at the Treaty of Amsterdam and tell the Council that, if the Council of Ministers so decides, decisions on legal and home affairs policy may be reached by majority voting - a legal possibility provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam - so that we can come to the necessary decisions at a European level and can meet the challenge of combating terrorism, a phenomenon that knows no frontiers."
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please permit me one more observation and a request."
"I wish to put on the record my thanks to you that the Convention will be possible."
"If possible, though, Laeken should be founded on a procedure that offers the possibility of the Convention coming up with a unitary proposal."
"It must be a Convention which can serve as the basis for the consultation of Heads of State and Government."
"There is still a lot of concern about it, and I ask you to bear that in mind."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the results of the Ghent Council are without a doubt positive and encouraging, not least - although not exclusively - in terms of the fight against terrorism."
"The Convention' s decision is extremely important and mention must be made of the Belgian Presidency' s firm undertaking to achieve these results."
"However, in a world political and economic climate which is changing rapidly in the wake of the tragedy of 11 September, and in the face of the new demands from democratic States - primarily for terrorism to be combated, of course, but also for an area of peace and respect for human rights to be created in Asia and the Middle East and, moreover, for economic growth and employment to be boosted - we would like to make quite clear the need for a better coordinated European Union initiative which can speed up the institutional reforms, which are still far from completion, and thus empower the European Union to enter the field as a world political entity, an initiative which is able, that is, to speak with a single voice in Washington and Islamabad alike, as President Prodi advocated."
"To give some concrete examples rather than limiting myself to describing vague needs, we would point out the urgency, in particular, for an incisive, coordinated action from the Commission and the High Representative laying the foundations for an - economic and social as well as political - agreement which will lead to the creation of a reunified, coherent, manageable State of Palestine while fully safeguarding the security of the State of Israel, together with an explicit international guarantee, as Mr Van den Berg said just now."
"Secondly, we would point out the urgent need for a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to reach long-term agreements with the oil-producing countries in the Middle East in order to secure the continuity of oil supplies and the stability of oil prices in Europe with a guarantee in euro."
"This would be a huge political boost to consolidation of peace in that area."
"Thirdly, we feel there should be a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to create the conditions for revitalising economic growth and employment in the Union, both by promoting forms of open coordination in the research and development and training sectors, thus setting the Lisbon project in motion, and by transparently inviting the Central Bank to join this effort, using the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy rightly recommended at Ghent, and further reducing interest rates."
"After that, Mr President, everyone will be able to assume their responsibilities transparently, in full respect for the independence of the Central Bank."
"Mr President, there are two messages coming from this House today."
"Firstly, the rather modest compromise resolution drafted by an all-party group which, if I were a member of the forces serving currently in Afghanistan - and I think particularly of the British forces - would give me very scant comfort."
"The other message comes from the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, and deals with a rather more robust approach to the current operations in that area and also his more forward thinking approach towards the future of Afghanistan."
"Of course this House must have compromise resolutions and must, so far as possible, be united."
"Europe must not act at the level of the lowest common denominator but accept that in politics, as in war, there must be room for leadership."
"Today, our resolution does not reflect the sort of leadership which is available for the people of Afghanistan through their exiled king."
"Our resolution does not reflect the fact that in Peshawar today there is an enormous meeting taking place of those seeking - including the moderate Taliban - the restoration of democracy in that country."
"I believe - as do many of my colleagues - that the king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on 21 September and whom Mr Solana met only last weekend, does have a role in the future of Afghanistan."
"He introduced democracy to that country in 1964: free elections, a free media, universities, hospitals; he introduced women into politics."
"It is that hope of the restoration of democracy in Afghanistan and the ending of international terrorism which must be the focus of our attention."
"Mr President, I would firstly like to welcome the information from the President-in-Office of the Council on the progress made in relation to measures for combating terrorism and the arrest warrant."
"Mr President, justice is a key word on the European and international stages following 11 September."
"The creation of a European area of justice is the best contribution the Union could offer at this time."
"We are not talking about a European criminal code; that is not what we want."
"Neither are we talking about establishing emergency laws."
"We are talking about something more fundamental: mutual trust between Member States and between their legitimate judicial systems."
"Mr Cappato, I sincerely believe that the proposals which the Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, produced calmly and at the request of this House, and which are of the high quality we normally expect from the Commissioner, deserve our support and must be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council."
"In no way will they violate the freedom and rights of the citizens."
"On the contrary, they protect them, making justice more efficient and putting judicial cooperation in the hands of judges, and not of governments, within the European Union."
"I am grateful for the information on the elimination of double incrimination, because - as the Chairman of my group, Mr Barón, said - this House feels that the effort we make to keep up with circumstances is not always reflected in the Council."
"We would also be grateful for more precise information on the debates in the Justice and Home Affairs Council and for broader involvement by Parliament."
"In this respect, given the speeding up of certain procedures, I wonder, Mr President, if this is not the moment to move cooperation in the criminal field to the first pillar."
"I am slightly more sceptical about what has been said about progress on immigration and asylum in the Union."
"I believe that not even the greatest will in the world would allow a positive assessment of this issue at Laeken."
"There is just one proposal approved by the Council which may be of use today."
"Why do we not implement the measures laid down in that one measure adopted in the Directive on the temporary protection of displaced persons?"
"It seems to me that the situation of the borders of Afghanistan and support for the refugees and the neighbouring countries, issues which the European Union has to deal with, provide us with a perfect opportunity to test this directive, to test the solidarity between the Member States in the European Refugee Fund and to implement what is laid down in it."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, there is no doubt that Europe must play an increasingly influential role in securing world peace."
"Little has been achieved thus far and more needs to be done, and here I endorse what President Prodi said regarding the common foreign and security policy."
"In the fight against terrorism, a great deal has already been done."
"Europe has decided to take action but the political support and military support too from many of the States of the Union - Italy announced yesterday the amount of troops and resources it is making available for anti-terrorist actions - will not alone suffice: the crisis in the Middle East needs to be defused."
"It may be that what has been termed the Marshall Plan for Palestine has not received enough attention - although it was certainly discussed at the Council."
"The population of Palestine has a per capita income of USD 800 per year, whereas the per capita income of the Israeli people is USD 18 000 per year."
"There is therefore a substantial difference and I feel that capital and enterprise investments are a way of ensuring lasting peace."
"The economic growth of the Palestinian people, who must have a State, will certainly contribute to calming a volatile situation."
"We will never win the war against terrorism if we do not first resolve the Middle East question."
"I feel that the course embarked upon by the Commission and the Council is the right one."
"We are also concerned - as President Prodi himself said - by the economic crisis."
"I regret to say that the United States has had to invest USD 150 billion to revitalise the economy."
"Europe appears to be concerned but is not doing enough, in our opinion, to support the economy and enterprise: this is not a question of State aid, it is a question of enabling many firms to stay in business, of preventing redundancies, particularly in the airlines sector."
"In the case of Alitalia, there is talk of around 5000 redundancies but all the airlines have been affected."
"From this point of view, if we are to safeguard employment and make it possible for a large number of firms to stay in business and grow, I feel that Europe, the Council and the Commission must increase their efforts even more."
"Mr President, I very much welcome the Belgian Presidency's use of the summit as an opportunity to put euro notes and coins at the top of the agenda."
"Monetary union is, after all, not only for large businesses but also for every citizen."
"I very much hope that this will be taken as a positive signal."
"I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission's proposal on charges for trans-frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction."
"We, the European Parliament, will, no doubt, also take this step in the next plenary session."
"The current situation as regards employment and the economy, that is, the state of the labour market, as well as consumer confidence, should surely be seen in a very critical light."
"I welcome the Commission's report to the Council on the appraisal of the economic consequences of the terrible events of 11 September."
"It is, I believe, important that we agree on a Community-wide approach."
"Not everywhere is there evidence of one."
"I believe that, in this situation, we must, now as in the past, stick with structural reforms and the advances they have achieved, particularly in the financial markets but also in the markets for goods and services and that we at the same time must not only underline the need for sound finances in the European Union and adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, but should also make use of the flexibility for which this Pact provides, for we need more investments in the European Union."
"Now as before, the Lisbon way is the right one, relying as it does on growth that is supported by investment and creates jobs and, above all, on mutual support in economic, employment and social policy."
"Only when all the macro-economic actors have played their parts can our policy in the European Union be successful."
"In these times of crisis we must hold fast to this, and the European Investment Bank, too, must be strengthened even more than previously in its task of helping public investments towards breakthroughs in the area of infrastructure."
"By this I mean trans-frontier infrastructure measures in the EU itself, but also such as will connect our European Union with the states of Central and Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, the fight against terrorism is clearly the current major concern of the European citizens and it therefore also has to be the main priority of our political action."
"Mr President, I am talking about terrorism in all its forms, because there is no legal or moral basis for distinguishing between forms of terrorism, just as there is no such thing as a good murder or a bad murder."
"In this respect, the action plan against terrorism, which the Belgian Presidency and the Commission are promoting vigorously, includes measures which we had argued for before 11 September."
"In fact we must remember that the proposals in this area presented by the Commission are not the result of improvisation, but they conform to a mandate received at the European Council in Tampere, whose implementation had suffered considerable delay, which was condemned by the European Parliament on several occasions."
"We are still awaiting the final approval of the Regulation on the freezing of assets, incorporating, it is true, as the European Parliament argued for, a list of European terrorist organisations, taking into account the financial operative support and propaganda framework of the terrorists."
"I therefore believe that we must welcome the Council' s commitment to approve a package of measures at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December."
"I am sure that the European Parliament will rise to the occasion and approve its consultative opinion before that."
"Mr President, I will end by saying that none of these instruments being provided to the judicial administration of the Member States imply the least restriction of the civil liberties of European citizens, but quite the opposite: they provide additional means for protecting the freedom which those who use terrorism to try to impose their ideas take away from the individual."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the impression which our citizens have gleaned from the European Council of Ghent is rather chaotic: a closed down city, three major countries making prior arrangements, an angry Belgian President, disparate final declarations by Heads of Government and, to finish off, an angry Commission President."
"At a time when unity of action is vital, Europe is divided."
"I should like to make three observations."
"The United Kingdom, Germany and France have lent their full support to the United States. In fact, the UK is even granting active military support."
"I welcome this."
"Other EU countries that are also members of NATO are providing more passive support."
"The EU countries that are not NATO members lend political support via diplomatic channels."
"These are three different kinds of support without any clear interrelation for the citizen. And then the EU President asked for an evaluation."
"So you, in fact, put a seed of doubt into our minds as to whether that support would last."
"Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that the United States is seeking support from countries outside the European Union, including Canada, Australia and the Pacific Association."
"I would call for more coordination in Europe' s support for the actions against terrorism in the coming months, so that the image of division will soon be one of the past."
"Secondly, I should like to comment on cooperation in the field of internal security."
"Commissioner Vitorino has tabled the proposals extremely promptly, and these include one about a European regulation against money laundering, one concerning arrest warrants and one harmonising penalties."
"In fact, those proposals had already partly been tabled."
"Last week, the Council of Ministers for Internal Affairs failed to reach agreement. That was also the case for the European Council in Ghent."
"Why did the Heads of Government fail to make those executive decisions?"
"Surely it is hardly justifiable vis-à-vis the citizens for the EU to be undecided about anti-terrorism measures at home."
"Then there is the convention, which receives my support, because the Council has adopted the wish of the European Parliament and my group for a convention with a broad parliamentary basis."
"We are less happy about the proposal to ask the convention to supply options."
"That is the type of question you might ask a consultancy bureau, but not a parliamentary body."
"Let the convention determine its own working method and submit its own proposals."
"That worked for the Charter and, in my opinion, will work again now."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the informal summit in Ghent has shown two positive aspects, namely fundamental agreement on a Convention to prepare a constitutional treaty and the final technical adjustments to the euro."
"Under other circumstances, without the shadow cast by terrorism, this would be an occasion for looking optimistically towards Europe's future."
"We are, however, concerned with a situation in which we ask ourselves whether, with the euro, Europe's capacity for integration has already been exhausted."
"A common currency, a common foreign policy and a common defence policy would give the EU that credibility in the eyes of its citizens and create that identification with it, whose absence we often regret."
"It has been, above all, in respect of foreign and security policy, that the Ghent Summit has brought us down to earth."
"Bilateralism, if you want to call it that, or undeclared intensified cooperation, laid bare the weaknesses that still handicap the European Union's effectiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world."
"Reviewing the international analyses following the Ghent meeting shows how the shock at the terrorist attacks on the USA has revealed the divisiveness within the European Union."
"It is not only a reaction to the behaviour of the USA, which prefers to deal and negotiate with governments direct, but also the consequence of the inherent military weakness of the European security and defence policy, in which there is a yawning gulf between ambition and reality."
"It is no secret that there are doubts as to whether the training of the European Rapid Reaction Force of 60 000 men is actually going to be completed by the 2003 deadline."
"The European Union needs an energy boost, not only to unite it more closely with its citizens but, above all, in order that it might fully meet its responsibilities within Europe itself and as a partner of the USA."
"The process of enlargement must be seen from this point of view, as must the post-Nice order, involving a Convention which should not be content to fritter away its time but, as the European Parliament has recommended, should work out a coherent basis for a decision on a constitutional treaty."
"Mr President, the European Council confirmed and reinforced Europe' s decision to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States to combat terrorism and ensure internal security, and also its commitment to avoiding a humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan."
"After 11 September, the political geography of the world has changed radically."
"However, the Shanghai Summit will be more important than the restricted summit at Ghent."
"What is the European Union' s role?"
"Is a single foreign and security policy possible?"
"Will we be able to reinvigorate the Mediterranean initiative and work for peace in the Middle East?"
"In reality, good intentions are often contradicted by the behaviour of certain governments, who delay integration and endeavour to take away the political influence of a Convention which should be developing the method and objectives."
"This is what we expect from Laeken and from an Intergovernmental Conference which needs to reform the Union before the European elections."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over and above all the constitutional issues, the present situation sees Europeans being asked the question: What is your capacity to act?"
"Is the European Union perceived as being able to act in the context of efforts to deal with this international crisis, or is it not?"
"To ask the question is to answer it in the negative, because the ones taking action are the Americans and, alongside them, partly the British and their allies, but not the European Union as such."
"Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived."
"They too are only a small junior partner in the business and have nothing like the weight that Europeans could have if they acted together."
"Only as a community will Europeans acquire capacity to act - they will not do it bilaterally, trilaterally or multilaterally."
"So it was a gross error for the ruling Big Three to set off before Ghent."
"Far from demonstrating European capacity to act, that is a trip down a one-way street, showing considerable lack of awareness of how Europe works."
"Those who have acted in this way had better take good note of that."
"We need capacity to act as a Community."
"So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force."
"Without such an instrument, Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world."
"That is why it is ridiculous for us still to be arguing about how this instrument should be financed."
"In this respect, the Community must prove its strength."
"We also, however, need an instrument at home."
"We need the capacity to combat terrorism across national frontiers."
"Police work goes on in the Member States, but it must be clear to all that international terrorism can only be combated with any prospect of success by units that are in a position to operate without regard to national boundaries."
"Action as a Community is what Europe lacks, and it is on that that we must concentrate."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank the various interlocutors and groups for their observations."
"I think that, except for two or three speeches, a predominantly positive evaluation has been made of the outcome of Ghent."
"Such a positive evaluation from the various groups encourages us, of course, to continue our hard work in the coming weeks, for we have another important summit coming up, namely the Summit of Laeken."
"I would also like to respond, as follows, to a few oblique remarks that have been made about the cooperation between myself and Mr Romano Prodi: our cooperation is excellent."
"In fact, we have just decided to come to the next press conference on a tandem, so as to rule out any further misunderstandings."
"Since we both are accomplished cyclists, this will undoubtedly be appreciated by Parliament."
"I should in any event like to react to three points."
"First of all, a few times, the question has been asked: so where exactly is the Union' s foreign policy now?"
"I think that Mr Romano Prodi has already entered into more detail on this and has, actually, made very valid points."
"Last time we had an international crisis, the Gulf War, Europe had fifteen different opinions on the stance the Union should adopt."
"Each Member State had its own opinion on the matter."
"In today' s international crisis, we have, for the first time, displayed a united front on two occasions, on 21 September and last Friday in Ghent, in a matter which is, actually, very complex."
"Firstly, to what does the stance of the fifteen Member States regarding the attacks in Washington and New York bear witness?"
"A joint vision and a joint approach."
"Secondly, what is the stance now after 7 October?"
"After all, things changed on 7 October, since the reaction from the United States and the international coalition."
"Again, we have a joint stance."
"It is important in my view to underline this, for there was a time in the European Union when this was different."
"Mr Romano Prodi reminded us that each time there was an international conflict, there was not one stance, but fifteen stances within the Council."
"Now this no longer holds true."
"However much I am of the personal view - which I share with many of you - that we should take things further still, for example that, certainly in the field of European defence, we should have made much more progress by now, I still believe that we should underline this positive development."
"At long last, little by little, piece by piece, a common foreign policy of the European Union is forming, something which, say fifteen years ago, was almost unthinkable."
"From that point of view, I believe, in fact, that Mr Van den Berg is more than right in emphasising the role we are to play now. For our role is different from that of the United States."
"The EU' s role is mainly one of political, logistical support, and diplomatic action to be undertaken. He is right in highlighting the importance of the mandate which we have received from the Council with regard to the Middle East."
"We, that is, Mr Romano Prodi, Mr Javier Solana and myself, are considering a date when we could undertake this important mission. Possibly the third week of November."
"For I believe that it is up to the European Union, especially the European Union, to take an initiative in this respect."
"However, we must be realistic and not foster any illusions."
"We cannot solve matters with just one visit - there have been many already - but perhaps by gaining momentum in one particular area, this could ultimately lead to an initiative."
"The second point I would like to make relates to what several Members have said and particularly concerns Mr Poettering' s comments."
"Mr Poettering said that the Presidency was doing a good job."
"He mentions the work on the single European arrest and extradition warrant by the ministers of the specialised Councils, amongst others."
"But when will this come about?"
"It is obvious."
"This very specific task was given to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and they must finalise the practical details before 6 and 7 December 2001."
"Mr Poettering, I have already said - not today, not on 19 October but on 21 September - on behalf of the European Council, that the specialised ministers were given the task of finalising the details."
"The only thing that I have done, with the help of the Commission and all the Member States of the European Union and the European Council, is to go further at the Ghent Council and to obtain approval of the principle of abolishing the double criminality system."
"(NL) At the most recent Council, we at least managed to reach agreement on this, for that is the most important point."
"It is easy to proclaim that a European mandate must be obtained, also for extradition."
"The most important point had not yet been reached, namely an agreement on the principle of the abolition of dual criminality, not only for terrorist acts but also for other serious crimes."
"We must indeed challenge a reductionist attempt to render the provision only applicable to terrorist acts."
"That was not the conclusion reached in Tampere."
"The Tampere conclusions were in favour of broadening the scope, in other words for other, serious crimes to fall within its scope."
"I am therefore personally optimistic with regard to 6 and 7 December. I am addressing Mr Poettering and also Mr Cox, in particular."
"But have no fear, if the Ministers for Internal Affairs and Justice fail to come up with the goods, then I will be taking the dossier to the European Council of Laeken on 15 December where the Heads of State and Government will decide."
"However, I am convinced that the Ministers for Justice will not let things get so far that ultimately, the Heads of Government will have to solve a technical problem which is predominantly concerned with modality."
"Finally, I also should like to briefly comment on the third point, namely the Union' s future."
"I believe that we are all agreed that 11 September has shown that a more integrated, more progressive Union is needed, a Union with greater ability to act, which has better instruments at its disposal, and which - certainly as far as the foreign and defence policy is concerned - has greater powers."
"To pave the way for this is exactly the intention of the Laeken Declaration."
"Therefore, I can already give very concrete answers to the generally positive evaluation based on that convention."
"The convention is a fact."
"Yes, Mr Poettering, the presidency is a limited presidency in line with the request of all groups, comprising five people including the president of the convention."
"Yes, the Member States and MEPs are proportionately represented, although exact numbers will need to be discussed in due course."
"Yes, civil society is involved, not by setting up a new body but by creating a network around the convention whereby groups in society can refer to the convention and whereby, conversely, the convention can also seek advice from European affairs study centres, trade unions, any other organisations which exist in our society, as well as civil society."
"A flexible network around the convention therefore seems preferable to the organisation of a special forum."
"Finally, I should like to respond to the most fundamental question which has been repeatedly raised here. Indeed, it is related to that text."
"If that text originates from that convention, how will the Council then relate to it?"
"Will it be considered a report that can be dismissed and need not be taken into consideration?"
"A discussion has therefore arisen as to the question of whether that is now a consensus text or a text providing options."
"The answer is very simple."
"That will, at any rate, be my reply in a few weeks' time when we are all meeting in Laeken."
"If everyone is agreed, then we will have a consensus text. In other words, it will then be quite clear that this is an important - if not the most important - contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference."
"If no consensus is reached at the convention, then I obviously believe that options should be given, not in a neutral manner, but in such a way that the majority and minority options are clearly indicated, as well as the individual option of one member of the convention, if applicable."
"It was also my intention to talk this over with the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and the two draftsmen of opinion on the future of Europe."
"I cannot see the sense of unleashing a holy war among ourselves as to the exact significance of that text."
"If consensus is reached, then we have a consensus text."
"If we cannot have a consensus text because we failed to reach consensus, options must be indicated, but not in a neutral manner, not in a way as if we were supplying a list without any significance. Instead, we should highlight the majority and minority options, in other words, the wishes and trends which originated at the convention and which have been brought forward."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to make a few comments on this debate, which has revealed great unity, not just between Council and Commission but also between these institutions and Parliament."
"I would just like to focus on a few issues which appear to have remained unresolved."
"Firstly, the issue has been raised, starting with Chairman Poettering, of the amount of aid granted to refugees."
"I would like to say that the immediate appropriation has been decided of EUR 315 million, but the problem is not now, at this time, I regret to say, financial, but the enormous practical difficulties of getting the aid to the people concerned."
"We are working through the NGOs and many other organisations."
"I would stress that, as things stand now, sufficient funds have been transferred in practical terms."
"When further funds are needed, then we will come back here to request them and discuss the matter together: the present problem is the difficulty of implementing these operations."
"I will now turn to another debate, taken up by a number of speakers, including Mr Tajani and several others, who linked this major phenomenon of the world being divided into two parts to peace in Palestine."
"This is an issue of fundamental importance, in which regard I would point out to Mr Tajani and the other speakers that what has been termed the 'reconstruction plan for Palestine' is something which is very much on our minds: I have discussed it many times with Mr Peres and we are well aware that we should concentrate on taking action in certain sectors such as water, energy, infrastructure and revitalising industry."
"This is our duty and the Palestinian and Israeli citizens know that the Commission is focusing its efforts in that direction."
"As soon as the political conditions allow, we will be here, requesting the necessary resources."
"However, I believe that the knowledge that we are taking practical action and are all ready to work together is in itself conducive to peace."
"Then, Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the decisions adopted in the field of justice and the fight against financial crime."
"I agree with what he said, but we must be careful. We have adopted decisions here: if we do not implement them we will lose all credibility."
"Therefore, the ministers responsible must speed up the implementation of these decisions or else they will be taken again at the summit."
"A further point related to the Convention."
"A general agreement has been adopted on the board, the executive structure and so forth."
"I would, however, like to focus on one point, touched upon by Prime Minister Verhofstadt, which is the duration of the Convention."
"Parliament and the Commission have guided and supported the Convention' s creation: they must support its work and they must support its conclusion, and so the work must reach its conclusion before the start of the electoral campaign for the European elections."
"This is a genuine deadline, not a theoretical one."
"Many speakers have brought up the issue of the Community method in this debate."
"Well then, on this matter I would simply like to borrow a vivid picture painted by Mr Duff."
"He said: ""When the two planes crashed into the World Trade Centre they demolished more than the twin towers."
"This is, in my opinion, a correct, responsible, practical observation."
"Mr Duff has fully understood the political meaning of the Commission' s efforts to achieve unified Union action by applying the Community method, which is the only effective way of ensuring success."
"A further point, mentioned by all the speakers, is the issue of the institutional reforms."
"The Commission and Parliament are working on the practical aspects of this matter: we have argued and helped each other, and I think we are making progress - painstaking progress - in our joint work."
"We have not yet finished but we are working, so to speak, on the bricks and mortar, on the concrete facts."
"At this point, although I do not wish to interfere with the internal organisation of the Council, I would point out that our reform will not be sufficiently effective if it is not accompanied by a reform of the Council' s working procedures."
"(Applause)"
"My intention in saying this is not to interfere in other people' s business but to stress the need for effectiveness."
"We need to bring all our work out into the open and achieve more transparency, accountability and democracy in our governance."
"The Commission has already addressed this point in its White Paper and we and Parliament expect to debate it with the Council."
"With regard to the economy, everyone has stressed the difficulty of implementing the Lisbon decisions."
"However, this is an area in which there has been a vast difference between the general decisions taken and the implementation of the decisions in subsequent individual Councils, with regard to liberalisation and market reform, speeding up innovation, and projects ranging from the creation of the single air space to the establishing of the Community patent, areas in which we are still extremely behind schedule."
"Our economy will only become dynamic if we rectify these shortcomings."
"Lastly - and, in this respect, more great progress has been made - we have undertaken to support the introduction of the euro with the indispensable backup measures such as the single market in cross-border bank transfers."
"We have committed ourselves to this and it is an absolutely crucial point."
"Finally, one last point on the subject of the Convention."
"I will go back to Mrs Maij-Weggen' s comment on the actual definition of the Convention: we cannot consider it to be a consultative body, as some have described it."
"It cannot be a body which just gives advice and is then disbanded and no longer involved."
"We are making the Convention as transparent as possible but also giving it as much democratic authority as possible, and we therefore expect it to produce major, incisive results."
"I would add, moreover, that the presence of the Convention is a breath of fresh air amongst the closed doors of secretive diplomacy."
"The air of democracy is nourished by the oxygen of transparency and accountability, and the Commission therefore fully supports the commencement of the Convention' s work so that dialogue will, at last, be opened between the institutions and between the institutions and the European citizens."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, President Prodi."
"As you heard, during the last part of your speech there was a buzz of voices which made it difficult for all the Members who were listening attentively to your speech to hear properly."
"I apologise for this."
"Steps must be taken to avoid such disturbance once and for all."
"As you and my fellow Members can see, all those who were not paying attention to your speech are continuing to chat in the corridors and will only sit down when the next President opens voting time."
"I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 42(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m."
"Mr President, the confusion in the House before voting time is in danger of becoming a moral issue."
"It is a political issue and is the result of the way our work is organised, with the debates taking place separately from the votes."
"Parliament is becoming a voting parlour, and this is the inevitable consequence."
"If we want to avoid this confusion, then we must allow a 15-minute pause between the debate and the votes. That way there will be less people attending the debates and we will be able to become a voting parlour pure and simple and increasingly less a Parliament!"
"Thank you for your comment."
"We shall now proceed to the votes."
"Mr President, I should like to draw your attention to the deluge of e-mails which we are currently receiving, as a result of which my computer refuses to work and I can no longer locate the actual e-mails that I should like to read."
"Could you see to it that something is done about this by the offices?"
"We will certainly take note of this."
"VOTE"
"The Commission can accept in part or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 5, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15 and 16."
"The Commission rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 and 17."
"Before the vote on Amendment No 17: Gröner (PSE)."
"(DE) Mr President, we had reached a compromise with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and they are now departing from it."
"So we too will not now abide by this compromise, and I call on my group to vote in favour of Amendment No 17."
"Mr President, I believe Mrs Gröner has made a mistake."
"We have not deviated from the compromise."
"On the contrary, we are sticking to what we agreed."
"We are not, though, voting in favour of the amendments that have been tabled after the compromise and with which we do not agree."
"We have not deviated from the compromise at all, quite the opposite!"
"(The President declared the amended common position approved)"
"Report (A5-0335/2001) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a common classification of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) [COM(2001) 83 - C5-0065/2001 - 2001/0046(COD)]"
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Voting time will now be suspended and resumed after the formal sitting on the occasion of the visit of his Holiness the XIVth Dalai-Lama."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)"
"Mr President, I should like to mention that the Greens and the Liberals have kindly invited everyone to their joint meeting this afternoon to meet His Holiness, the Dalaï Lama, at 3 p.m. in Room 100 in WIC - that means everybody who was not included in the invitation of the PSE and the PPE-DE."
"Welcome"
"I would like to welcome the Prime Minister of Bulgaria, Mr Simeon Saxe-Coburg, who has taken a seat in the visitors' gallery. He is visiting the European institutions."
"Prime Minister, on behalf of President Fontaine, welcome to the European Parliament. I hope that the accession of your country, which we hope will happen as soon as possible, will lead to the consolidation of the democratic process which has been set in motion and enable the Bulgarian people to take its rightful place in the Community of the peoples of the European Union."
"(Applause)"
"VOTE (continuation)"
"The pursuit of the second wave of the feminist movement in the 60s and 70s was strongly focused on enabling women to get on in paid jobs."
"On average, women were not as highly trained as men, and even if they were, due to male domination, they often got the jobs with the lowest status and the lowest income."
"Moreover, many women were financially dependent on their husbands."
"Highly trained women were right to claim access to jobs from which, in those days, they were almost automatically excluded."
"For women who were less highly trained, the situation was often different. Cleaning offices or stacking shelves in supermarkets are not demanding jobs, and, in many cases, not to be preferred to the role of housewife."
"That group of women experienced it, in many cases, as liberating if the income of their husbands obviated the need for them to work."
"Most women now have a paid job, while men do not work fewer hours to look after and raise the children."
"Feminism has become the employers' accidental instrument to solve staff shortages and to limit government spending."
"Certainly under those circumstances, it is even more important to actively fight any form of discrimination and intimidation at work."
"Miguélez Ramos report (A5-0335/2001)"
"Mr President, it was with great pleasure that I read Mr Ramos' rather technical document, which also has great political meaning for me."
"As you are aware, I have been a regional councillor of the Lombardy region for five years."
"My daughter, Elisabetta, has been a regional councillor of the Liguria region for five years and is currently a regional councillor of the Lombardy region, for the Pensioners' Party of course."
"I say this with pleasure in order to stress my personal hope - in addition to what is, I believe, the hope of all of us - that the regions in Europe will gain increasingly in political and decision-making importance and that they will be allowed to participate more fully in the production of the European directives and regulations which concern them."
". (EL) The debate on territorial units for statistics (NUTS) is not a technical debate about statistics because regional statistics and the classification of regions on the basis of NUTS provide a constant line of reference for analysing social and economic developments in the regions and determining which areas are eligible for structural support."
"One of the most serious problems is that completely different political and economic units are used as a basis for collating and processing statistics."
"This is no accident and arouses even greater suspicion in conjunction with the fact, as the report quite rightly points out, that the Commission exercises 'a great deal of flexibility' when applying the criteria for classifying an area in NUTS É, ÉÉ, or ÉÉÉ, using them as it pleases, depending on the 'needs' of the case."
"For example, a NUTS III type administrative division is used to allocate funds to Objective 2, thereby subsidising half the population of the Union and drastically reducing the funds available for the less developed areas for which they are supposedly intended."
"Between 1994 and 1999 (Delors II package) 51% of the population of the ÅU received support, of which only 25% corresponded to Objective 1, which funds NUTS II type regions."
"Lastly, of this 25%, only 16.4% related to Objective 2."
"In other words, because a small administrative division was used (NUTS ÉÉÉ), the rich countries received considerable support, thereby blatantly distorting regional policy in practice."
"Finally, it is again the rich countries which benefit, gobbling up a large slice of what are already miserly and insufficient appropriations from the Structural Funds."
"Some countries benefit even more because the NUTS III type administrative divisions are very small compared with other countries."
"For example, this sort of administrative division (prefecture) has a surface area of 2,950 square metres in Greece, 3,162 square metres in Portugal and a mere 758 square metres in Germany."
"All this illustrates, yet again, the malfunctions, inequalities, irregularities and hypocrisy of ÅU regional policy, in that a large chunk of the appropriations distributed in structural aid is 'recycled' and finds its way back to the more developed Member States, thereby seriously curtailing the potential for any national development policy, which is forced to remain within the confines of the poorly tailored Community 'straitjacket' ."
"As a result, not only do we fail to achieve the much-vaunted objective of convergence between the poorest and richest regions but, as the figures confirm - and Greece is a prime example - there is increasing divergence, not just between Member States in the north and the south, but between regions within Member States themselves."
"The only thing achieved with any degree of satisfaction is that people have been paid to turn a blind eye and mechanisms have been created to promote the interests of the large monopolies, which have benefited most from Community programmes."
"Despite the fact that the rapporteur's report fails to 'bring matters to a head' , it does at least touch on several serious problems and we shall support it."
"Weiler report (A5-0360/2001)"
". (PT) The study contained in the 2001 Joint Employment Report, produced on the basis of national reports, demonstrates how little attention most Member States pay to employment guidelines."
"In fact, only seven have paid any attention to the general objectives laid down at the Lisbon Council and reaffirmed at the Stockholm Council, and only three have referred to the specific objectives on the rate of employment for women."
"As stated in the opinion of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, to which we contributed proposals, that were approved, antagonism clearly exists between the objectives for employment rates that have been laid down by the Council and the minimal importance that the majority of the Member States attach to integrating sensitivity to gender issues in their employment policies. This failure to integrate such sensitivity in Member State policies can be seen in the lack of national objectives for reducing the various disparities between the genders in the labour market, whether these be a lack in adequate childcare services, or the limited initiatives for reducing wage disparities between the sexes, for example."
"The Weiler report is not sufficiently critical of the current employment situation in the European Union, although it does acknowledge some negative aspects of practices in these areas of employment, specifically where it focuses on the need to establish national targets and on meeting them."
"It does not, however, provide a critical analysis of the guidelines proposed by the Commission nor does it offer any clear alternatives for issues that we need to commit to, specifically the need to give priority to employment policies or not to continue the current trend of subordinating these policies to monetarist ones, thereby finally burying the neoliberal approach that prevails in the European Union, having rejected the proposals that we tabled on this matter."
". The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the thrust of the Weiler report on the employment guidelines for 2002."
"It also has a lot of sympathy for the amendments submitted by Mr Bushill-Matthews but feels that the Weiler report is not the appropriate report for such amendments."
". (EL) Without doubt the economic crisis is worsening, having already been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington."
"This recession, which appears to have set in for the duration, at least according to most analysts, cannot be resolved, yet again, at the expense of the workers, by making mass redundancies and eroding their rights."
"Overall employment has basically bottomed out and unemployment is staying put, even if it is not increasing as, for example, in my country."
"At the same time, more mass redundancies are on the cards in important sectors of the economy, such as transport, tourism etc. Employment policies have become an exercise in apportioning unemployment, even more so in the guidelines for 2002."
"It is no accident that the countries 'patted on the back' here by the EU are the countries which first proceeded to overhaul the labour market, especially by extending part-time and other forms of flexible employment."
"The European Parliament report supports the guidelines, which revert to the familiar subjects of structural reform and more flexible employment contracts, the purpose of which is to create a huge army of employable people with no rights or claims, whose productivity and competitiveness are tailored to the speculative demands of big business and its interests."
"Geographical mobility of the workers serves no purpose except to strengthen the concentration of human resources and wealth in the rich areas of the ÅU, which get richer by absorbing the best manpower and scientists."
"The sole purpose of the second pillar of the guidelines on entrepreneurship is to make the unemployed self-employed, thereby artificially reducing unemployment and rejecting the responsibilities of social solidarity."
"As for subsidised job schemes, not only have they been completely ineffectual in combating unemployment, the money has generally gone straight into the employers' pockets and workers have been replaced by the subsidised unemployed, resulting in constant infringements of collective agreements."
"Continuing privatisation, mergers, adjustment to EMU, increased imports and more intense capitalist competition, thousands of small and medium-sized farms wiped out and the closure of small and medium-sized enterprises have created conditions for spiralling unemployment."
"The policy which the ÅU persists in applying, despite an average rate of growth of 3.3% in 2000, does not appear to be reducing the unemployment or the poverty which is the bane of the lives of 22% of the population of the ÅU."
"The workers want a different policy, a policy predicated on people and their needs, with full, secure social rights for all workers, a better standard of living and real social development and prosperity."
"We are mainly well disposed towards Mrs Weiler' s report."
"We particularly appreciate the emphasis she places upon the quality of work."
"We are nonetheless critical of quite a few of the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs which make sweeping ideological statements about the market economy and the way it is run."
"We believe that an economic policy is thus being recommended that militates against the European employment strategy, especially during periods when the economy and demand for labour are not expanding."
"Because these amendments have been adopted by the House, we chose to abstain in the final vote."
". I wholeheartedly support this report by Ms Weiler which welcomes the 2002 employment guidelines."
"Whilst the report recognises that full employment can be achieved through further structural reforms of the labour market, it also calls for increased investment in training, especially for job seekers."
"The quantitative, as well as qualitative, returns that the EU would reap as a result of its commitment to training are unquestionable."
"Training and education are essential ways in which EU Member States can jointly boost the EU's employment rate."
"Time and again in Member States, investment in education and training has proved to be successful and when coordinated at a pan-European level, this would be amplified."
"It is important that these commitments are realised and that they do not simply turn into hot air."
"Finally, the recommendation that both sides of industry should agree on changes in working practices could pave the way for enhanced industrial relations and create a situation whereby the specialist knowledge of each party is fully utilised."
"Seppänen report (A5-0350/2001)"
"Madam President, you, like me, love the sea and have often visited my city, Genoa, which I have admired for 20 years from the top of the Righi hills."
"I see the sea and reflect deeply."
"The sea unites, the sea belongs to everyone, the sea has no borders."
"It is therefore right that the European Union should concern itself with all seas, particularly those which bathe the shores of some of our States, and that it should provide financial aid, not least, as in this case, to States beyond its borders such as Russia, for environmental projects to make these seas cleaner, more navigable and more beautiful."
"Mr President, Mr Fatuzzo' s explanations of vote are so poetic that I would like to ask you, as a member of the Bureau, whether the Presidency has any intention of publishing these speeches in a book, considering their value and the sentiments pervading them which surpass all the other speeches in the House and endow them with a poetic value that Parliament must not fail to appreciate."
"I will inform the Bureau of your suggestion, Mr Dell' Alba."
"Virrankoski report (A5-0345/2001)"
"Mr Dell' Alba, in a minute you will see that not all Mr Fatuzzo' s speeches are poetic."
"This one concerns nuclear power stations."
"Clearly, through this funding we are protecting the Chernobyl power station - and I voted for the motion - but we must think carefully: should we really close the Bohunice power station in Slovakia - which I visited with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy last week - and on which thousands of billions have been spent to increase safety, and make its closure a non-negotiable condition for Slovakia' s accession to the European Union?"
"Should we not think more carefully about this?"
"The manufacturing companies that used to buy energy from Chernobyl, and by means of which it was possible to sustain such a colossal complex of nuclear reactors, are, since the collapse of the Soviet Union, largely non-existent."
"The population of the Ukraine is so impoverished that it lacks the purchasing power to be able to buy any substantial amount of electricity as a consumer."
"Neither is there any internal funding available to finance new, cleaner and safe methods of generating electricity, and, given the long half-life of radio-active material, we will need to be very patient before what is left of the demolished stations is removed."
"Everything that is being done now, unfortunately, is impossible without outside aid."
"The measures to provide Chernobyl with a new protective casing by 2005, are too little and too late."
"The first casing - erected shortly after the disaster in 1986 - still conceals a dangerous seat of fire, and nuclear energy remains a source of future risks."
"In the debate on 2 May regarding 15 years of Chernobyl, I already indicated that other types of nuclear power plants are also unsafe and that they, upon closure, leave a legacy impossible to solve."
"Despite all these shortcomings, I support this finance proposal, for doing nothing is not a solution at all."
"Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou report (A5-0328/2001)"
"Mr President, I voted for Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou' s report."
"It concerns the Social Fund, which, as we know, is a fund dedicated to workers and to improving and enhancing the chances of the unemployed of finding work."
"In particular, this document regulates the definition of innovative measures, that is the new initiatives in this sector."
"I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this last explanation of vote to wish you 'Bon appétit' , of course, and to apologise for the drain on the European Parliament' s finances, for I have been informed that every minute of my speeches costs the institution ITL 1,2 million."
"If the services were willing to pay half of it to please Mr Fatuzzo, I could save on the other half and not make any more speeches."
"Joking apart, I would like to end this explanation of vote by calling for the innovative measures of the Social Fund to be encouraged and accepted, even if they are proposed to the Union by the candidate countries."
"That concludes voting time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Council reform"
"The next item is the report (A5-0308/2001) by Mr Poos, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the reform of the Council [2001/2020(INI)]."
"Mr President, it is a true honour for me to be able to present to you this report on Council reform in the presence of Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, representing the Council and Mr Barnier, representing the Commission."
"This own-initiative report does not concern the Council alone."
"It also concerns the European Parliament and Commission in equal measure, as they have the same interest in ensuring that the three institutions work well, and are efficient and coherent."
"In an enlarged Union, it is imperative that the Community institutions improve their ability to make decisions and increase their reaction time."
"I do not believe that it constitutes any insider dealing to state that today the Council is the most badly organised institution."
"This is a serious problem, since this institution, which has both executive and legislative competences, is still, in spite of the changes made to the Treaty, the European Union' s main centre of power."
"The Council has already lost much of its effectiveness."
"In my report, you will find a long list of dysfunctions."
"The Council itself had carried out some preparatory work three or four years ago and I used this and other work as a basis."
"Since then, however, nothing has been done, although some other preparatory work was carried out by former - and very key - figures on the international stage, and I shall mention, in particular, the Notre Europe working group led by Jacques Delors."
"One of the dysfunctions that I must emphasise particularly is institutional digression, which has primarily been at the expense of Community procedures, along with the Commission."
"The rise in power of the European Council, combined with the weakness of the General Affairs Council, has re-established the intergovernmental method of preparing decisions."
"The aides, or 'sherpas' , used by the Heads of State, have reintroduced a method that is reminiscent of nineteenth century secret diplomacy."
"Mini-summit meetings, like the one held at Ghent, have brought back the tendency to place control in the hands of a chosen few, a dream that some have never given up on since the Fouchet plan of the 1960s."
"In order to correct this digression, I recommend nothing more and nothing less than going back to the Treaty."
"We should ask the European Council to stop tackling detailed issues and to stop acting like an enormous vacuum cleaner that tries to deal with all the important decisions."
"You should not bite off more than you can chew."
"What is even worse is that the European Council now causes the institutional system to come to a standstill."
"No one dares to make a decision anymore."
"Everything is now referred back to those at the top."
"The European Council should restrict itself to giving general guidelines on European policy, as laid down in the Treaty."
"We must re-evaluate the General Affairs Council, enabling it to resolve conflicts between the specialised Councils and ensuring that decisions are coherent."
"To this end, it is essential to have a single channel for preparations, and the same single channel for preparations could also be used by the European Council."
"We must demand that the ministers in the General Affairs Council do not deal with European affairs at a brief monthly meeting, where an in-depth discussion of the items on the agenda is not possible due to the limited number of ministers attending and the unacceptable practical conditions."
"The proposal for a resolution suggests a number of practical solutions, which can all be implemented immediately without having to amend the Treaty."
"Before I finish, I would like to draw the attention of Members to the proposals on improving collaboration with the European Parliament."
"They concern the presence of Council ministers at our important debates as well as speeding up the legislative procedure from the first-reading stage."
"With regard to transparency, I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will support the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which proposes that Council discussions be made public when it is working on legislation."
"This obviously requires considerable reorganisation of the agenda and discipline in the conduct of meetings."
"If the Council did not meet behind closed doors when carrying out its duties as co-legislator, citizens might also perceive it as a second legislative chamber, which is, in fact, a task that the Council already fulfils today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, I would also like to say that, with regard to the dysfunctions in the Council, the Commission widely supports the analysis presented in this excellent report."
"Personally, I am not surprised by the quality of this analysis, given the experience and expertise that Mr Poos has gained over many long years and which he is now putting to use at the European Parliament."
"I would like to say that, having begun by voicing our overall appreciation of the report, the Commission also supports the reforms that you put forward for the Council."
"Transforming the Council into a structured and efficient body is in the interests of the whole European Union."
"Your report takes up many of the suggestions and comments that we at the Commission have expressed in the past, and particularly in our recently published White Paper on European Governance."
"These options for reform are all the more interesting since they can be made - as you have said - without altering the current Treaty."
"With reference to the Council, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would obviously like to say that, from my point of view, each of our institutions is autonomous and has primary responsibility for its own reforms."
"We know very well, however, that each of the institutions is concerned with how they all function."
"It is in this spirit and within these boundaries that I would like to give you the European Commission' s impression of the other institution, in other words, the Council of Ministers."
"Admittedly, within the framework of the debate on the future of the European Union, we must carry out an in-depth examination of the institutional set-up, the role of each institution and the amendments that need to be made to the Treaty so that our Union has a genuine institutional framework that is both more democratic and more effective."
"That is why I think, Mr Poos, that your report is an extremely important element, which will spark off the wide-ranging debate about to open on the institutional framework of the EU, its effectiveness and its democratic legitimacy."
"Nonetheless, the debate on the most fundamental reforms in the run-up to 2004 cannot be an excuse for refusing to immediately adopt the reforms that the Council can already implement in the existing Treaty. Furthermore, one of the objectives set out in the White Paper is to ensure the Council functions as efficiently as possible."
"Apart from the different views that might be expressed on one point of detail or another, there is some convergence on the analysis of the dysfunctions that we have found - and of the reforms that need to be carried out."
"This convergence is evident in the report that you are presenting, Mr Poos, in the White Paper and also - as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated - in the Trumpf-Piris report, which was drawn up by the General Secretariat of the Council itself. The operational conclusions of this report were widely approved at Helsinki by the European Council and were also widely implemented in the Council' s internal rules of procedure."
"It falls within the remit and it is the duty of each institution - I would like to reiterate this - to continually examine whether that institution is working efficiently."
"The Commission wanted to do this by adopting the White Paper and proposing the administrative reform drawn up by my colleague, Neil Kinnock."
"I believe that the Council will have to do this one day, as will the European Parliament, and the Commission will do all it can to support these two institutions in this undertaking."
"In this respect, I would like to reiterate that the Gothenburg European Council has already asked the Secretary-General of the Council to submit detailed proposals on this issue for the meeting at Laeken."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise - without going into the details of each proposal in your report, Mr Poos, that all we need is political will to successfully complete this assessment and improvement work."
"Obviously, this must be shown by the Member States governments as well as by the institutions themselves."
"There are at least two points that deserve particular attention. On the one hand, the concept of the legislative Council and, on the other, the role of the General Affairs Council."
"We are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the Poos report defines the three functions of the Council, which are to legislate, to take decisions regarding government and to coordinate policies."
"Consequently it is very clear - and the Commission supports this - that the Council must be organised differently so that it operates within the framework of one or another of these three functions."
"Therefore, the legislative Council should basically work in complete transparency, with open debates and public votes."
"Admittedly, the number of sectoral Councils may be too high, but it is primarily the lack of coordination between these sectoral Councils, which means that, unlike the European Parliament, in which the Assembly takes the final decision, the Council arm of the legislator has much more difficulty in coordinating its various decisions."
"This situation calls for particular consideration of how determined we are - as you mentioned in the report - to encourage consensus between Parliament and the Council from the first-reading stage within the codecision procedure."
"Mr Poos, although the Commission fully supports the determination to bring about swift agreements, we must ensure that they do not have a negative effect on the coherence of texts that the Commission proposes."
"Under the Treaties, the Commission has the exclusive right of initiative and the responsibility of protecting the common interest."
"The Commission therefore hopes that the determination of Parliament and the Council to bring about consensus at first reading ensures that the Commission will be fully involved in all aspects regarding substance and procedure, in order to guarantee this coherence in the texts adopted."
"I would like to reiterate that the Commission has been given the exclusive competence to hand down a judgment to protect the common interest at this stage of the codecision procedure."
"You are also quite right, Mr Poos, when you point out in the report that the crux of the debate is, essentially, how the General Affairs Council functions."
"It is extremely difficult, in just one monthly meeting, to take decisions on all the issues relating to EU external policy, including those on security policy, on maintaining the single institutional framework of the European Union and all the horizontal and institutional issues, such as, for example, the recent regulation on access to documents or the coordination of the EU response to the tragic events of 11 September, as well as coordinating sectoral policies."
"The Commission is fairly well placed to judge the degree of variation in the subjects dealt with by the General Affairs Council, as there are times when we require several Commissioners to represent us at the same session."
"We therefore support your view, Mr Poos: the various formations in the Council need a central body responsible for coordination and, at the moment, it is very difficult for the General Affairs Council to do this."
"We must therefore avoid a situation where the General Affairs Council becomes some sort of Foreign Affairs Council, because there is no other formation in charge of coordination."
"Furthermore, is it necessary to create a new General Affairs Council, made up of ministers who fulfil a coordinating role within their governments and who wield the necessary political authority, as you suggest?"
"This would, in any case, enable the European Council to be freed from arbitration and from policy coordination, so that it can fully devote itself to its real job of providing political impetus and defining guidelines for the European Union."
"However, creating this sort of Council raises a whole raft of political, even constitutional, issues, as you yourself admit, in some Member States, particularly in those that have a coalition government."
"To sum up, Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank Mr Poos once again for the extensive, excellent and very thorough piece of work that he has done and for the useful proposals contained in the report."
"Quite frankly, I do not believe that it is the Commission' s role to respond to one or another detailed comment regarding the way the Council functions because, as I have said, each of our institutions, quite naturally, functions autonomously."
"This, however, does not prevent us from performing a global assessment where there are no taboo subjects, to repeat the phrase that Mr Verhofstadt used this morning, when he stated that there were no taboo subjects where the wide-ranging debate and the Laeken Declaration are concerned."
"The issue of how to improve collaborative work, particularly in the field of legislation, is not a taboo subject either."
"The Commission would like to say that it is also in its interests to work with an efficient Council and that the two messages contained in this own-initiative report, in other words, that we must guarantee coherent action as well as a certain level of political representation in the Council' s decision-making, have certainly been heard, Mr Poos."
"Thank you."
"Mr President, Mrs Neyts, Commissioner Barnier, ladies and gentlemen, our group thanks the rapporteur, Mr Poos, for his report."
"Our colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, led by our coordinator, Mr Méndez de Vigo, have, of course, been committed to supporting his work."
"This report, though, sets alarm bells ringing."
"When the report observes - an observation that I welcome, although I regret its accuracy - that the coordinating role of the General Affairs Council has been undermined, the Commission's right to take initiatives weakened and, finally, government-level cooperation in Council built up to the detriment of cooperation at Community level, then that is cause for alarm as regards the Council's ability to operate."
"The Foreign Ministers, who at present constitute the General Affairs Council, can no longer perform this duty adequately."
"They travel around the world - which is after all what they are meant to do - spend a few hours in the Council, leave their deputies to represent them and are not there for the vote anyway."
"That is why the Council should, for once, take its Rules of Procedure, more specifically Article 11(4), seriously and check how many Ministers are actually present at the concluding votes."
"We need, then, a new General Affairs Council."
"Let us call it a Council of European Ministers, meeting weekly, or more often if necessary, in Brussels or, of course, in the national capitals, and always available within their governments."
"We also insist on something to which Commissioner Barnier has referred, namely that the Legislative Council which meets in public to decide on laws - not in committees, but in final rulings - needs to be separated from the Executive Council."
"I hope we will reach the point where this can be established and that a Council of European Ministers - as I wish to call it for the sake of simplicity - conceived along these lines, will also be able to coordinate the work of the various Councils."
"Some of their voting procedures are utterly different, and the European Council must then again be asked to give authority to the Council, so that the ladies and gentlemen can deal with the matter again."
"Things must change!"
"I would like to address one point which is not particularly topical but is intended to point the way ahead."
"It concerns the need to find a successor to occupy Mr Hombach's position."
"I recommend that we should not appoint a sort of Hombach Mark II to this position, not because I have anything against Mr Hombach, but because, in institutional terms, we need to go in a new direction."
"I think these duties should find a home at the Commission, so that the Commission, which has the Budget resources at its disposal, can also take responsibility for these issues..."
"(Applause)"
".... so that we can eventually achieve the transfer of the High Representative's functions to the remit of the Commission, where a Vice-President would take them over."
"(Applause)"
"Please let me make a final observation, which is not directed at my esteemed colleague Mr Poos: I hope that the present members of the Council have the strength and insight to come to the right decisions while they belong to the Council and not only after becoming honourable Members of this European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in this debate firstly in order to express my personal gratitude and that of my group to Mr Poos for his wonderful report."
"It really is a piece of work carried out with knowledge of the subject, not only because he is a veteran of the Council, but because I witnessed perfectly, ten years ago when we were preparing the Treaty of Maastricht, how Mr Poos, then a member of the Council with the government of Mr Santer, along with Mr Santer, showed the same attitude of openness, cooperation and solidarity towards Parliament which he is now proposing in his report."
"The result was the Treaty of Maastricht, which gave us codecision."
"I believe that we must salute his coherent and serious political track record."
"With regard to codecision, we are not just dealing with a reform of the Council as such, but we are an interested party in the matter."
"Codecision has allowed us to develop a shared culture in which the Council, for the first time, has been opening up to Parliament."
"We must consolidate this."
"There is a very important step proposed by the Poos report, which is that the Council, in legislative session, should act publicly."
"If there is an insufficient number of Ministers, they could apply the rule applied by Parliament: that votes should be nominal, and if members are not present, they should not be paid allowances."
"These are therefore measures which can be applied straight away and which do not have to await the reform."
"From this point of view, I believe that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, whose path has taken the opposite course, having moved on from Parliament to the Council, can introduce a degree of freshness into the work of the Council."
"I hope she can cooperate with us."
"A final observation, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: we are on the eve of the Convention; we have fought for it in Parliament and we believe that we also have to cooperate positively in the process of reforming our institutions, which are interdependent on each other, in a way which means that we cannot reform one without taking account of the others."
"In conclusion, I believe that we have to teach by example."
"We are awaiting the Council meeting on the 30 October, from which we want a unanimous position from the Council with regard to the Belgian proposal on taxation, in order to bring about the statute of Members once and for all; we also believe that the package of anti-terrorist measures is a great opportunity to demonstrate to our co-citizens that we are united."
"And lastly, the President-in-Office of the Council will allow me to point out that we would like her, with a view to Laeken, between the White Paper on Governance and the Mandelkern report, which is with the Council, to present us with a coherent proposal which is not based on a reduction of Parliament' s legislative powers."
"That would also help the reform."
"Mr President, just as the Commission and we in Parliament change our methods of working, the former through its White Paper, the Council too must of course change its own methods of working, both in the light of enlargement and because, as many people point out, its present methods do not work so well at present."
"Mr Poos has much long-standing experience of how the Council operates."
"I hope that the Council will take his views on board."
"I assume that this issue will come up at the convention and that, as Mr Verhofstadt said this morning, there will be no taboos."
"Precisely what shape is to be taken by the Council' s work is not of course something we Liberals have any reason for taking a view on, because it is not our task to regulate these matters."
"There are nonetheless certain issues in which we think we can become involved."
"Transparency is one such issue."
"For us, transparency in the EU' s work is important when it comes to all the institutions."
"It is a key to winning back people' s confidence in the European project."
"At present, the Council meets behind closed doors and legislates for millions upon millions of Europeans."
"That is not acceptable."
"Everyone talks about this, and everyone criticises it."
"Very minor reforms take place, but these are not enough."
"The legislation must be a matter for public debate."
"A separate department must be formed within the Council in which the ministers meet entirely openly and in public in order to legislate."
"There must, moreover, be proper Minutes issued afterwards."
"The members of this legislative Council must of course be politicians, not officials, with clear mandates from their respective governments."
"Another issue which worries us rather, and which Mr Poos also addressed, is that of all the overhyped 'mini-summits' which assume an enormous amount of importance."
"A great many decisions are made during these meetings of rather doubtful status."
"We hope that less emphasis will be placed on these meetings and that they will instead be transformed into working meetings."
"There is an increased tendency in the Council - not so much in the country that at present holds the Presidency, but in many others, especially Sweden - towards intergovernmental activity and a desire to strengthen the Council at Parliament' s and the Commission' s expense."
"We view this development with great concern, because more intergovernmental activity and more decisions behind closed doors scarcely lead to a more democratic EU."
"Mr President, during a meeting last Saturday, I happened to hear a new colleague of an important minister describing, with the frankness of a newcomer, his first experience of a Council of Ministers. He said that it was a sort of Barnum Circus, where everyone talks but hardly anyone listens or actually seeks agreement."
"We support the rapporteur and the majority of his proposals, and so I would like to use the time available to me to send two messages from our group to the Council, in particular."
"The first is that, even if the Council were to approve Parliament' s proposals tomorrow morning, we would not be able to resolve the fundamental democratic imbalance and we would not be able to stop the intergovernmental drift."
"The only way to genuinely improve the democracy and efficiency of the Union is by strengthening the Commission and Parliament and removing the Council' s right of veto."
"The second message is a call to reflect on what Commissioner Barnier has said, namely that despite the positive elements and the endeavours of the Belgian Presidency, it would currently be impossible to reform the Council without a grass roots debate among its members on the very nature of the Council."
"I am sure that ideas vary among the Union' s Member States on the Council' s future, and I therefore call strongly upon the Presidency to assume responsibility for organising this debate on the future and to ensure that practical steps are taken which open up the way for rapid progress along the path outlined by Mr Poos, pending more comprehensive reforms."
"Mr President, Mr Poos and the Commission' s gargantuan endeavours could be likened to those of an eagle which is eager but unable to take flight towards the future heights of the new European ambitions."
"However, we must see this report as a positive contribution to the preparations for the future structure of the Union, a Union which must of necessity be an autonomous, independent political entity, secure in its cultural and social traditions, which can serve as an effective response to the confusion brought by a hegemony such as that we are currently witnessing."
"The Union must assume a new role."
"In a situation in which alliances are being disbanded and reformed on a global scale, Europe comes across as weak, appointing dubious triumvirates to represent it on the world stage when it needs to be united and firmly autonomous in presenting and maintaining a line of peace and social justice to eradicate the threat of terrorism."
"The reforms proposed by the Poos report are necessary and achievable, and we support them."
"These are small but important steps, worthy of due consideration by the Council and Parliament."
"They will also contribute greatly to resolving the democratic deficit, endowing the Council with a new institutional role and a closer relationship with Parliament."
"This fundamental political and external security action and its mandated representative can only be effective if decisions are taken in a context of joint responsibility between all the countries rather than with some of them being excluded."
"The Council has to understand this."
"We are not just complaining for the sake of it: this is a democratic requirement for the well-structured, transparent running of the Union and will benefit the Union as a whole."
"Mr President, I would like to say that I believe that both Parliament and the Commission are most fortunate in having somebody of the calibre of Mr Poos to give us this very fine report which is long overdue."
"I very much welcome Mr Poos' report and very much hope that when it receives overwhelming support from Parliament, as I believe it will, the Belgian Presidency will convey the importance of the report to the Council of Ministers."
"We hope also that the Belgian Presidency will lead the drive, as it were, to rock the consciences of the members of the General Affairs Council as to what their role and function must and should be."
"Regrettably, the General Affairs Council has very much receded into the background in terms of its effectiveness."
"The Council has been undermined by the expansion of specialised Councils and by the European Council itself and this is very regrettable."
"The General Affairs Council, as Mr Poos says, must remain a powerful political body and it must not be allowed to become a super Coreper."
"If it does, nobody will have an overall view of what is happening; where we should go and how we are to prepare for the future."
"The work of the Council must be more consistent, and greater coordination is needed in the administration of the Council."
"I feel the Council should confine itself to defining the general political guidelines of the Union and should not intervene in the questions of specific detail."
"It is very much in the interests of better decision-making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty."
"Also, Ministers who attend the General Affairs Council meetings must have all the powers required to carry out their tasks."
"We are all too familiar with Ministers appearing at General Affairs Council meetings, taking the television cameras on the way in with their one or two one-liners and then going on their way."
"The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief."
"Madame, I know, I was there!"
"I saw it for myself on more than one occasion and things have not improved since I left."
"In actual fact, they have got much worse, and that is something that must be aired."
"We want the General Affairs Council to do its business."
"We would like the Presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the Commission to do its business."
"We respect, and must respect, the three institutions and the role that they have to play."
"This Parliament cannot afford to sit back and be silent if we see the role of any one of the institutions, be it Parliament or the Commission or, indeed the Council, being sidelined for any particular reason by any small group of Member States for any political reasons they may have at any time."
"Mr President, who knows the Ministers Mr Van Dale, Mr Conde de Saro and Mr Christoffersen?"
"These three gentlemen will, over the next 14 months, be responsible for the adoption of the majority of laws in the EU."
"The permanent representatives of the countries which hold, or are to hold, the presidency - Belgium, Spain and Denmark - are clever diplomats who live in the shadows."
"They meet every week in Brussels and negotiate the larger part of our laws."
"Seventy per cent of these are prepared by their subordinates and aides."
"Fifteen per cent of them they deal with themselves."
"Another 15% are placed on the ministers' desks, and the permanent representatives brief or deputise for the ministers during the formal adoption."
"The meetings take place behind sealed doors so that no one can see how far we are from that democracy in which we are united in believing in the fifteen Member States."
"It does happen that a matter is discussed in public and finds echoes in the national parliaments. Indeed, it may directly entail a brief or negotiating mandate for the minister."
"However, that is the exception. As a rule, we as voters and elected representatives have forfeited the larger part of our democracy, which is administered by 15 permanent representatives and their officials."
"The solution to this democratic deficit or embezzlement, for we know, of course, who have absconded with the power, is simple: to read our constitutions and return legislative power to the elected representatives."
"Let us recreate the core of democracy whereby the electorate can go to the polls and new majorities can be obtained and new laws adopted."
"That core does not exist in today' s EU."
"Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, we could actually say that we have had a stroke of luck."
"The day after one of the worst spectacles that the European Union and, in particular, its Council of Ministers has ever provided to the citizens of Europe, the excellent report by Mr Poos, the former chairman of the Council of Ministers, appears, which not only shows us the way forward - it gives an outline that should be displayed on all the churches or public buildings in the European Union, just like the theses used to be posted on the Wittemburg church."
"We have witnessed a European Council, where the dispersal of the institutions, the dispersal of the Council, split up into asides, factions and the most diverse formations, had a detrimental effect on the work of the Belgian Presidency, which did nothing to cause this of course. Now we are reiterating the great principles and calmly and dispassionately saying how Europe should be run, and where it is failing, because we are not applying the wise recommendations and thoughts of Mr Poos, which are also enhanced by his years of experience, of someone who has an insider' s view of the Council of Ministers, and of the European Council full stop."
"I therefore think that the vote on this report is a great moment for Parliament."
"Unfortunately, Europe in practice does not provide any inspiration at all, which is one of the main reasons why the work of the EU, the image of the EU and the weight of the EU are insufficient."
"Therefore, if this text can be an element that the Belgian Presidency, in the run-up to the Laeken Summit and the Laeken Declaration, may largely take into consideration by saying 'ladies and gentlemen, this is the way forward, this is the Community method and this is how things should be run, so that at least we are trying to put our house in order' , then this text will be worthwhile, and I hope it will receive Parliament' s unanimous approval tomorrow."
"In any case, the radical Members will support it unreservedly."
"We think that this is the way forward, that this is how we get there, that we must see European integration and not European destruction, which is, unfortunately, what the Council all too often gives us the impression is being allowed to happen. It is not really the Council itself, but its members, its actors, who certainly demonstrated at Ghent, as they did at Nice, that they are very capable of breaking up the institutions, and that they are actively working towards this goal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mr Poos and point out that all the institutions of the European Union will have to re-orientate themselves and find better ways of working in view of the challenges being presented to them, the enlargement of the European Union and the changes which will come about simply because of the number of people involved."
"The Commission has for some time been pressing on with this sort of internal reform process."
"The European Parliament is occupied in creating the same sort of conditions by means of the Corbett report, which is currently in progress, provided we can achieve these without amendments to the Treaties becoming necessary."
"I believe this should be done by both these institutions and also by the Council, which will have the greatest problems simply by reason of the increase in the number of its members."
"For when I consider that in future, when there are 27 members at a meeting of the European Council, it will take an hour and a half simply to deal with the precedence of delegations and then that the statements made by every delegation will make even lunch difficult - and of course we cannot go without lunch - then it clearly does not go without saying that we will be able to work effectively."
"This has nothing to do with the effectiveness of a Council Presidency, but exclusively with the structures."
"That is why it is extraordinarily important that we really do tackle many of Mr Poos' proposals in this area, which can be realised by simple amendments to the Rules of Procedure and without Treaty amendments."
"I believe we have to do this for two reasons, namely to increase efficiency and for the sake of greater transparency."
"Efficiency can only be increased by the burden of the General Council no longer having to be borne by one pair of hands and in the context of one organisation."
"Meeting up constitutes Item A, we do a bit of foreign policy, then all 27 of us meet the President of Kazakhstan, then move on to Item B, which is legislation, and all this with seamless transitions from one item to the next, so that half the participants are always in a press conference."
"Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I may be exaggerating a bit, but I fear that the reality is rather like that in some areas."
"It would in fact be necessary, for this reason, to move over to an Executive Council concentrating on foreign policy in particular."
"We really should be in a position to formulate a coherent foreign policy in the Council, provided that it is an intergovernmental organisation, and must make it clear that one effect of transparency will be a Legislative Council whose votes will be publicly taken and publicly explained."
"We will only win people' s acceptance of Europe if they know who took what decision and for what reason."
"That is a fundamental issue when it comes to gaining our citizens' acceptance, and only in this way can we, by means of the codecision procedure, bring about the public interaction of Parliament and the Council, so that the citizen and the media have the chance to reach a fair judgment and hold to account those who are responsible, or believed to be responsible, for wrong decisions."
"I believe it to be urgently necessary that the work should be made parliamentary in this way and that this should be the means by which it is also made political."
"We are engaged in the work of legislation, which in many fields is regulated by officials who share in the decisions."
"I find it hard to reconcile this with our democratic conceptions and so I would like to ask you to take the initiative on this point in Laeken, because we can achieve a great deal without amending the Treaty and should also be preparing ourselves in this way for enlargement of the European Union."
"Mr President, the Poos report is audacious, cautious and realistic. Audacious because it immediately proposes a set of amendments to improve the workings of the Council."
"Cautious because it acknowledges the viability of the amendments without needing to modify the Treaties. And realistic because it recognises that it is also becoming politically necessary to make considerable improvements to the workings of both the Commission and Parliament."
"The report' s proposals even consider the idea that improving the institutional workings of the Union will require major adjustments to the balance of established power which, without endangering the workings of these bodies, guarantee the full participation of all Member States."
"I would say, as a matter of fact, that this is the fundamental issue."
"The broad objectives for the European Union in economic, social and security terms and for its external representation will only be achieved in the short term if Europe as a whole, through its various public opinions, and the fifteen Member States, through their representatives in the various bodies, attach priority and urgency to improving political cohesion on the basis of fully egalitarian participation."
"Passivity, a lack of clear definition, division and disputes between countries, which prevent changes from taking place, help maintain the status quo, prove right those who see the European Union as nothing more than a group of merchants whose primary concern is to divide up the limited financial resources it has available in a way that is not always fair or equitable."
"Strengthening the institutions, improving their workings and efficiency, drafting and producing Community policies for security and for our external representation is absolutely essential, but this must be carried out by all fifteen Member States without exceptions and without cabinets."
"For this reason, the report warrants our support and our admiration."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report we are debating today is an intelligent and creditable attempt by Mr Poos to reform the Council without changing the Treaties."
"I congratulate the rapporteur on his efforts although I cannot share his optimism."
"I do not believe that this mini-reform can solve the problems of the Council nor do I see the political will to carry it out, unfortunately."
"I hope that I am wrong and Mr Poos is right."
"Mr President, the golden age of the General Affairs Council has passed and it seems unrealistic to believe that the European Council is prepared to reinstate the powers which it has taken away from it."
"European policies are not external policies but internal policies of the Member States and the important decisions must not be reserved for the Foreign Affairs Ministers."
"They already have enough to do with the common foreign and security policy."
"The institutional triangle is still essential to the good functioning of the Union, provided that each of its elements continues to adapt to the new requirements."
"In the case of the Council, we are facing a quagmire whose deficiencies can only be remedied: a) by recognising the decisive role of the European Council; b) by giving the General Affairs Council the task of effectively preparing its decisions so that they are not relegated to national bureaucracies; and c) by organising all the specialised Councils into an efficiently-structured system."
"This efficiency will not be achieved without abandoning the now obsolete system of a rotating six-monthly Presidency, replacing it with a longer-lasting Presidency."
"Effective political action cannot change its priorities every six months."
"My group raised this issue in the debate of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, although, out of respect for the focus of the report, we do not insist on this point."
"The Poos report has the merit of proposing to the Council some minimal reforms, which are likely to lead to a process of self-reform which is becoming increasingly essential."
"I would be pleased if it achieved that objective at least."
"We would all gain from this, even those of us who believe that Council reforms can only be achieved by the Convention because they need to be far more in-depth."
"Mr President, every single pronouncement by the European Parliament expresses our faith in democracy, transparency and efficiency. And quite rightly so."
"However, it is not enough. These general principles only acquire substance and translate into practice if they permeate the organisational structure of the entire European Union."
"Which is precisely why we should welcome Jacques Poos' motion for a resolution."
"It is one of the most important texts to pass through the European Parliament."
"The rapporteur demonstrates that a great deal can be done in the area of both democracy and efficiency without revising the Treaties, merely by applying them more accurately."
"Taking the report as my starting point, I should at least like to highlight the following: first, the way in which the Council is organised is so complicated, with its 27 sectoral formations which have a fragmentary effect on its work."
"It addresses individual trees, but rarely the wood as a whole."
"The General Affairs Council should meet more frequently, but with the ministers present, not just in Brussels but, if possible, at the meetings too."
"If the Council is to work, national administrations and governments need to adapt to the European institutional attitude and modus operandi."
"As for relations between the Council and the European Parliament, there is good cause to increase the numbers of days' presence, although personal appearances in Parliament by the President-in-Office of the Council and transparency do not necessarily mean that the Council has to be reformed."
"Finally, I note that the Europe issue has increased the volume of work and deserves greater attention."
"The members of the Council need to make a reasonable division between their national and European duties if they are to make a more effective contribution."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I, in turn, should like to congratulate Jacques Poos on the excellent report which he has presented to the House and to thank him for the highly democratic manner in which he dealt with the proposals and observations of the other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, observations intended to improve the report."
"I should like to comment on three points in the report which I consider extremely important."
"The first is item 9, which refers to the Council's two areas of work, namely the legislative and the executive."
"I think that Mr Poos is quite right to say that a distinction must be made between the legislative Council, that is, it must be clear when the Council is acting in a legislative capacity and when it is acting in an executive capacity."
"This is extremely important and, I think, needs to be borne in mind."
"The second point concerns collaboration between the Council and the European Parliament."
"It would be unfair to the Council not to say that certain steps have been taken, but that does not mean that more are not needed."
"I should like to comment on two paragraphs in Mr Poos' proposals which I think are very important."
"The first is paragraph 18, which refers to the role and the relations which the High Representative for the CFSP should have with Parliament."
"I should like to ask the Council to bring Mr Solana to order."
"The High Representative needs to learn that his relations with Parliament come within a certain framework and are governed by certain rules which he would do well to understand."
"The second paragraph is Paragraph 19."
"I was delighted at the excellent example set by the Belgian presidency this morning, when the President-in-Office of the Council reported to the European Parliament in person, and I should like to congratulate Mr Verhofstadt for this morning."
"The third point, which I think is very important, is the huge issue of transparency."
"It is an issue which concerns all the institutional bodies of the European Union."
"It has been raised by other Members, such as Mrs Malmström, who has done an excellent job on the issue of transparency, as, of course, has Mrs Maij-Weggen, but what I want to say to the Council is that European citizens are not just interested in what the Council decides; they are far more interested in why it decides what it does."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Council functions poorly, which is also bad news for all the other EU institutions."
"It is bad for Parliament and it is bad for the Commission."
"The lack of transparency and efficiency, which have often been referred to here, also affect our work and give us a bad image in the eyes of the EU's citizens."
"That is why reform of the Council is urgently necessary, as must be emphasised again and again."
"Mr Poos has produced useful and valuable suggestions as to how such a reform might now be possible without the need for a new European Treaty."
"I share the view that people have a right to know who votes and which way when it comes to laws and regulations that affect their daily lives."
"The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character."
"I do not believe that the number of Councils on various sectors is the problem."
"The problem is the deficient coordination within the Council and also within the governments of the Member States."
"Changes must be made here."
"I believe we must follow up this idea of sending a permanent minister to Brussels who would take over the coordination of government policy at national level."
"On Monday, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs added further items to the agenda, for example, the issue of the Council Presidency when there are at least twenty-five Member States, or also how the European Council is to be defined."
"What is that?"
"An organ, a super-board, or is it part of the Council?"
"This reform is urgently needed, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and we hope that you can do something even before Laeken, and that, in Laeken, the Council will again be on the agenda with a view to the future Treaty on the Union."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to thank Mr Poos for this report on the much-needed Council reforms."
"We sometimes say in connection with the Pope that there is no need to be married to be able to talk about marriage."
"However, in the case of Mr Poos, we can say that he has every right to talk about the Council as he has formed part of it for a very long time."
"How badly the Council functions at crucial moments was evident at the Ghent Summit where three Prime Ministers had made prior arrangements outside of the Council, where the President of the Council made essential statements on the evaluation of the attacks on Afghanistan which were subsequently not backed by the Council, where various Prime Ministers made various statements following the European Summit, where decisions were taken on a payment issue of banks in relation to the euro, but where no decisions were made on crucial anti-terrorist measures proposed by the Commission and Parliament and where, to cap it all, an embarrassing dispute arose between the President of the Council and the President of the Commission."
"That is how the Council comes across to the public. And that negative image dominates the entire decision-making process and the way the Union is viewed throughout the Union."
"How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union functions better and to improve the Council' s image with the citizen?"
"How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union' s entire institutional structure is more democratic and open?"
"In my opinion, a few factors are of crucial significance in this."
"First of all, the Council must confine itself to its original brief, namely to express the view of the Member State governments, under the supervision of the national parliaments and the European Parliament."
"Secondly, the Council must coordinate its tasks more effectively, thus ensuring that the General Affairs Council and the joint committees speak with one voice."
"In my view, the number of joint committees could be cut down even further."
"Thirdly, the General Affairs Council should function far more forcefully on the basis of solid positions of national members of government for European affairs, preferably in the capacity of Minister."
"Belgium set a good example in this connection."
"Fourthly, where legislation and the budget are concerned, all Council meetings should be public, which means that both discussions and decision-making should take place in public and reports that are compiled on these should also be made public."
"Fifthly, in the case of legislation, including the budget, only ministers should be granted a right to vote, which means that it is not acceptable for them to be replaced by, for example, the permanent representative or by officials."
"In my opinion, the Council should function entirely in line with its actual task as a Federal Council, much like its German model, so that it becomes crystal clear to the citizens what its role is in the democratic process of the Union."
"I truly hope that the report by Mr Poos will play a key role in the forthcoming IGC and above all, I hope that the Council will take to heart what has been expressed here in Parliament in the way of criticism, but also the odd word of praise."
"Mr President, people have a right to know how their representatives in government have acted and voted in the Council."
"It is entirely unacceptable in a democracy for laws to be made behind closed and bolted doors on behalf of 380 million people and without there being any public scrutiny."
"The most important position adopted in the European Parliament' s report on Council reform is therefore to be found in Paragraph 26, concerning the need for openness and stating the European Parliament' s request that, when the Council acts as legislator, both the deliberations and the votes should be in the public domain, as well as Parliament' s particular request that, at the beginning and end of all legislative procedures, public debates be held in accordance with Rule 8 of the Council' s Rules of Procedure and that Rule 9(1) of the Council' s Rules of Procedure be implemented."
"It also states that the results of votes and the explanations of vote referring to legislative texts must be published."
"Through this future openness, the European Union will be democratised."
"It will lead to greater pressure being exercised by electorates and to greater supervision of the Council by national parliaments."
"It is about time!"
"In turn, that will lead to growing demands for a concentration of the EU' s tasks and the need to limit the EU' s powers of decision-making."
"In other words, the report we are adopting today will have long-term consequences."
"I believe that we are thus coming significantly nearer the objective formulated by former Commission President Jacques Santer in 1995: Do fewer things, but do them better."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 10.00 a.m."
"Preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation"
"The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparations for the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation."
"Commissioner, Mr President, honourable MEPs, in two weeks' time, the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation will get underway in Doha, Qatar."
"The European Union is making every effort to ensure that, on that occasion, a new trade round will commence on the basis of a broad and balanced agenda."
"In this connection, the conclusions reached by the General Affairs Council on 26 October 1999 will remain a point of reference."
"The General Affairs Council of 8 October has underlined the importance of a new trade round."
"Next week' s General Affairs Council will once again examine the state of affairs."
"It is indeed important for a strong and united Union to leave for Doha."
"You all know, of course, that it is the Commission that negotiates in matters of trade on behalf of the European Union - as is the case here - and that Commissioner Lamy, who will be taking the floor after me, plays an absolutely crucial and, in any case, very valued role in this."
"For your information, I should like to add that the topic of the preparation of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation has also been discussed during the Social Affairs Council, the Agriculture Council, and, if I am not mistaken, this will also be done at the Environment Council, with a view to harmonising the positions, or at least, to being informed of the different sensitive issues."
"A new round of broad-based negotiations must enable progress to be made in the further liberation and regulation of world trade, which is vital for a variety of reasons."
"Firstly, the Conference will be taking place against a backdrop of a slowing down world economy, a situation which has been exacerbated by the tragic events of 11 September which are having a negative impact on economic growth in both the industrial and developing countries."
"An agreement on the start of a new round will thus give the world economy a powerful and positive signal."
"Even during the most recent informal Council in Ghent, the EU Heads of State and Government and the President of the Commission urged, and I quote: ""to work actively towards launching of the WTO negotiations."
"The current economic uncertainty means that trade liberalisation founded on a rules-based multilateral system and associated with a real development dimension is more important than ever, economically and politically"" - end of quote."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a new round of trade negotiations is also extremely important for the developing countries."
"The round must enable us to improve the integration of developing countries, and especially the least developed countries, into the multilateral trade system, particularly by providing better market access, through measures that facilitate the implementation of agreements that have already been reached, and also through measures that seek to make more operational the special and differential treatment given to these countries."
"Thirdly, a new round will aim to strengthen the WTO rules-based system, by clarifying and explaining existing provisions, particularly with regard to trade and the environment, and by extending the WTO' s scope to new areas such as investment, competition and trade facilitation, so that the WTO adjusts to the needs that have come about due to changes in the global economy and so that it responds to the concerns arising from globalisation."
"The European Union will also attempt to promote multilateral governance by ensuring increased coherence and improved cooperation of the WTO with other international organisations, particularly with the International Labour Organisation (ILO), in order to help to improve the way that globalisation is controlled."
"(NL) I should like to underline that consequently, the European Union not only seeks to further liberalise world trade, it also seeks to further regulate world trade."
"In fact, that reflects public opinion in the Member States perfectly."
"Non-trade issues, further progress in terms of transparency of the World Trade Organisation mechanism, the preservation of the European model of government services and the special statute of those services are some of the interests which the European Union protects."
"Together with the developing countries, a serious effort has been made over the past three years on the issue surrounding implementation."
"That has made it possible to identify the relevant themes."
"In some cases, these concern the application of the agreements, or a slight adjustment or interpretation of the text to be specified."
"In other cases, these concern points which could well result in a formal change to the existing agreements."
"All this slows down the process."
"It is a process in which the European Union takes an active part, and is fully aware that this forms a key component for many countries."
"I should like to point out that, alongside this effort involving the developing countries, an effort must also be made involving the so-called 'rich countries' which were originally, up until the beginning of this year, absolutely unconvinced - some more than others - of the fact that there is a real problem of implementation with regard to the developing countries."
"(FR) Commissioner, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for over a year, the European Union has played a central role in another important matter, namely trying to find a solution to enable the world' s poorest people to have proper and effective access to medicines."
"The European Commission action plan in this area was approved by the General Affairs Council last May."
"The European Union is working hard so that a clear statement on access to medicines and on the TRIPS agreement can be adopted at the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha."
"Today, the WTO consultations are focusing on the draft Ministerial Declaration and on the draft decision on implementation-related issues. Two documents, which were tabled on 26 September by Stuart Harbison, the Chairman of the WTO General Council."
"Many of the WTO members consider these documents to be a good basis for our work, and they will be amended in line with the negotiations that have taken place since they were published."
"As far as the European Union is concerned, the draft Ministerial Declaration will take into account a whole raft of subjects that we consider to be crucial."
"The document still, however, falls short of expectations in several areas."
"Commissioner Pascal Lamy will no doubt comment on this issue in his speech, and the Commission will continue to strive to ensure that the Ministerial Declaration responds to the European Union' s concerns and interests."
"We are taking an active part in the negotiations on the agenda of the new round with an open and flexible approach, and we are also particularly concerned about assisting developing countries whilst protecting the legitimate aims and objectives of the European Union."
"While the various components that will feature in the new round and the implementation-related issues form a whole, the final assessment by the Union will be based on both the overall balance and on the balance within the various subjects that will be discussed."
"(NL) Mr President, Commissioner, by way of conclusion, I should like to say that the purport of the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation is to further adjust the regulating effect of world trade, and that this conference offers us a chance to give the world economy a considerable boost by commencing a new trade round."
"Finally, I should like to underline the positive political and economic significance of such a round."
"It aims to reinforce international solidarity, curb inequality and to enhance the stability of the world and the world economy."
"Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having organised this debate on the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation. There are two weeks to go before the conference opens and some lively discussions are now going on in Geneva and elsewhere on the negotiating programme that will be launched."
"I would now like to say that, as negotiator for the European Union, it is very important to me that the European Parliament actively participates in this debate."
"As you know, we fought together, at the previous Intergovernmental Conference - at which the Treaty of Nice, as we call it, was draw up - in order to enhance Parliament' s competences in the area of trade policy."
"As you also know, the Member States did not adopt our proposals."
"In these circumstances, the Commission is doing everything in its power, within the framework imposed on us by the Treaty, to inform the European Parliament and to involve it in the Union' s trade policy."
"You also know that we are in favour of creating a consultative parliamentary body at the WTO, to enhance the role of Members in the multilateral trading system."
"I am convinced that, if we want the support of public opinion, if we want to improve the WTO' s legitimacy, then enhancing the role of Members in the WTO' s work is not only possible, but also, and above all, it is necessary."
"So, what is in the negotiating programme proposed by the European Union?"
"On several occasions over the last two years, since Seattle, we have had the opportunity to come together to discuss the progress of preparations for the forthcoming Ministerial Conference."
"The exchanges of views that we have had here or in committee have given us food for thought as to which strategy should be applied."
"The considerations and concerns that you have voiced during these meetings are very similar to those of the Commission."
"Like us, you want a negotiating programme on the liberalisation of trade and investment, to meet the needs of our exporters and those of developing countries."
"But, like us, you also want an agenda that focuses on the drafting of new rules, the clarification of current rules and the linking-up of World Trade Organisation rules and those of other international bodies in the areas of society, the environment, health or food safety."
"It is these rules that will provide greater market efficiency, better social development and sufficient environmental protection."
"We believe that the key to sustainable development of the planet as a whole hinges on our ability to combine the opening-up of the markets with the application of multilateral rules."
"This is why there are three subjects on the agenda supported by the European Union since the Seattle meeting. These are market access, regulation and the integration of developing countries; the unity of these three subjects is guaranteed by what is called the single undertaking."
"Lastly, we want to hold intense negotiations and come to swift conclusions."
"Some may be surprised that the tragic events of 11 September have changed neither course nor our schedule."
"I would like to briefly explain this."
"Even before 11 September, we believed that an approach based on the principle of well-ordered liberalisation was required."
"This has become even more necessary since the terrorist attacks took place."
"The process of opening up markets, regulating trade, integrating developing countries and the concern to ensure environmental and social sustainability - we need these more now than ever before."
"These are issues of stability and security, both in relations between countries and between generations."
"Dialogue, negotiation and peaceful resolution to commercial conflicts have made international trade a laboratory for international governance, where each partner participates in decision-making."
"Faced with the instability caused by the attacks, we must further strengthen the importance of the multilateral dimension, which we believe to be the best way to give today' s de facto globalisation a legal status."
"Of course, the WTO is only one of the pillars making up a multilateral system, which must meet the challenges of globalisation."
"A round of World Trade Organisation negotiations is therefore necessary, of course, but it is in no way sufficient."
"We must also strengthen the other institutions of governance, the environment, social development, development funding and policy support agencies."
"Let us now consider the prospects for the Ministerial Conference, which will take place in two weeks' time."
"Generally speaking, I think that we are in a better position than we were at this stage before the Seattle conference."
"The preparatory work is being carried out in a spirit of positive cooperation."
"The belief that the multilateral system must now, more than ever, be an essential part of growth and prosperity is widely shared."
"And I think we must also point out that the open, constructive spirit and the efforts made by many partners - such as ourselves, the United States, and an increasing number of developing countries - have already helped to partly reconcile the differing views that prevented Seattle from being a success."
"This came across very clearly at the last informal select meeting of WTO trade ministers, which was held in Singapore on 13 and 14 October and which I attended."
"I feel that this was also correctly reflected at the meeting of APEC trade ministers (Pacific-rim countries) that took place last week."
"I think that we have now reached a point where we can envisage an ambitious, balanced round that meets the primary objectives of the European Union."
"Of course, we have not yet achieved this goal."
"We are now entering the final and crucial stage, in the run-up to Doha."
"As you know, a draft Ministerial Declaration, which will constitute the framework of negotiations for the new round, was published on 26 September 2001."
"All the members of the WTO considered this document to be a sound basis for moving forward."
"Of course, no one was fully satisfied, which, if you are familiar with the culture at the WTO, is more or less a good sign prior to negotiations."
"Obviously, not everything in this document is acceptable, not even for us, and I shall outline to you the main areas of difficulty, which require further work."
"The first difficulty concerns trade and the environment, areas that give us particular cause for concern due to the lack of ambitious proposals."
"Clearly, we hope to make the framework for negotiation much more substantial."
"Progress is being made in some areas, but we must admit that most of our partners in developing countries are still hesitant, to say the least, about the idea of accepting negotiations on this subject."
"We shall do everything we can in the following days to improve this situation."
"I also made it clear to my colleagues, in Singapore, that a framework on this issue was not only a political necessity for the European Union, but should also be of interest to all the members of the World Trade Organisation and of the multilateral system as a whole."
"I think that the message concerning the political importance that this question holds for us has got through."
"We still need to draw operational consequences from this."
"The second difficulty, after environment, is agriculture, which is still a very sensitive subject."
"The draft declaration before us seems to pre-empt the outcome of the negotiations in several respects, since it aims, in particular, to phase out subsidy categories, which goes further than the framework that Franz Fischler and myself received..."
"Mr Lamy, I must ask you to interrupt your speech."
"As you will all, of course, understand, this is an exercise in evacuating the Parliament building."
"We shall adjourn the sitting and leave the Chamber immediately."
"I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to follow the instructions given by Parliament' s security staff calmly and orderly, and to leave by the emergency exits."
"This sitting is now adjourned, and will resume as soon as the bells indicate that work can be resumed as normal."
"(The sitting was interrupted at 16.35 due to a fire drill and resumed at 17.10)"
"Mr President, I shall carry on with what I was saying before this brief interruption, which is that the draft statement for the Doha Conference, currently on the table, raises a number of issues with regard to the environment and agriculture, and now I shall talk about the social aspect."
"We are not completely satisfied with some aspects of the statement either, specifically with the way it deals with the social domain."
"We feel that it is treated too sparingly and should be extended to more appropriately reflect the importance of this issue for our societies and our own ambition, for such is the mandate I was given, to establish an international and multi-institutional dialogue on this subject."
"With regard to investment and competition, we are unhappy with one of the options put forward, which is to limit ourselves to working programmes."
"In our opinion, working programmes cannot replace negotiations, even if it does make sense that there should be a connection between a working programme and a negotiation, provided, of course, that this is agreed in advance."
"The issue of the relationship between health and intellectual property, which the President-in-Office of the Council mentioned, is also problematic."
"As you know, we are very committed to this matter and we are working actively on reconciling the more extreme positions so that a substantial political statement can be agreed on in Doha, reconciling the flexibility of the agreement on intellectual property with, on the one hand, the need of developing countries for access to essential medicines and, on the other, the concern to ensure that innovation through research can take place."
"These are our concerns and other delegations will obviously have their own concerns about the ministerial statement."
"For a number of developing countries, the implementation of existing WTO agreements, or in many cases, their adaptation, is of the utmost importance and we must, we feel, be willing to respond openly and creatively to these concerns."
"Some of the least advanced countries have a real problem of lack of capacity and resources and a solution must be found to this problem in the future work of the World Trade Organisation."
"Despite the concerns that I have highlighted, most of the WTO member countries seem increasingly willing to show the necessary flexibility and openness to sufficiently conduct ambitious negotiations in Doha in terms of substance, and I am beginning to think that we might be able to see our four priorities met there: trade liberalisation, further regulation, the inclusion of development at the top of the multilateral agenda and the integration of our objectives for sustainable development into the WTO."
