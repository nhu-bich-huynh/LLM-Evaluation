"Unfortunately, Prime Minister Fico was slow to distance himself from all of this, and was certainly not unequivocal when he did so."
"I am sure that the Slovak Prime Minister is slowly realising that the European Union will not tolerate any government playing with the fire of nationalism."
"This smouldering fire of nationalism ought to have been put out in Slovakia immediately."
"The prime minister is wrong if he holds the minority's representatives responsible for this."
"It is unlikely that Martin Schulz, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Hans-Gert Poettering or Elmar Brok spoke out last week in favour of stirring up the Hungarian coalition."
"Europe's values do not allow nationalism."
"Isolating Slovakia is of no interest to anyone, but it is the duty of every one of us to overcome nationalism and racism."
"There has been tension with the new government in Slovakia where a situation arose that violated EU values."
"Physical violence has occurred, and openly racist graffiti appeared, simply because someone was speaking Hungarian, because they belonged to a different nationality."
"Prime Minister Robert Fico was slow to respond and did not distance himself appropriately from the xenophobic behaviour and anti-Hungarian attacks."
"In fact, the way in which he has responded is astonishing."
"He is making attacks, political judgments and is looking for a scapegoat."
"Sure enough, he has found one in the legitimate representative of Slovakia's Hungarian voters, the Party of the Hungarian Coalition."
"Why is all this happening?"
"Our fears have been realised."
"The crucial mistake occurred when an extremist, mainly anti-Hungarian party became a member of the government."
"This opened the floodgates and intimidation has gained credibility."
"What lesson can we learn from this situation?"
"EU institutions should pay closer attention to current events in our Member States, and if necessary, should respond and act immediately in order to nip disorder and lawlessness in the bud."
"– Mr President, I wish to condemn the arrest of three journalists from three different channels in Cyprus by the occupying forces occupying 40% of the Republic of Cyprus."
"I also wish to express here the anger of the media and of the world of journalism about the arbitrary and boorish conduct of the Turkish occupying forces and of the occupying regime towards media workers."
"We, as the European Parliament, must make demands in the same way as the United Nations and the international and European organisations defending the freedom of the press and individual rights. We must act with decisiveness to put an end to the high-handedness of the occupying forces and the occupying regime and to effectively protect the mission, the work and the rights of journalists."
"I would mention in passing that the journalists were brought before unrecognised courts and sentenced and that the fines imposed on them were paid by the Turkish Cypriot press associations."
"Mr President, it is useful to meet our constituents during the summer break, and in two-and-a-half hours last Friday I heard of the plight of Irish dairy farmers resulting from the over-severe implementation of CAP reform by the Commission and the Council."
"The implications of this are very traumatic, because incomes will fall despite the compensation that is on offer."
"To ask farmers to increase their scale to make up that difference is just neither practical nor possible."
"I urge this House to stress to the Commission and the Council that, while we may be counting beans in terms of budgets, they are dealing with people and families and their actions are having a very severe impact on them."
"This is a matter I will be raising directly with the Committee on Agriculture."
"I would stress again that these are difficult times for farmers."
"What the Commission is doing is over-severe, and it is particularly important that we watch the budget for 2007."
"Ten days ago Finnish Social Democrats celebrated the hundredth anniversary of the granting of full suffrage to women."
"Finland was the first country in the world in which all women had the right both to vote and to be elected."
"One hundred years later, more than a third of members of parliament are women, and women hold 40% of ministerial positions."
"In many other European countries, however, the situation is not very good."
"In Estonia, for instance, where women were granted full suffrage in 1918, still only one fifth of members of parliament are women, and women hold only every seventh ministerial position – that is, 14%."
"One of the reasons for this inequality is that voters cannot find suitable female candidates on the voting lists."
"On lists of candidates, the first ten names still include only one or two women."
"I call upon my colleagues throughout Europe to ensure that in their home countries there are an equal number of women and men among the candidates for parliament."
"That would be the truly democratic choice."
"And one need not fear that women will not vote for other women."
"It is time to give up that silly myth."
"Mr President, the ridiculous story in the British press to which Mr Wise referred earlier actually originates from a disgraceful press release put out by the Deputy Chairman of the British Conservative Party, Mr Eric Pickles."
"It is interesting to see UKIP and the Conservative Party working hand-in-hand."
"The press release actually claims: ‘The European Union plots to wipe Britain off the map’."
"It alleges that Britain is to be broken up into a series of transnational regions and will no longer exist."
"If you look at the references it transpires that the so-called plot is nothing more than the old Interreg regions – the regional cooperation between different regions with similar problems, such as the Atlantic regions."
"Presumably if they saw a geological map of Europe, they would claim that Scotland was being merged with Austria because they both have granite, or that the different limestone areas were being merged into transnational regions."
"Sadly, the British Conservative Party, which is trying to portray itself as a serious party, has revealed its true colours by this press release."
"Nobody can believe that it is trying to be serious anymore."
"Mr President, in your speech you mentioned one of the problems of this summer, which is the mass arrival of immigrants in Lampedusa and the Canary Islands; we are talking about tens of thousands of people."
"In this regard, the European Union has decided to act by means of Frontex and cooperation between governments, but unfortunately it appears that this has not yielded any results."
"Rather than the number of immigrants falling following action by the European Union, immigration has increased and the problems have not been resolved."
"This means that the European Union is not currently applying the necessary resources and we therefore believe that it should increase its efforts in order to put an end to this problem of illegal immigration, given its consequences both for the European Union itself and for the fate of the Africans in question."
"Mr President, recently the Turkish army occupying the northern part of Cyprus has increased its attacks on press freedom."
"In the last two months, three TV teams of Greek Cypriot journalists were arrested, kept for several days in atrocious prison conditions and brought before a Turkish military court, accused of filming in a supposedly military area."
"The occupied town of Famagusta is arbitrarily regarded by the Turkish army as such an area."
"Having been found guilty in summary proceedings, the journalists were heavily fined."
"In a commendable gesture of solidarity, the fines were paid by Turkish Cypriot journalists who themselves suffer similar treatment by the Turkish army."
"I call upon you as the President of this House to express to the Turkish Government your deep concern and strong condemnation of these arrests, which constitute a blatant attempt to severely curtail freedom of expression in an EU Member State."
"– As you rightly said at the start, the flow of immigrants towards European shores has persisted during this summer and hundreds of them have lost their lives without even getting there."
"While the European Union has commenced surveillance patrols in the sea in the vicinity of the Canary Islands, we are still waiting for patrols in the Mediterranean to start, as had been promised."
"Libya has up till now been sceptical about these patrols, but today we heard the news that it is prepared to reconsider its position, provided the Europe Union provides assistance with the guarding of Libya’s southern frontiers."
"This is a positive development, Mr President, and I hope it will lead to the launch of these patrols as soon as possible as well as to the commencement of a battle against organised crime."
"Organised crime is exploiting these immigrants and causing serious problems to countries affected by illegal immigration."
"– Like many of my colleagues, I travel by air every week, and therefore I would like to express my thanks to the British police and intelligence services which, in cooperation with the intelligence services of other countries, detected an attempted terrorist attack on trans-Atlantic flights at the beginning of August."
"These terrorist attacks would have had devastating consequences for the lives of hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of people."
"The discovery was shocking and caused inconveniences for other passengers whose flights had to be cancelled for security reasons."
"I would also like to thank the passengers and airport staff for their cooperation and disciplined behaviour in the ensuing situation."
"I believe that ultimately we all understand and are grateful for this discovery, and for the fact that the police subsequently arrested and are now prosecuting the suspects."
"This gives us a certain sense of security for the future, a security which was shaken on 11 September 2001 and remains so to this day."
"– Mr President, on 8 September we shall be celebrating International Literacy Day."
"Our thoughts turn to the need to ensure that no young people are left in third countries who do not know how read and write their language."
"The European Union, with its development aid, is participating in global efforts to eradicate illiteracy."
"However, there is also internal illiteracy."
"In coordinating their efforts, the Member States and the European institutions are helping education for which the Member States have jurisdiction."
"However, we must not underestimate the value of maintaining the linguistic and cultural identity of the children of migrant European workers."
"Just as constantly improved European schools need to be run for the children of people working for the European institutions, coordinated care and institutionalised obligations are needed for other internal migrants, in order to maintain their linguistic and cultural identity."
"New technologies and distance learning help and the European index of language skills must not be limited to five languages; it must include all the official European languages."
"Mr President, during August we lost François Lamoureux at the age of 59 – far too soon."
"I knew him as Director-General for Transport and Energy."
"His door was always open. He was always curious to hear people’s views, to give advice and to express his opinion."
"His lucidity and intelligence, his professional standards and rigour, his complete consistency, and even the impertinence of the most lucid: he offered us one of the best examples of a vocation for European public service, based on a federalist, Europeanist and genuinely progressive conviction."
"We owe to him the fact that the Delors White Paper became a reality in the trans-European networks, and also, irony of ironies, the opening up of the rail sector under the best possible circumstances, the Galileo project, the motorways of the sea and the current logistics project."
"It is very sad that he did not have time to draw up and implement a European energy policy."
"The one we get will not be the same."
"I would like to pay tribute to him now, just at a time when we are going to need him most."
"I am sure that he would have been smiling from behind the lenses of his glasses if he had known the controversy and the Europeanist revision that his absence is causing."
"As a tribute to him, I believe that we must continue working hard to achieve more progress and more Europe, a Europe that genuinely serves the common interest."
"That concludes this item."
"Madam President, honourable Members of Parliament, I am pleased to have the opportunity to present to you, on behalf of the European Commission, the proposal on passenger car related taxes."
"Once adopted it will have a direct impact on about 15 million new passenger cars presented for registration in the EU each year and, to a certain extent, on more than 200 million used passenger cars circulating on the roads of the Community."
"The proposal is designed to benefit the internal market, the citizens, the car industry and the environment."
"First of all, the proposal contains a number of measures needing to be taken at Community level in order to improve the functioning of the internal market, mainly by abolishing registration taxes – which currently involve unnecessary cost and administrative burdens, the lack of transparency and legal uncertainty for citizens."
"The proposed Community measures are furthermore aimed at avoiding double payment of car-related taxes, when a car registered in a Member State is exported or permanently moved for registration to another Member State."
"Registration taxes also involve high costs and reduced competitiveness for the car industry and result in the fragmentation of the car market."
"The proposal also promotes sustainability by implementing fiscal measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars, as it establishes a more direct relationship between taxation levels and carbon dioxide emissions."
"It is important to mention that the application of the proposed measure is budget neutral: the gradual abolition of registration tax and its replacement by an annual circulation tax does not involve revenue losses for the national budgets, nor does it increase the total tax burden for citizens."
"The proposal takes a minimalist approach to car taxation and addresses only those issues that can best be dealt with at Community level."
"It only seeks to establish the principle and structure of passenger car related taxes; it does not seek to harmonise tax rates, which will continue to remain the responsibility of the Member States."
"It does not introduce new car taxes, but instead provides for the gradual abolition of registration taxes in the 16 Member States currently applying such taxes, as well as for their gradual replacement by an annual circulation tax."
"The proposal has been discussed only once in the Council so far, and the reaction of the Member States has been mixed."
"Strong support from the European Parliament can maintain the momentum and help the Council reach a unanimous decision."
"I want to emphasise that the proposed measures would make passenger car taxation citizen-friendly, car-industry-friendly and environment-friendly."
"."
"Madam President, I think we are discussing an important topic today."
"A considerable proportion of the C02 that we all send into the atmosphere is accounted for by car exhaust fumes."
"Road transport is responsible for some 25% of European CO2 emissions, half of which is attributable to cars."
"As such, a reduction in CO2 emissions by our fleet of cars can make an important contribution to the Kyoto objectives to which the European Union has committed itself."
"Only last year, in its report on climate change, this House pointed at the need for a considerable improvement in energy efficiency in the transport sector."
"Alongside this, technological innovation is of major importance in order to be able to achieve our climate objectives."
"Tax measures can be very effective in this."
"By differentiating taxes according to impact on the environment, we can discourage harmful practices, promote economy drives and stimulate technological innovation."
"In that light, we welcome the Commission proposal to differentiate annual road tax depending on CO2 emission, according to which a proportion of annual road tax would be calculated on the basis of the quantity of CO2 emitted by the car per km."
"A car which is more economic in its fuel consumption, and therefore uses less CO2, will cost less, and we in this House also want other substances, such as nitrogen oxide and soot particles, included in the equation."
"It is important, though, that we apply a calculation basis that is progressive."
"That means that heavier engines that use more fuel and contribute more to climate change will, in relative terms, be taxed more heavily."
"Accordingly, there are low thresholds for driving modest models, whilst people will need to pay a price for driving around in the most expensive and biggest cars, which cause most environmental damage."
"We do not support the proposal of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to bring forward the date on which the directive enters into force."
"In our view, Member States need to be given the time to do the groundwork properly."
"The second and, I believe, most controversial part of the proposal, alongside differentiating car tax, is to abolish registration tax on new cars."
"Whilst, according to the Commission, this solves a few internal market problems, it will, it believes, also accelerate the renewal rate of the fleet of cars, so that old and environmentally-unfriendly cars will make way for new and clean cars more quickly."
"I have to say that opinions on this subject within my group are divided, and I, as rapporteur for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, would just like to add that I made a proposal of my own, which did not make it to the finishing line, though, not to abolish this registration tax."
"I think that, based on the experience in my own country, this registration tax can also be used to promote the use of environmentally-friendly cars, the sale of which in the Netherlands has been boosted enormously through their no longer being taxed."
"Members of my group will, then, vote in different ways, but it is important that the Commissioner is aware that people are divided on this issue."
"Finally, the Commissioner said something about the Council and mixed reactions."
"I wish him much strength, because although this is a rather important discussion, and this House, as we also know, takes a degree of pleasure in it happening, in the Council, though, a proposal such as this will probably quickly be vetoed out by one of the Member States in a flat refusal to talk about taxation at European level."
"Nevertheless, I hope that the Commissioner will succeed in achieving, in principle, a breakthrough on this score."
"I wish him good luck."
". – Madam President, what I actually wanted to do was to thank the rapporteur, but she is not here yet, so we will have to do that later."
"The draft report she produced was a good one."
"Some of the points in it proved controversial when we came to vote on them."
"Where one of them – Article 4 – is concerned, a contradiction remains in the report that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted, for we adopted two different – and mutually exclusive – versions of it, and it is for that reason that our group wants to reiterate our desire that the future tax on motor vehicles should be levied strictly in proportion to the amount of CO2 emitted."
"As Mr Wiersma said earlier, energy efficiency is of course an issue, but any attempt to use tax policy to regulate everything you possibly can will end in failure."
"Our position is quite clear: we want tax to be strictly proportionate to CO2 emissions, without reference to the technology used, to the use to which the vehicle is put or to how big it is; in other words, we want it to be purely environmental."
"If an attempt were to be made to use this instrument to instigate some sort of campaign against larger cars, then that would be mistaken, for it is the bigger models, the more expensive cars, that make technological progress in the manufacturing of cars possible, in that it is they that are first fitted with important safety features and first take environmental considerations into account, since it is in these expensive cars that a new technology can be better developed."
"No more calumnies on big cars, then; instead, let us stick with the objective we all share – that of achieving 120 mg per kilometre by 2010."
"That is difficult enough as a project, one that demands considerable efforts of some of the Member States, particularly of the new one, where the cars on the road are older than the average for the European Union."
"We need a degree of flexibility if our common objective of renewing the stock of motor vehicles is not to result in discrimination within the European internal market, and that is why we too believe – as a resolution of the Committee attests – that the Commission should additionally produce a study by 31 December of this year about what importance should be attached to factors other than CO2, in order to ensure a compromise."
"We, though, have no desire to bring about a reduction in CO2 by dealing with all the other pollutants that are already being emitted, and that is where the divide between the groups lies, although I do believe that we can come to an understanding about this."
"We have tabled an amendment – the amendment in question is number 40 – to the effect that the Member States should be given the option of giving separate treatment to old cars that have been licensed for at least twenty years."
"As a rule, these old cars, being based on old-style technology, put out quite a lot of pollutants, but there are so few of them on the market that we can deal with them in the same way that several Member States are doing already."
"As far as registration tax is concerned, I am persuaded that it should be dropped once certain transitional periods are over; it is an obstacle to the European single market, and so we should agree to let it expire in such a way that not only are the Member States’ fiscal interests taken into account but also an orderly transition is possible."
"I will conclude by saying that I wish you, Commissioner, a great deal of success."
"I know how difficult European fiscal policy is; harmonising it brings one up against problems wherever one turns."
"On many fronts, we are making next to no headway, and as long as unanimity is required, it will be difficult to make the sort of progress that really is of some use."
"With this in mind, we endorse the report and support you in your difficult task as Commissioner for tax."
"Madam President, I must start by emphasising that the Commission proposal on passenger car related taxes concerns a sector which does not come within its exclusive jurisdiction, given that its proposals relate mainly to the creation of a new system of taxes on the purchase and maintenance of cars."
"That is why the proposal formulated by the European Parliament, as contained in the rapporteur's report, should aim both at obtaining consent to the completion of the internal market and introducing fiscal convergence on passenger car related matters."
"As a matter of principle, it cannot be disputed, at least not by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that taxation must gradually be combined with protection and improvement of the environment, as indicated in the Kyoto Protocol."
"However, in order for this principle to be more broadly accepted and applied on a broader scale by the Member States, certain preconditions must be put into place, as mentioned in the rapporteur's report."
"First of all, tax revenue losses from the abolition of registration taxes could, if the Member State so wishes, be covered by parallel increases of revenue from annual circulation taxes over a gentle and gradual ten-year adjustment period."
"The Commission proposes gradual abolition over five years; the European Parliament proposes ten."
"Secondly, the proposal to introduce a registration and annual circulation tax refund system for vehicles exported and transferred definitively to another Member State should be adopted."
"Thirdly, a highly intricate passenger car taxation system should be avoided in future in order to achieve the objective of harmonisation laid down in this directive as a whole."
"This means that the adjustment, from the year 2008, of annual circulation tax demands, on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions, should be examined by the Commission and the automobile industry should be given the chance to adapt."
"Consumers cannot be charged high annual circulation taxes due to high pollutants."
"The cost of adjustment must be borne by the automobile industry as it adjusts, while consumer associations must act on the question of transparency in the application of the directive."
". Madam President, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to say a few words on this proposal for a Council directive on passenger car related taxes."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur in her absence on an excellent report, which, I believe, is a very significant contribution to the debate."
"I personally agree that taxation is the responsibility of the individual Member State."
"However, the thrust of this proposal would improve the functioning of the single market and, crucially, would greatly assist in our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, without compromising the ability of any country to levy its own taxes."
"Ireland has one of the highest rates of VRT in Europe, with almost 10% of the total tax take coming from motorists."
"Last year its figures for VRT alone were in excess of EUR 1.5 billion, an increase of over 20% on the previous year, so the fact that Ireland will not be supporting this proposal will come as little surprise."
"But this is a short-sighted and short-term viewpoint, and we need to look at the wider implications."
"I believe VRT is an anti-free market mechanism and one of the reasons why the EU passenger car market has not been functioning well."
"Indeed, consumers in nine Member States, including Ireland, have been penalised by a measure which has reduced their purchasing choices."
"The Commission’s proposal is a sensible one, particularly from an environmental perspective, since taxes levied on motorists would be linked to carbon dioxide emissions from the vehicle."
"Indeed, I agree with the suggestion in the report that other pollutant emissions should be part of the equation, although it might be difficult to include this measure initially."
"Furthermore, I think it is an excellent idea that Member States be encouraged to apply fiscal incentives for passenger cars, in order to encourage the placing on the market of cars and vehicles that meet energy-saving and energy efficiency requirements."
"When governments set targets for reducing CO2 emissions, they have a responsibility to introduce mechanisms and structures that will facilitate this."
"The Commission’s proposal is an excellent one and I fully support it."
"."
"Madam President, the question is: do we want to find an effective means of protecting the world’s climate and the future of humanity or not?"
"When you burn one kilo of petrol or diesel, you produce more than three kilos of carbon dioxide emissions."
"Carbon dioxide emissions from traffic have increased by almost a third since 1990."
"This completely wipes out the effect of a large proportion of the reductions in emissions in other sectors."
"From 2003 to 2004 alone, emissions in Europe increased so much that it was the equivalent of three million people driving their vehicles right around the world."
"The European automotive industry is not going to achieve the emissions reductions for cars it promises by 2008."
"It is therefore important to boost incentives for vehicles that produce fewer emissions."
"The Commission’s proposal is not the best possible option in this respect."
"Taxation on vehicles in Member States varies widely."
"Abolition of registration tax in all countries will not make things better for the environment."
"Studies in the Netherlands show that the most effective way of getting consumers to choose vehicles that produce fewer emissions is a differentiated registration tax based on carbon dioxide emissions, as is the system in Denmark, for example."
"In Finland, on the other hand, car tax actually punishes those who buy vehicles that produce fewer emissions."
"For changes in taxation actually to bring about a reduction in emissions, it is important to oblige Member States to ensure that any changes they make to the national taxation system are a step forward for the environment."
"If registration tax is replaced with an annual circulation tax, it needs to relate to carbon dioxide emissions rather more stringently than merely proportionately."
"It must also take account of emissions other than carbon dioxide."
"Furthermore, the tax should also apply to SUVs, that is to say, N1 vehicles."
"On the whole, the best solution would be one which, if possible, combined a differentiated registration tax based on emissions and an annual circulation tax."
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also believes that this should be possible."
"The export of vehicles from one country to another and the taxation solutions associated with it could be dealt with in another way, through a system of compensation."
"."
"Madam President, the number of cars has risen at an alarming rate over recent decades, while the use of the train, tram, underground and bus has stagnated."
"This has resulted in an enormous amount of space being taken up by car parks and motorways, bringing with them noise pollution, air pollution and a lack of traffic safety."
"Now that cars are the most commonly used mode of transport, and the road infrastructure is very extensive, complex and expensive, we cannot avoid the question of who will be footing the bill for this."
"Various Member States, when determining car tax, already take greater account of the pollution they cause."
"Unfortunately, the proposal for a directive is a half-hearted one since it appears to be mainly pursuing other objectives."
"A simultaneous attempt is being made, without this contributing to less pollution, to harmonise taxes in the Member States and to give the car market new growth opportunities by introducing a price reduction from 2016."
"According to the draft directive, which aims to integrate the emission of cars gradually and partially in motorised vehicle tax, a quarter of tax should be based on the CO2 emission by the end of 2008 and half by 2010, but why stop there?"
"Why did the Commission not propose right away to take the emission of NOx and soot particles, as well as the car’s fuel efficiency as a basis for calculating motorised vehicle tax, rather than wait for amendments?"
"Why has the Commission, for the past ten years, not shown any support for Germany Greenpeace’s initiative to develop a car that uses half the amount of petrol?"
"Instead, the Commission would like to gradually phase out registration tax on cars across the European Union and, in so doing, make the car cheaper in 16 Member States."
"So far, taxes and the differences in them have been a matter of national autonomy and national considerations."
"If the Union does more than combat tax havens and other forms of large-scale tax evasion, it goes beyond its line of duty."
"The aim should be to reduce harmful emissions rather than provide the car industry, even after the market has been saturated, with customers who are keen to buy the latest model every year."
"My group has rejected a ban on registration tax."
"Car emissions have over the past ten years increased by 30%, despite the Kyoto Agreement and despite technical improvements."
"Since the increase in the number of cars and the average mileage more than cancel out the technological benefits, my group believes that doing things by halves is no longer an option."
"As far as we are concerned, not just 50% of car tax should be based on their CO2 emission, but 100% on the pollution they cause."
"The easiest way of solving this is by changing motorised vehicle tax into a levy on fuel according to the emissions."
"In that way, it is the air polluter that pays, and not the car owner."
"New cars will need to meet strict fuel efficiency requirements, and priority will need to be given to soot filters becoming compulsory in diesel cars."
"In addition, the car mileage will need to come down, and that is only possible by providing robust, healthy and affordable public transport."
"Belt-tightening measures and privatisation in this sector, supported by the European Union, have so far had only the opposite effect."
"."
"Madam President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur in her absence, and to say that I endorse her position."
"Perhaps it is not surprising that the European Union Member States have very different tax systems in place for passenger cars, but I am astonished at the argument by governments as to why this system should not be changed and gradually be harmonised at the European Union level."
"The arguments are of all varieties, covering taxation, administration and subsidiarity, but in essence they boil down to the argument that I found in the draft of my own country’s position."
"There, we read ‘if it ain’t broke, why fix it?’"
"I have always been an advocate of the subsidiarity principle in the field of direct taxes."
"Can a small and medium-sized European Union Member State, however, really carry out its own tax policy with respect to passenger cars with a specific goal of environmental protection or energy efficiency?"
"By way of example, a few years ago in Latvia there was an attempt to sharply increase registration and annual taxes for very powerful motor cars."
"What happened then is what is also happening in other European countries – Latvians registered their cars in neighbouring Lithuania."
"I am therefore convinced that the reduction of CO2 emissions or other environmental goals in this field must be tackled at the European Union level, not at the level of individual Member States."
"Finally, I would like to say that, in view of the widely differing views of the governments of EU Member States on these issues, I think that Parliament ought to take a very even-handed step, and make the wording of this draft directive likely to be accepted unanimously by the Council, to avoid its being rejected for its very nature."
"Madam President, the passenger car is universally used throughout the European Union."
"It is no longer a luxury and, with the exception of VAT, should not be subject to additional taxes such as vehicle registration tax."
"VRT should only depend on the costs of the measures."
"Charges for polluting the environment with carbon dioxide emissions should be included in the price of fuel, thereby giving preference to cars with low emissions."
"This will encourage people to replace their cars with vehicles that are more environmentally friendly and use less fuel."
"The same could apply to fuel in the European Union."
"The annual circulation tax should not be too high or vary too much, as it will prevent poorer people from buying used passenger cars and may force pensioners, whose car use is limited due to their age, to give up their vehicles."
"The Council Directive on passenger car related tax is necessary for the single market and should be adopted as soon as possible."
"– Madam President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur for drawing up this report."
"Having, on behalf of my group, helped to produce the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I, too, have had to give this dossier my attention, and I would like now to concentrate on two principal points."
"Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the Commission’s proposal for the abolition of vehicle registration tax."
"It is this that leads me to endorse the report, subject to the condition that the progressive abolition of vehicle registration tax is retained."
"Among those Member States that levy a registration tax, there are massive differences not only as regards the amount of the tax but also the basis on which it is calculated."
"Of all the charges levied on private motor vehicles in Europe, it is in registration tax that the widest variations are to be found, and, as these differences interfere with the smooth functioning of the internal market, the proposal for the abolition of registration tax should be acted on."
"Along with my colleagues, in particular Mr Langen, I also endorse a direct proportional link between the tax burden and the amount of CO2 emitted."
"Every gram of CO2 discharged into the atmosphere has the same effect on climate and should therefore be subject to the same amount of tax."
"In doing this, the tax must also be technology-neutral; proportionate taxation guarantees that vehicles producing higher levels of CO2 will be taxed more than those that produce less, and that is crucial in terms of climate protection."
"I also believe that pollutants such as NOx and particulates should be included in the tax base for motor vehicle taxes in order to encourage environmentally-friendly cars."
"With this end in mind, we in the Committee on the Environment have already managed to get these amendments accepted, and tomorrow in the plenary I will be voting in favour of the report as a whole and of Amendments 10 and 19 in particular."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, creating a Europe of the citizens is one of the greatest aspirations that we European Socialists have."
"What Parliament is about to approve is a specific package of measures for the other, equally important, objective, which we can call a Europe for the citizens."
"As everyone knows, the European Parliament is only consulted on taxation matters and the final decision rests with the Council, which has to come to a unanimous conclusion."
"Our hope is that the national governments will support this proposal."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted in favour of the proposal by a considerable majority because it aims at gradually abolishing vehicle registration tax and identifying common European standards for national circulation taxes to be linked to pollutant emissions."
"This is an important measure that is only apparently of specialist and limited interest, since in fact it affects most people."
"Of course, it is not yet perfect and much more could be done, but it is moving in the right direction: it is a step forwards on the road to convergence, if not to genuine harmonisation of legislation within the confines of Europe, transcending national borders."
"Each Member State currently has its own taxation system, in which the two taxes are often combined at very different rates."
"This situation creates distortions and prevents the internal market from working properly; in addition, it causes problems both for the car industry and for European citizens."
"Lastly, it is a step forwards on the road towards the social and environmental sustainability of development, since it aims at fighting pollution and protecting the environment in order to guarantee a future for the generations to come."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many Finns have been amazed that Finland can maintain a road tax that has made it almost impossible for people to buy cars abroad and has forced them to pay much higher prices than others."
"Finland’s stock of cars is therefore one of the oldest in Europe, meaning old-fashioned safety solutions and less environmentally friendly cars."
"That definitely cannot be sensible."
"There is therefore a strong argument in favour of a more uniform road tax in the EU, and I therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal."
"It is important for us to devise a road tax based on how much pollution is caused by cars."
"In that way we can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and acid rain."
"It is a fact that pollution from cars is one of the biggest sources of pollution of the Baltic Sea."
"A uniform road tax would also mean a more efficient common market and more efficient competition."
"As I say, new cars are also safer."
"We should thus be killing two or more birds with one stone."
"I therefore believe that Parliament should give its strong support to restructuring road tax – so strong that the national governments cannot ignore the signal."
"Madam President, this proposal will fortunately not be implemented."
"There is a blocking minority in the Council, and that is something of which we in Denmark approve – most of us, anyway - for the high registration tax has meant that, in Denmark as in a number of other countries, we have fewer and fewer cars."
"It is the purchase of cars that determines how many cars will be driven."
"If people own cars, they will drive them."
"A high registration tax is therefore a very good thing if we want to limit the number of cars."
"Go to Denmark or the Netherlands, and you will see that it works."
"Clearly, a registration tax of this kind, as well as an annual tax, should be established on the basis of consumption."
"It should not be arranged on a proportional basis, as proposed here, but in such a way that we obtain results reminiscent of those we have seen in connection with refrigerators."
"A noticeable difference has been made where proper tax increases have been implemented."
"From almost every point of view, the present proposal will involve environmental damage."
"We are seeing many more cars, and with proportionality there will be more cars that are significantly more polluting and that consume more energy."
"In actual fact, there is a lot to suggest that Volkswagen and other representatives of the car industry have successfully got a handle on this matter, and when I hear the car industry lobbying really hard in Denmark to have registration tax abolished, I know that it is, of course, because they are counting on selling more cars as a result."
"They are not counting on selling cleaner cars or cars that consume less energy."
"On the contrary, they are producing huge numbers of cars that cause a very great deal of pollution and consume a very great deal of energy."
"I would therefore thank you for not allowing this proposal to be implemented."
"We hope to see a better proposal."
"Madam President, according to a Dutch newspaper this summer, car purchasing tax is being evaded on a massive scale in the Netherlands."
"Evasion is, after all, very lucrative, because the tax is high and the chances of being caught are minimal."
"Measures to avoid this evasion are therefore called for, not so much in the form of abolishing this tax, as the Commission proposed, but in the form of action by competent authorities."
"During the debate of 5 November 2003, I made a case for a transparent system of levies with clear goals."
"To link the levies to the environmental effects is a transparent and clear goal."
"That is why further research into, and discussion about, the environmental effects of car taxes deserve our unqualified support."
"The Member States would then, based on research results, be able to harmonise their levies, and give accountability to environmental damage."
"To impose this measure from Brussels would be taking matters too far, though."
"After all, the Commission proposal falls outside the scope of Article 93 of the Treaty."
"Registration and motorised vehicle tax do not belong to the harmonised taxes."
"It is not the differences in, for example, motorised vehicle tax that hinders the functioning of the internal market, but mainly an inefficient system of reimbursing levies in the event of car imports and exports."
"The Commission proposal is therefore in contravention of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality."
"That is the reason why I will not be voting in favour of this report or of the Commission proposal."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by congratulating Mrs Riis-Jørgensen on her report."
"I should like to emphasise that this proposal does not entail introducing a European tax policy or the European Union encroaching on the sovereignty of the Member States when it comes to taking decisions about taxes."
"This proposal too will leave it entirely up to the individual Member States to decide to what extent they wish to tax motoring."
"What we are taking a decision about in this case is the structure and system of taxation with a view to facilitating the internal market."
"It will mean that it will become easier to buy and sell cars across Member States’ borders."
"Those who will benefit from this are basically individual consumers."
"I should like to say to our Danish fellow MEP, Mrs Auken, that what is important for us is to obtain new, modern cars."
"There is nothing so environmentally dangerous as the old stock of cars."
"New technology is good for the environment."
"We must do all we can to bring about the rapid conversion and modernisation of European cars."
"I wish to emphasise how constructive it is that, in her report, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen has also included a proposal for having tax incentives for new types of vehicle, for example hybrid cars or cars propelled by other fuels, as this would perhaps also lead to the motoring world being quicker to take increased account of the environment."
"A number of years ago, we in Sweden introduced a special incentive to promote the use of catalytic converters. This very rapidly proved to be a success and led to a very swift reduction in emissions."
"We now have an opportunity to go further down that route."
"It is, however, also important that, through this approach to car taxation, we give the European car industry an opportunity to develop more quickly in terms of its response to environmental considerations."
"This also means more rapid modernisation."
"Better cars in Europe are good for the environment, but the outcome can also be a better and stronger car industry."
"Madam President, the Commission proposal has two objectives."
"It intends to improve the functioning of the internal market and to implement the Community strategy for reducing CO2 emissions by passenger cars."
"In order to meet European Union environmental protection aims and the Kyoto protocol, CO2 emissions should be significantly reduced in order to achieve the Community target of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre."
"And taxes do provide a strong incentive for consumers."
"It should be emphasised that the aim here is not to harmonise or introduce new taxes."
"The aim is to introduce a European Union-wide basis for levying taxes on passenger cars."
"Initiatives in individual Member States in this field are currently not very well coordinated and vary significantly."
"A tax system where the vehicle registration tax depends on CO2 emissions is a step in the right direction."
"It provides the basis for the long term aim of achieving a convergence of registration tax rates and guaranteeing fair competition across the whole of the single market."
"Vehicle registration tax should be gradually restricted, which would help to eliminate discrepancies within the European Union car market."
"We should also set up a cohesive and transparent system for refunding registration tax that is based on clearly defined criteria."
"Furthermore, it is important to ensure that the process of abolishing registration tax is implemented in line with the principle of budget neutrality."
"."
"Mr President, I have a very specific comment to make on this report."
"Amendment 18, which refers to Article 4, calls for a graduated progressive tax."
"However, Amendment 19 – creating a new paragraph 1a in Article 4 – seeks to introduce the notion of direct proportion."
"This notion was also included in the amendments by Mr Langen, although he has now withdrawn them."
"So what would such a notion mean?"
"It would mean that the tax on a car with emission levels of 200 g/km could only be EUR 200 and that on a car of 160 g/km, EUR 160."
"As a result, the desired outcome – namely to effect a major shift in what the consumer decides when he buys a car – would not be achieved, since, if there is only a difference of EUR 80 between a car with 120 g/km emission and a car with 200 g/km emissions, then the market will remain unaffected."
"We must therefore vote against this direct proportionality and stick to the text on the graduated progressive tax."
"The Commission published a very interesting document last week on the efficiency of cars in Europe."
"On page 32 of the working document, there is a graph showing which category most cars fall into."
"You will see that almost 70% of the cars in Europe are between 140 and 200 g/km, and only 25% are below 140 g/km."
"So what we can achieve with this instrument is to levy an over-proportional tax on those between 140 and 200 g/km, so that we can effect a major shift to categories below 140, which is the target of the European Union."
"So, we have a contradiction in our text, and if we want to be effective we have to remedy this."
"Mr President, they do not give up, do they?"
"Despite the Commission’s insistence that this proposal is not aimed at tax harmonisation, it will force countries that apply tax on registration of vehicles to phase that out and it will make all countries apply the same level of emissions-linking to the so-called ‘annual circulation tax’."
"Is that harmonisation, or is it not?"
"The rapporteur gives the game away when she argues that in the long term it would be of great advantage to approximate the ACT rates – meaning the same rates of road tax in all countries."
"They simply do not understand that allowing countries the freedom to choose how much revenue to raise and how to raise it is a fundamental responsibility of our elected national governments."
"Moreover, competition over tax rates and tax bases between national authorities is actually a good thing for business and economic growth – witness the general reductions in company tax over the past few years."
"The worry is that when the EU gets involved it inevitably screws up."
"For instance, despite eight directives on value-added tax so far, the administration of VAT remains as complex as ever and fraud is now running into billions."
"Unfortunately the drive for tax harmonisation in the European Union remains alive as always."
"I sincerely hope, though, that this particular piece of legislation may be stopped."
"I would like to congratulate Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her excellent report, but at this point, I also need to express my appreciation to the Commission and to Mr Kovács personally for the proposal he has drawn up."
"Based on the discussions we have had so far, in my view, there is consensus among the main powers involved that we need to get rid of the registration tax, a mechanism running counter to the internal market's objectives."
"This would support the free movement of people, while lower prices would contribute to the quicker renewal of the car fleet."
"At the same time, I also support the idea for us to put an end to this situation in a budget-neutral manner by introducing an operating charge."
"I do believe that Mr Kovács may also be familiar with fiscal pressure; after all, he had to vote for the registration tax in Hungary a couple of years ago."
"I think that the transition scheme is a good idea, as it gets rid of double taxation, while taking depreciation into consideration too."
"There are two other things I would like to mention."
"Firstly, Member States must be given the maximum freedom possible when they come to setting and applying the operating charge."
"On this subject, many have discussed an innovation fund, and a fuel charge, although these can be resolved as part of the income tax issue."
"I think it is too much to consider a mandatory 50% rate based on environmental considerations."
"In fact, if there is anyone who has had any great success with the Kyoto Protocol, let them decide what rate to consider."
"This is one of the reasons I suggested that the Commission recommended other factors when setting the operating charge."
"At the same time, I would like us to stick to this proportional or linear idea, as this should be the only way to be able to levy taxes with any taxation factor."
"In very many cases, having a car only a couple of years old is already a step towards renewing the car fleet, especially in the new Member States with old cars, where people are unable to trade in their old cars for new ones due to social or financial reasons."
"I support the 10-year scheme because I think that this is enough time to take advantage of the options available and for the economic players to adapt too."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the rapporteur for being here today and for putting this report together."
"This report has to do with the taxation of motor vehicles, and there are two reasons why it is going in the right direction."
"The first is that it is reasonable, from the point of view of environmental policy, for all emissions to be included in the tax base for any taxation of private motor vehicles."
"Both the emission of CO2, which is responsible for climate change, and the pumping out of nitrous oxide and particulates, which are the causes behind the build-up of ozone and the incidence of lung diseases, should have an influence on taxation; that is reasonable and the right way to go about things."
"The second is that the planned demise of vehicle registration tax is also to be welcomed, not only from the consumers’ point of view but also in terms of environmental policy."
"It is because of registration tax that vehicles produced in one EU Member State are exported to another one with registration taxes, only then to be reimported by reimporters from the country in which they were made."
"This results in needless movement of vehicles and in higher purchase prices for them."
"It may be that the loss of registration tax in Europe will cause this reimport trade to be banned and the average age of the vehicles on the road to be reduced, which will ultimately be of benefit to the environment."
"Mr President, I welcome the fact that this issue has been raised."
"However, the level of passenger car emissions is a function of the amount of fuel used, that is, the distance driven, the quality of the petrol, and, essentially, also of time."
"The proposed tax solution has two aims: to remove the currently compulsory registration tax and replace it with a new tax levied when the vehicle is purchased or annually."
"This issue begs the question: what do the authors want?"
"The new tax is, by definition, unfair."
"It places the same burden on consumers who travel great distances and contribute more to air pollution, and on consumers who travel short distances, only going out for Sunday trips to church, as we say in Poland."
"Furthermore, the legislation forces the consumer to pay tax upfront while the damage done, that is, the pollution, will be generated in the future."
"Moreover, the tax burden will affect the poorer consumers most of all, and make it more difficult to purchase used cars."
"If that is the case, then doubts may arise as to whether this legislation has not been written to order with a view to the interests of car manufacturers."
"Stagnating demand means that these car manufacturers are on the lookout for solutions that will benefit them, especially as the new tax will pass through their hands, thereby increasing their revenues and cash flow."
"The authors also say nothing of the level of this tax and there are worries or concerns about the amounts flowing into the budgets of the Member States."
"The programme that we would be prepared to support reads as follows: we should gradually set stricter emissions standards for new passenger cars, introduce more stringent standards for fuel quality and abolish taxes on the purchase of cars."
"We should perhaps also consider introducing an environmental tax on the cost of petrol and use the revenue this creates for research into new technologies and cleaner fuels."
"Only these solutions will benefit consumers, producers, environmentalists and the whole economy in the long term."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for this excellent report, which you presented here despite the travel problems you had."
"The more difficult it becomes to fly, the clearer it is that the car is a vital consumer durable for most Europeans."
"The present situation, in which the car is one of the most difficult objects to move inside the Union, is intolerable."
"Moving a car from one Member State to another entails considerable obstacles, which are still due to different tax laws and inflexible administrative legal practices."
"Furthermore, the citizens of the Union are treated completely unequally regarding car taxation, depending on where they live."
"For example, in Finland, a country where distances are long and the population is sparse, a passenger car is not exactly a luxury, but a necessity for working people and their families."
"If cars in Europe are to be redesigned and if there are to be more environmentally friendly cars on the road, it is appropriate to reduce car purchase tax, abolish registration tax, and compensate for that with moderate rises in circulation tax which acknowledge regional balance and on the basis of fuel consumption and polluting emissions."
"There is an unparalleled number of old cars on the roads in Finland, which in other countries would have ended up on the scrapheap by now."
"Car taxation should also move towards a system of tax concessions for equipment that increases safety on the roads."
"Obviously, it is not worth talking about car tax unless you include fuel taxes."
"In Europe we should be promoting tax concessions on biofuels and lowering taxes on diesel."
"Besides, the latest research shows that carbon dioxide emissions from diesel engines are lower than those from petrol cars."
"This needs to be taken into account when tailoring reforms."
"The environmental impact of road traffic should be examined as part of the Union’s wider policy on transport, although at present there is not enough proper debate on the compatibility of taxation on vehicles, fuel taxation and road transport infrastructure charges."
"That is what we need."
"– Let us face reality."
"We have an anomaly, and the Commission’s proposal, which has been markedly improved through Mrs Riis-Jorgensen’s report and excellent work, is a step towards finding a solution to this problem."
"We do not have an internal market in the automobile sector."
"That is the problem."
"It is still very difficult for a European citizen in one country to buy a car from another country and go back home with it."
"In many cases, this citizen is faced with prohibitive and disproportionate fees, and dated bureaucratic procedures in the form of so-called registration taxes."
"The Commission’s proposal for registration tax to be done away with and be replaced with a system of environmentally-sensitive taxes goes in the right direction, because it removes obstacles to an open market and lowers the capital cost of cars while encouraging more environmentally-friendly consumption."
"Can this proposal still be improved upon?"
"Among other things, we must ensure that those who have already paid registration tax are given an adequate refund."
"We must see to it that the weaker members of society who cannot afford to buy those types of car whose purchase we are encouraging, are not penalised through higher payments."
"In the same way we cannot place further burdens on those who necessarily have to travel, for example, to go to work."
"We can find reasonable and transparent solutions so that there will be no such negative effects."
"It is not easy but we can do it."
"The position of the European Parliament, which I hope we will adopt so that registration tax will be removed, will be sending a powerful signal to governments of countries who are still resisting a similar agreement, including my own country’s government."
"Our proposal is realistic also because it is intended to come into effect over a reasonable amount of time in order to avoid causing a negative effect on national budgets."
"But until such an agreement is reached, we must still appeal to governments to act more reasonably by not imposing double taxation in the case of citizens who would be returning to their own country after at least two years working in another country of the European Union and find they have to pay tax once again on a car, which tax they will already have paid in another country."
"Ironically that is what is happening in my own country, Malta."
"Before my country joined the European Union, it was relatively easy for emigrants returning to my country, and bringing a car back with them, to pay a reasonable amount of tax."
"For the past two years however, people in this sort of situation are being asked to pay a prohibitive amount of tax."
"Then, these citizens justifiably ask us ‘What sort of internal market is this?’"
"– Mr President, let the truth be told: the discussions taking place about cars are being held hostage to the seven oil sisters and the large automobile industries that control the governments of the major countries of Europe and America, which are imposing this regime."
"Car engines have not changed for a hundred years, while mobile telephone technology changes every month."
"Why are we being held hostage to this fuel and these derivatives?"
"It is a huge issue."
"The major scientist and inventor from Thessaloniki, who found a cheap method of splitting hydrogen, was sent packing, as were numerous other inventors who found other ways, other fuels to prevent our being slaves to oil."
"We have heard numerous proposals here concerning the ratios between pollutants and taxation."
"It is one correct way forward."
"However, is car safety not also a correct way forward?"
"Because, in an accident, an unsafe car injures more people who, when hospitalised, naturally affect other people's revenue."
"Therefore a safe car should pay less tax."
"But that is another viewpoint."
"I should like to mention the situation in Greece. We in Greece have higher registration taxes than any other country."
"Both the socialist government and the conservative government maintained high taxes."
"For example, we earn half what the inhabitants of Luxembourg earn."
"They earn EUR 1 000 and we earn 500; they pay EUR 20 000 for a car and we pay 40 000."
"We have the most expensive cars in Europe."
"We need justice at long last. We need a uniform standard."
"The poorest country in Europe, with its deficits, cannot have the most expensive cars just because certain people cannot find a different ratio."
"Mr President, Europe really does not have a good reputation among the people who live in it; it has become proverbial that ‘everything bad comes from Brussels’."
"Looked at from that angle, the danger is that the public will once again misread our intentions."
"‘Tax’ and ‘EU’ are inflammatory words virtually always capable of being interpreted and misunderstood to mean that Europe, the EU, is yet again attempting to impose on the public."
"Most of the speeches we have heard today have explained why, in this specific instance, in the Riis-Jørgensen report, something completely different is at issue, but there have been those who have argued that this is no more than yet another attempt to reach into Europeans’ pockets."
"It is not surprising that, when the domestic political temperature is running high, politicians – and opposition politicians in particular – cannot resist the temptation to use anti-EU slogans as a means of whipping things up."
"In my own country, Austria, we have national parliamentary elections in four weeks’ time."
"Power is at stake, and so there are quite a few who are not mincing their words."
"Our main opposition party, the Social Democrats, are covering large surfaces with posters claiming that Chancellor Schüssel’s Federal Government wants to bring in a universal toll on private motor vehicles."
"The fact that this is not the case does not bother them; they just try it on, and anti-European sloganising gives them a chance of scoring a few points."
"Let me tell you, then, that the Riis-Jørgensen report is a step towards a rational way of taxing motor vehicles and protecting the environment."
"That, and nothing else, is what it is about; it is something one can vote for."
"Mr President, I hope the Commissioner appreciates how happy the Irish car buyer would be to see VRT eliminated."
"This tax has made cars unnecessarily expensive in Ireland."
"I am totally against EU interference in regulating national taxes."
"However, as Ireland levies VRT, it is a draconian tax that has no rationale except to bleed Irish car owners of money – a lot of money from citizens who, for the most part, do not have a public transport system that will allow them to manage without a car."
"To collect car taxes for a reason like environmental protection makes sense."
"People can understand that and to some extent they can control the rate they pay by their choice of car."
"The Irish Government should make this change with or without Europe."
"However, we must make this shift carefully and think of all the ramifications."
"The move to use road tax to effectively promote energy-efficient cars by charging significantly more tax for cars with bigger engines that use more fuel will mean that drivers will have to pay more for bigger and more powerful cars."
"However, these tax penalties will have a negative impact on families."
"Any family with more than three children, or families with grandparents or other household members, are dependent on bigger cars like people carriers and therefore will be forced to pay the consequences."
"I am advocating a dual system in which the road tax increases with engine size and, within each engine size category, by energy efficiency."
"The family can then reduce the tax they have to pay by choosing a more energy-efficient car which satisfies the family’s transport needs."
"We must ensure that measures are both environment- and family-friendly."
"Mr President, as you have probably gathered from the number of Irish contributors, this is a very vexed issue in my own country."
"In Ireland we consider VRT to be a national tax and we consider the mix of taxation, the rate of taxation, to be a matter falling within national competence."
"Having said that, we are now holding out a prospect of abolishing VRT and perhaps somewhat dishonestly indicating to Irish consumers that at last they may get a car at a much cheaper rate, in much the same way as in other Member States."
"In fact, it was one of the carrots dangled during the single market debate in Europe – sign on here, vote yes, you will have cheaper cars."
"What we are talking about here will be budget-neutral, that has been said and on that we all agree and it will be the motoring public that will bear the cost of the tax if VRT is abolished."
"In Ireland VRT totals EUR 1.15 billion, which is a huge amount in a very small country."
"I do not want to see that put on direct income tax or any direct taxes."
"If we need that money to run our country – and that is a matter for our national government – it must still be collected from the motoring public."
"We must be equitable and fair as to how that is done."
"Having said that, I am all for balancing the taxation structure of motoring in order to decrease emissions - carbon emissions and particles and NOx and all the rest, but how that is done in each Member State is up to each Member State to decide and this is what we must be very careful about."
"I would love to see this debate taken side by side with the debate tomorrow on national allocation plans in relation to our Kyoto targets."
"We should be talking about sectoral targets for CO2 emissions and here transport is one of the biggest sinners."
"It is in that context that we should be talking about taxation on passenger cars and indeed all vehicles."
"This lack of joined-up thinking between two different sectors or two different parts of the DG in the Commission upsets me, because it is really part of tomorrow's debate as well and I would just like to make that point very clear."
"Manufacturers of cars have been selling cars to countries like Ireland, where there is a high rate of VRT, at a much cheaper rate than they have been selling them to other countries that have no VRT or very low rates of it."
"The manufacturers will increase the price of their cars, so our consumers may not benefit from the abolition of VRT.."
"Would that they could, but let us be honest with them."
"Mr President, let us not kid ourselves."
"The report we have before us clearly addresses the issue of taxation."
"Whether a report deals with tax structures – which is the case here – or tax levels, it is not a competence of the European Union and these discussions should not, in my opinion, be taking place here."
"As with many other areas of business we debate, I fear that this would only be the thin end of the wedge in terms of EU interference with taxation: further treaty creep would most probably follow."
"In my opinion, sovereign Member States should be free to set their own criteria and levels of taxation, and not have the EU dictate to them."
"In that I agree wholly with Mrs Doyle."
"However, I have to say I am pleased to see that Parliament is addressing an issue which the Commission has failed even to acknowledge: that of vintage vehicles."
"They must be excluded from the provisions of this directive and I personally will support any amendments to this end."
"We all want to see cleaner vehicles on our roads."
"Indeed, in the UK we are moving to a car-tax structure based on emissions levels."
"However, harmonisation of tax structures is not the way to achieve this: better design, cleaner fuels and research into alternative fuels are the way forward, not a half-baked attempt to extend the competence of the EU into tax."
"– When you buy a new car in, for example, Portugal, you have to pay an astronomical registration tax to the government, sometimes nearly half the final cost of the car."
"On top of this tax comes VAT and then, over the course of the years, you have to pay a circulation tax, which is a nominal amount."
"In other words, buying a car in my country is much more expensive than in most EU countries, and this makes no sense."
"Yet this is how it is and how it will continue to be, because the State – in this case Portugal, which is no different from any other State – likes to charge people up front."
"I refer to this information, just as others have done, because it is relevant to what we are debating here."
"This Proposal for a Directive, aimed precisely at removing what is known as registration tax in EU countries and replacing it with an annual circulation tax, the amount of which will take account of carbon dioxide emissions, is fairer, more sensible, more environmentally-friendly and more economical."
"This is indeed the right system, as it will make cars more affordable for the middle and lower classes and will lead to a more rapid renewal of the stock of cars on the road, which makes sense from the point of view of both the environment and road safety."
"Contrary to what some may believe, an increase in car prices via taxation is not always environmentally friendly."
"In my country, for example, because new cars, which are more environmentally-friendly, are more expensive, people buy less safe, more polluting used cars from other countries."
"On the other hand, a circulation tax, as advocated in the proposal for a directive, would ensure that the vehicle tax burden would accompany the car throughout its useful life and that citizens who settle in more than one EU Member State are not taxed twice over. It would also contribute towards more transparent rules in the internal market by enabling people to make a genuine price comparison of cars in the different Member States."
"To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that raising car prices does not reduce the number of cars in circulation. It merely worsens the quality of the cars we drive."
"A fair and balanced circulation tax is always better than an excessive registration tax, for the environment, for the economy and for the citizens."
"I only hope that the governments of the Member States also understand this at the appropriate time."
"Mr President, let me just start with warm congratulations to the rapporteur on her report;"
"I think she looks perfectly all right even without make-up."
"There are at present 25 different systems of vehicle taxation in the EU, and putting them on a uniform footing will help the internal market work better; that much we know, and to those Members who would deny it, one has to say that it simply has to be admitted that the effect of this proposal is to do away with the distortions and inefficiency that result from double taxation when vehicles are transported across borders."
"The registration taxes imposed in some Member States have – as we have heard often enough – the inevitable effect of making the public negotiate financial and administrative obstacles if they want to take a vehicle from one Member State to another."
"Registration taxes are a sacred cow; let us then slaughter it once and for all – not least because of the environmental considerations and perhaps, indeed, with them particularly in mind."
"After all, tax measures are one of the three pillars of the Community strategy for reducing the emission of CO2 from motor vehicles."
"That is the right approach, but I do not believe that it goes far enough; it is not only the emission of CO2 that should be taxed, but the emission of pollutants generally, for – as we have been told often enough already – there are, alongside CO2, also nitrous oxides and, of course, particulates, emitted into the atmosphere, and so these elements should also be taxed."
"I am quite convinced that abolishing registration tax will have beneficial effects on the environment, for a natural consequence of it will be the sale of new cars."
"The object of reducing the costs involved in buying them is that the consumers will get rid of their old cars as soon as possible and replace them with new ones that save on fuel and pollute the environment less."
"It follows that taxes on vehicles should, in general, be based on the pollutants emitted by them, and if the tax levied is to be fair and neutral in the field of competition, then the rates must relate directly to the pollutants emitted in each instance."
"The tax burden per annum dependent on the emission of pollutants must increase in line with any increase in it."
"."
"Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur and those MEPs who supported the abolition of registration taxes, the establishment of refund systems for car taxes and the application of fiscal measures to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and improve fuel economy."
"The latter implements the third-pillar measures provided for by the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars endorsed by the Council in 1996."
"It is the only pillar of the three that make up the strategy that has not yet been implemented at Community level."
"I should like to stress once again that the proposal of the Commission does not involve any kind of harmonisation and certainly would not touch the rates of car taxation."
"It would only propose the harmonisation of the of car taxation, certainly not the rate."
"I have taken note of the Parliament’s amendments."
"The Commission could accept 15 amendments in principle – amendments 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 19, 23, 24, 28, 29, 31 and 32 – which reinforce and clarify the proposal."
"We will do our utmost to take on board as many of them as possible during the forthcoming discussions in the Council."
"However, at this stage in the legislative procedure, the Commission will not formally revise its proposal."
"I now turn to the group of amendments suggesting that car tax differentiation should be based not only on carbon dioxide emissions but also on other pollutants – in particular amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 25, 26, 27, 30 and 36."
"In principle the Commission encourages Member States to apply coordinated fiscal incentives under certain conditions – for example, to expedite the placing on the market of passenger cars satisfying future requirements."
"However, mixing the objectives on carbon dioxide emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol with those on pollutant emissions covered by the Sixth Environmental Action Programme would lead to increased internal market fragmentation in the area of passenger cars and endanger the whole compromise in the Council."
"As far as the Commission is concerned, it is not necessary to include fuel consumption or fuel efficiency, because CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency are directly linked."
"Some of you suggested that the transitional period – which in the proposal we set at between five and ten years – be fixed at ten years."
"That is acceptable to the Commission in the spirit of the compromise because it would certainly facilitate the smooth transition that we very much support."
"On the question of linear or progressive taxation, the Commission does not express any preference in the proposal."
"We want to keep it open for each Member State to decide."
"Amendment 4 refers to double taxation, while amendments 13 and 22 ask for a one-stop online solution in order to calculate registration taxes."
"Amendments 34 and 37 ask for the scope to be extended to cover light duty vehicles."
"The Commission, although sympathetic, considers that those measures would be difficult to adopt, mainly for reasons of subsidiarity of an economic or technical nature, or because they are beyond the scope of the proposed directive."
"The Commission does not support amendment 20, which requests that a study be carried out by the end of 2006."
"That is an unrealistic time period within which to carry out such a study."
"The Commission cannot support amendments 33, 35, 38, 39 or 40, either."
"I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the support and efforts to conciliate and strike a balance, taking into account the complexity of the issue of passenger car taxation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday at 11.30 a.m."
"The next item is the report (A6-0184/2006) by Mr de Grandes Pascual, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships and amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 (COM(2005)0210 – C6-0153/2005 – 2005/0098(COD))."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to present to you today the proposal for a regulation on funding to deal with pollution caused by ships."
"The aim of this regulation is to provide the European Maritime Safety Agency with the funds it needs in order to properly fulfil the new role assigned to it with regard to combating pollution caused by ships."
"In view of the fact that the intention is for the Agency to have responsibility for this area over the long term, this text defines a financial package to be attributed to the Community budget on the basis of a multiannual commitment."
"The Agency will only be able to fulfil its role effectively if it has financial security based on a multiannual commitment."
"The aim of the proposal for a regulation is therefore to establish procedures for the Community contribution, which has been set at EUR 154 million – the reference figure for 2004 – for the period 2007-2013."
"The proposal provides that the resources made available to the Agency are intended to cover all of its anti-pollution activities, as listed in the action plan that it adopted in October 2004."
"Of these activities, I should like to draw particular attention to the operational assistance given to Member States that want to strengthen their national mechanisms to deal with pollution, using specialised ships, specifically standby ships equipped for the recovery of pollutants from the sea, which the Agency will make available to the Member States."
"Another activity is the development, alongside aerial monitoring, of a satellite imaging service that will make it possible to detect pollution and thus to help the Member States to combat the illegal dumping and accidental spillage of hydrocarbons."
"Yet another activity is the development of a response capability for accidents involving noxious and dangerous substances."
"I should like to thank your rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for seeking, and reaching, Mr President, an agreement with the Council at first reading."
"This constructive approach between the two institutions should enable us to adopt this regulation quickly, to give us a viable system for combating pollution at Community level without delay."
"I should like to extend my warmest thanks to Mr de Grandes Pascual and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for their efforts."
"The compromise you have reached clarifies the Commission's proposal in a number of areas."
"Therefore, Mr President, the Commission fully supports and accepts all of the compromise amendments proposed by Parliament."
"Thank you for your attention; I am now going to listen closely to the thoughtful comments of the various speakers."
"Mr President, Commissioner responsible for transport, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking all of those Members who have improved the quality of this report through their amendments in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"For my part, I have tried, through dialogue, to reach a fundamental consensus with everybody who has shown an interest in this work."
"At the same time, as you have quite rightly pointed out, Commissioner, we have maintained a fluid and fruitful relationship with the Commission and the Council, which has resulted in compromise amendments that will make it possible to approve this report at first reading. There will therefore be no delay in the measures planned within the context of the new tasks entrusted to the Agency with a view to combating pollution caused by ships more effectively."
"I shall very briefly mention the most characteristic aspects of the report."
"Firstly, we are talking about a regulation of a financial nature, which will make it possible to implement the Agency’s new tasks on the basis of a multiannual commitment of seven years, covering the period 2007-2013, in accordance with the new financial perspective."
"The new tasks assigned to the Agency are intended to increase maritime safety and prevent pollution caused by ships in Member States’ waters."
"The size of the commitment was initially set by the Commission at EUR 154 million, a sum that was consolidated by Parliament in the financial perspective and maintained without any cuts in the interinstitutional agreement reached last May."
"I must point out that that sum was initially indicative and that now it has the consensus of Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"It is the minimum appropriation necessary for the Agency to carry out the new tasks assigned to it."
"It should be remembered that the purpose for which the Agency has been created is to provide an appropriate framework for carrying out concrete actions aimed at increasing maritime safety and preventing pollution from ships in Member States’ waters, and also to provide the States with additional resources when national response resources are insufficient to deal with a large-scale incident."
"I must therefore say once again that the Agency has not been created in order to replace the actions of the Member States, but rather to act when the countries affected have insufficient resources to deal with disasters and to complement their actions."
"The additional resources that we are talking about essentially consist of the long-term chartering of ships by means of stand-by contracts with commercial ship operators that have vessels of sufficient capacity that can be adapted for pollution response purposes."
"In response to a request for assistance from a Member State, such vessels would interrupt their customary commercial activities in order to deploy to the area in need."
"With regard to the criteria for selecting priorities for the deployment of ships by region, as a result of the amendments presented and the agreements reached with the Council, the Agency will have to pay particular attention to regions that have been declared the most vulnerable, due to their greater susceptibility to accidents or deliberate pollution, given their characteristics and previous experiences. The Agency will, however, be able to assist in any other region within Community waters which needs help and which requests it."
"The contracting of the first stand-by oil recovery vessels – a total of seven – was carried out in 2005 via a restricted tender procedure."
"Before the end of this year, 2006, the second tender procedure will have been concluded."
"This time, the Agency wants to conclude four new contracts for ships that will prioritise the two major Atlantic regions and the Mediterranean region."
"I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this should be the opportunity to fulfil our commitment to Galicia."
"In any event, before beginning the contracting of stand-by vessels, the Agency will first carry out an inventory of the resources of the Member States, in order to ascertain how best to complement the needs of the Member States that the Agency must cover."
"I would also like to stress that my objective of broadening the scope of the regulation, so that the Agency can deal with pollution by noxious substances, and not just oil pollution, has been achieved."
"Consensus has been reached in this regard through the use of the term ‘pollution caused by ships’, in order to describe pollution caused not just by oil, but also by noxious substances."
"It is also worth pointing out that it has been agreed that the Agency should play a key role in coming years in the development of a centralised satellite imagery service for surveillance, early detection of pollution and identification of the ships responsible, increasing the availability of data and the effectiveness of the response to pollution caused by ships."
"Finally, I am pleased with the consensus reached by the three institutions with a view to increasing transparency in the management of the resources given to the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA)."
"In the past, we have seen other agencies accused of acting rather opaquely and outside of parliamentary control."
"In order to prevent such dangers, it has been agreed that, independently of the four-yearly assessment laid down in Article 7, the European Parliament should be regularly informed about the financial execution of the Agency’s resources."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are convinced that the new transparency practices will increase the Agency’s prestige, preventing it from acquiring the image of a purely bureaucratic instrument."
"I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, by asking you to support this report, which has not just been my work, but is the result of the participation of all of the political groups and of the consensus between Parliament, the Commission and the Council."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has put before us a proposal for extending the remit of the Maritime Safety Agency, and it is surely right, and surely makes sense, that the Agency should be allowed to perform operational tasks in combating pollution, for there is no doubt that the agency possesses the know-how required to support – and I emphasise the word ‘support’, for there is no intention that it should replace them in what they do – the Member States in preventing maritime pollution and in dealing with it."
"If, though, its responsibilities are to be extended in this way, this must go hand in hand with the allocation of the necessary funding for the long term."
"No agency can do a proper job of work if it does not have enough money."
"The Commission’s proposal for the sum of EUR 154 million over the seven-year period is very realistic, being based as it is on the experiences gained in 2005 and 2006."
"It goes back, though, to a time when EUR 58.5 billion more was meant to be allocated to Category 1A."
"The whole category from which the EMSA is funded was cut down to 71%, although the EMSA is not affected by this cut, as the old amount still applies."
"Do not misunderstand me: the Committee on Budgets takes the view that the EUR 154 million constitutes the minimum that should be allocated to the EMSA to enable it to cope with its additional functions."
"We in the Committee on Budgets would have been happy if the members of the lead committee had taken exactly the same view, had supported us in our approach and had incorporated this into the regulation, for our position is that, if the Community fails to allocate sufficient resources, it is doing no more than wasting money."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur on his work and his efforts to achieve this resultant agreement between the institutions."
"Τhis result gives us all satisfaction because it expresses the will of the European Union to give visibility to the European Maritime Safety Agency for combating pollution, to give it suitable means and adequate funding."
"It already has important responsibilities, as the Commissioner and the rapporteur have mentioned, in supporting the efforts of the Member States to combat pollution and in providing the Member States with suitable information in connection with the prevention and combating of pollution and the evaluation of their policies."
"I believe that, within this framework, in addition to this support, the Agency can also play a coordinating role, which is something that our past experience has shown we need."
"The sum of EUR 154 million is important, not only because it is an adequate sum, but also because it also offers security over seven years."
"As far as operational support is concerned, the Agency has – as already mentioned – already chosen the way in which it will act to prevent and combat pollution."
"It is very important that we emphasise that, beyond these areas relating to the Baltic, the western approaches to the English Channel and the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, which are priority areas, the Agency can, if necessary, also act in other areas."
"It is also important that the Agency has the facility to deal with all substances."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner if we could programme an extension to its duties or if we could give a broader interpretation, so that the Agency can act in cases where pollution is not caused by ships, such as pollution from the major oil slick in Lebanon, which is currently plaguing the Mediterranean and approaching the Member States."
"."
"Mr President, it is most appropriate that we should be debating this today, and that we can expect it to be adopted by a large majority tomorrow, for the EMSA is to be officially opened, in Lisbon, on 14 September, and it will not be able to do its work properly without a sound financial basis."
"I believe that that is what we are establishing by means of this regulation for funding action in response to maritime pollution."
"As has frequently been said, we regard EUR 154 million from 2007 to 2013 as the very least that is required, and we will also, over this period, look carefully to see what improvements might have to be made."
"I can assure Mrs Haug that we are already keeping an eye out to see that nothing is wasted and to ensure that, on the contrary, it is properly funded and is taking the proper steps."
"What it clear is that the Member States will not be discharged from their responsibilities."
"All the EMSA can do is to support them and supplement what they do."
"It has to be emphasised that maritime pollution is not just something that happens as a result of disasters."
"We know about the ‘Prestige’ and ‘Erika’ disasters, but our seas are being fouled day in and day out by illegal discharges of oil; if the environmental protection organisations are right in their calculations, these happen 3 000 times a year in European waters."
"Something must be done about this, and I very much hope that the satellite monitoring system that the EMSA is to help set up will enable us to make a better job of dealing with the criminal acts in our waters."
"Another cause for rejoicing is that the rapporteur, who was rather unwell before the summer, is back with us again, so that we can, so to speak, join with him tomorrow in getting this regulation on the road, and that he has, together with the Council, managed to come up with some good solutions, for which we are very grateful, and we have got this done and dusted at first reading stage, with no need of a conciliation procedure."
"To sum up, our adoption of this regulation tomorrow will see this House and the Council making an important contribution towards clean and better protected seas in Europe."
"I hope that this demonstration of Europe’s concern for clean waters will lead the public to value the European Union more highly."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the European Maritime Safety Agency is ready to take part in the fight against the marine pollution caused by the thousands of ships that plough through Community waters on a daily basis, but we must first acknowledge that the Member States lack the capacity to respond to the great ecological disasters that we suffer periodically, such as the tragic cases of the and, in particular, the ."
"It is fair to recognise that we cannot demand that each and every coastal Member State, regardless of its size or wealth, permanently have available sufficient physical and technological resources to respond immediately and effectively to major disasters and accidents."
"We should also remember that ships do not just transport goods to and from the coastal States, but that they are also part of the supply and trade chain of the other continental or non-maritime States, and therefore the latter should bear a degree of shared responsibility in terms of the risks involved in maritime transport."
"For all of these reasons, Community measures should and must be taken in order to support and complement those established by the various Member States individually, though those States must remain primarily responsible for both preventing and responding to marine pollution."
"Amongst those support measures, the European Maritime Safety Agency is establishing a system for the collection and analysis of information on pollution caused by ships, which would include photographic surveillance by satellite, scientific-technical assistance and operational assistance, by means of ships spread out in different geographical maritime regions and ready to act in the event of accidents and disasters at the request of the Member States affected."
"The present regulation is intended to provide funding for the next seven-year programming period 2007-2013 to cover the costs of these new services. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the proposal with the compromise amendments shared with other parliamentary groups, and we congratulate Mr de Grandes on his good report and the work he has done in order to reach a consensus so that this regulation can be approved at first reading."
"Nevertheless, I would like to say, for my part, that I am convinced that the greatest maritime pollution is not caused by accidents and disasters, but that there is a great lack of environmental awareness; certain unscrupulous people put their economic interests first and deliberately and wilfully clean out their ships’ tanks and bilges at sea."
"Satellite photographs may reduce such cases, but I doubt that they will be of any use on cloudy days or when visibility is poor."
"I would therefore advocate the introduction on all ships of automatic mechanisms for controlling the levels of tanks and bilges at short, regular intervals in order to ascertain whether or not they have been emptied into the waste facilities provided in ports under the MARPOL legislation."
"This should be obligatory, just as the black box is for aircraft and the tachograph is for lorries."
"This would be the best way to put an end to deliberate discharges of pollutants, which I believe to be the most numerous and damaging sources of pollution."
"Mr President, at the Copenhagen European Council in December 2002, all Heads of State or Government supported much more stringent regulations to combat pollution caused by ships."
"That summit took place only a month after the accident involving the in November 2002."
"Now, almost four years later, it seems as if the level of ambition has fallen considerably. There is too little money, and it is not completely clear how comprehensive we shall have been able to make the system."
"That being said, we are pleased that this compromise has been reached, and we support it."
"We would also particularly congratulate Mr Grandes on his report, and, as a Dane, I have to say how constructive it is that we have had the arrangements extended also to cover the North Sea area."
"We are pleased that the subject is now pollution in general and not only special pollution."
"We assume that this proposal and the whole of this draft are of such a kind that improvements might also be made and that the level of ambition might also gradually be increased."
"We assume that it will be possible for the content to be increased and for proposals – such as the one now tabled – to be incorporated so that it is possible to pursue the very many criminals who are quite indifferent to what happens to our marine environment and who therefore have no compunction about using it as a dustbin, unwilling as they are to pay what it costs to get rid of their pollutants properly."
"I do not believe that the proposal is good enough to enable us to prevent behaviour like that, but I hope that it is good enough to be improved and that it can therefore operate as a necessary framework."
"Thank you for your proposal. Naturally, we support it."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, while we are debating the framework of the responsibilities and the funding of the European Maritime Safety Agency to prevent and combat cases of maritime pollution, a huge ecological disaster is unfolding in the southeast Mediterranean as a result of the criminal bombing of the Jiyyeh power plant in Lebanon by the Israelis."
"According to information from the International Maritime Organisation and other competent agencies, tens of thousands of tonnes of oil leaked into the sea and have spread along the shores of the Mediterranean to a distance of over 170 kilometres."
"The murderous attacks by the Israelis caused the death of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians and caused incalculable repercussions on the local environment in general."
"This is a crime against humanity."
"The cost of the cleanup operation in the area, according to the most moderate estimates by International Maritime Organisation experts, runs to more than EUR 50 million, in other words one-third of seven-year budget for funding the European Maritime Safety Agency to combat maritime pollution."
"I do not mention this in the sense that the cleanup operation will be covered from the Agency's reserves, but so that we have a better understanding of the real cost of this sort of pollution."
"The much-vaunted European Union principle of 'the polluter pays' is proving to be false and hypocritical, given that, in this case too, the European Union has not made any reference to those responsible, to Israel, which caused this huge ecological disaster."
"The European Maritime Safety Agency cannot and must not replace the International Maritime Organisation and its members, who bear chief responsibility for the safety protection of life at sea and the environment."
"The European Agency needs to focus its action on improving maritime safety and combating pollution, concentrating its attention in particular on preventing pollution."
"The Agency must help with additional measures rather than replace the infrastructures and activities of the Member States; it must complement their action in dealing with disasters."
"The activities covered by financial assistance must include all forms of maritime pollution, especially pollution from hydrocarbons and dangerous liquid substances."
"The take-up of EUR 136 million from total appropriations of EUR 154 million being given to the Agency to charter standby ships and the huge cost of satellite photographs, with 1 000 photographs costing EUR 1 million, mean that there is a huge risk of this Agency turning into a purely bureaucratic mechanism."
"That is why great care is needed in order to secure financial assistance so that the Agency can perform its new duties."
"– People in countries with a coastline are well aware that sea pollution cuts across borders, and ships tend not to choose where to run aground."
"This is certainly the kind of issue in which national self-interest can be harmful."
"Economic areas can and must continue to be exclusive, but the sea is a common good and when there is an environmental tragedy it affects all of us."
"The right way forward is therefore for us to adopt a Community perspective to address the risks of maritime pollution."
"As Mr de Grandes Pascual’s report correctly points out, and I take this opportunity to commend the rapporteur, what we need is a sustained, long-term financial framework that will deliver prevention for the Member States and enable them to use up-to-date, appropriate technical resources to protect our coasts from spills, such as those that have happened in the recent past. Furthermore, and equally importantly, the framework will lead to punishment for those responsible for environmental crimes."
"Mr President, oil spills are always harmful and are sometimes criminal, yet financial spills can be harmful, too."
"Throwing money at the sea is not a solution in itself."
"I therefore support the multiannual funding model proposed here, and most importantly, the transparent, effective use thereof."
"The EUR 154 million allocated to the European Maritime Safety Agency for 2007-2013 will hopefully help to implement the action plan to combat maritime pollution, to set up a framework of specialised stand-by vessels to take action in the four priority zones and to set up a satellite image service centre to support the activities of the Member States and the Commission in the fight against spills from vessels, among other tasks in the fight against pollution."
"This is a project which, with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Transport and Tourism and others, has our full backing, not least because it reinforces the idea that the Member States have a shared responsibility in this joint effort."
"Mr President, we are not living in a , as the Romans would say; nowadays, the sea belongs to all, and is a global, shared responsibility."
"In adopting this resolution, we in Parliament are fulfilling our share of that responsibility."
"Mr President, as our coordinator, Willi Piecyk, has already said, we Socialists support this multiannual financial framework for the European Maritime Safety Agency and we are also pleased that an agreement has been reached."
"This Agency was created following two great disasters – the oil slicks caused by the and by the – and from the beginning its task was to assist coastal States in dealing with disasters, should those States so request."
"I would like to say in this regard, Commissioner, that in my region, Galicia, on the Atlantic coast, which has suffered in particular from great disasters over the last twenty years, the location of the Agency’s stand-by ships for recovering oil felt like a kick in the teeth."
"In fact, even though the Commission expressly acknowledged that the area most affected by large-scale oil slicks over the last thirty-five years had been the Galician coast, with more than seven slicks greater than 10 000 tonnes, of the seven anti-pollution ships contracted by the Agency, not a single one was located in Galicia: five in the Baltic, one in the Mediterranean and another in the English Channel-North Atlantic region."
"To be fair, however, I will also say that one of the commitments that this Parliament extracted from the Commission after the disaster was the presence of an anti-pollution ship based in Galicia and in this regard I must say to Mr Barrot that the fluid dialogue with the Commission, both with the Director-General for Transport and with the Agency itself, has helped to allay our fears."
"Amendment 13, which divides the Atlantic coast into two regions, as Mrs Ayala and myself had requested, Mr de Ruiter’s visit to Galicia and the good communication that has been established between the regional government and the Agency provide us with a guarantee that the European Union’s commitments to Galicia with regard to the location of an anti-pollution ship on the Galician coast will be fulfilled."
"Mr President, pollution crosses borders and requires urgent co-ordinated action to deal with its consequences, so it is wholly appropriate that we create at EU level a framework to deal with it."
"I congratulate the Commissioner and our rapporteur for their excellent work on this matter, but it is only a start."
"The best cure is prevention."
"We, in Scotland, an oil-producing maritime nation, have a live debate on proposals to transfer oil from ship to ship at sea, in an area of special scientific interest covered by the Birds Directive, the River Forth, just north of Edinburgh."
"This is an area precious to Scotland's natural environment."
"There is almost total opposition to these proposals in Scotland and yet the United Kingdom Maritime and Coastguard Agency just yesterday gave its approval for these potentially disastrous plans to go forward."
"Fortunately, the EU can take a bigger view."
"Commissioner Dimas has launched an investigation into the potential environmental consequences of these proposals and I hope his investigation will stop these proposals from being implemented."
"While I welcome and support the Commission's proposals, they are a start."
"I believe we can go further."
"I believe my Group wants us to go further still."
"These proposals are stopping a disaster from happening but, of course, dealing with its consequences is only part of the picture, we must prevent them also."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, unfortunately the ecological disasters caused by accidents at sea continue to constitute a serious danger to the seas and coastal areas of Europe, while the ability of the Member States to deal with these accidents is often inadequate."
"That is why it is important for us to give the EMSA, which provides the Member States with important support, the necessary financial security for it to do its job."
"It is very important that its duties be extended, so that the EMSA can acquire every effective new means for combating all forms of deliberate and accidental pollution."
"The provision of operational support to the Member States must be strengthened by providing specially equipped vessels to combat pollution and creating a central satellite photograph transmission centre for surveillance and prompt location."
"Nonetheless, the Agency must also address other matters, such as the disposal of the oil recovered and air surveillance, activities for which additional funding will be required."
"Finally, let us not forget that the Agency's action complements that of the Member States."
"Consequently, action by the Member States also needs to be strengthened."
"Mr President, I would like firstly to congratulate the rapporteur, Luis de Grandes."
"I am delighted he is in such wonderful and enviable health."
"I must say that he has done a fantastic job in cooperation with the Council with a view to reaching an agreement at first reading, since it was important to guarantee the stability and the work of this Maritime Safety Agency."
"The joint proposals take up two of the requests presented by Mrs Miguélez Ramos and myself. One of them was that, while this new programme extended the Agency’s control to noxious substances, we should not overlook the fact that oil was at its basis."
"Secondly – and Mrs Miguélez Ramos has already mentioned this – with regard to the division by regions, the initial deficiencies on either side should be resolved, since the conditions for the contracts had not provided much motivation for the shipowners of the region, who did not have any interest in making ships available, and that was exacerbated by the lack of insistence on the part of the Agency."
"As Mrs Miguélez Ramos has quite rightly said, that has now been overcome and we are facing a much more practical and better-organised future."
"In any event, we would say to the Agency and to the Commission that, in this multiannual programme, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control will also be watching very carefully to ensure that the actions, the action plan, and hence the presence of the vessels, are sufficient to meet any needs that might arise, and that we no longer have to face those deficiencies that we have seen in the past."
"I shall end with an observation and a request to Vice-President Barrot, who I know is well-known for paying great attention to this Parliament’s appeals."
"At a time when the maritime borders of my country, of Italy, Malta and Greece are demonstrating their great weakness, we would like the Frontex Agency to have at least the same capacity for deployment of vessels and resources for controlling and protecting our maritime borders as we are approving today for the Maritime Safety Agency."
"I would ask Vice-President Barrot to help his colleague Mr Frattini within the Commission to ensure that the Frontex Agency has the necessary resources as soon as possible, since this summer we have been in great need of them."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to start by thanking Mr de Grandes Pascual and your Committee on Transport and Tourism once again for their excellent work, which should allow us to adopt the text at first reading."
"I am delighted at this because – as several of you have said – we must never forget the disasters of the sinking of the and the ."
"That is why it is absolutely vital to use all means necessary, and now that Parliament and the Council have brought their texts into line with one another, we will be able to reach agreement at first reading."
"Of course, the Commission supports the compromise reached during the informal trialogue with the Council."
"In this spirit, it accepts the compromise amendments you have proposed, Mr de Grandes Pascual, which are supported by the various political groups and which reflect the compromise from the informal trialogue with the Council."
"I am quite sure that, tomorrow, the Members of the European Parliament will support this approach, even if the financial package of EUR 154 million must be regarded as a minimum, as stated in one of the recitals to the regulation."
"I should like to take this opportunity to respond to some of the comments that have been made regarding the Agency’s missions."
"We can look at this extension as part of the revision of the regulation planned for 2007."
"I am thinking in particular, Mr President, of the current situation on the coast of Lebanon, where we should like to be able to respond more easily to the needs of our Lebanese friends."
"That said, I have also noted your desire to ensure that the efforts undertaken by the Agency in terms of combating pollution do not result in a disengagement from the Member States."
"We must be quite clear on that point."
"I should like to thank you, Mr President: the quality of this debate, and your various suggestions and proposals, show that Parliament really feels involved in these efforts to combat marine pollution and to protect the European marine environment, which is one of our great assets."
"I should therefore like to thank Parliament, and I hope that we will now be able to adopt this excellent text without delay."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m."
"– Europe has constantly promoted the development of international maritime law to protect the environment."
"It has already achieved the gradual scrapping of single-hull oil tankers worldwide and increased compensation for victims of hydrocarbon pollution, and it has supplemented existing international regulations by introducing stricter inspections in Community ports, more effective checks of classification societies and more thorough monitoring of maritime traffic."
"Strict and effective enforcement of international regulations by a large trading block like the European Union, the world’s foremost trading area, accounting for 24% of the global fleet, helps to enhance the credibility of the regulations even among ships flying third-country flags."
"We therefore have to agree with the proposal to grant the European Maritime Safety Agency further powers to support the Member States in this truly international campaign."
"The next item is the Commission statement on forest fires and floods."
"Mr President, I am very happy that we are having this debate this evening, which follows on from the previous debate on a similar matter."
"I should like to say that the European Union civil protection mechanism was activated 11 times in the first few months of this year, intervening on request in the floods in various European countries in the spring, especially in the countries which requested it, namely Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania and, outside the European Union, Algeria."
"Similarly, we recently had the crisis in Lebanon and the associated problems created by the hostilities."
"Both Lebanon and Cyprus requested intervention by the European Union on three issues:"
"Firstly with the provision of humanitarian assistance for refugees and displaced persons."
"Secondly with evacuation: the removal from Lebanon of citizens from European Union countries, their transportation to Cyprus, their reception there and their subsequent repatriation."
"The third problem which arose was the problem of contamination by the oil slick following the bombing of the oil tanks in south Lebanon and the fact that approximately 10 to 15 thousand tonnes of oil spilled on to the shore and then into the sea, polluting the entire coast of Lebanon."
"In this instance, the European Union immediately sent experts both to Cyprus and Lebanon."
"Firstly, we mobilised the civil protection mechanisms in the European countries, coordinated the aid mission and addressed the more specific problem of transporting humanitarian aid, given that certain countries offering aid did not have any means of transportation, which is a specific problem which needs to be examined in future."
"Secondly, as I already mentioned, European citizens and third country citizens were transported as quickly as possible from Cyprus to their own countries."
"This was a very difficult operation if you imagine that about 45 000 citizens from other countries abandoned Lebanon, went to Cyprus and had to be repatriated."
"The European Union, with the civil protection mechanism, coordinated transportation, with aeroplanes scheduled to arrive so that the citizens of the various countries had to remain in Cyprus as little as possible."
"I should also point out and emphasise the exceptional efficiency with which the Cyprus authorities and a great many volunteers dealt with this crisis, with our participation, of course."
"The third major problem was the problem of the oil slick."
"As I said earlier, we immediately sent experts, who are still there, given that this is an ongoing problem: for a time the surrounding countries were threatened, but they were not ultimately contaminated and at present the experts are trying with various pumps and materials sent by countries of the European Union and third countries, such as Norway, to improve the situation and to clean up the shores."
"Furthermore, this summer we had fires in various European countries, such as Greece, France and Portugal, and very extensive fires in Spain."
"Of these countries, Spain asked for help from the European Union and, within a few hours of the Spanish Government's request, fire-fighting 'planes, fire engines and firemen were offered by various European countries and, with the help of the European Union, action by the Spanish Government and a change in the weather and rainfall, the fire was finally put out."
"Furthermore, we had a major problem in Ethiopia, with floods which continue to threaten the country; we had hundreds of deaths and several thousand refugees."
"Experts and specialists from the European Union are there and countries in the European Union have offered certain supplies and materials to deal with the emergency in this country which, I would emphasise, is still in a state of crisis."
"Similarly, numerous countries in the European Union sent aid through the civil protection mechanism to Indonesia following the earthquake last May."
"I should like to say on the subject of the fires, given that this is an issue of great interest, that the Commission is not competent for all forest-related matters: these are matters for the Member States and it is the Member States which determine the policies used to protect forests, prevent fires and address all associated, forest-related problems."
"Policies at European level are designed to strengthen the Member States' corresponding policies."
"They also include the funding programmes which we have and which are available either from the new rural development mechanism, the Forest Focus Directive, which will have the facility to finance action to protect forests, or from the new LIFE+ programme, which makes express provision for financing for various activities which used to be financed under the Forest Focus Directive."
"Of course we also have the civil protection action programme, which can be used to finance – and is financing – certain activities to protect forests."
"I know that in matters of civil protection from natural disasters we can never be satisfied."
"Many crises and natural disasters cannot be averted. However, we can be better prepared."
"Although the civil protection mechanism has proven that it adds value and that it is very important, there is a great deal of room for improvement, a great deal of room to make it more effective."
"On this matter I should like to thank the European Parliament for its constant support, for strengthening the civil protection mechanism, and I am certain that this evening's debate will help in this direction."
"Mr President, the Commission is here today to attend this debate in the European Parliament on the initiative of my group and I would therefore like to begin by thanking the other groups that have supported this initiative, thereby making it possible for us to hold this debate today."
"I would, of course, also like to thank the Commissioner for being here and above all for his work and commitment in this field."
"Nevertheless, certain Members have told us quite legitimately that we are doing the same as we did a year ago, that we are in the same situation as last summer."
"I would like to respond to them by saying that that is not true: it is true that we debated fires in September last year as well; it is true that we visited the areas affected together with some of our fellow Members who are here today – and not without difficulties created by certain bodies in this House, incidentally; and it is true that we held a hearing in which victims’ families were able to express themselves in an emotional manner to all of us, but we are not in the same situation, because, since then, the European Parliament has presented clear and concrete initiatives and proposals to the Council."
"For example, within the framework of the Berend report, this House approved a raft of amendments aimed at updating the European Union’s Solidarity Fund."
"We have also asked the European Commission for a specific directive on fires and on drought, since there is a directive on floods, and we have asked the Council for a committed response to the report by former Commissioner Barnier, which was presented at the last European Council, as everybody knows."
"We are not, therefore, and nor should we be, in the same situation as a year ago."
"We have a package of proposals which should make us much more effective in combating fires."
"What we have not had is a reaction from the Council, and that fact can be attributed as much to the Presidencies we have had this year, which have done practically nothing, as to those Member States most affected that have not asked for anything."
"Certain competent public authorities use the drought, or the deliberately caused fires, as an excuse for this failure."
"It is true that there is drought and it is true that there are criminals, as there have been in the past, but we should be asking those authorities what they have done this year in the field of prevention and whether, when the inevitable has happened, there has been proper coordination inside and outside of their borders."
"For example, the Commissioner referred to the most significant fire of this summer: the one that took place in Galicia."
"I would like to ask you when you formally received the request for assistance from the Spanish Government, and on precisely what date you were formally asked to activate the civil protection mechanism."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we are simply asking for more prevention and more coordination."
"We are not talking about inventing resources or funds that do not exist. We are simply asking that the European Union’s Solidarity Fund be applied, which would have been much easier, by the way, if the European Parliament’s proposals had been taken into account."
"Nor are we asking for greater powers for the European Union, but rather for more planning and more coordination while fully respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"Let us see whether, while helping those who most need it now, we can ensure that we do not have to repeat this debate next year."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the audacity with which Mr Galeote has tried to claim ownership of this resolution is not going to stop me from saying to all of you that, from the outset, that is to say, since Monday of last week, we Socialists have been in no doubt whatsoever that we wanted a motion for a resolution, that we wanted it in this sitting and that we wanted it on this issue."
"This is because, like the floods in central Europe, ladies and gentlemen, the fires in southern Europe are a recurring environmental emergency."
"Their causes have been very well studied: more than 80% are caused by human actions, either negligent or wilful, with a deliberate intention to cause damage."
"We are talking about how a fire starts, however. How a fire starts is one thing, but its spread, the area burnt, is quite another."
"Other factors are at play here. The weather, for example, which this year was very extreme with very strong winds, very high temperatures, and little or no rainfall, or the state of the countryside which, for socio-economic reasons, has been abandoned, and is full of highly combustible undergrowth that helps fires to spread, as well as the planting of inappropriate forest species and the abandonment for decades of a genuine forestry policy."
"In the countries of the Mediterranean south, huge amounts have been invested in fire-fighting resources."
"Throughout southern Europe we have very efficient extinguishing mechanisms, but the resources are never sufficient: suffice it to say that this summer in Galicia, ladies and gentlemen, there have been more than 7 000 people and more than 60 aircraft dedicated to putting the fires out, but how can they fight 300 fires every day?"
"In this regard, what we Socialists are asking from the Commission is very clear."
"On the one hand, that the Commission facilitate the application in this case of the Solidarity Fund by means of the political criterion: we want the Solidarity Fund to be applied to the affected populations and regions in the European Union."
"We are also asking for two other things."
"One relates to Forest Focus."
"We have established a warning system that is effective, but insufficient."
"It is effective in that it allows us to identify areas of climate risk or quite simply areas at risk of natural disaster, but it does not indicate the areas of socio-economic risk."
"We Socialists argue that, behind these fires, there lies the serious abandonment of the more traditional farming practices and also the ageing of the population currently living in rural areas."
"We are also asking you to mobilise the European forestry strategy."
"We believe that Commissioner Dimas must find the money and the instruments to create effective policies aimed at keeping people in the countryside by means of that plan or that forestry strategy and also at maintaining and extending our areas of forest."
"Mr President, when an oil tanker sinks, we are all very well aware, firstly, of how serious a situation it is, of its environmental impact and of the need to respond in a joint fashion."
"When we are facing fires or floods though, we in the European Union carry on acting as if each one were an isolated event that did not deserve or require a genuine global approach and, in some people’s view, as if they did not have a genuine European dimension."
"That is absurd."
"It is because of that lack of an overall view and of policies consistent with that overall view that we do not have a real range of instruments for combating them."
"I believe that there are in fact three dimensions to this kind of disaster that must be tackled."
"The first is the emergency situation itself, and here the European Union can do much more than it is currently doing; the European Union could do much more to strengthen its measures for responding rapidly to civil protection crises, but it is not doing so; specifically, the European Union, in this case the Council, rejected or continues to reject the idea of implementing what was proposed to it in the Barnier report, with specific proposals on the creation of a European civil protection response service, and that is what needs to be set up for pure emergency situations."
"Clearly, however, after the immediate coordinated response to the emergency, which does not work, because the planning instruments do not exist or have not been properly implemented, we naturally need subsequent assistance for those affected."
"That is the second element that we need to take into account."
"This is where my group agrees with the request from other groups, stressing the importance of mobilising the European Union’s Solidarity Fund, since that is what it was created for, with a political outlook – obeying its rules, of course, but with a political outlook."
"A fire or a flood, and in this case I am referring specifically to the situation in Galicia, completely destroys the already scant resources that a region needs for its development. It is therefore obvious that we are facing a situation that requires the urgent application of the Solidarity Fund, in order to assist those populations and that territory which, in tourism and economic terms, have seen their source of income reduced to ashes – and in this case I mean that quite literally."
"That brings us to the third dimension, in order to try to ensure that the first and the second are not repeated, although we can never prevent everything."
"I am talking, of course, about prevention."
"We need a genuine European forestry policy, which does not exist because it is still fragmented."
"Since Forest Focus was drawn up, there have been more fires covering larger areas."
"We hope that the European Commission will take this into account in the report that it has to produce before the end of 2006."
"Biomass needs to be promoted."
"We truly have to take seriously the consequences of warming in this case and the rise in temperatures."
"The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development must take account of the consequences for the forests."
"In that way, the situation will change and we will no longer have to face problems such as this after the summer every year."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the tragedy of the forest fires that, year after year, affect the countries of Southern Europe, and especially Portugal and Spain, must not be allowed to go on."
"The time has come to replace the rhetoric with practical measures to ensure that the summer is not transformed into an inferno that destroys protected forests and landscapes and the lives and property of the thousands of people who courageously continue to live in rural areas."
"What happened in August in Portugal was particularly serious; tens of thousands of hectares of forest were burnt, a number of people died, an important environmental heritage site in the Peneda-Gerês and Serras d'Aire e Candeeiros national parks was destroyed, and there were enormous material losses."
"September has begun, and the scourge of the fires continues."
"Consequently, solidarity must be shown with the communities affected, urgent support must be provided for pastoralists and farmers who have lost their cattle-grazing land in, for example, the Serra de Soajo, and burnt wood must be removed immediately as fair payment for farmers, small forest owners and those sharing common land."
"It is vital, moreover, that we place the emphasis on prevention by means of increasing financial, technical and human resources, including support for those directly involved in fighting the fires and with the reforestation of burnt areas, namely the protected areas."
"Extraordinary aid must be granted to the worst affected areas and communities of Portugal from the European Solidarity Fund."
"There must be no further delay in adopting effective public policies aimed at strengthening prevention, reforestation, and forestry development. The common agricultural policy must also be amended in order to ensure that family farming receives sufficient support for farmers to be guaranteed a decent living, by means of guaranteed production prices, and in order to stem the tide of people abandoning rural areas, which will be exacerbated by the decoupling of production aid."
"."
"Mr President, natural disasters are affecting Europe with increasing frequency."
"Once again we see disastrous forest fires in the south."
"In large parts of Europe there have been great heat waves, with the highest temperatures recorded since records began, which led to great droughts."
"In some regions in Poland the harvests fell by over twenty percent and hundreds of thousands of farming families found themselves in a desperate situation."
"Then heavy rainfall and localised flooding made harvesting difficult and compounded the losses."
"Government aid is limited and most farmers cannot afford the expensive insurance cover for their own farms."
"In any case, insurance does not solve the problem, as natural disasters are becoming the norm rather than the exception."
"Farmers in Poland and elsewhere are asking the European Union for aid, which currently is symbolic rather than real."
"It is imperative for us to create a European system which can be used to provide aid to the countries and people affected by natural disasters."
"It is vital to earmark larger funds than those we have at present, for this purpose."
"People whose houses have been destroyed by catastrophic fires, whose fields and crops have been destroyed by droughts or flooding, have to be able to count on solidarity and aid from the European Union."
"One of the reasons the European Union was created was so that its communities and citizens could help each other in times of need."
"The Union should show solidarity and provide aid for the victims of natural disasters such as droughts, floods or forest fires."
"We expect the European Commission to put forward real proposals both for a system to counteract the consequences of natural disasters and for providing aid for countries and people who have suffered as a result of such disasters."
"Mr President, I would like to point out that we discussed this matter a few months ago."
"During that debate, important issues were raised."
"But, as the previous speaker mentioned, during the recess, my homeland of Poland was hit first by a serious drought and then by flooding."
"This disaster also affected my constituency of Lower Silesia."
"It is a problem which affects my country on an almost annual basis."
"It is clear that droughts and fires affect mainly southern Europe and floods affect mainly northern Europe."
"It is also clear that we should, as the previous speakers have mentioned, make Solidarity Fund resources more flexible and define the bureaucracy to allocate these funds to the people and regions affected by disasters, and increase the funds earmarked for aid to these regions."
"This is because, for many of our citizens, the European Union is about providing real aid in the event of such disasters."
"– I believe that today's debate is not being held so that we can express our sorrow about the phenomenon or to emphasise our support for the victims."
"I do not think that is particularly useful to them."
"What is needed is for us to debate the issue politically and for us to see what we can do as the European Union."
"I think that today's debate ultimately raises the question of what model of European Union we want."
"Do we want a European Union which only concerns itself with monetary policy, with competitiveness, with the internal market – matters which it quite rightly concerns itself with – or do we want a European Union which, at the same time, will be present at the major problems of daily life, present where there is human pain."
"The fires we experienced this summer in my country, in Greece, are one such instance."
"Of course the Member States have the initiative in this sort of natural disaster, but that is no excuse for the European Union not to demonstrate its solidarity in a tangible manner, that is no excuse for the European Union to be absent."
"Everything the Commissioner said about the initiatives taken this summer by the European Commission is particularly positive."
"An intervention by the Solidarity Fund would also be positive, but I think that the European Union needs to have more tools at its disposal."
"It needs a more substantial and more effective European civil protection mechanism, as called for by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in its motion."
"We have got the Barnier report: the Council asked for it and the European Council welcomed it last June."
"Now we need to put the Barnier report into practice."
"We need to move at long last from theory to practice and I trust that the fact that the Council welcomed this report is not purely and simply an expression of diplomatic affability, but expresses the will of the European Union to be more present when such issues arise."
"– As I speak, the fire that, in the far north of Portugal, has struck the biggest natural park in the country for the second time this year, has yet to be put out."
"What is more, eight other large-scale fires in other regions remain active."
"The tragedy of the fires is still affecting a number of Member States this year, although it appears that Spain is currently the worst affected, with countless human tragedies, including loss of life, and economic and environmental losses that cannot be quantified."
"I therefore wish to express my solidarity and heartfelt sympathy with all Members of this House from all of the countries affected, and in particular those from Spain. I remind the House of those who have lost their lives in this inferno that has hit us, and pay tribute to all those who – in a professional capacity or otherwise – have striven as far as is humanly possible to mitigate the impact of the fires"
"As we know, the problem of the forest fires and other disasters cannot be waved away overnight with a magic wand, particularly given that they are often down to a complex range of factors, such as the climate and negligence or crime on the part of human beings."
"Yet we also know that it is possible to reduce their scale and offset the impact if we attach due political priority to the issue."
"It should be remembered that Parliament recently dedicated a great deal of attention to the issue, over several months, and mobilised the resources and the good will to gain a better understanding of these phenomena, to identify the causes and to propose short-, medium- and long-term solutions to reverse this appalling situation."
"Various commissions interviewed researchers and experts, made contact with local authorities and communities, and formulated proposals and recommendations to the Commission and the Council that obtained broad political support in Parliament last May."
"I was the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which formulated some 30 proposals with a view to adopting a European strategy, which was aimed at achieving the objectives of reducing the impact of natural disasters to a minimum via the creation of new measures and ensuring that the various existing political and financial instruments operate coherently."
"It would be unreasonable to expect all of these proposals to have been implemented since May, but there is an increasingly urgent need to move from the reports to practical action."
"The political debate is over, and there is awareness of and agreement on the political solutions needed."
"The fresh tragedy this summer has merely served to remind us that we need to act with increasing urgency so that next year we do not have to be restricted to expressing words of mutual solidarity in the face of a new tragedy."
"Mr President, as an MEP for the Galeuska electoral coalition, I would like to speak on behalf of the Galician Nationalist Bloc, which has asked me to communicate its concern and its political condemnation of all of the fires that have taken place this summer, particularly those that have destroyed huge areas of forest, including the Natura 2000 Network in Galicia, and which, furthermore, have cost the lives of several people."
"I would like to express my sincerest condolences and solidarity with the families of the victims and all of the people affected."
"There has been another environmental tragedy in Galicia, which can be added to other ecological disasters, such as the ."
"We must therefore once again shout out today ‘[never again]’. ‘’, that is to say, no more fires."
"Unlike the case of the , I do not believe that we can in any way criticise the management or response to the disaster on the part of the Galician authorities and the national government, but the fire was so big that it demonstrated the need for greater European solidarity and resources to help the Member States to put out large fires, or to deal with floods, as we are going to approve tomorrow in the case of funding for the fight against marine pollution."
"At the same time, however, we must not fail to analyse the possible influence on these fires – the majority of which are believed to have been caused deliberately – of extensive planting of non-native species over previous decades, the confused changes of use or town-planning reclassifications of burnt areas, the paper pulp factories’ interest in obtaining cheap wood, or the alleged vengeance of former forest wardens who have not been employed for supervision purposes this summer."
"We must also analyse the extent to which all of us and the common agricultural policy are responsible for the forced abandonment of traditional agricultural activities by those people who, unable to find any alternative work, have left the rural areas and upset the land-planning balance, and therefore no longer look after the forests, or raise early alarms, or prevent arson attacks."
"We need to consider all of these things."
"Mr President, I would ask the Commissioner to pay particular attention to development and to the conclusions of the Galician Parliament’s committee of inquiry on this latest disaster."
"In recent years, Galicia has been particularly affected by disasters, such as the ."
"Furthermore, in recent years, 350 000 hectares of forest have been destroyed by fires, and this summer around 80 000."
"We must therefore pay close attention to this inquiry, so that we can take account of the requests for significant legislative changes which will undoubtedly have to be made."
"In recent days, we have been witnessing another disaster in Galicia: the River Umia is being contaminated by a chemical industry; its location right next to the River Umia should never have been allowed."
"I would therefore ask the Commissioner to pay particular attention here."
"Why?"
"Because the specific characteristics of this latest disaster suggest that these fires have been started deliberately by professionals."
"Who is behind this natural disaster?"
"If penalties need to be increased, if European legislation has to be amended, there is no question that that must be done and, in particular, we must keep a close eye on this inquiry, because there are people behind this and they must be exposed."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is sad to realise that only in recent years has the subject of civil protection been aired in this Chamber and it is debated each time in connection with a particular kind of disaster: an earthquake the day before yesterday, marine pollution yesterday, fires and floods today, and so forth."
"The topics are fragmented, powers are fragmented and resources are fragmented."
"That alone would be enough to justify the tenacity with which my political group has been proposing for years to this House and the Commission that a European civil protection agency should be set up. This would be a versatile, flexible body endowed with its own powers and with human and material resources supplied by the Member States."
"It is now more important than ever to set up a civil protection agency, Commissioner, after the unfortunate experience of recent years when so-called Community cooperation has proved worthless and ineffective, if not downright harmful."
"What use is the experience that has been gained by individual Member States in relation to civil protection if Europe is not then in a position to intervene immediately to manage emergencies, reduce damage, provide relief and coordinate volunteers?"
"Finally, we need to believe that, if there is one sector where the principle of territoriality does not hold, it is precisely that of civil protection."
"Have we learnt nothing from the unfortunate experience of the oil slick or this summer’s forest fires, or the terrible impression that was left when, faced with the tsunami tragedy, Brussels decided to leave the 300 European task force experts at home after having trained and prepared them for years?"
"Then let us put an end to the ambiguity of good intentions, Commissioner, and try to coordinate our interventions, powers and resources firmly and formally, so that Europe can also play a leading role when it is a case of protecting the right to life, which is a physiological right rather than an institutional one."
"This is an important debate, and it is important that we demonstrate solidarity with the citizens of countries that have become the victims of forest fires, especially the Spanish."
"I would nevertheless like to view the matter from a different angle, one which is connected to the distress caused in Finland this summer by widespread forest fires in Russia."
"In Russia, more than a million hectares of forest burned, and the worst fires occurred close to the Finnish border."
"When the wind blew from the east, large clouds of smoke came across into Finland."
"They did not just cause a bad smell, but posed a very serious health risk."
"One estimate by the Finnish National Public Health Institute puts the health costs incurred at tens of millions of euros, and, indirectly and in the worst case scenario, this will also lead to the death of some Finnish citizens."
"Russia must comply with international agreements, and Parliament should call on the Commission to take action and negotiate with Russia to ensure that it too adheres to these agreements, provides its neighbouring countries with sufficient information, is prepared to accept help and also takes adequate action itself."
"It so happened that when Finland’s Prime Minister offered Russia help, the latter did not even agree to accept it."
"Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue, and the Commission should therefore take action."
"– Mr President, this year's fires in the Mediterranean were the usual sad summer phenomenon."
"However, in certain countries, the inefficient way in which they were dealt with by the state mechanism was unprecedented."
"We must learn from our mistakes."
"Unfortunately in my country, Greece, preparations were for the first time in many years clearly inappropriate."
"Two areas of Greece, Halkidiki and Mani, suffered incalculable ecological and economic damage."
"It transpired that this happened in large part due to poor planning and coordination, resulting in approximately 50% of fire-fighting 'planes being immobilised."
"All this would perhaps be a Greek family matter, if the forests lost did not constitute a loss not only for the natural wealth of Greece or Spain or France, but also for the wealth of Europe as a whole."
"This being so, what causes particular surprise is that the Greek Government did not request – I repeat did not request – assistance from the European Union Monitoring and Information Centre, unlike the Spanish Government, which requested and received civil protection aid on 9 August, including fire-fighting 'planes."
"As many speakers rightly emphasised, Europe needs a common civil protection force straight away, as Parliament has repeatedly requested."
"What point is there in our endeavouring to create European civil protection mechanisms when some governments ignore them so flagrantly?"
"Similarly, the newly set up European Solidarity Fund must be ready to provide aid."
"I call from this tribune for the Commission to use the political considerations at its disposal to mobilise the necessary aid for the residents of the areas affected and for the Council to urgently align the rules for activating the Solidarity Fund with Parliament's proposals of 3 April 2006."
"In 2006, the European Commission presented its proposal for changing the existing Community civil protection mechanism."
"I had the honour of drafting the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, in which we proposed – and I would emphasise this – that prevention should be included in funding."
"Today this does not exist, it is not possible."
"Lastly, the Commission must exert its influence on the Member States, so that, at the very least, stricter legislation is introduced on changes of land use and reforestation after fires is mandatory."
"Mr President, accelerating climate change means that we are experiencing an ever greater number of freak weather conditions which cause great damage to the countryside, farming and our environment, in the broad sense of the word."
"Recent years have been marked by numerous natural disasters such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, hailstorms and even blizzards."
"We are all aware of and appreciate the efforts of MEPs and the entire European Parliament to establish a system for providing aid to those affected."
"It is unfortunate, however, that the European Commission has been rather slow in dealing with this matter."
"We often forget that the economic situation of those living in certain regions is affected not only by natural disasters but also the state of the economy and systems designed to foster regional development."
"In Poland, which has been affected by nearly every type of natural disaster imaginable this year, we have had slower development, considerably lower levels of agricultural subsidies from the European Union, significantly lower production quotas and reference yields."
"To this list of disasters we can also add the Russian embargo on Polish plant and animal products, dumping on the fruit and vegetable markets and a lack of adequate protection for Polish producers."
"In addition to all this, the region around Lublin, which is one of the poorest regions in Poland and the European Union, has also recently experienced drought, hurricanes, hailstorms and flooding, which have caused serious damage to commercial buildings and housing."
"Entire homesteads have been destroyed or damaged and the hailstorms have almost entirely wiped out the already meagre harvest."
"Polish farmers are weeping but nothing seems to be happening in the European Union."
"I think it is high time the European Commission drew up an effective means of combating the effects of natural disasters and providing aid to the people, families and regions affected by these disasters."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to start by expressing my solidarity with our friends in Spain, Greece, Italy and other countries who have suffered from these forest fires, and by sparing a thought, of course, for the victims, because these fires are both ecological and human tragedies."
"However, there are many things that disgust me."
"When will we stop having to talk, each September, about the forest fires that occurred over the summer?"
"We have been doing this for years, and nothing has changed."
"Parliament has already adopted provisions instituting European coordination regarding civil protection."
"That shows real urgency."
"It is slowly coming into place, but it is quite clear that things need to improve."
"I am disgusted because these disasters, although they are called natural, are not natural at all."
"These fires are deliberate, or due to negligence, and we must condemn that."
"The European Union cannot and must not act in the place of the Member States: they must do everything possible to avoid land speculation."
"They need political courage to implement real territorial planning policies that will conserve our natural spaces and the diversity necessary for the ecological balance of the planet."
"We want to emphasise prevention, in order to have less to repair."
"Europe’s role is to set common objectives for good forest management, with a certain degree of flexibility, because the Mediterranean forest is not the same as the Scandinavian forest and, if climate change makes one region drier, it will, unfortunately, cause floods elsewhere."
"It is our farmers who will suffer most, particularly in these cases."
"It is true that Europe must support the pro-active policies of the Member States and fund the action taken to reach the objectives."
"It must also encourage forest owners to diversify species, to provide firebreaks and to maintain the undergrowth, through programmes such as Forest Focus, Life+ and so on, but the most important thing is that we must not create an umpteenth European body."
"Public money is not intended to finance bureaucracy, but to respond effectively to the people’s expectations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by sending a message of condolence from the European Parliament to the families of those killed and of solidarity with the victims and inhabitants of all of the regions of the European Union in which there have been fires and floods this summer."
"The fires in Galicia had to be extinguished under extreme conditions, conditions marked by the figure ‘30’: the temperature was above 30° for many days, there was a wind of more than 30 kilometres per hour and humidity was less than 30%."
"They were extinguished thanks to an unprecedented mobilisation, under the Presidency of the autonomous government, and national and international cooperation was a decisive factor."
"I would therefore like to express my gratitude for the support of the European Union and its Member States."
"There is still much work to be done and we must continue working together in three directions. In order to help those who have suffered damage, the Galician authorities have set an example by providing EUR 13 million for the most serious damage; the Spanish Government’s programme will provide between EUR 40 and 60 million."
"The European funds from the Solidarity Fund must be added, as Mrs Miguélez has pointed out."
"The Galician authorities have already launched a plan to the tune of EUR 126 million until 2009 for the restoration of the environment and also for progressing towards appropriate forestry development, and other Community funds must be opened up and mobilised for the same purpose."
"Fires are the main threat to European and Mediterranean forests and, as Galicians, we are very vulnerable."
"I would call upon the Commission to draw up a proposal for a directive to combat fires, to implement a Community programme for 2007-2013, to activate the Galileo system and the technological resources for the detection and fighting of fires, and to strengthen civil protection through the creation of a European civil protection force."
"– Mr President, for more than a decade we have hardly seen a year without a drought."
"As a consequence of these droughts, we have also experienced huge fires or, in contrast, sudden and prolonged downpours that have caused equally sudden floods."
"All these phenomena are increasing in scale and causing a great deal of damage, particularly to the agricultural sector."
"It happened in 2005 in Spain and Portugal, and it happened this year in Bulgaria, Romania, Poland and Greece."
"Over the last two years, the European Parliament has adopted as many as three resolutions on the droughts in Portugal and Spain and on the effects of the natural disasters on the agricultural sector."
"Unfortunately, in spite of numerous debates in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted, the involvement of the European Institutions seems to have had no positive impact."
"Furthermore, the European Commission suggests that the funds for dealing with natural disasters should, first and foremost, come from the Member States."
"Be this as it may, the scale of the damage exceeds the financial resources of individual countries."
"There have also been suggestions that these kinds of events should be covered by insurance, and that insurance companies should pay for the damage."
"However, we should remember that natural disasters are becoming increasingly common and are so destructive that insurance companies are refusing to insure against these kinds of events."
"We therefore need to draw up a compensation system at European Union level which can be applied very quickly after damage is caused."
"The European Union should show solidarity in the face of ..."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, extreme natural occurrences are becoming more frequent, and so it is a good thing that the Community has the means to deal with them on the basis of solidarity."
"The Disaster Relief Fund will be able to give help in Spain and Greece in particular, but also in other countries."
"That aid must be as unbureaucratic as possible."
"What these regions need is European solidarity, and we have the means to help them."
"The fact is, though, that Europe is not a suitable source of funds if fires are regularly started deliberately, and so, while I urge support for the victims, I also expect the Member States to call the arsonists to account and to punish them severely, particularly if their actions are motivated by land speculation, about which we hear every year with depressing regularity."
"However the damage was done, we must help now, and the forces deployed to deal with disaster situations must be subject to binding rules on their coordination, at least in the states that want that."
"Whether, however, Europe should apply its precious financial resources to rural development or even to cross-border cooperation in preventing and fighting forest fires, is another question; while I realise that a number of delegations are calling for this, I do not regard the prevention of forest fires and the creation of firebreaks as a specifically European task."
"If the Member States affected want to use EU funds for that purpose, then they should be allowed to do so."
"Commissioner Dimas described the various options, including Life+, but please can these be kept within their national financial frameworks, and not take anything away from the protection of the environment in other countries?"
"Moreover, they should be used only in response to current emergency situations, and not as functions of the future European structural and agricultural policy."
"– Commissioner, yet again this summer the forest wealth of the Mediterranean was consumed by fire."
"In my country, Greece, over 150 000 decares of forest were burnt."
"The fires caused a chain reaction, with huge consequences both for the ecosystem and the economy and for tourism, agriculture, livestock farming and beekeeping."
"The risk of floods is such that there is an urgent need to protect local forests and to use every means to prevent them from being appropriated for building."
"Whilst welcoming the initiative for a European Parliament resolution on fighting forest fires, I wish to emphasise that this sort of issue, which affects almost all the countries of southern Europe every summer, requires serious preparation and responsible action by all the agencies involved."
"Obviously the fire brigades need to deal with the consequences of this phenomenon, which is why I wish to emphasise the need for the European Union to support the areas affected."
"However, that is not enough."
"The major issue is still prevention, not merely extinguishing the fire and its consequences."
"Timely action, proper preparation, adequate equipment, experienced human resources on standby and direct and proper action on the part of the governments responsible are needed on what is a burning issue for European citizens."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the fires in Galicia this summer have been put out badly and late."
"The result has been a disaster."
"According to Commission sources in the middle of August – and I would be grateful if the Commissioner could give me a more up-to-date figure today – 88 473 hectares have been burnt, not including burnt areas of less than 50 hectares, of which there are many in Galicia, where farms are small, and the total burnt area is therefore well over 100 000 hectares, which is equivalent to 80% of the total area burnt in Spain and half of the entire area burnt in Europe."
"Four fatalities, 514 injured, 35 villages evacuated, the main communication routes cut, many animals killed and seriously injured: in short, a real tragedy, an unprecedented environmental and human disaster, with immeasurable economic and social consequences."
"Unquestionably Galicia’s worst environmental disaster."
"The disaster, which has been mentioned here, did not lead to any human victims and Galicia recovered quickly, as a result of the rapid action of marine regeneration, but this latest tragedy has left us with human victims and burnt areas that all the experts say will take 20, 30 or perhaps even more years to recover."
"How will it affect the climate, biodiversity, underground aquifers and the Natura 2000 areas that have been devastated?"
"Commissioner, what has failed this year in Galicia?"
"Do you know?"
"Do you believe that the fire can be said to have been tackled effectively in Galicia?"
"You have told us here that the Spanish authorities asked for assistance and the European Union quickly responded."
"Could you tell us the date when it was requested, as others have asked?"
"Could that cooperation have been improved?"
"Given the European dimension of this disaster, it falls to us in this Parliament to emphasise its magnitude and also to call for the resources necessary and assistance available to alleviate its dramatic short-, medium- and long-term consequences and to cooperate so that we can find out what has failed, in order to stop it happening again."
"To this end, we would ask for the urgent mobilisation of the European Union’s Solidarity Fund for Galicia, which has been devastated by fire and which is facing a very serious ecological, economic and social situation."
"– Every year fires consume a significant proportion of Europe’s forests."
"This year has sadly been no exception."
"With climate change and global warming, the portents are not good."
"Natural disasters cannot be avoided, yet precautions can be taken right now by complying with the Kyoto Protocol and by setting out an appropriate forestry policy."
"In Portugal 420 000 hectares were burnt in 2003, and 320 000 in 2005."
"This year, by the end of August 59 000 hectares had been burnt, which is terrible, not least because protected areas have been burnt and there have been victims to mourn."
"It should also be acknowledged, however, that major efforts have been undertaken and enormous investment made in prevention and on-the-spot firefighting; a permanent monitoring system has been put in place involving the security forces, the armed forces and many young people; helicopter brigades have been set up to fight the fires during their first minutes; and there have been days on which more than 500 fires have been detected."
"There has been major investment in the training of firefighters and in the creation of professional forest firefighting teams, and I should like to pay tribute to their dedication and hard work."
"In Portugal and in other countries great efforts have been made, but more needs to be done. The Commission must adopt the proposals put forward by Parliament."
"– Mr President, this summer there have again been numerous fires in several countries of southern Europe."
"They have been especially devastating in Spain, particularly in Galicia."
"This year in Galicia, the fires exposed the inefficiency and lack of planning of the regional government."
"This very much exacerbated the consequences of the disaster: 4 fatalities, more than 500 wounded, more than 100 000 hectares burnt, 4% of Galicia’s wooded area burnt, serious environmental damage and, furthermore, serious repercussions for livestock farming, the tourism industry, etc."
"This black August has also caused deep alarm throughout Galician society: Cerdedo, Soutomaior, Ponte Caldelas, Pontevedra, Meis, Santiago, Padrón, Muros, Vimianzo, Avión and Quiroga are some of the many municipalities affected by the fires in Galicia this summer."
"The Galicians are a Europeanist people."
"They know that, as Goethe said, Europe was created on the road to Santiago de Compostela, and, as an Objective 1 region, Galicia is aware of the role that the Structural and Cohesion Funds have played in its development."
"I would also like to point out that, in Galicia, the number of ‘yes’ votes in last year’s referendum on the European Constitution was far higher than the average for the rest of Spain."
"Galicia is now expecting the European Union’s Solidarity Fund to be mobilised, which, furthermore, will help to improve the Union’s image."
"Nevertheless, more measures to prevent any repetition of this kind of disaster are needed."
"We must therefore make progress with the construction of a European civil protection system capable of responding quickly and effectively to the disasters that take place almost every summer and which affect the forests of southern Europe in particular."
"The European Union must also pay more attention to the continent’s forest wealth in terms of preventing fires."
"In this regard, I am not sure whether the coming dismantling of the Forest Focus programme within the Life + programme is good news."
"Furthermore, as this Parliament has said on many occasions, we need a European directive in the field of forest fires and drought."
"Neither Galicia, Spain nor Europe can resign themselves to the continued disappearance of our forests, as if that were their unavoidable fate."
"– Mr President, I am delighted to have with us today Commissioner Dimas, who is particularly sensitive to the question of natural disasters, given that this year fires swept through once again, especially in the countries of southern Europe."
"We note that the fires intensify every year, despite the fact that we have more and more aeroplanes available for putting them out. That is because we are changing – or rather we have changed – and we are downgrading the climate of the planet, thereby exacerbating the greenhouse effect."
"In my country, Greece, there was a truly huge disaster in Halkidiki and Mani."
"In Halkidiki, one of the most beautiful – perhaps the most beautiful – and one of the most important tourist destinations in Greece, 60 000 decares were burned, causing huge damage both to the environment and to tourism and farming."
"The victims need immediate compensation and the burnt areas need immediate – I repeat immediate – protection against the risk of the soil being washed away."
"Preventive measures for the future and a new fire policy need to be applied."
"We need to examine the possibility of replanting with trees that stop fires and which do not burn as easily as pine."
"Lastly, we need to examine again what sort of Europe we want."
"If we do not help our fellow sufferers now, then what sort of a Europe of solidarity are we talking about?"
"If we are not generous to those who have been destroyed, then we should not be surprised if the people soon stop following us."
"If we do not stand by the people who have been destroyed, then we shall lose their trust and such a Europe certainly has no future."
"We need to examine the issue beyond the question of the fires."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today, I myself was hemmed in by flames while on holiday in Halkidiki, and saw two thousand people gasping for breath."
"In such a situation, one wonders what could have been done better beforehand."
"First of all, of course, I want to thank the emergency services, who did their utmost with promptness and speed, but I also want to thank the Greek Government for organising everything so very well, and with the help of the Greek Navy, for managing to save over a thousand lives."
"What I regard as vital in a case such as this is an improvement in communications facilities."
"I can remember trying to dial 112 – the emergency number."
"When one is in a state of panic, numbers get confused, so it would certainly be a good idea to automate this to some extent."
"I also think it important that we in Europe should set up a civil protection force, the primary function of which would be to resolve the problems arising in disaster situations of this kind, and which would be able to try to get the situation under control as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"Such a strategy for natural disasters is a core challenge."
"If there is to be cooperation not only between the armed forces, the rescue services, the fire brigade and the police, but also between all the bodies with responsibility in such situations, they need a suitable communications platform in order to be able to help each other rapidly and effectively."
"Something else of importance would be a European observatory to make information available."
"I had to telephone, from Greece, the APA press service in Austria in order to find out the actual extent of the disaster."
"It was very interesting to see that the Austrian office very quickly got in touch with the Greeks, and it was this that enabled the Navy to save many people’s lives."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their very positive contributions to tonight’s discussion."
"A very wide and rich range of issues was raised, from trans-boundary pollution – fires in Russia, which should of course be raised in the framework of EU-Russia cooperation – to stricter criminal laws regarding arson and arsonists, which lie within the exclusive competence of the Member States."
"The European Union mechanism for civil protection is a relatively new instrument with limited resources, limited means and competences, but recent experience shows that it works: it is a real example of European Union added value."
"Having said this, when dealing with natural disasters there is no room for complacency and it is clear that our prevention, preparedness and response activities can still be improved."
"This is why earlier this year the Commission prepared a legislative proposal to reinforce the mechanism both politically and operationally."
"For example, the proposal will allow for the mobilisation of extra transport equipment and will provide a platform upon which to contribute to the development of early warning systems."
"In April 2005, the Commission also presented a proposal for a Council regulation establishing a rapid response and preparedness instrument for major emergencies."
"One part of this proposal provides the legal framework for the future financing of civil protection operations and will result in a budget of EUR 119 million over a seven-year period."
"This is an improvement on previous levels of funding but, as I have mentioned many times before, the Commission can only respond to the ambitious requests made by other institutions if sufficient resources are made available."
"Mrs Estrela, we have an ancient proverb, δεί δή χρημάτων – money is needed."
"Otherwise, we cannot deliver more!"
"Both these instruments are currently being negotiated by the Council."
"The Commission would like to have them adopted by the end of the year once Parliament’s opinion is available."
"I would also like to offer specific thanks for Parliament’s initiative to earmark an additional EUR 6.5 million in the civil protection budget for 2006."
"This has allowed the Commission to launch an initiative to design, develop and test European approaches to joint civil protection intervention."
"This cooperation and coordination will make our fight against natural disasters – such as the floods in several European countries, or the summer forest fires in Spain, for which assistance was requested by the Spanish authorities on 9 August – even more effective."
"On the specific question of forest fires, which was raised by a number of Members, it is necessary to note as I have before that forestry matters are a Member State competence."
"Member States are responsible for launching actions to protect forests threatened by fire, as well as restoration efforts."
"The main aim of the measures we take at European Union level is to reinforce the Member States’ policies."
"These measures include the possibility of financial support available under the new Rural Development Regulation, the Forest Focus Regulation and, from 2007, the Commission’s proposal for LIFE Plus, which explicitly provides for the possibility of financing forest monitoring programmes and forest fire prevention activities in order to continue the work of the Forest Forum."
"Let us look towards the future."
"The Commission is preparing a study to look at the effectiveness of Community measures for forest protection and at options to improve the effectiveness of these measures."
"The results of these analyses are expected by the end of 2007."
"The Commission has proposed a directive under the codecision procedure on the assessment and management of floods, which I hope will be adopted soon."
"The Commission has also undertaken preparatory work with regard to the threat of droughts, which become more intensive and frequent each year, particularly, but not only, in the southern parts of Europe."
"We are engaged in discussions with the Member States to collect information and to assess whether similar legislative action is needed."
"Quite a few speakers referred to the Council regulation establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund, which does not allow the Commission to mobilise the fund on its own initiative."
"It is necessary for the Member State concerned to make an application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage."
"To date, no such application has been received from the Spanish Government."
"The possibility of financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund depends on whether the criteria in the regulation for mobilising the fund are met."
"The rules governing this instrument allow for the possibility of assistance in the event of major natural disasters."
"To qualify for aid, the estimated cost of total direct damage must exceed EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices, or 0.6% of gross national income of the state in question, whichever is lower."
"The Solidarity Fund is not designed to support general longer-term prevention measures for the rehabilitation of agricultural production potential."
"In such cases, other potential sources of funding exist at Community level, including projects co-financed by the structural funds."
"In addition, several possibilities of response to national disaster exist within the common agricultural policy."
"In 2006, the Commission’s civil protection mechanism responded to floods, earthquakes, forest fires, marine pollution and emergencies with a humanitarian dimension."
"Four European countries requested assistance in the spring floods, even though a greater number were eventually affected."
"We sent experts to all sorts of situations, from coordinating the European effort in Cyprus and Lebanon to assisting the Indonesian authorities in the aftermath of the earthquake and the eruption of a volcano."
"We sent emergency supplies such as medicines, medical supplies, food and shelter."
"We dispatched equipment to pump water and to extinguish fires."
"With your support we shall continue to better prepare ourselves and to improve our response for the benefit of the Member States and those we seek to help."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"The next item is a Commission statement on the situation in DR Congo."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is obviously a pleasure for me to find myself back here today before this Parliament in order to discuss a country that is particularly dear to my heart – the Democratic Republic of Congo – and, more specifically, in order to discuss the electoral process that is currently under way there."
"You will recall that, after the Lusaka ceasefire agreements were signed in July 1999, the European Union and the European Commission worked tirelessly alongside Congo not only to restore peace and stability there, but also to restore peace and stability throughout the Great Lakes region."
"It is with a certain pride, I believe, that we can say today that the peace and democracy process in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the rare cases in which the European Union has been able to show itself to be a real political player by deploying all of its external policy instruments."
"It is worth pointing out, in this regard, the increased importance of development cooperation in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, which had been suspended for more than a decade, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the European Security and Defence Policy, the appointment of a special envoy and the only military operations conducted outside Europe: Artemis in 2003, in order to bring peace to Ituri, and now EUFOR, in order to directly support a United Nations peacekeeping mission and an election observation mission led by your fellow Member, General Morillon, and in which a good number of you have participated."
"I am delighted that so many diplomatic and financial efforts should have finally led to a first round ballot of the presidential election and the legislative elections being held on 30 July."
"This first brush with democracy, after more than 40 years, occurred under what can be described as model conditions, given the overall situation in the country."
"The election observation mission was able to observe first hand the objective difficulties that the country and its population are experiencing."
"In spite of these difficulties and the disturbances that took place in the wake of the provisional publication of the first round presidential election results, this is an important result, with which we can only be satisfied."
"I can assure you that, throughout this process, the task has not been easy for anyone, and especially not for the people of Congo and their leaders, who have inherited a country that has been divided and rocked by years of war."
"A country in which 30 years of poor governance and corruption have destroyed the institutional capacities of the rule of law, irreparably damaged the basic infrastructure and profoundly altered the socio-economic fabric and social organisation."
"These elections represent a unique opportunity to draw a line once and for all under the bad practices of the past, which have led the country into bankruptcy, plunged it into the depths of war and dragged it into the vicious circle of under-development and poverty."
"Congo possesses considerable natural resources, occupies a strategic position at the crossroads of Central Africa, and has high-quality human resources;"
"I firmly believe that Congo will be called upon one day to play a major role in the stabilisation and development of the whole of Africa if good governance, the rule of law, human rights and the key elements to which Congo has subscribed by ratifying the Cotonou Agreement are fully respected in there."
"Thanks to the work done thus far, there is now an opportunity to really lay new institutional and administrative foundations in the country and to embark upon – and I am by no means exaggerating here – a radical reform of the State."
"It is not the interest of a few individuals that is at stake here, but clearly that of the whole of Congo and its population, and we, the European Union, have a moral obligation to respond in an effective and clear-sighted manner to this requirement that the people of Congo are voicing out loud."
"The deplorable events that, on 20, 21 and 22 August, followed the provisional publication of the results, have not, in my opinion, done anything to taint the symbolic value of this major act in the history of Congo."
"Through their massive turnout at the elections and their model behaviour, the people of Congo have taught their leaders and their politicians a great and fine lesson in democracy and good citizenship, one that cannot go without being mentioned."
"With the second round of the presidential election, scheduled for 29 October 2006, in prospect, the two presidential candidates must therefore be called on by all possible means to submit to the verdict of the ballot boxes and, above all, to respect the results unconditionally."
"In this connection, I also wanted to point out the importance, which has often been overlooked until now, of the results of the legislative elections. These results will determine the majority in parliament, from which the prime minister and future government will have to derive."
"Indeed, the new Constitution provides the country with the institutional structure of a modern country in which the separation of powers guarantees a balance of forces and in which the government is called upon to be accountable to its citizens by regularly submitting to elections."
"In spite of the difficulties over the last few days, the aim of the European Union’s action in DRC can only be to make a success of a transitional process that must hinge on the establishment of new authorities and institutions on the basis of the results that will come from the ballot boxes, in line with the international standards of transparency and reliability in electoral matters."
"It is clear that the situation remains tense and that this tension is liable to mount further as the election campaign and the date of 29 October, which has been set for the second round, draw near."
"It is therefore vital that the international community continues closely and constantly to monitor the situation on the ground."
"In this connection, I am convinced that MONUC and EUFOR and the people of Congo will be able to do a great deal to help prevent outbursts and acts of violence in Kinshasa."
"Faced with these objective difficulties, some early, encouraging signs are reaching us from the ground."
"Under the auspices of the United Nations, a joint committee on the Kinshasa events has just been put in place; it will be divided into two sub-committees, an independent investigation sub-committee, which will be in charge of establishing the facts about the events of 20, 21 and 22 August in Kinshasa, and a sub-committee that will have the task of defining the codes of conduct necessary for the election campaign, ahead of the second round of the presidential election and post-election period, to go off peacefully, in accordance with the will of the Congolese people."
"The two parties have also promised to cooperate fully with the independent investigation committee and have committed themselves to working in favour of the electoral process, in accordance with the global and inclusive agreement, signed in Pretoria."
"To this end, the two sub-committees began their work on 30 August 2006."
"On the other hand, it is important for the other African players, particularly the African Union and South Africa, to commit themselves to taking a leading role in the actions aimed at bringing President Kabila and Vice-President Bemba closer together, in the common interest of the nation."
"As regards the European Commission, I am pleased to inform you that I have just agreed to the request put to us by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to help in covering the USD 46 million financial gap in the electoral process by contributing an additional EUR 16 million; the Community’s total contribution to the electoral process will therefore increase to EUR 165 million."
"I can also confirm to you that the election observation mission, placed under the control of General Morillon, will continue to monitor the progress of the electoral process, in this interim period, until its conclusion."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, responsibility for Commissioner Michel’s statement lies with him himself and with the Commission; he alone bears responsibility for a statement he made some time ago in an interview."
"The Committee on Development discussed this with the Commissioner a week ago, and as far as I am concerned that lays the matter to rest."
"There is one lesson, though, that we must learn from what has happened, and it is that what is said in this House on the subject of the Congo may well not always be listened to here, but a very great deal of attention will be paid to it there, as we have been obliged – painfully – to learn."
"Let every one of us, then, be careful in what we say in our contributions to this debate."
"This very evening, the results of the parliamentary elections and the outcome of the scrutiny by the Supreme Court are expected."
"That is the moment at which the first round of the presidential election can be regarded as over."
"Even though it is fundamentally improper that we should be debating the Congo at this point in time, let us, here in this House, congratulate the Congolese people and its independent electoral commission, whose dedicated work, patience and tenacity have made this first electoral round a success."
"Let us hope, for our own sake and for that of the Congolese people, that the first national assembly to be elected for forty years may be able to convene and commence its work."
"It will help to stabilise the country."
"It will be for us an important partner in dialogue."
"Let us play our part in preparing the provincial elections;"
"Europe and its Member States must play an effective supportive role, not only in the electoral process from beginning to end, but also in the subsequent period of reconstruction."
"As Mr Morillon will confirm, the EU’s election monitoring commission is staying put, and the UN is making its own considerable contribution."
"MONUC and EUFOR have found their roles and enjoy respect, and we MEPs will observe the forthcoming round of elections."
"It is cause for hope that the Congo has such a considerable potential as a democracy, but the process of democratisation is under threat from agile forces with which we are familiar, and on which we need to exert influence."
"Let us then persuade them that it is in their interest too that peaceful democratic elections should meet with success, and that the authority of a legitimate state should come into being; that is the only chance for the Congo and its people."
". – I took part in Parliament’s Electoral Observation Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo."
"I visited more than 40 polling stations in various parts of Kinshasa and I had the opportunity to observe the work of one of these polling stations in Dima, just one of the 250 000-plus around the country, until the last vote had been counted."
"I admired the patient dedication of the Congolese people – men and women, people working in polling stations and voters."
"They all said to me, with moving seriousness, that the authenticity of the people’s choice – the choice of the 25 million-plus registered voters in a logistical operation of epic proportions – would depend on their commitment and vigilance in carrying out their electoral duties and that, in turn, peace, democracy and the country’s development would depend on that choice."
"This operation, and indeed the entire transitional process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2003, could not have come this far were it not for the European Union."
"The election should therefore be a source of pride not only for the Congolese people, but also for Europe, which provided 80% of the funding for the presidential and legislative elections, with the European Commission contributing EUR 165 million."
"The EU’s involvement in the DRC since the terrible war that devastated the country has been the best example of the implementation on the ground of Europe's security doctrine: humanitarian and development aid, technical support for demobilising and disarming militias, the maintenance of the political process and use of the instruments of European security and defence policy, with any additional resources used coherently to achieve a single goal, namely a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Congo, in control of its resources for the people’s benefit."
"As regards EUFOR, the European military force which, since the 30 July election, has played a key role in reducing tensions between the forces of the two presidential candidates, Mr Kabila and Mr Bemba, consideration should be given to the idea of extending its tour of duty until the new government takes office towards the end of January, in order to guarantee that the electoral process is carried through to a successful conclusion."
"It would be a serious mistake to leave the job only half done, because the transitional process remains poised on a knife-edge."
"The fighting in the capital in August between the presidential guard and Mr Bemba's militias demonstrates that the main political actors are still prepared to resort to armed violence."
"It also shows up the inability to form a unified national army, which has perhaps been the biggest and most dangerous failure in the transition process."
"According to the International Crisis Group, the task of integrating the armed forces has been only half completed."
"It is not only Azarias Ruberwa and Jean-Pierre Bemba who retain private armies."
"President Kabila himself has failed to submit his presidential guard to the process, and it was his forces who set off the armed hostilities that took place in August."
"Whatever the result of the election, the international community’s priority should be to demobilise the militias and help set up a single Congolese army viewed by the Congolese people as a force for stability and democratic authority."
"Right now, however, it is not Congolese or European weapons that will guarantee the ultimate success of the electoral process."
"That will primarily depend on Congolese men and women, such as the independent candidate for Parliament, Eve Bazaiba Masudi, member of the Kafko NGO, which is made up of women fighting courageously for peace, democracy and human rights, in close coordination with MONUC, the United Nations Mission in the DRC."
"Eve Bazaiba Masudi and other women representing Congolese civil society are seeking to mediate and to hold the warlords to account."
"These women deserve the EU’s support, and I trust that the Commission’s delegation and the committee chaired by General Morillon, whose outstanding work thus far I wish to commend, can support these people who are bringing peace and dialogue."
". – Mr President, as head of the European Union election observation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I have stayed in that country on many occasions, Commissioner, since the Commission entrusted me with the responsibility for the mission in October."
"An entire book could be written on the exceptional adventure embarked upon by the people of Congo in order to provide themselves with democratic institutions with the help of the international community and of the European Union, in particular."
"I shall confine my speech this evening to some comments about the new stage that was reached on this road on Sunday 30 July, during the first round of the presidential elections, which coincided with the legislative elections."
"Just after that first round, I had the satisfaction, on 1 August, of signing, together with my counterparts from throughout the world, from the African Union, from the French-speaking community and from the Carter Foundation, a joint declaration that was basically designed to point out how impressed we were – and I quote – with the strong turnout of Congolese male and female voters and with the participation of the political party witnesses and the national observers in the election of 30 July."
"In congratulating the people of Congo for the calm and dignified atmosphere in which these elections took place, we were urging the candidates – and I quote again – to respect the choices of the Congolese people and to use legal means of redress in the event of a dispute."
"Finally, we were calling on them to develop the peace process observed and to make a lasting contribution on the road to national reconciliation and to the rebuilding of the country."
"This appeal was sadly not heard by the most diehard supporters of the two candidates who were well ahead in the first round and, shortly before the provisional results were announced, on Sunday 20 August, they began to confront each other in the very heart of the capital, before reaching the stage, late in the afternoon on the Monday, of fighting with heavy weapons around the residence of the senior vice-president, in which the members of the international transitional aid committee, chaired by the United Nations Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Bill Swing, were gathered."
"It was only thanks to the assistance of a security operation put in place by the general commanding the MONUC forces, with the support of the European-led forces of EUFOR, that the hostages were able to be set free and the madmen forced to return to their camp."
"I was therefore pleased to have championed in this Chamber the setting-up of that force and I felt proud – you are right, Commissioner – to be European, because it was the remarkably effective intervention of the European Union that enabled a swift return to calm."
"We should also once again congratulate the people of Kinshasa, who refused to let themselves be led into murdering and looting again, as they were being called on to do by the staunchest of those who remained opposed to any democratic revolution."
"The calm that has prevailed since then throughout the country may offer hope that those people will no longer cause any harm."
"It is up to us to demonstrate the greatest vigilance and to continue to use all of our political and, if need be, military, weight to put pressure on the two candidates that are still in contention until the second round of the presidential elections, scheduled for 29 October."
"Then, and in accordance with the Constitution, the power, Commissioner, will return to the people, by means of its elected parliament."
"That is what the people of Congo aspire to."
"That is what we must continue to help them achieve."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has committed itself financially and politically, with a great deal of determination, to the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and we can only be delighted at that."
"The same goes for the desire expressed by the Congolese people to finally be able to choose their leaders by themselves, and for Europe’s support in this area, provided that this support is perceived as being completely neutral, something that has posed problems recently."
"That being said, the situation remains very tense, and while it is clear that these elections seem to be necessary or urgent, after so many years of war, chaos and victims, they will not be enough to put right a country that still has serious problems, starting with extreme poverty and a high level of violence, which regularly undermine the efforts to establish the rule of law."
"Controlling the trafficking and trade in weapons, setting up an effective police force and judicial system and bringing the most serious criminals before the International Criminal Court are the requirements for consolidating peace."
"This situation of impunity has just as serious an effect on health issues."
"Besides the shortage of health care personnel to which Doctor Mukwege, who practises in the west of Congo, drew our attention in Brussels, in May, there are also the mass rapes and inhumane treatment inflicted on women that must be combated relentlessly. This must be done by also relying on the abilities of the local communities to organise themselves, to restore acceptable daily living conditions, and to denounce and punish acts of violence."
"Will the new elected leaders of DRC be able to put a stop to this violence?"
"It is justifiable to be worried, especially given the unrest that followed the announcement of the presidential election results, which do, however, still offer an opportunity to both of the candidates who finished first in the elections."
"In the event of serious unrest, what exactly would EUFOR’s mandate be?"
"Finally, the mineral and forestry resources in DRC are now the subject of shameless exploitation, whereby corruption more often than not goes hand in hand with a disastrous social and environmental impact."
"The answers that will be given, not only by the elected Congolese authorities, but also by the European Union’s political and economic partners, in relation to transparency, to the way in which profits are used, and to social and ecological conditions of exploitation, will be key to determining whether or not DRC is capable of taking action in favour of sustainable development."
"How do you see things in this area, Commissioner?"
"If one takes account of the events that took place in DRC, then to put in place a democratic and peaceful transition would constitute a strong sign of hope for the thousands of Africans who are now fleeing their countries in order to make a dash for Europe’s shores with the idea of thus escaping from the chaos and of ensuring their own survival."
"In any case, everything must be done to give the Democratic Republic of Congo and the millions of Congolese people, who have suffered so much and who have reacted with so much energy and vigour, their chance."
"."
"Mr President, I find it regrettable that it should be at this hour of the day that we are discussing this issue, which is a rather important one, and not least that we should be doing so at the same time as the Committee on Foreign Affairs is meeting and voting on Turkey at this very moment."
"The lamentable fact is that this is another indication of the ‘importance’ attached to this issue."
"Glad though I indeed am that these elections took place, I take a rather more sceptical view of them than do those who have already spoken."
"Although we are told that both the elections and the deployment of EUFOR were great successes, I think the European Union and Congo have narrowly escaped disaster."
"What if Kabila had been elected in the first round?"
"The situation would have been markedly worse than it is now."
"It is clear from the results and the campaign that these elections were not essentially about politics; they were to a considerable degree about regional allegiance in a Congo that is, in fact, divided between East and West."
"Many persons in positions of responsibility within the EU – and none more so than Commissioner Michel – displayed a bias in favour of Joseph Kabila."
"I would like – and here I am addressing Mr Schröder – to be able to say that this has sorted itself out, but, far from it, it had a great influence on what happened on the ground, and I would like to quote from a article, according to which: ‘The gross irresponsibility of Bemba’s campaign, which was characterised by ethnic nationalism and sometimes by racism, was at least equalled by that seen in the conduct of the Europeans, in particular that of the Development Commissioner Louis Michel, who, piquantly enough, is from Belgium."
"His manifest and public bias in favour of the previous incumbent, Kabila, prior to the elections at the end of July 2006 is something for which the people in the West of the country, and particularly those in the Bemba stronghold of Kinshasa, have never forgiven him’."
"I have to say to Commissioner Michel that the normal response to something like that would be to resign."
"As I have done before, I demand that you pay for actions by doing so."
"We also know, Commissioner, that a whole array of economic interests are at stake here."
"For example, George Forrest, a Belgian, invested USD 400 million in a copper mine in Kamato, and it seems likely – or this is what keeps on being said, at any rate – that he used this to make a considerable contribution in support of Mr Kabila’s campaign."
"The does not mince its words when it writes that Mr Kabila is making use of State resources and has received payments from foreign mining enterprises."
"I do not regard that as a good sign."
"All we can do now is to hope that the European Union really will play a neutral role."
"() Mr President, far more people have lost their lives during the war in DR Congo than in the hundred times more high-profile conflict in Iraq."
"Note that these losses have been estimated to amount to between 50 000 and 200 000 dead."
"However, according to UN statistics, around four million people have died during almost ten years of internal conflict in DR Congo."
"This is a tragic world record."
"From an economic point of view, DR Congo is a very important country for the world economy."
"It has no crude oil, unlike the Middle East, but it does have a raw material which is needed for the production of mobile phones: coltan."
"A resolution of the conflict in DR Congo is at hand."
"This is not thanks to a single superpower which desires to be the world’s policeman, but thanks to the UN international forces, which have often been mocked."
"The largest peacekeeping force in the history of the UN has been deployed in DR Congo."
"It consists of 17 500 young people."
"The elections in DR Congo have cost the international community 500 million dollars."
"This pales in comparison to the war in Iraq, which costs 177 million dollars just for one day."
"I think that the planned European Parliament mission will be a further step towards re-establishing order in a country which deserves to finally enjoy some peace."
"Finally, I would like to say that I do not agree with the proposal made by the previous speaker, Mr Pflüger, with reference to the dismissal of Commissioner Michel."
"It is far more entertaining to have Commissioner Michel here in this House."
"– () Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what happened in Kinshasa on 21 and 22 August showed clearly that the European Union was right to take the decision to send troops to help secure the elections in Congo, even though there had been many, in various of its Member States, who had expressed doubt as to the wisdom of this approach and as to whether the European Union and its forces really could make an effective contribution."
"Just now, Mr Morillon, to whom we must be grateful for the outstanding work he did as chief observer of the elections, once more confirmed that it would not have been possible for calm to be restored as speedily as it was had it not been for the deployment of troops – specifically Spanish and Polish troops – under European command, and I see that as the best indication of the rightness of that decision."
"We must, however, remain vigilant, not least in the immediately ensuing days and weeks."
"It is also significant that our activities in Congo should involve the civil and military powers, working closely together to manage the crisis."
"Commissioner Michel has just brought home to us in a powerful way what the European Union did in the past to stabilise the Congo; the securing of these elections is just one among many interventions."
"I am confident that the Commissioner, now that these elections are over, will continue to develop the plans that are needed if this country in the heart of Africa, which is important not least in terms of the security of Europe, is to be made even more stable."
"Mr President, it is unusual for this Parliament to debate an electoral process in the middle of that election taking place."
"However, there are a number of reasons why that is justified."
"Firstly, as colleagues have said, the three million deaths in five years; there are still one thousand people a day in the Congo dying from the indirect consequences of that war."
"Secondly, the electoral process to enable those former belligerents to join the democratic process remains fragile, as the three days of fighting in the Congo following the publication of the preliminary first-round results demonstrates."
"We should do everything as a Parliament to support the process of post-conflict reconciliation and democratic transformation."
"Thirdly, this is an electoral process where the EU is playing a central role, as Commissioner Michel has already explained: 80% of the cost of the election is being met by the European Union, the biggest ever EU electoral observation mission in Africa and all of it backed up by an EU military mission assisting our UN partners in providing the necessary protection to enable the election to take place in peace and stability."
"The electoral observation mission, ably led by our colleague General Morillon – whose work I commend – has made only a preliminary report and any political assessment this Parliament makes must similarly be guarded before drawing our own conclusions in this House."
"Yet, the Members of the European Parliament present did note the late publication of the voter rolls, the failure in many, if not most, cases for the candidate details to be posted outside the polling stations and the apparent sharp inequalities between the financial means available to different candidates and parties, together with legitimate questions as to how their money was raised."
"However, in terms of the technical conduct of the elections, I want to emphasise the incredible commitment to the process shown by the mainly young polling officials."
"In Lubumbashi, where I was based, they worked non-stop throughout the night, without electricity, fuel or water; a 22-hour count conducted in large part by candlelight and where the officials slept for a few minutes by rota in their determination to enable the process to be completed fairly and accurately."
"I have been taking part in elections since 1979. I have never seen an election like it."
"Finally, my colleague, Mr Schröder, has already made it quite clear that it was necessary to enable Commissioner Michel last week to answer on the record the questions raised with him, and that process has been completed."
"Tonight, I want to simply repeat my closing statement to the Commission last week and say that redoubled efforts should be made to insist on the European Union’s neutrality in this process and that the European observation mission must be specifically tasked with monitoring the allegations of bias made in the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
"I invite the Commissioner to join with his colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, to ensure that the results of this monitoring are fully evaluated, both for the second round of the elections in the Congo, and for the benefit of future European electoral missions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all observers, I was very impressed with the high turnout, the discipline and excellent organisation, a real feat in a country such as Congo, where both infrastructure and communication are lacking."
"The euphoria of the moment, however, should not blind us to certain developments that give less cause for optimism and more cause for disquiet."
"First of all, there were the extravagant and disproportionate election campaigns waged by a handful of big players, while other candidates did not even have the absolute minimum at their disposal."
"The large-scale misuse of government funds meant that the playing field could hardly be described as level."
"Only those with funds and a private militia were able, and allowed, to take part, which begs the question of where the money came from all of a sudden."
"Secondly, there was the very negative campaign from a certain corner of the opposition which put itself offside."
"The nationalistic, patriotic discourses of those men degenerated into language with genocide overtones, and it is regrettable that other candidates adopted it as well."
"Major frustration even led to the reproach that the international community and the EU were taking sides."
"This reproach intoxicated even those politicians, who, like Tintin, had only discovered Congo, and it makes no sense whatsoever: the truth is that there would probably never have been elections in Congo had it not been for Commissioner Michel’s unstinting efforts."
"Finally, there is the painful conclusion that Congo’s democratisation process remains very fragile."
"The events of 20 August have left a bitter aftertaste, along with the fear that a long campaign which has divided the country into West and East will, in the long term, fail to produce the stability that is hoped for."
"The Congolese people fortunately did not respond to the provocations."
"They are desperate for peace, and deserve better."
"Mr President, I was part of the Observation Mission, too, and the first-round polling day passed surprisingly smoothly, given the enormity of the task."
"As Mr Howitt said, the election agents were well trained and confident about what they were doing and showed great dedication."
"There were a few things that appeared not to be organised absolutely perfectly."
"For instance, there did not appear to be a coherent plan for dealing with the enormous volume of material disgorged into the compilation centres – some of it sensitive material, some of it not."
"It is important in the weeks up to the second round that as much is done as possible to tighten up on any procedural weaknesses, so that there can be no technical grounds for dispute at what will be a very sensitive moment."
"Secondly, we observers detected the perception in some quarters, as has been mentioned, that the EU was not neutral."
"It was an erroneous perception, but it could weaken the authority of the EU mission, which needs to be trusted by all sides."
"It could also potentially put EU election observers at risk."
"The EU needs to work hard in the weeks up to the second round to convince the Congolese of its neutrality."
"Nothing must be done that could be construed as favouring one presidential candidate over the other."
"Finally, I would stress – as did Mr Schröder – that no one must doubt how much this election matters."
"It matters for the Congolese, who have waited 40 years for democratic elections and who turned out in great numbers on 30 July, but it matters globally too."
"For example, there is a supposedly closed uranium mine in the south of the Congo from which uranium is still being mined and exported, probably to Iran."
"The world is not safe while there is an ungoverned hole in the heart of Africa."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thought at first that I would not reply to the speeches in which some doubts were expressed about my neutrality regarding the problems in the Congo."
"I shall reply, however, because the comments have occasionally been very excessive."
"Mr Pflüger, I would like to tell you that your conception of the law is, let us say, too hasty."
"In certain non-democratic countries, we still encounter these sorts of conceptions. I thought that we were safe from such conceptions as that in Europe, in any case, and especially in a Parliament as honourable as this one, which is, effectively, the guardian of democratic values such as the right to a defence, respect for proper information and objectivity based on extensive argument."
"I would like to be very clear regarding what has been said."
"Mr Pflüger, all the statements that I have been making for weeks, months and even years regarding my interest in the Congo seem to have escaped you - and without doubt this is because, like others too, you have not tried to deepen your understanding of the issue."
"Now, I have never sided either with one candidate or the other."
"I still maintain very regular telephone contact with President Kabila just as much as I do with Vice-President Bemba."
"During the events of the 20, 21 and 22 August I intervened personally in order to calm people down, as I believe General Morillon knows."
"I can therefore affirm that I am in personal contact with both candidates."
"For example, I can tell you that President Kabila reproaches us for not having reacted sufficiently when, in the course of the election campaign, candidates used arguments based on ethnicity or ‘being Congolese’ and made xenophobic statements."
"I must say as well that the strategy of certain candidates involving the denunciation of ‘the foreign candidate’ – this unfortunately forms part of certain practices - has evidently impressed the international community to such an extent that it has not reacted to what is obviously a worsening of the Congolese electoral debate, with argument based on ‘being Congolese’ or on one or other candidate belonging to the Congo."
"I mention all this in order to say that I utterly and completely reject the accusations of partiality that certain people have levelled at me."
"I could show you more than ten interviews I have given to European or Congolese newspapers that express my perfect neutrality."
"I have reproached President Kabila just as much as I have reproached Vice-President Bemba and other candidates on the electoral lists."
"Mr Van Hecke has had the intellectual honesty to be more thorough in the remarks he has made."
"Thus, several months ago I also spent a whole afternoon in the house of Mr Tshisekedi, urging him to get his supporters to register and even urging him to make use of his right to be a candidate because I thought, and I still think, that Mr Tshisekedi is a man of experience who knows the Congo well, a man with a programme that could have been revealed in order to improve the political debate."
"Taking into account what I have just said, Mr Pflüger, it is a little thoughtless to accuse me of being partial simply because one day during a broadcast, in response to the question ‘what does a candidate like Mr Kabila represent?’, I answered ‘the hope of the Congo.’"
"If I had been asked ‘what does a candidate like Mr Bemba represent?’, I would have answered ‘the hope of the Congo’, because all those who take part in an election represent the hope of their country, in this case above all because it was the first time that an election was being held."
"I therefore find your tunnel vision particularly excessive."
"You accuse me, for example – and if we were in the Belgian national Parliament I would have immediately reacted by appealing to the Rules of Procedure in order to respond to personal comments – of protecting Belgian economic interests."
"Which Belgian economic interests?"
"One of the serious problems facing the Congo is the lack of interest from foreign investors."
"Moreover, it is legitimate enough for any country, for any business to deem that it has the right to seek economic or commercial partnerships with any other country, on condition that it ensures that natural resources are respected, that it prevents these resources from being pillaged – this is what foreign forces have done for a very long time and what internal forces are still doing today – and on condition that it respects basic economic ethics, a factor that, unfortunately or fortunately, must be taken into account in the open world with which we are familiar."
"I therefore ask the question: which economic interests?"
"Today, the economic interests that I encounter in the Congo are Chinese, Indian, Israeli, American."
"This is not a reproach, not a critique, but I find few, very few European economic interests, Mr Pflüger."
"The truth has rights, and I must tell you that I would hope that European businesses would invest in a country like the Congo."
"It needs such investment."
"You made reference to a Belgian business that has developed in the copper sector. I suppose you are referring to the business owned by Mr Forrest."
"I cite this because it was pointed out that one of my sons was married to Mr Forrest’s daughter, that they were directors of Mr Forrest’s companies and that I was therefore related to Mr Forrest."
"In my life I have only met Mr Forrest three times for a few seconds, and I was in the company of a Belgian parliamentary delegation."
"Mr Forrest creates 630 jobs through his company; he creates hospitals and schools: a whole social system is developing there."
"I am not defending Mr Forrest personally;"
"I do not know if he is honest or not, I am simply observing."
"What I do know is that a Belgian journalist carried out an investigation on Mr Forrest and that he became a supporter of Mr Forrest, simply because he creates jobs."
"Out of the 630 people whom he employs in his business, there are 600 Congolese."
"I am not defending Mr Forrest, I do not know him well, I have met him three times in my life for a few seconds."
"I have therefore had enough of this sort of attack which – it has to be said – borders on nastiness and which I cannot let pass."
"I can assure you of one thing: I am completely impartial, I have contacts with everyone in the Congo and I am proud of having doubtless been one of the first - well before 1999, when I was still leader of the opposition in my country - to try to mobilise the international community to finally take an interest in this country."
"Why?"
"Simply because, as someone said in this House, there have been almost 4 million victims in Central Africa in ten years."
"This figure cannot be compared with those of other world conflicts."
"That is why I have always thought that it was my duty as a politician to concern myself with the Congo."
"That is true, Mr Pflüger."
"The second reason why I am so engaged in the Congo is that I am Belgian and thus, in a way, I feel inspired by a kind of historical memory."
"As a Belgian, it is not so much that I felt responsible, but rather I felt indebted to the Congolese population."
"It is thus true that I feel a particular attachment to the Congolese population, without doubt because I have this recollection of a certain collective bad conscience and because I still have this old conception of morality which consists of rereading the history of my country and of my people in an intellectually honest way."
"This is why, when I was the Foreign Affairs Minister, we visited the Rwandans to apologise. This is something that others have not done yet, and I regret this."
"This is the reason why, as regards the political assassination of Mr Lumumba for example, I also apologised in the name of my country to Mr Lumumba’s family."
"I do not therefore need a lesson in ethics, and you may organise all the investigations you wish into my activities."
"The same people who claimed that I was biased have also claimed that I was the owner of a diamond mine in the Congo, that I bought a villa on the river - in short, it is all gossip-mongering."
"The only excuse you have for such an excessive reaction - and this does not correspond with my definition of intellectual honesty - is that you do not, I think, know the Congo very well."
"Perhaps you have been to the Congo, perhaps not, I do not know, but in any case you have an image of the Congo partially distorted by the excesses of certain parties who use any old argument in the campaign."
"There is populism in the Congo too, it exists everywhere, it even exists in our countries. Sometimes it even exists in this Parliament, and I regret this."
"This is what I meant about neutrality: hearing a chorus of people repeating that the Commission is not neutral is ultimately tiresome."
"To the accusation: ‘you have not been neutral’, I reply: ‘we have been perfectly neutral’."
"Mr Kabila is annoyed with me because we did not denounce the excesses in the debate on ‘being Congolese’;"
"Mr Bemba is annoyed with me because, in my capacity as Foreign Affairs Minister and as Commissioner, I would meet President Kabila."
"When I go to the Congo, whom do you want me to speak to if not the head of state."
"Of course it was necessary for me to meet Mr Kabila."
"However, if there is one thing that proves my neutrality, it is that I have never been to the Congo, not once, without meeting Mr Kabila and the four Vice-Presidents who make up the presidential milieu."
"I have taken my sense of neutrality even further."
"I have systematically sought contact with Mr Tshisekedi."
"Somebody mentioned women; I have met representatives from the whole of civil society, I have met everyone."
"It is true that I am probably someone who has quite an important network of information in the Congo, and I pride myself on having been able to play a modest role in the transitional process."
"In this connection, people bore grudges against me because I supported the transitional process until the end, but there was no solution other than to support this process."
"Mr Tshisekedi and the UDPS, who denounced the transitional process, had signed the Pretoria Agreement, they had signed the Agreement underpinning the transitional process."
"Afterwards, I had the impression that this party chose the policy of making things worse, that it had decided that the transition was not going to succeed, so that an alternative was needed and that this was the best way to gain power."
"Personally, I can do nothing."
"I do not think I can be blamed for the fact that the party withdrew from a process that it had supported and to which it had signed up."
"I simply hoped that all the active political forces would participate in the election."
"Unfortunately this did not occur, and I regret this."
"This chapter is now closed."
"If I truly felt that I should resign, I would not wait for anyone to ask me."
"Perhaps I am a little old-fashioned in this respect."
"I still believe in political responsibility, but this sense of responsibility should work both ways: it should affect the person who has responsibility and the person who exposes the way in which that responsibility has been exercised."
"Now, if you criticise the way in which someone has exercised political responsibility, your criticism should be based on real points. You cannot just say anything."
"I am prepared to argue for a long time about this and I cannot accept the accusations made against me."
"These affect me deeply because, for years now, the basic intention underlying my political commitment has been, precisely, to try to help this fine country and fine people to escape from the poverty and confusion towards which – it has to be said - the international community has shown complete indifference, if not disdain."
"As for the army, I have noted what was said with great interest and I obviously agree for the most part with the various speeches that have been made."
"I agree with Mrs Gomes when she says that the reform of the army will be an extremely important point."
"More or less half of this reform has already been achieved."
"I would simply like to point out that it was necessary to reduce the army concerned, or rather the assemblage of different troops and militias amounting to roughly 330 000 soldiers – I do not know if you can imagine this - down to 100 000 men, also taking into account the fact that, for example, the process of demobilisation and reintegration attracted fake soldiers who joined in because they wanted to profit from this process."
"To reduce such an army is therefore much more easily said than done."
"It is easy to talk about but difficult to achieve, and a certain amount of time is required in order to carry out this process properly."
"I hope that the international community will continue with its commitment to aid the Congo and to reform its army."
"The same applies to the police."
"Substantial progress has, moreover, already been achieved."
"Mr Schröder, I agree with almost all of what you have said and I would also like to thank you for the balanced nature of your comments with respect to the aforementioned subject."
"Even so, when you say that we should not debate the Congo at the moment, I myself believe that we should debate it."
"I think that the second round can succeed if the international community tells both candidates unequivocally that they do not have the right to sabotage the second round because that would be to insult the Congolese people’s passion for democracy."
"The attitude of the Congolese, this people’s enthusiasm about its historic meeting with democracy has been beautiful to see and has been the best recompense for all the European Union’s efforts."
"I think we must talk about this."
"In fact, we must not stop repeating that the second round must not be a failure and that whoever is beaten must respect the result."
"Whoever is beaten will also have his role to play, and the winner will have to take this into account."
"This is my personal conviction."
"Perhaps people will again reproach me for exceeding the bounds of strict neutrality, but my personal conviction is that whoever wins must have the wisdom not to act as if the other candidate did not count or as if he represented nothing."
"That is the approach he will have to adopt in order to revive the Congo."
"This is my profound belief, and the leader of the opposition will also have his role to play."
"Without any sycophancy, I would to like to congratulate General Morillon for the way in which he has carried out the election observation mission up to now."
"I believe that he deserves a lot of credit: he has carried out his mission under extremely difficult conditions; with his considerable experience he has succeeded in seeing things in context when it has been necessary not to be absolutist, in being severe when it was necessary to be severe, and, in any case, in remaining rigorous and never straying from his course."
"I would genuinely like to thank him and to congratulate him."
"Mrs Aubert, you have asked me the following question, and with very good reason: ‘What do you plan to do?’"
"As I recall, this is the main point of your speech."
"The real response is based on what we have already debated in this House."
"I think that, more than ever, we must suggest and encourage projects of good governance in the Congo."
"You mentioned, for example, the correct and appropriate use of natural resources."
"We all know that the Congo is in fact a very rich country."
"It is creditworthy, as they say, it is a country that could ensure the prosperity and well-being of its population."
"The Congo has everything."
"In the first place, it has its people and extremely important human resources."
"In my view, what is needed is to recreate a genuine state, a state in the governmental sense of the word, with a working judiciary and administration, with people who are paid and who receive their salaries and with a working education system and a working health care system."
"I have spoken with both candidates and I have told them: rather than arguing about how Congolese you are and about all these subordinate issues which, at base, only concern your own personal interests, it would perhaps be more worthwhile to tell the Congolese how you plan to give them better access to education, justice, health, administration, culture and infrastructures; and also how you are, for example, to implement an embryonic social security system with the help of the international community."
"This is the real debate."
"I think that what I have just said corresponds very closely to the conclusion I wanted to offer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for having lost track of the time."
"I thought that it was important to set the record straight on a number of points and to specify my hopes concerning the second round of these elections."
"The debate is closed."
"The first item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the suspension of negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) by Enrique Barón Crespo, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade (O-0088/2006 – B6-0427/2006)."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 July, the Director-General of the WTO, Mr Pascal Lamy, announced, as a result of the meeting of the trade negotiations committee of the WTO in Geneva, the suspension of the Doha Round negotiations."
"I hope that this suspension is provisional and that the talks are not reduced to ashes, but rather that a phoenix can rise from them – as the Commissioner has said."
"This decision, which, provisionally, has put an end to five years of negotiations and more than seven years of diplomatic efforts, has led to great uncertainty within the multilateral framework of the WTO trade negotiations and, furthermore, it raises a problem with regard to an informal time limit, which is more political than chronological: the forthcoming expiry of the mandate of the Trade Promotion Authority, granted to the President by the United States Congress to allow him to negotiate in global terms."
"Mr President, I would say in passing that it is odd that for an organisation such as the WTO, which is an intergovernmental organisation and a ministerial conference, everything depends on a decision by a Parliament, the United States Congress, highly respectable though it is. The other Parliaments of the world, beginning with the European Parliament, also have the right to express an opinion, without imposing any kind of condition, or any guillotines, such as those currently being imposed by the United States Congress."
"In this regard, I would like to say that next week, in the governing committee of the parliamentary assembly that we have created between the European Parliament and the Interparliamentary Union, we will have the opportunity to discuss and work on this issue with representatives of the majority of the world’s Parliaments, because we believe that this is an issue that concerns all of us."
"We in Parliament, and specifically in the Committee on International Trade, have not waited until the holidays were over to express our concern."
"I did so, on behalf of that Committee, immediately after the announcement, pointing out that we cannot resign ourselves to a definitive failure of the negotiations."
"What we have to see is how we can move on from this crossroads and how we can put the process back on track."
"There have been a series of contacts and bilateral meetings during August and I hope that the Commissioner can tell us about any opportunities for progress."
"I also believe that the Commission must try to exploit its mandate as far as it possibly can, because we have responsibilities. Firstly, to defend our interests, but at the same time also to promote the principle that a multilateral system which benefits everybody, not just the developed countries, but also those countries that should be the main objective of the negotiation – the developing countries and, above all, the least-developed countries – can truly play a fundamental role, such as the one the European Union should play as the world’s leading commercial power."
"I therefore believe that it is important for the European Parliament to speak out and to support the possibility that we can continue with, put back on track and renew the objective of achieving a Doha Round for development and also to support the Commission – which has not had much of a holiday in this regard – which we hope can continue working to conclude this Round."
"There is still a margin for manoeuvre; there always is a margin in politics, though, chronologically speaking, the time limits are running out, and perhaps the need to act quickly can help."
"Mr President, we believe that the comments the Commissioner can make today are important and, above all, we want him to know that he can count on our concern, our support and our desire for this Round to once again become a process geared towards a more prosperous and cooperative humanity in the future."
"."
"Mr President, I certainly share the desire of the Chairman of the Committee on International Trade that this very regrettable development in the negotiations should be a temporary halt, rather than an indefinite suspension."
"I welcome the fact that he and other Members of this House are meeting other parliamentarians from WTO member countries to review this matter."
"The more we can gain a broad understanding of what is at stake and what the problems are, and the more we can spread that knowledge amongst the players in the various WTO countries – rather than keeping this knowledge to a very tightly-knit circle of negotiators – then the better off we will be."
"I will certainly pursue that objective when I visit Washington DC later this month to meet with leading figures on the Hill."
"The last time I discussed the Doha Development Agenda with some of the Members of this House was in Geneva in late June."
"First of all I would like to say how much I appreciated your presence there, your networking activities and the way in which you played an interesting and useful role among the negotiating parties."
"We will need your backing in the future in our efforts to convince our WTO partners to resume these negotiations, and I very strongly commend the approach taken by the Members of this House."
"At the end of the week I will travel to Rio de Janeiro at the invitation of the Government of Brazil and the G20 Group of developing countries."
"This will be the first chance to review at ministerial level what happened in Geneva in July, to discuss our respective positions and to assess the possibility of how and when we can move forward."
"In the weeks following the suspension, all sides have expressed a commitment to seeing the Round succeed."
"Nobody is saying, on the face of it at any rate, that they are no longer committed to it, and Doha certainly needs that level of commitment."
"In all our actions and statements we need to top up confidence in the Round and the process and to reassert the values of multilateralism and the economic benefits of a wide and ambitious deal."
"However, the rhetoric has to be matched with political leadership."
"What we are faced with is a lack of what one might call ‘realistic ambition’."
"All sides are exporting their domestic constraints into these negotiations."
"Perhaps that is inevitable, but it is not or should not be allowed to become an excuse for failure."
"Yet even in the most difficult and seemingly intractable areas of negotiation, the positions on agriculture are not that divergent."
"They are not so far apart that they are irreconcilable."
"They dictate that the EU lift its average tariff cut close to that requested by the G-20 developing countries."
"The EU signalled in Geneva that it was willing to negotiate on that as part of a balanced package – if others too are prepared to move forwards and show the same sort of flexibility we ourselves are demonstrating."
"If we are to move in the direction I have indicated we could, then in the right circumstances, this would represent a substantial shift from our original offer of a 39% average farm tariff cut, which is already much higher than the cuts accepted in the Uruguay Round."
"These would be the steepest farm tariff cuts ever accepted as part of a multilateral trade negotiation."
"Nobody could describe this as ‘Doha-light’."
"To these can be added the subsidy cuts flowing from EU reform, which would see EU producers withdraw dramatically from key global export markets such as milk and poultry, and the contraction of the EU grain market as demand for animal feed falls."
"If one puts all that together it amounts to a major new market access package for competitive agricultural exporters such as the United States, Australia and other members of the Cairns Group."
"It would potentially downsize European agriculture by up to USD 20 billion per year."
"To dismiss this as insignificant, as some have done, is either a crude negotiating posture or a failure to do the necessary maths."
"In return for those cuts, the EU is looking to the United States to match it in cutting trade-distorting farm subsidies, which the developing world now rightly regards as the condition and catalyst for any final Doha agreement."
"The United States has offered significant cuts in the so-called ‘amber box’ trade-distorting subsidies, from USD 19.1 billion down to USD 7.6 billion."
"This sounds good, and is to be welcomed."
"However, the United States has also proposed an increase in what it is allowed to spend in other categories of trade-distorting subsidy, while rejecting the idea of directly reforming those subsidy programmes so as to ensure that they no longer distort trade."
"If one adds together the three types of proposed trade-distorting support that the United States wants to keep, one actually arrives at a potential new ceiling of USD 22.7 billion, which is more than the United States currently spends."
"In other words, by the end of the Doha implementation period, US trade-distorting payments to farmers could actually go up as a result of what the US tabled in its offer last October."
"It is understandable that the US’s trading partners have found that unacceptable, especially given the sweeping cuts that the US is demanding from others, in terms both of subsidies and tariffs."
"Quite rightly, developing countries are insisting on an effective reduction in US subsidies, and the EU supports that."
"Unless there is a shift in the US position, advanced developing countries such as Brazil and India will not be prepared to offer greater access to their markets for industrial goods and services, and that is the crux of the eventual deal we are seeking."
"That deal will be hard to reach."
"I do not underestimate the difficulties that will arise in the negotiations we are yet to have with the advanced developing countries on industrial tariffs."
"However, it is the stand-off on agriculture, which represents only a fraction of trade for developing and developed countries alike, that is preventing the Doha negotiations from addressing trade in manufacturing and services, which is where the vast bulk of the potential economic gains from this round lie."
"We will only achieve closure on Doha if all the parties involved make the effort to sell an outcome on its merits across areas of the negotiations."
"These include not only agriculture and farm tariffs, but also manufacturing, services and rules."
"All sides should realise that a realistically ambitious and achievable outcome, far from being a ‘Doha-light’, would actually yield deep-seated structural changes in farm policies and create new trade flows in goods and services on a scale unmatched in any previous trade rounds."
"In other words, there is an awful lot already on the table, as Mr Lamy has repeatedly pointed out."
"What is being lost in a continued stalemate – let us be clear about this – is being lost first and foremost by developing countries."
"It is they who are losing new trade opportunities."
"Even more importantly, they risk losing out as a result of a weakening of the multilateral trading system."
"We on the EU side will try to do as much as we possibly can, in any scenario, for the weaker and more vulnerable developing countries, without seeking to divide the WTO membership."
"In particular, we will keep our promises on Aid for Trade, and we will maintain our efforts."
"Some will ask how it is that suspension of the DDA will affect our broader trade policy stance."
"The answer is that our commitment to Doha will remain paramount."
"Nothing can replace the WTO."
"Firstly, it is based on equality and the rule of law, rather than on raw power."
"Secondly, some benefits can only be achieved in a multilateral context, such as new disciplines on farm or fishery subsidies, a new agreement on trade facilitation, new disciplines for anti-dumping tools and better and clearer rules on regional trade agreements."
"These are examples of areas where any number of bilateral agreements could not even begin to achieve the sort of improvement and strengthening of trade rules and the trade system that we are seeking."
"Thirdly, these are the only form of negotiations in which smaller developing countries can punch their collective political weight."
"Finally, the dispute settlement system itself is one of the cornerstones of the WTO system and a feature unique in international law."
"There is no doubt that any erosion of confidence in the multilateral trading system as a whole would in the long term also critically affect that dispute settlement system."
"Bilateral and regional deals are therefore not an alternative to multilateral negotiations, but rather an add-on and a complement that helps to address in greater depth a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, as well as establishing disciplines in areas in which WTO members have decided – at least for the time being – not to negotiate collectively within the multilateral system, be it in relation to competition rules, government procurement or the labour dimension."
"We are looking at several negotiations in this context."
"Some are already in progress, while others will be launched when the conditions are ripe."
"Mercosur, the GCC and Central America are in the first group and we are also looking at Ukraine, India, Korea and the ASEAN countries as potential partners for new initiatives."
"Let me conclude by saying that I and the Commission remain firmly committed to a successful outcome of the multilateral round and that I want to work closely with you in this House to achieve that goal."
"That remains my priority."
"The Commission will also shortly present soon two communications – one in October on external aspects of our competitiveness in Europe, and one on trade relations with China."
"These will tackle other key issues of our future trade policy."
"I am keen to discuss both of these with you in the coming weeks, and look forward to doing so."
"As a team I believe we should continue to work together in the future as well as we have done in the past – for Europe’s sake, but also for the benefit of the global economy and in particular for the most needy developing countries."
". – Mr President, there can be no doubt that the costs of the failure of the Doha Round negotiations are high and will increase in the event of a definitive breakdown."
"These costs arise, :"
"Firstly, from lost earnings to the global economy, development and employment, earnings which the successful completion of negotiations would have generated."
"Secondly, from the undermining of progress in certain sectors of activity which are especially important to developing countries."
"Thirdly, from the weakened credibility of the World Trade Organisation itself."
"I believe that the danger in the event of a total failure far outweighs the danger of achieving an albeit less ambitious overall agreement, although an agreement cannot be accepted at any cost to the Union."
"The European Union maintained a constructive and responsible position."
"It tabled noteworthy proposals and abandoned many of its objectives right from the start of the round."
"Consequently, any return to the negotiating table depends on flexibility on the part of other leading trade partners if we are to envisage a balanced result."
"We, as the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, continue to advocate multilateralism."
"The commitment to a multilateral trade system makes a decisive contribution towards security, transparency and the stability of international trade."
"It also helps to disseminate enhanced economic interdependence across international political cooperation."
"The breakdown of multilateralism contains within it the danger of sectoral trade conflicts and the revival of regional trade strongholds."
"Consequently, the successful completion of multilateral trade negotiations should remain – as the Commission and the chairman of our committee emphasised – the supreme choice, the supreme priority on the Union's agenda."
"At the same time, we must strengthen supplementary strategies of bilateral and cross-regional relations with other important partners."
"The stability of the global trade system calls, in my opinion, for new dynamic impetus to the link between commercial interdependence and joint responsibility between the European Union and the United States of America and this link between interdependence and joint responsibility must be verified."
"With Mr Barón Crespo before me and his country's victory over Greece in the World Basketball Championship in mind, I would suggest that we look on the outcome of these negotiations so far as time out rather than a definitive breakdown."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the suspensions of the Doha Round negotiations is first and foremost the breaking of a promise to adjust the balance of trade rules to benefit developing countries."
"It represents a triumph of the narrow interests of some countries over the broader interest of the international community and, like the chairman of the Committee on International Trade, we are all, of course, thinking about the mid-term elections due to take place in the United States."
"The suspension already potentially threatens the multilateral system as the main framework of trade negotiations and a return to more imbalanced bilateral negotiations that will act to the detriment of the poorest, and in particular the smallest, countries, as you pointed out, Mr Mandelson."
"Furthermore, it will leave the multilateral system in place, which will not disappear, though the idea was to begin to reform it and make it more compatible with the objectives of development and with the other rules of the international community: namely the need to take on board the objectives of public health, the environment, and tomorrow – we hope – the social dimension of globalisation."
"The main losers of this suspension of the round of negotiations will be developing countries, and, of those, the least advanced countries in particular."
"Irrespective of the shortcomings and the limitations, what was on the table, and what was being proposed by the EU – which was often, indeed, what Parliament wanted to see – will be jeopardised, will be lost: the abolition of export subsidies by 2013, free access, as regards rights and quotas, for products from the least developed countries to the markets of the developed countries, even though the problem remained of the 3% tariff lines that a number of other industrialised countries had sought, increased access to the markets of industrialised countries for all agricultural production in developing countries, even though the US proposals fall well short of what is required, addressing the situation of cotton producers, the trade-related assistance package, and the amendment to the Trade Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on access to medicines."
"I welcome the fact, Commissioner, that you are simply announcing that you are once again going to set forth in search of peace, to meet again with the G20 and the United States and to attempt to find ways to return to the negotiating table."
"We must not, in my view, allow the Doha Round to die."
"Whatever the difficulties posed by the expiry of the authorisation to negotiate granted by Congress to the US administration, we must not allow the undertakings and the promises that had been made simply to be thrown out of the window, and I am delighted to hear that, for its part, the EU will honour its commitments and keep its promises."
"We should perhaps return simply to the heart of the Round and remind our partners from the industrialised countries that we knew that it would not be based on reciprocity, and that we would have to offer more in the way of access for agricultural products than we would gain via industrial tariffs and the opening up of markets and services."
"Europe must continue to promote the multilateral system."
"It certainly needs to be reformed so that there can remain a framework of confidence between developing and developed countries. After all, it is within the multilateral system that the developing countries can continue to be heard via the G20 and the G90, and that the trade rules can be made more compatible with the aims of eradicating poverty and with all of the other rules of the multilateral system."
"."
"(NL) Mr President, has the Doha Round failed beyond repair?"
"That is what more and more commentators seem to assume that it has."
"Especially since Hong Kong, nine months ago, no progress has been made, and in July, negotiations were postponed indefinitely."
"Like the Commissioner, and most fellow Members of this House for that matter, I refuse to believe, though, that this is the beginning of the end."
"There is, after all, a great deal at stake."
"Outright failure could well result in the collapse of the multilateral trade system, with all that this entails."
"Failure to reach a global trade agreement increases the risk of ever more countries resorting to bilateral or regional agreements, which, in any case, puts poor countries in a weaker position."
"In addition, an interruption in negotiations can increase the number of trade disputes, during which WTO Members will try legal action as a way of getting what they did not manage to get via an agreement."
"There is more, though, as the Commission pointed out: sooner or later, the WTO’s very will be challenged."
"It is therefore necessary, now more than ever, to make the WTO more transparent and enhance its democratic legitimacy."
"Our group sees it as essential that rich and more developed countries should try to bring their viewpoints closer together beforehand."
"There is absolutely no point in organising another high mass if the US and the EU fail to close the gap between them in the area of their agricultural supply and other issues."
"The American Congress recently applauded the tough stance adopted by the US negotiators."
"A blame game of this kind will do nothing to bring about constructive solutions."
"All key players, including the EU, the US and the G20, have to pull their weight in order to achieve a result."
"Meanwhile, what is termed the Hong Kong must remain intact in full."
"All pro-development commitments must be delivered upon."
"Whether or not an agreement is reached, the EU must not back out of its intention to abolish export subsidies by 2015."
"At the same time, all developed countries and advanced developing countries must be invited to observe the EU’s ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative."
"The tone of this compromise resolution is voluntaristic and positive."
"It confirms our belief in a multilateral approach of trade policy despite everything, based on the honest conviction that when the Doha Development Agenda fails, there are unfortunately no winners, only losers."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, the Doha round has failed, and what you, Commissioner, are presenting us with today is a rehash of what caused it to fail."
"You say that you hope that it will be completed nonetheless, but on what do you base that hope?"
"You say that the developing countries are losing out and that the damages them more than anyone else, but why is it that the developing world countries and their representatives have not completed the round?"
"Perhaps they took another view of it and were even smart enough not to, on the grounds that the liberalisation that underlies your thinking, the liberalisation that you want to push through, has self-evidently not made them rich."
"Far, too, from filling the stomachs of the people who live there, it has driven them into debt and has failed to solve the problem of famine."
"This is the first time that these countries have come together, and if they manage to wield enough clout against the industrial nations of the West to cause this thing to fail, then that puts things in a different light and we need to see if we can come up with another offer."
"You say that the reduction in customs duties as offered will bring EUR 20 billion to European agriculture, but are these EUR 20 billion not surplus to it, and – if we make this cut – would these EUR 20 billion not at least benefit the countries of the developing world, or would this be nothing more than a reduction in food standards?"
"Are the countries there being bought off for less than they need to rise above poverty, with agriculture here being ruined as a consequence?"
"Qualified access is what is needed."
"The market access that you offer in return for access to the developing world’s markets for industrial products and services, destroys their infrastructures and the fragile development of their own industries and trades, while denying agriculture here a chance of existence, even though we need, as a matter of urgency, to produce food."
"It follows that quality and qualified market access are what is needed to enable the countries of the developing world to enjoy our price levels and standards and to develop their own economies."
"The agreement on sugar showed us that those ACP countries that were able to supply sugar while complying with these conditions saw their economies develop, while those that were unable to do so found themselves having to sell to the multinationals at prices below the poverty level, and that state of affairs is going to continue."
"So, Commissioner Mandelson, what you should do is make a proper offer of the sort that these countries can agree to, one that stabilises food supply and improves the stability and quality of trade, rather than one with a general tendency to put farmers around the world out of business."
"It is then, I believe, that the multilateral approach will be the right one, and everyone will be able to benefit from it in a way that they certainly cannot from the liberalisation that you are proposing."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha Development Round has failed."
"What was it meant to develop?"
"That is the core issue."
"Was it only trade – trade for trade’s sake – that was meant to develop, or was it the intention that more trade should bring development in its wake?"
"For if the latter is what is intended, then there is a great deal more that must be included in the negotiations; it will be necessary to ask what contribution trade makes in the various countries in terms of raised social standards, of improved protection for the environment, of enhanced quality of life."
"That is a quite different approach from a desire, above all else, to open up markets in order to exchange bigger trade margins, for there can be no reciprocity then."
"Solidarity is about the stronger helping the weaker, and what that means is that the more developed countries must give more than those that have not developed to the same degree."
"It is not only quantity that is at issue here; it also means a qualitatively different approach, not to mention the insight that those who have not yet developed the market in their own countries must be enabled to do this before anything else happens."
"It may be that they will need to keep their markets closed for a time before they can be opened up."
"What use is it to many developing countries to be allowed to export to the European Union if they have no products they can export, quite simply because they cannot even yet feed their own people?"
"Yet, at the same time, these countries are told that if they are to be allowed to do that, they must be so good as to open up their markets to our services and our industries."
"No agreement will ever be reached if our way of negotiating never rises above this, and I say that as one who is fanatical in support for a multilateral system."
"Commissioner Mandelson, you will recall that I have, on very many occasions, asked you whether you really believe that the USA is interested in a multilateral conclusion to the WTO round."
"I have always said that I do not."
"The Americans can defend their interests better if they are not tied down by multilateral agreements."
"That is why it is much more important that the European Union should join together with the G20, and that is something to which we must, of course, give renewed consideration in view of the immense differences between the countries of the South."
"This cannot be only about opening up markets if the consequence of doing so is to put the European market at the mercy of Brazilian agri-business, which is huge and dominated by three families; in no way whatever does that do anything to help these countries."
"I believe that what we need to do is to rethink our approach."
"We want trade."
"Again and again, you say that we want free trade."
"We can have an ideological disagreement about that; I do not want that sort of liberalisation, but let us leave that to one side for a moment."
"What matters is not so much that we should have free trade, but that trade should be made fair."
"Fair trade is just trade, and ‘just’ does not mean ‘equal’."
"If the same standards are applied to all categories of countries as regards reduction of tariffs and the opening-up of their markets, then that may be no more than equal treatment, but it is not just."
"You must change the mandate that you have been given; this is the approach that you need."
"If you want to advance trade, you have to bear in mind – and, indeed, make it your priority to do so – the circumstances of the individual countries and the stage of development that they have reached."
"."
"Mr President, I am not at all surprised that the World Trade Organization talks have collapsed once again."
"For some time now, I have been calling for the exclusion of agriculture from these talks."
"Agriculture makes up a mere 5% of world trade, yet the blame for the collapse of the talks is laid firmly at European farm gates."
"Why should 5% hold back the other 95% of trade?"
"It is time to remember that."
"I attended the Doha Round of talks in Hong Kong last December and before that those in Cancún, and I informed this Parliament of the false impression that is being created that developing countries would benefit from more access to EU markets."
"Nothing could be further from the truth, and we are hearing it again in this Chamber today."
"The developing countries have little to gain from such a gesture; in fact, the EU already allows free access to 50 least-developed countries as it is."
"The real winners would be the beef barons of South America, if we were to allow Irish farmers to be sold out."
"The real losers in this situation would be the small European farmers who are already on the breadline."
"Let us make no mistake about that."
"A recent survey of Irish consumers, for example, revealed that just one in five people has confidence in food imported from outside the European Union."
"This is not surprising."
"Opening up the EU agricultural market any further will bring food security and food traceability into serious question."
"Are we willing to accept the scenario of uncertainty regarding the food we feed our children, in the light of food safety scares such as mad cow disease, CJD, or avian influenza?"
"Are we willing to accept a free-for-all approach to the use of angel dust and other suspicious substances amongst Brazilian beef farmers?"
"We in Ireland have recently witnessed the demise of the Irish sugar industry."
"Brazilian sugar barons are the beneficiaries of the recent sugar reform, while 4 000 Irish sugar beet farmers have been made redundant."
"In Hong Kong last December I witnessed Korean farmers fighting for a livelihood which is currently being threatened by transnational grain corporations, who are bargaining under the guise of endeavouring to help developing countries."
"This is a fallacy."
"It is clear that the WTO cannot succeed as long as we insist on playing Russian roulette with our food supplies and with the livelihoods of small European and Irish farmers."
"It is time to move on."
"It is time to exclude agriculture from the talks once and for all and not sell out European farmers."
"."
"Mr President, the suspension of the Doha Development Agenda negotiations represents a heavy blow not only for the WTO, but also for all parties to the negotiations."
"The WTO has lost some of its credibility, whilst global trade has benefited from drafting and enforcing international rules for the movement of trade."
"As I fear that the developing countries will be footing the bill for this suspension, I would call on Commissioner Mandelson to monitor the interests of those countries both multilaterally and bilaterally."
"Indeed, a desperate lack of economic prospects in Africa is one of the factors forcing an increasing number of people to seek their salvation in Europe."
"I personally have my doubts as to the composition of the G20."
"After all, new economic power will also need to translate into new responsibility."
"Also, I have always backed American trade representative Susan Schwab’s appeal to China to show evidence of this new responsibility."
"Commissioner, in your interview with the German magazine , you expressed your commitment to carry on in order to get Doha back on track."
"Could you explain to me on what your optimism is founded, particularly in the light of your indication that you do not expect the negotiations to be complete before the end of the year?"
"Do you have any evidence to assume that the Americans will make a move by then?"
"Moreover, I should like to urge you once again to reflect very carefully on the European agenda after Doha, for that may be more desirable than we may think."
"Mr President, it is extremely disappointing that the WTO negotiations have been suspended indefinitely, and I am particularly worried about the position of the developing countries."
"The objective of the WTO negotiations, as we know, was to improve the position of the developing countries, and all those involved had to do their bit: Europe in the area of import tariffs for agricultural products, the United States in the shape of internal support to farmers, developing countries, such as Brazil and India, with regard to access to their markets for industrial products, and suchlike."
"I do not wish to point the finger at any of the parties, for that is also difficult with so many parties being sat around the table, but it should be said that the way in which the Commissioner has acted has unfortunately not led to the desired results, and that it is now becoming more difficult for developing countries to gain a stronger foothold in the world economy."
"I am pleased, though, that the Commissioner has expressed his commitment to the developing countries more than once, and I will hold him to that if I may."
"We cannot change the facts, and that is why it is important to look to the future, particularly that of the developing countries."
"During the negotiation round, agreement was reached, in principle, about a number of items that are very important for developing countries, which include, as they have already been mentioned: aid for trade, no import duties for the poorest countries, trade facilities, as well as special and differentiated treatment."
"What could have been a major step forward, is now left in the lap of the Gods."
"I understand, and also condone the fact, that the Commissioner would like those agreements to go ahead as much as possible, but I then wonder how, according to the Commissioner, can this be done in those areas?"
"Can the plans be implemented as yet and if so, how?"
"Finally, I should like to mention the Export Promotion Organisations (EPOs) that are related to the WTO."
"We have not yet seen any concrete proposals, and that is why I should like to know: what is, according to the Commission, the impact of the suspension of the WTO negotiations on the developments of EPOs?"
"Does the Commissioner believe that, in the framework of the EPO negotiations, there is scope for walking the extra mile for the benefit of the ACP countries?"
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have had the pleasure of sitting in this House and following the progress of trade policy for twelve years, in the course of which I have seen three Commissioners deal with the subject, and I know how difficult it is."
"This House has been there through every twist and turn of the negotiations; it has seen how difficult it is to conduct them on a multilateral basis, and how difficult it is, too, to understand what is meant by a modern trade policy and trade strategy."
"Speaking personally, I am highly sceptical as to whether we have a right understanding of it even now."
"I can go along with much of what you have said just now, and I am grateful to you for referring to the Commission’s new communication, which will be reaching us shortly."
"Sometimes, though, I take a rather sceptical view of our own self-criticism and our understanding of the changes that have come about in the world."
"On the one hand, it is certainly easy to criticise the Americans – and there is no shortage of reasons for doing it – but it is also important that it be mentioned that there is, in developing countries too – Brazil being one of them – and for reasons that Members have already addressed, scepticism about agreeing with the WTO."
"Another factor may well be that China has become a global trading partner, with a greater impact on countries like Mexico, to name but one, than it has in the EU or the United States."
"There are so many reasons, and I sometimes find it regrettable that the debate on a modern trade policy, to which you yourself refer in your own document, is not engaged in at the necessary depth."
"What is also lacking is an understanding of the fact that the EU’s Member States have taken up very different positions as regards the challenges of globalisation."
"Some of our countries are very open, because they can afford to be, while some, however, are in difficulties because they got around only very late to introducing reforms and transforming themselves."
"This is evident from the textiles debate and from the anti-dumping debate with reference to shoes, and there are many other examples."
"I quite simply do not see us actually thinking through what we mean by modern trade policy."
"That involves – as I have mentioned – the part played by China."
"Have we really understood what China’s accession to the WTO means?"
"If you are going to consider the possibility of Russia joining it there, Commissioner, then we urge you to discuss the matter with us; the lack of any debate about the effects and consequences of that is something I find regrettable, and, for that reason, I am in favour of having one."
"It is something for which this House expressed its support as long ago as 2002, at the same time as it declared itself in favour of negotiations with Asia, and yet, as I see it, the debate with this House and with the responsible committee is lacking in depth."
"I would like to see a debate about what our participation in the GATS+ negotiations forming part of the bilateral round might mean; here, too, you are right, but I do wish we could have a debate about it."
"What I do think needs to be done if we are to talk in terms of a modern trade policy is for this House to be fully consulted, not just when we are called upon to agree to the outcomes of negotiations, but at the outset, when such negotiations are being considered."
"The Commission, the Council, and this House, meeting in Stuttgart, have already negotiated a statement, and that involved this House being consulted either fully or to a considerable degree."
"I would recommend to you that we do the same thing again, and hope that you can agree to this."
"Mr President, the indefinite suspension of the Doha Round creates serious risks for our global economy."
"It threatens parity and prosperity for the developing world, jobs, growth and security in Europe, and the future of the multilateral trade system itself."
"A new explosion of discriminatory bilateral and regional agreements could substitute global liberalisation, eroding the multilateral and rules-based system of the WTO."
"While some might say that no deal was better than a bad deal for developing countries, without the shield of the WTO – as you said, Commissioner – they will be left vulnerable to use and abuse in a unilateral scramble for trade domination."
"Failure will mean that protectionism will fill the vacuum as momentum towards wide-ranging reduction of barriers ceases; the world economy will slow down and global trade imbalances will continue to rise; financial markets will become more unstable; and international economic cooperation will break down further."
"With the erosion of the WTO system, speculation is rife about what form a ‘Plan B’ might take: perhaps and East Asia free trade area; perhaps Japan’s proposal for a pan-Asian comprehensive economic partnership that includes India, Australia and New Zealand."
"Either of those would create a new Asian bloc that, along with the European Union and NAFTA, would produce a tri-polar world with all its inherent instabilities."
"Does the Commission agree that there is now an urgent need for a Plan B to get world trade policy back on track and for the EU to play a key role in shaping the world trade order?"
"Does the Commission agree that such a strategy must have these three key objectives: to spur the revival of Doha; to offer an ambitious alternative to restart the process of liberalisation on the widest possible basis if our primary goal fails; and to counter the proliferation of preferential deals amongst small groups of countries?"
"Time and time again I have stood in front of you, Commissioner, and reflected on the finger-pointing blame game that has plagued progress."
"It is time to set that blame aside."
"The ‘Everything But Arms’ initiative shows that the EU can do good, but we can and must do better before the US mandate expires and, with it, our opportunity to eradicate poverty and distribute fairly the benefits of globalisation."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the results so far achieved during the Doha Round and the outcome of the TRIPS agreement on access to medicinal products are having disastrous effects on the living standards of millions of human beings."
"It is quite clear that the slogan ‘Free trade = poverty reduction’ was just bait to persuade the southern, poorest countries of the world to endorse the expectations of the industrialised countries."
"The real reason for the suspension of the WTO talks was that it was impossible to reach an agreement among the six main nations, which were determined to defend the interests of their agribusinesses; the other 143 countries were excluded from the negotiations."
"According to the FAO, the breakdown was due to having focused all the talks on free trade instead of fair trade."
"It is better to have no agreement at all than a bad agreement!"
"The suspension of the talks may provide an opportunity for reviewing the Commission’s negotiating mandate, which should concentrate on: 1) reforming the WTO to make it more transparent, more inclusive and more democratic, embedded within the UN system, and bound in its decision-making by the framework of international law; 2) reviewing the three main agreements now on the agenda: agriculture, intellectual property and services; 3) providing a binding frame of reference for the activities of transnational companies; 4) making respect for the rights of peoples a condition of free trade, by ensuring that the human rights clause, as approved by Parliament on 14 February, is observed; 5) refusing at bilateral or regional level to sidestep the rules agreed upon at multilateral level, taking the EPA talks with the ACP countries as an example."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the oral question by our Committee on International Trade is very relevant and timely."
"The European Parliament cannot look the other way when negotiations which are so important at multilateral level and which had offered such great hopes for more organised, transparent, free and fair trade are suspended."
"We would refer to the motion for a resolution presented by our group with regard to the concrete aspects we are debating here."
"We would like to point out, however, that a failure of the Doha Round would be a failure for international trade and for the multilateral system, since it would jeopardise the achievements such as tariff and trade preferences and would lead to a multiplicity and overlapping of rules, thereby making companies’ lives more difficult."
"The real fundamental reasons for this failure must be entirely exposed."
"The inflexible States that have hindered the negotiation must be condemned, and we must not give up on the negotiations. They must be revived so that we can take advantage of the progress already made and make the Doha Round a success for the sake of a fairer form of globalisation and for the sake of the WTO itself."
"The very future of this organisation is at stake; the WTO could be greatly harmed by this crisis."
"This requires serious reflection, and the WTO’s operating mechanisms must be updated, modernised and democratised."
"The European Parliament must continue to play the role that has been assigned to us by seriously and rigorously monitoring the situation that has been created and promoting a solution to the current impasse for the good of everybody, but above all, as others have said, for the good of the least-developed countries."
"Commissioner, we are grateful to you for being here and for the information you have given us, and you know that you can count on this Parliament, as other speakers have said, in the efforts to unblock these negotiations."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the commercial sky clouded over in Geneva last July."
"Despite the hopeful ray of sunlight offered by the G8 a few days earlier in St Petersburg, the minds of certain negotiators clouded over and the negotiations of the development round were suspended ."
"Football matches are also suspended as a result of bad weather, but they are eventually played when the fog lifts or the storm passes."
"The current situation should not discourage us or undermine the political will to continue along the path of multilateralism and development."
"We must continue to fight to maintain a multilateral international trade system with clear, transparent and binding rules, in which all countries, and particularly developing countries, can participate fully and from which they can benefit."
"If that did not happen, we would be entering the jungle of bilateralism. That would expand the current tangle of more than 250 bilateral treaties, it would penalise the developing countries and it would promote Darwinism, protectionism and discrimination."
"We must not move backwards."
"Commissioner, what will happen to the commitments and agreements reached last December in Hong Kong, particularly in terms of development?"
"Is the principle of the single undertaking still valid in the Commission’s strategy?"
"Will the elimination of export subsidies for 2013 be maintained?"
"What will happen to the negotiations on cotton?"
"Which countries are prepared to apply all of these agreements?"
"Furthermore, it was said in Geneva that all of the negotiators would lose out."
"All citizens, and particularly those of the least-developed countries, are also losing out."
"What initiatives is the Commission planning in order to explain to the citizens that the WTO is not dead and that it is still the best instrument for regulating and promoting fair and free international trade?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although there is, of course, something fundamentally wrong when the negotiations of the Doha round are broken off, every crisis brings an opportunity with it."
"As we have seen over the past few years, no particular success has been achieved by going from one round to another and constantly saying that we are not satisfied but will keep going, so it follows that the time now left to us must be, not least, a time in which we reflect on things."
"Theoretically, we all realise that the WTO, with its 150 member states, cannot be managed in the same way as it was at the beginning, when it had 23 of them."
"Why do we not draw particular conclusions from this?"
"Why, too, can we not for once consider where, overall, Europe’s interests lie, and what our trade position is in the various sectors?"
"It is not enough to say that agriculture accounts for only 2% or 3% of the total trade figures if those figures, in effect, relate to large regions of the European Union and would change the shape of our society, and so we need to come up with a sort of overall concept."
"It really is worth trying to do that."
"Neither WTO negotiations nor trade talks carried on a patchwork basis, along the lines of 'I give you three cows and you give me two fishes in exchange', are no use any more."
"If the differences between states are constantly on the increase – and you, Commissioner, said as much – then why are we thinking in such categories as ‘multilateral’ or ‘bilateral’?"
"Why can we not start thinking in terms of – among others – ‘multiregional’ categories?"
"In a nuanced world like this one, we cannot apply the same yardstick to every state."
"However much we may cherish development policy – and I, too, am in favour of it – we, in this European Union, also have an obligation to our own citizens."
"What is very important in these rounds – as their failure demonstrated – is the need for greater involvement of the parliaments in the negotiations."
"It is not enough for a parliament to be able, at the end, to give or withhold its approval."
"Since we lament the failure to involve the public, let at least their representatives have the right to be present at negotiations and consulted – if no more than that – while they are in progress, for it is we, at the end of the day, who have to explain them to the electorate."
"Mr President, when the Doha Round ground to a temporary halt at the end of July, we had already taken small steps towards fair trade."
"It was agreed that all export subsidies for agricultural products would be abolished in 2013 and that the US and Japan would follow in the EU’s footsteps by guaranteeing free market access to the least developed countries for 97% of all products; there was agreement about an extensive package of aid for trade; and, finally, the Americans had said that they intended to start phasing out their support to the cotton sector."
"That, after five years, was a hard-won result, but the signature is, of course, missing, and, as I already stated I do not believe that the poorest countries should lose out as a result of that."
"It is simply crucial that these measures be taken if we want to achieve the Millennium Objectives by 2015."
"In response to my written request, the Commissioner has expressed his willingness to propose a frontloading arrangement with this package."
"Would it be possible for him to confirm his commitment to this here in this debate?"
"Could he also confirm that the EU is prepared to abolish its export subsidies in 2013, unilaterally if need be?"
"At the same time, does he not share my view that a frontloading measure of this kind could also help get things back on track for the least developed countries?"
"I still take the view that, if deals are done bilaterally, multilaterally, regionally or however else one would like to call it, among the strongest parties in other words, it is particularly the weakest countries that stand to lose out."
"This is something the Commissioner has said himself on many occasions, and that is why he has every reason to state that, since those countries should not be at the receiving end of those deals, we should as yet commit to this multilateral trade agreement."
"Do not let the fight against poverty become the victim of deadlocked negotiations."
"If the world trade round cannot be saved, at least we should save the Millennium Objectives."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, so the spotlight finally shines on the hypocrisy that reigns in the area of international trade on this planet, the dialogue between the cheats, the liars and the thieves."
"If the situation were not so tragic, everyone would be relieved that the wolves are leaving the woods with their identities revealed and that the apprentices are once again seeing that the masters can sometimes get a taste of their own medicine."
"You are right, Mr Mandelson, to boycott the meeting in Canberra, in Australia, scheduled for two weeks hence, because the World Trade Organisation should not be buried so hastily."
"The situation is extremely serious, because governments have shown themselves to be incapable of managing world trade for the common good, and worse, incapable of setting a development timetable."
"I should like to share some thoughts and a proposal with you."
"As regards the Doha Agenda, it is worth taking note of the development areas on which there is consensus, and postponing the reform of international trade until the developing countries have adopted social and environmental standards conducive to fair competition in the world."
"My second comment relates to farming."
"The EU should not offer any more concessions until it discovers what form farming will take after 2013, bearing in mind the major developments offered by biotechnologies and the problems of feeding people that will inevitably arise."
"The question is, Commissioner, can you assure us that the common agricultural policy currently in force following the 2003 reform is compatible with current WTO rules, and that we do not run the risk of losing out in a dispute brought before the Dispute Settlement Body?"
"Lastly, given the inability of our political leadership to find common ground on international trade, I should like to suggest that a Parliament initiative take place without delay under the auspices of the world interparliamentary union and the European Parliament."
"This initiative would consist of questioning the citizens’ legitimate representatives on this issue and of making suggestions to those representatives on the right way forward for sorting out the appalling mess in which international trade finds itself."
"Mr President, clearly, as the Commissioner and others have said, agricultural change remains the key to lifting millions of farmers in Africa, Asia and Latin America out of poverty."
"Realistically, Commissioner, until we in the rich world tackle the need for fairer and better access to our markets, there will be no prospect of a wider deal on industrial goods and services."
"A shift to regional trade deals would, as you and others have said, be a major step backwards and undermine the essential principle of non-discrimination."
"Such deals would exclude most of the world’s poorest countries, including ACP countries, which are of course by definition generally small, vulnerable and of little economic significance."
"Before returning to the negotiations, Commissioner, the rich countries must deal with subsidies and dumping, especially as regards cotton."
"Also, there is an urgent need for a decision on Aid for Trade, with new money and with no strings attached."
"In addition, it needs to be understood, during the preparations, that the pace and scale of market opening is critical for developing countries, as is special and differential treatment and tariff protection."
"Someone has mentioned the danger of a flood of trade complaints to the WTO, and it is my belief that there should be major reform of the sanction mechanism, which currently only comes into play when the complainant is a major player."
"ACP commodity-dependent countries know this full well and to their cost."
"‘Waving or drowning’: it is sometimes very difficult to tell the difference."
"Multilateral agreement is essential."
"Regional, bilateral agreements are not what we are looking for."
"You now face a formidable task, Commissioner, and one that will severely test your diplomatic and consensus-building skills, as well as those of others."
"We wish you well in that task."
"Mr President, I was always amazed at the Commissioner’s optimism throughout these talks."
"Many of us believed that they were doomed from the start, specifically because the EU gave too much too soon, while the US gave very little at the beginning and remained dogged in its position."
"There has been too much focus on agriculture, which you have said yourself, Commissioner."
"Too much blame is now being levelled at agriculture for this apparent failure of the talks."
"Doha was oversold for its potential for lifting the poor out of poverty."
"I have said here before that the poor are used far too often in far too many negotiations."
"Their interests were not being best served in the talks that have gone on to date."
"The price for EU agriculture and for EU consumers in terms of food supply is enormous – you have outlined it to us here this morning: downsizing by USD 20 billion a year."
"I wonder whether we could put names and faces on that downsizing."
"We are retracting from milk, poultry and grain markets, not to mention beef."
"I do not know many poor farmers who will gain from that, but I know many in the G20 who are not poor and who would gain significantly."
"In my view, no deal better than a bad deal."
"If the world’s poor need food to eat and clean water to drink – and we know they do – then Doha was never going to deliver that to them."
"I am sorry to say that, but that is the case."
"We need to add to that the real threat here for the European Union."
"We have raised standards of food production; we have environmental and animal welfare issues."
"These were never on the table at Doha, so we were never going to have fair trade for farmers globally."
"I have some questions to ask the Commissioner, one of which is very specific."
"I shall answer the first myself: will world trade – free trade – deliver sufficient global food supply?"
"I think not."
"We need to look after food production just as we are concerned about energy now."
"Lastly, what about CAP reforms?"
"We have them on the table; we are going to have to give more."
"Is that what we have ended up with at the table now, in giving too much too soon?"
"Mr President, I could not disagree more with the previous speaker, Mrs McGuinness, on the point she made about the poor."
"The alternative to a successful Doha Round is sadly already emerging."
"It is a backward step to a world of unequal and exclusive bilateral deals: deals that are already strong-arming many poor countries into accepting lesser terms on market access and intellectual property rights; deals that are leaving the poorest countries out in the cold."
"I believe that we still can and should go the extra mile to ensure the completion of a round that is truly about development."
"That will take time."
"In the short term, as others have said, we need to rescue the gains made at Hong Kong: the landmark agreement to end export subsidies by 2013; duty- and quota-free access for the poorest countries, modelled on the EU’s pioneering ‘Everything But Arms’ scheme; as well as a substantial commitment to expanding aid for trade to improve supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructures in the LDCs."
"I commend the Commissioner on the flexibility he has shown since the collapse of the single undertaking in seeking to salvage the development package – a flexibility again, I am afraid, lacking in some of our negotiating partners."
"Amid the stock-taking at the WTO, the recent report of that organisation’s task force on Aid for Trade is timely."
"It highlights the real need for demand-driven additional aid, aid targeted to enable the poorest countries to participate in the global trading system."
"Aid for Trade cannot substitute for delivery of the Doha Round, yet, in the intervening period, it remains an important tool to meet the technical and logistical challenges that these countries face in bringing their goods to the world market."
"The faltering of the Doha talks and the disillusion surrounding their aims means that Aid for Trade is now more politically apposite than ever."
"It is in the interests of all countries, developed and advanced developing, to commit funds multilaterally to ensure that the appropriate investments are made in trade-related infrastructure to allow the poorest countries to trade their way out of poverty."
"I look forward to the EU – and the Commission in particular – taking a lead on these issues."
"Mr President, we all understand the difficulty and the complexity surrounding the WTO negotiations and we support the Commissioner and his team."
"The EU put a good deal on the table; we were waiting for serious counter-offers and were sadly disappointed by what came back."
"Surely now is the time for the EU to show moral courage and leadership."
"Has the Commission considered the potential costs and benefits of the EU unilaterally eliminating all its subsidies and import tariffs on agricultural products and how this might benefit the EU, developing countries and the WTO negotiations?"
"In New Zealand, farmers screamed when their subsidies were abolished."
"Yet New Zealand farmers are now amongst the most efficient in the world, in fact forcing other trade blocs to put up tariffs and barriers to their products."
"We no longer live in a post-war Europe where food security was a legitimate concern."
"Surely we need to bring the farmers of the EU into the 21st century and show moral leadership in setting dates for the abolition of both subsidies and tariffs so that less-developed countries can benefit with new markets for their produce, EU farmers would become amongst the most efficient in the world, and we would secure the goal of services liberalisation, releasing the talents of Europe onto the world."
"Thank you, Mr Kamall."
"There are not many farmers in your constituency, are there?!"
"– () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, for all those attached to the multilateral structure, as has just been pointed out, this suspension of the implementation of the Doha Agenda for Development, designed to make trade rules work in favour of development, is very bad news."
"If it ends in outright failure, we know what awaits us – a proliferation of regional agreements, which always work to the detriment of the weakest."
"In other words, this would be at complete variance with our objectives, which are aimed at realigning the rules of international trade in favour of the developing countries."
"This Round ought to enable us to deliver a fairer share of the benefits of globalisation and to take account of differences in levels of development."
"It should also offer developing countries better access to the markets, without forcing their own markets to open up at any price."
"Of course, there were some shortcomings in these negotiations, but they also delivered progress, as has been pointed out in this debate."
"This progress, these victories, deserve to be saved and in this respect I welcome the wish expressed by Mr Mandelson."
"This wish is indispensable, and it is vital that the negotiations be relaunched. Yet making progress also entails reforms, and the question of the reform of the WTO is on the table today."
"– Mr President, I wish to say straight from the outset that I agree absolutely with Commissioner Mandelson's approach and the considerations he expressed."
"There can be no doubt that our basic objective must continue to be the successful completion of the Doha Round negotiations."
"This will be in the interests of the European Union and the Member States."
"However, this success cannot be achieved at any cost, nor can it be achieved with unilateral concessions on the part of the European Union."
"I believe that the time has come for us to answer a crucial question of strategic importance: can the institutional structure of the World Trade Organisation, as we have known it since it was established in 1995, serve the strategic objective of the European Union for a democratic, multilateral trade system?"
"I fear, on the basis of our experience to date and given the failure of the Doha Round negotiations, that it cannot do so."
"The World Trade Organisation currently generates more crises than it can resolve."
"That is why I consider the priority for an initiative to be taken on the part of the European Union for a major ambitious democratic reform of the World Trade Organisation to be of strategic importance, just as I consider the need for the European Union to submit an integrated strategic trade policy for the development of bilateral and regional trade relations to be of strategic importance."
"That is exactly what the United States are doing, Mr Mandelson, as you well know; over and above the Doha Round, they are developing their bilateral and regional trade relations."
"We need to and must do the same."
"Today, regional and global correlations of not only commercial but also political strength are being shaped and the European Union must not get left behind in this major strategic venture."
"Mr President, there is a real risk of the longer-term suspension of the Doha talks again resulting in a multiplication of bilateral free trade agreements, and, while there is no doubt about the fact that the poorest countries of the world will lose out as a result of this, it will also become more and more difficult to defend workers’ interests."
"We once had the ambitious objective of building an environmentally and socially sustainable society, and what has become of that?"
"Beginning in the 1970s, the industrialised states committed themselves to spending 0.7% of their gross domestic product on development cooperation; in 2005, we spent a feeble 0.33% on it."
"A sort of global Marshall Plan could now be a new initiative to the benefit of both sides, on the one hand doing away with poverty in the really poorest countries of the world and giving them a fair chance in the world’s markets, while, on the other, preventing environmental and social dumping."
"."
"Mr President, this has been a very useful debate because it has focused our attention, it has provided insight and it has given me guidance, which are the essential roles of Parliament vis-à-vis the Commission."
"I am a new Commissioner and do not know what has happened in the past or what precedent has been set, but I feel instinctively that the information-sharing, consultation and dialogue I have with this Parliament and with the Committee on International Trade is very strong."
"It is certainly more wide-ranging and frequent and of greater depth than I was used to as a minister in my national parliament."
"I welcome the depth and strength of those contacts and am slightly surprised by the criticism that has been expressed."
"I do not know whether it is one representative of Parliament or of the Committee on International Trade as a whole, and I hope it is not."
"The Commission consults Parliament on all main trade policy orientations on the basis of the Westerterp Procedure which, as we know, provides for the possibility of a debate in Parliament before the opening of negotiations on any trade agreement, as well as for information from the Council before the conclusion of any such agreement."
"We do so also on the basis of the Stuttgart Declaration, which states that Parliament should be consulted on the conclusion of all agreements – even ones covered by the then Article 113 – that have an important bearing on the Community."
"Our commitment to this relationship is shown by the fact that we send the Committee on International Trade copies of all the policy documents that are under discussion in the Council’s Article 133 Committee."
"There is no legal obligation on us to do this."
"We do it because it is right and because it helps underpin our relations."
"No doubt we could do even better in the future, but to characterise what we do at the moment as ‘poor’ or ‘insufficient’ seems inaccurate."
"A number of the points raised relate to legitimate concerns over the impact of these negotiations – both their direction and suspension – on developing countries."
"I should make it clear that developing countries do not conform to a ‘standard size’ state of development or set of interests when it comes to the negotiations."
"There are different developing countries with very different interests and very different needs."
"Our job is primarily to ensure two things: firstly, that all developing countries benefit and gain from these negotiations and, secondly, that the weaker, more vulnerable and less-developed among them receive the greatest direct assistance, not least in terms of capacity-building, Aid for Trade and the putting in place of a full duty-free and quota-free system that enables them to access rich world markets."
"In other words, we operate a system of proportionality: proportionality vis-à-vis what we expect developing countries to contribute and the effort we expect of them in bringing these negotiations to a conclusion, and proportionality also in terms of what we give and how we support and underpin their development."
"The countries that are in greatest need and have least to offer are quite rightly those which are, and will remain, our priority in these negotiations."
"It is important to stress this because, unlike some of those who have spoken, I passionately believe that a good Doha deal can contribute to development and to fairer trade, through the way in which we operate special and differential treatment between developing countries, the way we allow carve-outs for commitments to developing countries to protect and enable the development of infant industry, the way we provide for longer implementation periods for developing countries so that they can prepare for change and, in particular, the way that we grant special access to the least-developed countries and attention to their capacity needs."
"We shall continue to adhere to that standard, as you would expect us to do, throughout the negotiations."
"What is important is to have not just access for developing countries to the markets of the developed world, but also much greater access for developing countries to the markets of other developing countries."
"What is important is South-South trade, especially given the extent of duty-free and quota-free access that we in Europe already give to developing countries and particularly the ACP countries, as a result of which 75% of agricultural exports from Africa come to Europe, as do 45% of those from Latin America."
"In fact, we are the most open and fair-minded trading bloc in the world."
"Let us remember that fact, whilst also reminding ourselves of what we can do better in the future."
"The greatest and earliest gains for developing countries will come from increased trade opportunities with other developing countries."
"It is therefore South-South trade that we must not lose sight of when delicately and sensitively addressing the issues of tariff reductions and the much-needed multilateralisation of ‘Everything But Arms’."
"Others who have spoken have suggested that far from giving too little for and to developing countries, the European negotiating position has consisted of giving far too much, too early and showing far too much flexibility."
"Well, we in Europe conceived the Doha Round."
"We were primarily instrumental in launching it and we have nurtured it throughout."
"After Cancún we were instrumental in putting it back on track, through the framework agreement, in 2004, and I do not apologise for putting an end date, in Hong Kong, on the elimination of our export subsidies."
"This was a commitment we had already made, assuming, of course, that we reach the end of these negotiations and that other countries act similarly in eliminating the components of their export subsidisation."
"I make no apology, and am not actually primarily responsible for the future of the common agricultural policy, although I would point out that I do not as yet see a consensus emerging in favour of its abolition."
"In the event of a doubtful outcome to the Doha negotiations, we will have to look very carefully at what happens to the future of export subsidies, because that is linked to another point that has been raised in this debate – i.e. whether or not we will be more or less vulnerable to litigation at the WTO in cases brought against us on agriculture should a deal not be reached in the multilateral negotiations."
"If these negotiations do not succeed, I agree that it is likely that there will be an upsurge in cases brought to the WTO, especially concerning agriculture."
"We in Europe can view this possibility with relative equanimity."
"We have reformed our common agricultural policy because it was right to do so for our own purposes and needs, as well as for the needs of others within the international trading system."
"To the extent that we have now implemented that reform, and will continue to do so, we are protected from litigation at the WTO."
"However, not all WTO members are in the same position and I certainly do not exclude the big agricultural exporters – for example Brazil and Argentina – trying the judicial road if they see that the political and negotiating one is blocked."
"However, others are more vulnerable to that than we are in Europe."
"Before I make one final comment about timing, let me just say this about the WTO itself."
"Everybody – including the present Director-General of the WTO – agrees to varying degrees that the WTO would benefit from some institutional and procedural reform, as others have commented on during the course of this debate."
"The Sutherland Report provided some interesting ideas in this regard."
"However, we need to be clear in our minds on this."
"The present impasse in the negotiations is not due to an institutional problem but to a political one, and no institutional improvement could break the present deadlock."
"That is something which requires political will and an adjustment of attitude and policy on the part of certain WTO members."
"That brings me to my last point, which relates to when these negotiations can restart."
"Quite simply, we will have to wait until the mid-term elections in the United States are over in November before we can entertain the idea of a serious resumption in negotiations."
"I will be working to that end."
"Thank you Commissioner."
"With 15 minutes at the beginning and nearly 15 minutes at the end, I think you have been very consistent."
"It also means that we now have a problem with the following debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"The next item is the report (A6-0193/2006) by Mrs Gröner on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality on the proposal and the amended proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ‘Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information’ as part of the General programme ‘Fundamental Rights and Justice’ (COM(2005)0122 – COM (2006)0230 C6-0388/2005 2005/0037A(COD))."
"."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I would first of all like to express our thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mrs Gröner and Mrs Angelilli, for the excellent job they did."
"I have to tell you that I was very happy to fulfil the request of my fellow Commissioner, Mr Frattini, to replace him, at least at the beginning of the debate, because this is a very important subject and one which is close to my heart."
"I also want to tell you that the Commission is firmly committed to the Daphne programme, which sets out to prevent and combat all forms of violence against women, children and young people."
"We know that Parliament also values it very highly."
"Daphne will be ten years old, but what the Commission is proposing is already the third version of the programme."
"During that period its success has been widely acknowledged."
"It has served to finance a great many projects which have helped to achieve progress in the fight against violence."
"The attachment to Daphne felt by Parliament and many sections of civil society is reflected in their suggestion that the Commission should stop presenting Daphne measures and action to prevent drug abuse under the same programme heading."
"As you know, the Commission has taken Parliament’s wishes on board and on 24 May it put forward two separate programme proposals."
"Although Daphne II runs to the end of 2008, it is essential that Daphne III be adopted by the end of the year so that the new forms of action provided for by the proposal for a decision, as well as the budget appropriations, which are much higher than in the past, can be used right from the beginning of next year."
"I am looking forward to today’s debate."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission’s original proposal was that Daphne should be a joint programme for combating violence and both educating people about drugs and preventing the abuse of them."
"Getting it to withdraw this proposal took a determined campaign, with joint statements by the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality and women’s organisations, and I really am relieved that they have avoided the issues of drugs and violence being confused and enabled us to press on with what is one of the EU’s most successful programmes."
"To date, however, it has been possible to use Daphne I and II to fund only some 17% of the good proposals that have been submitted, which is a demonstration of how enormous demand is, and it is for that reason that the Committee for Women's Rights and Gender Equality is calling for additional resources."
"Today sees us sending out two very clear messages."
"The first is that Europe will attach greater weight to the campaign against violence and refrain from conflating it with other aspects."
"The second is that we acknowledge and support the valuable work done on the ground by organisations such as women’s organisations, numerous self-help and human rights organisations, youth associations and their networks."
"Violence is on the increase in daily life, particularly those aspects of it that cross borders, and it is this that the Daphne programme addresses first, having come into being in response to it."
"The women’s movement made a priority of such matters as domestic violence, child abuse, and the trafficking of women for their sexual exploitation, and we have been able to develop many good projects to deal with these things, while also raising public awareness of them – and not just since the World Cup."
"Daphne I and Daphne II have yielded valuable knowledge, one result of which has been that all the projects have been summarised in a user-friendly ‘tool kit’, which it has now been possible to pass on to the various professional organisations; studies have also been made available to a wide professional public, along with contacts far beyond Europe’s borders."
"Now, though, we have new tasks to which to address ourselves."
"Daphne III makes cross-border ‘networking’ much more important."
"New things are happening in the migration field, and there is much important work to be done on the people-trafficking front."
"We have proposed financial support for a network of ombudspersons for children, and a single number for children's emergency telephones throughout Europe."
"We also want to reinforce the networks of organisations dealing with violence on the Internet."
"The various activities make up a long list, and so it is not unreasonable to do as the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has done and demand EUR 120 or 125 million for them, and I hope that this House will help to meet the need that this demand reflects."
"This House, during the last stage of Daphne, managed to secure the establishment of a helpdesk, and we have had a very positive experience of this."
"It has helped organisations to establish contact with one another across borders and to find the right people to talk to."
"When considering the establishment of a ‘think tank’, we should also have recourse to the immense reserve of knowledge to be found in the organisations, drawing on this knowledge and deepening it."
"I do not, however, wish too great a burden to be placed on Daphne, and so I would ask you to be careful with Amendment 56."
"It is intended that it should clearly define Daphne’s main target group as being children, women, and young people, and should make clear that such categories as social workers, frontier personnel, and the police are not included."
"My message to you is that there must be no doubt about the fact that Daphne is mainly targeted at women, children and young people, although the others can be involved, as is made clear in Amendment 57 and elsewhere."
"We continue to demand a European Year against violence against women; it is something that has been being called for for a long time, not least in Daphne I and II, and we are being persistent and consistent in continuing to do so."
"I will take this opportunity to ask that all forms of violence, without equivocation or exception, be targeted."
"This is something that the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has worked through with the Commission, and I hope that we will be able to come to a final agreement on it with the Finnish Presidency of the Council by the end of the year, as we are indeed willing and ready to do."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to congratulate Mrs Gröner and all my fellow Members who have worked on this report."
"I also thank the Commissioner for his support and his words this morning."
"I am convinced that important results can be achieved when everyone collaborates, and they have been achieved in this case."
"Above all, the continuity of the Daphne programme has been guaranteed; this is an important, valuable programme for preventing and fighting violence towards women and children, which has already in the past obtained significant and to some extent unexpected results."
"In addition, the programme has been guaranteed an budget line that is rightly separate, as the rapporteur also said, from the drugs prevention programme."
"It is worth mentioning that, out of all the possible aims of Daphne, a number of important priorities have also been set, including the fight against domestic violence – worryingly, a problem that is constantly on the increase – and the scourge of genital mutilation."
"Another important point has been to specify that the term ‘child’ or ‘young person’ covers the age range from newborn to 18 years, although the measures may of course target young people up to the age of 25."
"There has also been a concern to specify that violence prevention should be aimed not only at young people, women and groups at risk, but also at newborn babies: cases in which babies are mistreated or actually abandoned are growing exponentially and are often associated with situations of psychological and social deprivation."
"Such occurrences could be prevented by providing mothers and families in extreme difficulties with assistance and support."
"Clearly, these are ambitious aims for which, unfortunately, there is inadequate financial provision."
"In conclusion, I hope that Daphne may be allocated greater resources than at present in the mid-term budget review; we are counting on your efforts as well, Commissioner, to achieve that."
"– Madam President, we must acknowledge that, with today's independent report, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, in proposing the special programme to combat violence against children, young people, women and high risk groups, is correcting in the right direction the proposal for a decision on the overall programme which, in addition to combating violence and animal reactions between human beings, also promotes drugs prevention and public information as part of the general programme entitled 'Fundamental rights and justice'."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, the chairman of the committee, Mrs Záborská, and all the members determined with sensitivity and almost unanimously the target of protection from violence, namely the most vulnerable groups of our fellow Members."
"However, this does not mean that every category of persons wronged and subject to violence will not be protected without discrimination."
"That is why our group, the Group of the European People's Party (European Democrats) and Christian Democrats, does not agree with the amendments which contain lists of instances and categories of victims."
"The majority of the committee's amendments develop the conclusions of the evaluation of the two generally successful previous programmes, namely Daphne Ι and ΙΙ."
"Given that funding of Daphne ΙΙΙ is, in our opinion, satisfactory within the framework of the agreement on the financial perspective, we must expect the results of actions to be spectacular and to eradicate violence from civilised European society, not only by 50%, as the rapporteur proposes, but if possible in its entirety, with systematic work and cooperation on the part of the authorities, local agencies, organisations and civil society."
"The overall action is expected to be based on three principles: prevention with constantly updated information, addressing the root of the evil, remedy/care for victims and reintegration/rehabilitation of perpetrators."
"Allow me, however, to observe that the success of the programme also depends on avoiding breaking the issue down into too many focal points and avoiding getting involved in the field of criminality in general."
"That is why the European People's Party did not vote for Amendment 69."
"The positive results are also expected through transparency in connection with the involvement of non-governmental organisations, which must take valued action and guarantee their positive contribution to healing the wounds of violence."
"These agencies are the European Federation for Missing Children, which includes 19 organisations, and the European Children's Network, which is valued in the Member States."
"We hope that the success of the new programme will safeguard the viability of the programmes once their funding ends and that we shall thus be able to ..."
"– Madam President, I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Gröner both on her report and on her constant efforts aimed at strengthening this programme."
"As we all know, if this programme is not applied as broadly as proposed in Mrs Gröner's report, we shall not be able to limit either superficially or materially the phenomenon of violence that is present at all social levels, violence which is spreading its social fabric and constantly extending to the large social groups now facing it and that is why I think that the European Union should step up its efforts."
"I should like to stress that the Commission was right not to merge the Daphne ΙΙΙ programme with the drugs programme, a position that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and Mrs Gröner have firmly stood by."
"However, I should also like to point out that, on reading the 2007 budget, we were surprised by the Council's position, which reduced Community resources for Daphne ΙΙΙ, compared with the Commission proposal."
"If we are not to be hypocrites towards the victims of the violence spreading to immigrants and refugees, children and infants, we should invigorate and strengthen the budget for Daphne ΙΙΙ, because this policy of cutbacks runs completely counter to commitments to further strengthen and upgrade the programme and guarantee the efficacy of its actions."
"In order for a policy of combating violence against women, children and young people to be effective and to constitute a priority for the ΕU, it must be accompanied, over and above the suitable planning and organisation of actions, by adequate resources to implement them."
"."
"Madam President, Daphne is the young woman in Greek mythology who was chased by the God Apollo."
"His intention was to rape her, but he failed."
"The moment Apollo touched her, Daphne was transformed into a laurel tree and she was saved from being raped."
"In the European Parliament, the name Daphne stands for an important initiative."
"Ten years ago, in the late summer of 1996, Europe exploded with the knowledge of what came to be known as the Dutroux affair."
"The discovery of the bodies of a number of missing girls in a town in Belgium raised serious questions about what we do to protect women and children from those who abuse or exploit them for profit."
"In April 1997, a large number of representatives from NGOs, the European Parliament, the European Commission, law enforcement agencies and other experts, gathered in Brussels for a hearing on these subjects."
"Maybe the most important result of that hearing was a commitment from the Commission to launch the Daphne initiative."
"What it amounts to is to put force behind the words; to give the campaign against violence a substantial budget."
"The idea behind it was simple enough: to provide financial support for projects which would bring together NGOs from at least two Member States to cooperate in research, data collection and analysis, good practice identification and sharing, training exchange and networking, awareness-raising and information campaigns, but also direct action to support victims of violence and produce guidelines and protocols."
"It seems simple enough, and who could possibly be against it?"
"But, as we all know, our society is characterised by a systematic devaluation of the things women say, do and decide."
"That gender power structure affects everything and is at its most visible in the phenomenon of men’s violence against women."
"Because of that, the Daphne initiative has been under constant threat ever since it started."
"It should be obvious that we should not mix the fight against violence with the fight against drugs; they are simply two different areas."
"It is the Commission that runs the Daphne project, but in this House it is Lissy Gröner who should receive praise and support when we discuss the ‘reborn’ Daphne initiative."
"She is one of the pioneers."
"Of course, there is still a long way to go before we reach the necessary zero tolerance towards violence against women and children."
"The long-term importance of the Daphne initiative is the way it can affect grassroots organisations, deeply embedded in all Member States of the Union."
"Zero tolerance is the goal and Daphne is one of the means of achieving it."
". – Madam President, we too are grateful to the rapporteur."
"I see the prevention of Daphne and the anti-drug campaign being merged together as a tremendous success for women throughout Europe."
"In bringing this about, this House has sent out a signal and re-emphasised the need for the programme to combat violence against women, children and young people to remain independent."
"Daphne is a small, but very successful, programme, which has already enabled important progress to be made in combating violence against women."
"Violence against women is not a private matter, but rather an issue of internal security."
"The most dangerous place for women is the home in which they live."
"‘Family’ and ‘home’ may epitomise peace and security for many, but for millions of women, it is within the family and at home that they suffer, are abused, are tortured and even killed."
"Human rights are an entitlement for all human beings of whatever gender, and neither culture nor tradition can excuse the violation of women’s fundamental rights."
"It follows that violence against women is not just a women’s issue; it also affects men, who need to face up to their responsibilities and take action to deal with, and put a stop to, violence against women, not only in war zones but also in the bedroom."
"Taking Daphne further cannot be the only thing we do to combat violence against women."
"We would like to see the Commission produce a free-standing directive and thereby demonstrating that it attaches the highest political priority to the campaign against violence."
"A proposal along these lines has been overdue for many years."
"It is positively scandalous that the Commission should shut its eyes to the demand for one and should disregard the need for European legislation to be harmonised."
"It really is quite essential that a free-standing directive be put in place, and, while I am on that subject, let me say that I would like to hear the Commission say something today about something concerning which we, in this House, have passed numerous resolutions, whether on International Women’s Day or on other occasions."
"We also hope that the Commission and the Council will be able to wrap up negotiations on Daphne as soon as possible, so that the programme can be refinanced in good time for 2007."
"It is important to us, too, particularly at a time like this, when the women’s rights campaigner Seyran Ateş has been forced by vicious threats to give up her lawyer’s practice in Germany, that we should put the spotlight on the violations of migrant women's human rights, and affirm that there will be, for them, ‘zero tolerance’."
"Madam President, I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, for an excellent report and for the committed way in which she has tackled the issues involved."
"I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their committed approach when it comes to the fight against violence against women."
"Those women and children who are subject to violence need the Daphne III programme."
"Violence against women by men occurs in all social groups."
"One cannot merely single out particular groups or particular factors such as drug and alcohol abuse – there is violence against women and children across the whole of society."
"Despite the fact that study after study confirms that violence occurs in all social groups, many people still refuse to see the truth, which is that violence occurs right across the spectrum."
"Myths about the involvement of alcohol or drugs continue to flourish."
"If we are to fight violence against women, we have to banish these myths that it is ‘them’ or ‘others’ or ‘addicts’ that abuse women and children."
"It is just as likely to be our own neighbour, workmate or relative who perpetrates such acts of violence."
"This is one of the reasons why the Daphne programme must be split into two separate programmes – one programme especially for the prevention of, and fight against, violence against women and children and another for the prevention of narcotics abuse and for providing information in that regard."
"Having a joint programme for these two different social problems would be to perpetuate the myths that there is a connection between drug and alcohol abuse and violence against women by men."
"This then leads to the belief that if we solve the drug and alcohol problems we also solve the violence problem, but this is not the case."
"These are both social problems that need to be solved, but they require different measures if they are to be so."
"I am therefore pleased to see that the Commission has accepted division into separate programmes."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left gives its full support to this report."
"We believe that it is particularly important that the programme also tackles the trafficking of women and children for sexual purposes."
"This is important because we must do everything we can to fight this modern slave trade."
"It is also important in order to highlight the fact that this slave trade is another example of the violence to which women and children are subjected."
"There are two terms in the report that I would like to see changed."
"The first of these terms is ‘domestic violence’, which I believe we should call ‘violence against women by men’, since that is exactly what it is."
"Violence against women does not only occur within the four walls of a domestic household."
"Women who live in abusive relationships live with this physical and psychological torture 24 hours a day."
"The other term I would question is ‘private life’."
"There is no reason to make a distinction between public and private life."
"The perpetration of violence against women is a criminal act, whether in public or in private."
"."
"Madam President, to begin with, I would like to mention the division of the Daphne document into two separate programmes."
"This would be a positive step if the intention were to carry out a genuine investigation into the problem of drug addiction and violence, as well as their prevention, instead of a self-centered perception of the problem and the failure to perceive the real causes for these social ills."
"Violence is a serious problem and, as with other disorders, the most effective means of combating it is to eliminate the causes and risk factors."
"These include neurobiological indicators as well as traits such as selfishness, hostility, impulsiveness, irritability, anhedonia, low intelligence, poor responsiveness of the brain to stimuli, as well as a lack of respect for values and antisocial behaviour."
"We have to be aware that the growing plague of aggression, mental disorders, underdeveloped personalities and addictions is a result not only of a hedonistic lifestyle but also stems from the dominance of a materialistic world view which does not appreciate the role of spiritual development in the individual."
"The vast amount of knowledge gathered to date correlates poorly with the primary environmental factors influencing the development of a well-balanced personality."
"One of these factors is a healthy and loving family, preferably a complete one with many children, where the children are wanted, loved and learn to live together with, and for, others."
"– Madam President, every day millions of women are victims of abuse of all kinds, including violence from family members, intimidation at work, mental cruelty, sexual abuse and forced prostitution."
"In the EU, one in five women suffers what is referred to as domestic abuse, that is, violence perpetrated by her husband or partner."
"Let us not forget, however, that these figures only take account of reported violence."
"Indeed, fear, shame and the limited access to public services explain all too often why some violence goes unreported."
"What is more, some types of violence are not counted because they do not fit in with established definitions and are not considered as crimes because they are seen as taboo subjects."
"The Daphne Programme to fight against violence against women proposed by Parliament and the Council more than six years ago covers all forms of abuse, other than domestic violence, suffered by women around the world."
"In this regard, the emphasis should be placed on the fact that the large majority of such abuse is related to particular cultures and societies, in particular Islam and countries where Islamic law is in force, and in which stoning, genital mutilation, immolation and forced marriage are part of the culture, the religion and the customs."
"The Daphne Programme should channel its efforts into the fight for the woman’s right to information, protection and punishment for the perpetrators of the abuse, and should help to change certain mentalities and barbaric customs that sadly still exist in many countries governed by Islamic law."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I too am delighted at this measure."
"I have been pleased to hear during this morning's debate in this House that many Members have mentioned a need that I wholeheartedly endorse: we have to move towards a European Union directive on violence."
"The time has come to harmonise legislation on this subject and, until that happens, the Commission should use the tools that they say they are preparing and straight away set out a very clear-cut, rigorous position on the policies that the Union and its Member States should apply, so that we can take a clear stand on these issues."
"It is true that a great deal has been done in recent years on the subject of equality."
"The individual EU Member States have passed legislation in so many areas, but some black holes have been left concerning this very subject."
"We must operate with clear, well-defined policies in this regard because, even though we all agree on proposing zero tolerance towards violence, we do not all agree on the tools to use to achieve this aim."
"So as to obviate the risks of this policy, then, the programmes to be financed through Daphne must respond to clear-cut, rigorous policies defined by the Union."
"– Madam President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her work and say that separating the Daphne III programme from the programme on drugs prevention and information, as requested by this Parliament, was crucial to the proper operation of Daphne."
"It has been a genuine success on the part of the rapporteur to achieve this separation; it has increased the strength and visibility of the Daphne programme, which is an essential instrument for supporting women’s organisations combating gender violence."
"As well as the budgetary increase already mentioned, I would like to stress certain important contributions made by Mrs Gröner’s report: firstly, the specific inclusion of people trafficking and forced prostitution as forms of violence, and the absolutely clear reference to genital mutilation and honour crimes as forms of gender violence that have a serious impact on health."
"Under no circumstances can violence against women be justified on the grounds of tradition or cultural practice, and I also believe that it is very important that children who see their mothers being abused should be included as victims of gender violence."
"It is also very appropriate that the report asks that the programme pay particular attention to certain groups of women, such as refugees, emigrants, women living in poverty, disabled women and elderly women, as groups exposed to a greater risk of violence."
"It is also very important that the report proposes including the definition of the legal basis for combating violence against women amongst the sections providing European added value."
"At the same time, concrete objectives must be set, such as reducing the number of victims of violence and people trafficking by half over the next ten years."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the European Year against violence against women can undoubtedly help to promote awareness raising and the sharing of good practices, and it is therefore very important that this Year should also be supported within this Daphne programme."
"Madam President, I fully support the rapporteur's excellent proposal to split the financial framework programmes into two specific programmes."
"This should help to ensure that both programmes are more focused and that each gets the level of visibility and funding it deserves."
"The Daphne programme has been an important instrument in helping to raise awareness of and to combat violence against women, children and young people."
"In Ireland, as elsewhere, violence against women is a very significant problem, with statistics from different reports indicating that one in four women have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime."
"Funding from Daphne has had a positive impact on the work of many Irish women’s groups."
"However, unfortunately, national funding for frontline services to assist women and children is still not adequate, with insufficient shelter accommodation for those at risk."
"I should like to mention some of the proposed amendments and my particular support for them."
"I am pleased to see that in Amendment 14, along with other vulnerable groups, women with disabilities were specifically mentioned as being particularly vulnerable to violence."
"It is therefore crucial to ensure that measures are put in place to protect those suffering multiple discriminations."
"Amendment 14 also mentions women living in poverty in rural or remote communities."
"Outreach services need to be put in place so that these women and children can access the necessary services and be protected from violence."
"I am also pleased to see references in this report to trafficking and enforced prostitution, to children who witness violence, and to action specifically designed to prevent newborn children from being abused."
"However, in the final analysis, whether you are new born or elderly, citizen or migrant, rural or urban, nobody should be at risk of violence."
"Indeed, the fight against violence should be placed within the context of the protection of fundamental rights as guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU."
"Finally, I would like to give my full support to the promotion of the European Year Against Violence Against Women: awareness-raising is crucial."
"Madam President, a year and a half ago, Spain was in the vanguard of Europe in terms of combating male violence against women, when it approved an integrated law against such violence."
"Nevertheless, so far this year 51 people have been killed as a result of this scourge, of this kind of violence."
"We cannot therefore feel satisfied, naturally."
"The law was necessary, and that is what we said, but, as we can see, unfortunately a law is not enough."
"The essence of this kind of violence is deeply rooted in people’s mindsets and in the cultures that suffer from those mindsets, and one year, or one piece of paper, will not be enough to change that."
"Daphne, the objective of which is to combat violence of all kinds, is therefore a fundamental instrument, and we cannot and must not give up on it."
"Many forms of violence against women need to be combated: people trafficking, physical and psychological abuse, practices such as clitoral circumcision or the feminisation of poverty, and many others."
"All of them require urgent action and resources. They will never be sufficient, however, regardless of how many of them there are or appear to be."
"We must therefore once again call upon the governments to emerge from their European lethargy and to understand that it is not possible to do more things with less money and that, with regard to violence in general and male violence against women in particular, we cannot demand great actions unless we also provide the means and resources needed to carry them out."
"To provide Daphne with resources and with political importance is not a purely bureaucratic process."
"Let us not forget that its ultimate objective is to save lives."
"Though, like the Spanish law against gender violence, it is not sufficient, it is nevertheless essential."
"– It is extremely important that this report by Mrs Gröner be adopted, and I wish to commend her on her work."
"The Daphne Programme can help prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and protect the victims, an area that must be strengthened. In so doing, continuity will be provided for previous Daphne programmes and the scope of those programmes extended."
"Violence against women, and the suffering, and in many cases the death, that it leads to, cannot be tolerated any more."
"This is a fight that requires constant effort and action, and must not be confused with other actions."
"For women’s rights to be resolutely defended, the Daphne III programme must, as suggested in the proposal before us, remain separate, and increased funding is required if we are to counter physical, sexual and psychological violence more effectively, including the violence associated with the trafficking of human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation, and domestic violence, and threats of such acts, of which women, young people and children are the main victims."
"Preventative action must be taken in the form of awareness-raising campaigns, for example the European Year against violence against women. Moreover, action must be taken in support of the victims."
"In order to establish clear, credible targets for effectively reducing violence, public policy needs to be more proactive and greater financial support is required for the organisations involved in this fight."
"Hence the reinforcement that we have proposed and that we hope will be adopted."
"Madam President, first of all, I should like to congratulate Mrs Gröner on her report which contains a number of very positive proposals."
"I am mainly referring to the removal of all drugs-related topics."
"Drug use and violence have, despite a certain overlap, been kept apart, with good reason."
"The emphasis on the fight against human trafficking within this programme is, in my view, the other main gain."
"I would, however, like to take this opportunity to underline the importance of real action."
"The efforts many have made to take action against forced prostitution and human trafficking at the time of the World Cup have not been rewarded with constructive action by the parties involved."
"It is hoped that this House and the Commission, in coalition, can persuade, and possibly compel, Member States, NGOs and citizens to respect the rights of fellow human beings in order to reduce exploitation of this kind."
"I am less positive about the views on the distribution of responsibilities."
"It is my deep conviction that it is no business of government to encroach upon the personal privacy of individual people without good reason."
"There is only cause for this once the boundaries of criminal law have been crossed."
"Since these boundaries vary from one Member State to another, it is up to them to guarantee enforcement in this respect."
"Since it is impossible to find justification for an active role for Europe in this area, my group has applied for separate votes for a number of those amendments, which I will be in favour of once those elements have been removed."
"– Madam President, it is shocking that one out of every three women around the world should fall victim to violence at some point in the course of her life, and I should like to say a number of things about this."
"In view of the violence committed by young people, it is intolerable that young people should be allowed to carry weapons, that they should use them to inflict wounds and worse, and that party drugs and other intoxicants should circulate among them; our teachers therefore need to be trained in the prevention of violence, theft, vandalism and drug-dealing."
"Another promoter of violence is the Internet, which not only enables perverts to establish contact with their potential victims, but also offers, at various sites on it, detailed tips on the committing of violent acts."
"This, I believe, is where criminal prosecutions need to be stepped up."
"Finally, I cannot do other than address the violence that is current within immigrant communities."
"People who come from cultural environments with a quite different attitude towards violence – by which I mean an archaic one – believe that they can retain their greater propensity for violence even within the EU; it follows that potentially violent elements must be prevented from entering it, and that the abandonment of violence must be made priority in integration."
"First of all, let me cordially welcome the delegation of women from the town of Lazio in Italy who are listening to our discussion from the balcony."
"To begin with, I would like to recall the success we have jointly achieved."
"Thanks to the close and good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, what was originally a two-part Community programme – combating violence against women and fighting against drugs – has now been divided."
"In this way, we have emphasised how very important each of the two struggles really is."
"I wish to express my gratitude to Commissioner Frattini and his team, and particularly to our rapporteur Mrs Gröner for her excellent work, as well as to all my colleagues from the committee for their cooperation."
"I am proud of this achievement."
"The Daphne programme, however, will not be effective as long as men – both those in the home and those engaged in politics and public life – do not actively participate in the process."
"In this respect, I appreciate the actions taken by the Austrian and Finnish presidencies in support of the involvement of men in promoting gender equality."
"Since 1946, dozens of regulations have been passed, and yet there is still growing violence."
"I hope that this will not prove to be just one more regulation, since we all know that the problem will not be solved solely by administrative actions and the funding of short-term, one-off campaigns targeting violence against women and children."
"It is not enough to deal only with the consequences."
"We must focus on prevention and on systemic education and the promotion of respect and the dignity of the human being."
"This and only this will be fruitful."
"We must focus on the treatment of violent individuals as soon as they manifest inclinations to violence."
"Otherwise, the use of the Daphne funds will be ineffective, if not totally worthless."
"I would like to conclude by mentioning violence against children, which is also addressed by the Daphne programme."
"As we speak, a paedophile party in the Netherlands is promoting its agenda with the aim of legalising paedophilia and sexual activity with children – as long as children give their consent."
"Almost everyone is silent on this matter."
"I wonder why …"
"Unless we are able to apply our legal tools and use the support of politicians to stop the abuse of minors, we will never win the battle against violence against women and children."
"– Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my satisfaction at the agreement reached between the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to split the content of the programme we are debating into two specific programmes."
"This agreement was actually brokered by the Commission, and for that I thank Commissioner Frattini."
"Having said that, I should like to express my support, my full support, for the report by Mrs Gröner, whom I congratulate, and in doing so I shall highlight an amendment that I consider particularly important, which is the one that specifically mentions national, regional and local authorities as targets of awareness-raising actions."
"I shall also explain why: a few days ago in Milan there were some cases of violence against young women; naturally, these episodes of violence caused outrage, but some comments were also made that once again confirm an attitude that is quite widespread among the authorities, that the victims are also somehow partly to blame for violent acts."
"You will all remember, I am sure, the so-called ‘jeans’ ruling; well, among the comments I shall quote the one made by the Prefect of Rome, who stated that the latest episode, when two French girls were raped after accepting a lift from two strangers, was due to imprudence more than anything else."
"Even though the prefect’s intentions were undoubtedly good, this statement reveals a way of thinking according to which, if a woman is raped, it is at least partly her own fault."
"Is being imprudent, however, a crime?"
"I do not think so, and I should not like to go back to the times when women were asked to stay at home in the evenings so as not to be imprudent."
"Well, then, I should like to point out that we are talking about programmes to ensure that the European Union develops as an area of freedom, and I emphasise ‘freedom’, as well as security and justice."
"Madam President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great defeat still, on this late summer’s day of 2006, to have to stand here and talk about gender-based violence, honour killings and genital mutilation."
"That this is the case shows that such behaviour is, in fact, still in some way accepted within society and something that we have not yet overcome. For as long as we do not agree that abuse, both physical and psychological, is also a violation of human rights for women and children, millions of women and children will be subjected to exactly that."
"One way of showing that we are agreed to signpost this as unacceptable behaviour is to approve and highlight such international agreements as exist – the UN Convention on Women’s Rights, the UN Convention on Children’s Rights, the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and the tool that the Daphne programme represents."
"I am appalled to hear that the Independence and Democracy Group will be voting against parts of this programme."
"Threats, violence and other outrages involving horrific activities such as genital mutilation all get explained away or justified at times on the grounds of tradition or culture."
"This means that we need to stir up a debate in workplaces, in schools, at the dinner table and even amongst the peace-keeping soldiers we send abroad in the name of the UN."
"Those countries with which we have agreements need support."
"I was speaking about this very subject with women in Kyiv in Ukraine just last Saturday."
"I have also discussed this a great deal with women’s groups from Turkey."
"There is much to do in this field."
"Many of the proposals in this report today are very constructive."
"We also need to review the scale of punishments."
"In Sweden, for example, the maximum punishment for grievous sexual attacks on children is the same as that for serious fraud."
"There is room for thought on this matter."
"In New York they have successfully reduced crime perpetrated against women and violence against women."
"I see this as a first step towards being able to achieve the same in Europe, but to do so requires us to agree on just how unacceptable and heinous this situation is."
"– Madam President, the mere fact that we are talking about violence against women in 2006 shows that we are in decline."
"Two and a half thousand years ago, in the Republic of Athens, in the time of Socrates, there was no crime, there was no violence against women."
"It was considered unacceptable while, two and a half thousand years later, we have this violence, this unchecked violence, against women."
"We must therefore take measures."
"I do not know if the Daphne programme suffices or if something more is required."
"Penalties must suddenly get stricter."
"Penalties against someone who rapes a woman are not strict."
"Today, in 2006, we have more prostitution of women than we did 50 years ago, after the war."
"Today, of all the women who come to our country, to Greece – which is not a rich country – from the former east bloc countries, half are extradited."
"This is a crime."
"In order for us to fight violence against women, therefore, we need first of all to fight the poverty that leads to violence."
"We need to fight drugs effectively."
"My country has more heroin-related deaths than anywhere else and it is the poorest country in the eurozone."
"We must therefore look effectively at prevention and at effective penalties for the guilty."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, as we have already heard said today, Daphne is the most important programme aimed against violence, and so it is all the more important that it should be kept separate from the anti-drug programme."
"Putting the two together in this way would certainly have resulted in even more misunderstandings and in incomprehension of what the European Union was up to, particularly among the persons affected by them, and I am glad that this is not going to happen."
"This programme is a successful one, and must be continued, as visibly and comprehensibly as possible, as a response to increasing violence, and this separation is helpful to this end."
"I am sure, too, that the doubling of its budget is not only encouraging but also necessary, constituting as it does a broadening of the range of goals and actions."
"I would particularly like to highlight the campaign against people-trafficking, in particular against the trafficking of women and children, which calls for a high degree of vigilance and a great deal of work in view of the need for extended networks and for the financial resources required to that end."
"I would like, then, to give my forthright support to Mrs Gröner’s proposal that cooperation projects to combat people-trafficking be extended to include third countries, since cooperation with countries of origin is vital."
"Despite all this, Daphne is no more than a drop in the ocean."
"It is particularly in the Member States that the campaign against violence must be continued with greater vigour, and must also be enshrined in law."
"I would refer in this regard to the eviction law, which has been implemented for some considerable time in Austria, and also in many other countries, the effect of which is that those who commit acts of violence are required to leave the home."
"I would also like to mention the anti-stalking law that is now in place in Austria, the object of which is to address the issue of psychological violence, something that is not yet taken seriously."
"– Today, we are once more discussing the fight against violence."
"It may seem unnecessary to discuss this issue again."
"However, nothing could be further from the truth."
"Every year, thousands of women and children are trafficked within the borders of the European Union to become the objects of sexual exploitation."
"There is much talk of prevention and of providing support for the victims."
"However, where are the actions of the services responsible for dealing with this phenomenon?"
"Of course, there is action taken simply for show."
"It yields little in the way of results other than generating media hype."
"What about the fact that there are labour camps in a large European Union Member State on the Mediterranean coast where, according to the press, 20 000 people from other Member States worked?"
"They worked fifteen hours a day."
"The barracks in which they lived were surrounded by barbed wire and patrolled by guards armed with firearms."
"People who did not want to work were even murdered."
"Rape, in full view of spouses, was a common occurrence."
"In spite of intervention by diplomatic services and pleas from escapees, the police only intervened after a few months."
"Yet the enlightened citizens of the European Union benefited from this slave labour."
"Is it possible that the local authorities did not know about it?"
"After all, the matter affected thousands of people."
"These events took place a few weeks ago."
"Thus, we are debating important matters which should have been resolved long ago."
"Some people, like the leader of the Socialists, create international uproar about controversial demonstrations not being permitted, yet we are turning a blind eye to the emergence of a new form ..."
"It is a shameful thing that violence against women has become a worldwide phenomenon today, in the face of which national borders are of no significance."
"Such violence causes great suffering and destroys the lives of millions of women and thereby of entire families."
"In Europe alone, every fifth woman is a victim of violence, the consequences of which can be measured in the damage done to their physical and mental health and to that of their children and family members."
"For violence may lurk in seemingly peaceful family homes as well as in intimacy in the workplace, in the increasingly harsh modes of behaviour between the sexes, in sexual harassment, and in its harshest form it manifests itself in enforced prostitution, which is the contemporary world’s version of slavery."
"We cannot ignore the fact that the countless forms of violent and sexually degrading behaviour arise from certain social customs and traditions that are unacceptable to Europeans."
"These include enforced genital mutilation and the institution of forced marriage."
"Sadly, these unacceptable forms of behaviour have also made their appearance within the EU."
"All of these phenomena fundamentally violate human rights, which constitute one of the cornerstones of the European Communities and of the Union."
"The defence of these rights require the cooperation of law enforcement and judicial authorities as well as the joint action of Member States and of the European institutions."
"The Daphne III Programme can count on widespread public support, for during the World Cup championships alone, our campaign against forced prostitution was able to garner 100 000 signatures and the assistance of Commissioner Frattini, as well as the voluntary collaboration of the police forces of the countries concerned."
"If we were able to keep sport clean, we should also strive to preserve the peace and cleanliness of family life and find the strength necessary for community action."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Gröner, for her outstanding report on the Daphne III programme."
"Violence against women is a large and growing problem within the countries of the EU."
"Many women and their children have their lives ruined as a result of violence and, especially, threats of violence."
"Every year, hundreds of women die in Europe as a result of domestic violence, with a large number of attempted murder cases being reported on top of that."
"It is therefore of extraordinary significance that violence against women and children be made a distinct point on the EU agenda."
"Violence against women and children is a special problem that requires special initiatives and special solutions."
"Parliament’s proposal focuses on the outrages that take place day in and day out in domestic settings and on changes that will force the national parliaments to take a stand on these serious issues."
"There is a need for a programme that focuses solely on violence and that can contribute to publicising this problem whilst at the same time helping to promote a public debate about violence."
"The taboo and silence around violence must be fought, and the Member States ought to be making a massive effort to inform people – both the victims and perpetrators of violence – of how to get help."
"The taboo is also a great obstacle in the way of preventative work, and we need to open the eyes of EU citizens to the many victims who live in daily fear of attack."
"Violence is not a private matter, irrespective of the area of life in which it occurs and of who perpetrates it and regardless of whether it takes place within a family or in public life or whether it be a case of violence by the state."
"Violence against women takes many forms – physical, psychological and sexual violence, enforced prostitution and the trafficking of women."
"The principal objective of the EU’s activities to counter violence is to prevent and combat all forms of violence in order to completely eliminate this form of crime that is also a serious violation of human rights."
"The fight against violence should be recognised as being part of the protection of our basic rights and freedoms."
"Madam President, we must firstly welcome the proposal presented on the initiative of Mrs Gröner and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, which promotes this specific programme, since in this way the scale of the problem is being acknowledged and specific measures to prevent and combat gender violence are being proposed."
"We must provide women with the means and resources required to escape a reality which, year after year, kills hundreds of women from all countries of the Union."
"Violence against women and children is a violation of basic fundamental rights and, furthermore, we must not forget that this violation is all the more serious when it affects certain groups, such as minorities and people living in poverty or the disabled."
"Given the alarming statistics on the victims of this violence, we must carry out a genuine social revolution, since we cannot forget that, behind the statistics and the numbers, there lies the history of thousands of women who every day have to suffer at the hands of those who abuse them merely because they are women."
"We must therefore strongly defend a specific programme which makes progress towards resolving a social problem with regard to which all public powers must act to promote a change that leads to a more egalitarian society."
"The Spanish Government has implemented a law against gender violence, with a clear commitment to combat this social scourge."
"Though it is true that that law cannot put an end overnight to the reality suffered by women, it offers significant support."
"This is the direction that the rest of the Union must take, making decisive commitments in the conviction that to do nothing at this point would mean turning our backs on thousands of women who are expecting us to respond."
"The next speaker ought to be Mrs Lévai, but she does not appear to be present in the Chamber either."
"That brings us to the end of the speakers’ list."
"In giving the floor to Commissioner Frattini, I will apologise to him for the House’s unruly state, which is attributable to our keenness to move to the vote."
"Nevertheless, Commissioner, the rapporteur and the whole House are interested to hear what you will be saying to us."
"I have to inform the honourable lady Member that I cannot add her to the end of the speakers’ list."
"No, I am sorry, but you were not at your seat when I called you."
"The same applies to you as to Mrs Kauppi."
"Colleagues, if somebody is not in their seat during a debate, it is the President of the sitting’s decision not to give them the floor afterwards."
"It is a question of politeness, Mrs Kauppi, to be here not only for your speaking time, but also to listen to others."
"Madam President, I should like to make a point of order about working to the agenda."
"I contacted the Sittings Secretariat at approximately 11.15 this morning."
"I was told that my speaking time would be postponed until 9.00 this evening."
"As soon as I found out that my name had appeared on the list, I printed out my speech, ran to the elevators and came here, because I noticed that I needed to be here before 9 p.m.!"
"Of course I understand that I cannot use my speaking time now, but I really regret that the Sittings Secretariat informed Members so late that the debate would continue and not end at 11.30, as it was supposed to."
"That is not the way to treat colleagues in this House."
"Mrs Kauppi, I am a long-standing Member of this House."
"I know that it is difficult to know exactly when your speaking time will be, but I say again, and with all due humility, that I personally – you may think differently – find it polite to listen to the debate, to be here before your speaking time."
"If that was the case each time then this could not happen."
"Your name came up on the screen, as did other Members’ names – such as that of Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg, for example."
"They were surprised that some colleagues were not here, so their speaking time was brought forward by five minutes."
"I cannot help that."
"I can only invite everyone who speaks in a debate to be here from the beginning of the debate."
"If that were the case then this would not happen to you again."
"That applies to everyone who was absent from the Chamber when I called their names."
"I called five or six people who were not here today and so they could not speak."
"Normally, when we have a lot of time, I am very happy, as every Vice-President is, to add names at the end of a debate."
"However, we cannot do that today as we have to vote on the report."
"I should now like to give the floor to Commissioner Frattini."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise to you all for the late arrival of my flight to Strasbourg this morning, which prevented me from hearing the first part of the debate; my colleague Mr Kovács, however, was here."
"In general, I sincerely appreciate the way in which Parliament and the Commission have worked on the Daphne programme in recent months."
"I also heartily thank the rapporteur and the chairman of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality."
"They are well aware that about a year ago I said right from the beginning that I supported the idea of separating the Daphne part dealing with violence towards women and children from the part dealing with drugs prevention, so as to avoid inappropriately confusing the issues."
"I am very pleased that there is general agreement today in that respect and that it will be possible to focus more seriously and more emphatically, with about twice as much funding as was provided in the past, on the issue of preventing and reacting to all kinds of violence that affect children and women."
"In particular, I believe that the Commission is not only ready, but also very happy to continue cooperating closely with Parliament on implementation measures, in the sense of keeping Parliament continually informed about how the Daphne programmes are being allocated and about the concrete results of the programmes and projects that are actually financed."
"There is an important topic that I heard mentioned by a few Members during the latter part of the debate, which is the role of the Member States and the role of Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this subject seems particularly important to me because we cannot just underline the role of the Member States, the police forces and the courts in pursuing and punishing acts of violence at a national level."
"There is a need for Europe to speak out loudly against any form of violence that increasingly affects women and children."
"That is why the Daphne programme is necessary, and that is how it provides added value. It does not detract from the duty of the national police forces or courts to pursue and punish individual cases of violence at a national level."
"It is our duty, however, to make Europe speak out against crime, which is increasingly transnational and directed against women – for instance, all the kinds of traffic aimed at forced prostitution – and against children – as in everything concerning the horrendous crime of paedophilia, which is more and more becoming a transnational crime."
"Anyone who still has any doubts needs to be assured that the value added by European action in this area is quite obvious."
"I shall now make just a very few comments on certain amendments highlighting some particular kinds of violence."
"We must be careful not to exclude other kinds of violence, but in what sense?"
"In the sense that, if the draft text makes reference just to certain kinds of actions for which Daphne may grant funding, we risk excluding other forms of violence for which Daphne should also provide funding."
"I would prefer a more general wording, which covers prevention and reaction to all kinds of violence, without specifying some and therefore without the risk of excluding others."
"One particular amendment concerns the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children."
"A proposed compromise amendment, Amendment 72, confirms the possibility of funding this federation, but it adds another organisation called ENOC."
"I support the compromise amendment in that, on the one hand, it enables us to grant funding to very specific organisations that are already operational, but with this second organisation, on the other hand, the range of potential funding beneficiaries is made a little broader."
"Two final remarks: the first is that much has been said about a European telephone helpline to help children in difficulties."
"The initiative is extremely important, and I can tell you now that we are already preparing a draft framework decision."
"We were working on it – I was working on it – when I presented the communication on children’s rights to you in June."
"I can now tell you that preparations for the framework decision on the single European helpline are under way and we shall actually submit it very soon."
"It is an initiative that will really help a great deal, and so I also thank those who referred to it during the debate."
"The final issue has been touched upon by some Members: the idea of having a European directive against violence towards women."
"I very much like the idea and it is a very interesting one, but I have one concern: finding an appropriate legal basis."
"We should find one: I do not know whether there is a suitable legal basis in the Treaties for a directive against violence towards women, but if we succeed in resolving this aspect of the legal basis then I shall be politically very much in favour of the idea of harmonising at least the European guidelines for severely punishing cases of criminal violence against women."
"This is the beginning of a thought process that we can take up again later."
"I am grateful to everyone who has taken part in this debate, and I am ready to continue to cooperate with you on these issues."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"Colleagues, I should just like to remind those who were not here earlier why we have had problems today with the timing of the debate."
"Commissioner Mandelson decided to speak for 28 minutes instead of the 12 or 15 minutes maximum."
"We must clarify such things in the relationship between Parliament and the Commission."
"We cannot solve it today, but that is what causes the problems."
"I apologise for the fact that voting time has had to be delayed."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, I would like, speaking on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, to thank you and seriously urge you to do what you have just been talking about by drafting a legal instrument to actively combat violence against children, women and young people."
"Today, there was support for this proposal from almost all the groups in this House."
"I ask you to take up this debate now in order that we may achieve a result without delay."
"You can rely on our cooperation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at 12 noon."
"– The Daphne Programme has delivered considerable progress in the fight against violence against women, young people and children."
"A vital instrument for raising awareness and for introducing good practice, Daphne has made it possible to enlist the help of NGOs while raising public awareness of forms of violence long considered taboo."
"Quite apart from these results, which must be consolidated and boosted by increased funding, this is concrete proof of the added value of action taken at European level, which reminds us that the original idea of Europe is that of a political group founded on fundamental values such as the protection of vulnerable people."
"This, rather than economic power, is the main thrust of European commitment today."
"Apart from the stated ‘objectives of ambitious results’, we wish to point out the need for clear, credible objectives to reduce violence still further, because much remains to be done."
"Accordingly, we can welcome the helpdesk services provided to the organisations involved, and the extension of aid to a broader range of NGOs, which has become necessary due to the international proliferation of organised crime."
"We should like to point out that the success of the Daphne-funded programmes is down to the involvement of the actors carrying out the vital outreach and follow-up work."
"The next item is voting time."
"."
"Mr President, in 2002, Parliament and the Council agreed to change the legal basis of the regulation on the transfer of hazardous chemicals and pesticides, a follow-on from the Rotterdam Convention."
"An overwhelming majority in this House was in favour of the change, and even the Council agreed to it without dissent."
"The Commission, however, went to the Court of Justice to fight this change, resulting in years of uncertainty for the sector, with the Court’s ruling only complicating matters even further."
"Parliament and the Council had selected Article 175 as the legal basis, while the Commission had opted for Article 133."
"The Court decided, much to the surprise of all parties involved, to adopt both articles as the legal basis."
"This course of affairs is not unique, unfortunately."
"The Commission, Parliament and Council have failed to agree on the legal basis in various areas."
"Recently, there was the example of the dossier on the transport of waste substances, for which I happen to be the rapporteur."
"I should like to urge the three parties to desist, in future, from thrashing these choices out in court, but instead to arrive at a solution together."
"The main thing is that clear policy is adopted on the choice of legal basis."
"We have now had three comparable cases before the Court, which have all led to different rulings."
"That is hardly conducive to the consistency of legislation, and also leads to a whole procedure of repair legislation such as that on which we are about to vote."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission and Council, together with this House, to arrive at a clear procedure for selecting legal bases."
"That is something that can only benefit the quality of legislation."
"Mr President, President of the Commission, Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank you warmly for your invitation to come and speak here in the European Parliament."
"I also thank you, too, Mr President, for your kind words of introduction."
"We last met during your visit to Finland in early June, and you are welcome to our country at any time."
"The directly elected Members represent an important part of the democratic process both in the European Union and in its Member States."
"Your powers of influence are considerable: you have a chance effectively to promote the aims of the entire Union in your day-to-day work."
"The Finnish Presidency wants to work very closely with the European Parliament."
"This week several of the ministers in our Government will be here, ready and willing to engage in debate with you, and I believe that the discussions will be very useful."
"The importance of European cooperation and integration to promote peace, stability and prosperity in our continent is obvious, and the results are striking."
"Our efforts are based on a common set of values."
"They are freedom, democracy, a respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and a commitment to the principles of the rule of law."
"Each Member State must implement these values in its own way, but together we often achieve better results."
"A united European Union is also a much stronger player internationally than any one single Member State."
"The European Union’s international role has strengthened significantly in recent years."
"The EU is a visible and important actor in matters ranging from development to crisis management."
"More and more, global threats to security are not of a military nature."
"Climate change, pollution, natural disasters, contagious diseases and economic uncertainty are threats which we cannot prepare for using military means."
"That is why we try to promote multilateralism and reach international agreements to combat the threats and dangers that are common to all of us."
"International crime is a great concern to us all."
"Close cooperation between Member States to combat the threat of terrorism is vitally important, as is effective cooperation with third countries."
"If there is to be security on a broad scale and if it is to be endorsed globally, it needs to be linked to human rights and development."
"The European Union’s security strategy is based on this premise, which has been adopted by the United Nations."
"We can have an influence on the creation of a more just world and the realisation of the UN’s objectives for the millennium."
"It is one of the strengths of the Union that it has at its disposal a wide range of resources, from humanitarian aid to its policies on agriculture, trade, development and the environment."
"The EU’s development policy can also be seen as part of its security policy."
"The EU is the developing countries’ biggest development cooperation and trading partner, and is the world’s biggest contributor of development aid."
"I hope and believe that the EU institutions work together closely to reach a decision on financing for development in order to guarantee an uninterrupted flow of EU financing and, in particular, diverse action on the part of the EU from the start of 2007 also."
"There is a link between development and trade."
"It is not always an automatically positive one: it requires political will and know-how."
"This way trade can be made to boost economic growth, the reduction in poverty and social development in the developing countries."
"The developing countries themselves, however, must also be prepared to implement national reforms, promote good government and eradicate corruption."
"Access to markets alone will not necessarily be enough for fairer globalisation: special action will also be needed to support the poorest countries in order to help them to function more successfully."
"In October a joint sitting will be held for both Ministers for Trade and Ministers for Development with the aim of achieving a strong commitment on the part of the EU to the World Trade Organisation’s ‘aid for trade’ recommendations and their speedy application in practice."
"The matter of the cross-border movement of people also needs to be addressed with exactly the same wide-ranging approach."
"I believe that this issue is being discussed in Finland at the Lahti Summit."
"I also believe that we will be ready to go forward with decision-making in December."
"Questions of human rights are a delicate issue."
"We have agreed that they need to be legally and ethically binding, but it is a very challenging task to endorse them with practical policies."
"The European Union’s human rights policy must nevertheless be founded on exactly the same rules in different parts of the world."
"Fortunately, we also have good partners, mainly, of course, in the shape of the United Nations."
"In Europe, an important partner for us is the Council of Europe, whose expertise we should be able to exploit more effectively."
"It is still an important objective for the EU to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights."
"A report by Luxembourg’s Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker, contains excellent proposals for closer cooperation between the two organisations, but we have to work to implement the contents of this report."
"Both acting to prevent conflict and crisis management itself have become more important than ever for the Union."
"Allow me to wax nostalgic for a moment."
"When I was Foreign Affairs Minister for Finland, my Swedish colleague, Lena Hjelm Wallén, and I launched an initiative to develop the EU’s crisis management capability, though we certainly did not dare to hope for such a speedy development."
"Things turned out otherwise, however."
"The initiative was adopted with the Treaty of Amsterdam and today the cornerstone of the Union’s fast evolving crisis management policy is military and civil development and their successful coordination."
"Having wide-ranging influence is the surest path to the settlement of conflicts."
"For example, sending an EU crisis management contingent to the Democratic Republic of Congo to support the UN has already proven necessary, as when the results of the first round of the elections were made known violent clashes erupted."
"Hopefully, the situation will now remain stable, so that the campaigning and second round of elections can proceed peacefully and in a way that respects the democratic process."
"After the elections, the country must quickly move on to the reconstruction and development phase."
"The EU is already now working to reform the country’s security sector."
"The European Union is also working hard to resolve the difficult situation in Darfur."
"The Union is the biggest supporter of the African Union’s African Mission in Sudan peacekeeping operation."
"Decisions regarding the reinforcement of the peacekeeping operation and transitioning it to one under the control of the UN need to be implemented fast, because the human suffering in the region must not be allowed to continue any longer."
"There are thus ever-growing expectations with regard to international action on the part of the European Union."
"A unified Union is a strong player, as the situation in Lebanon has demonstrated."
"The EU has been active in endeavouring to find a political solution, first in establishing UN Security Council Resolution 1701 and now in its comprehensive implementation."
"It is, however, vital that the parties involved will show commitment to its implementation."
"The Union’s determined action has strengthened confidence in the EU as a peace-broker in the region."
"We obviously cannot succeed in this alone, but the European Union’s role may be highly significant."
"The Member States of the European Union have taken a major role in the UN’s extended UNIFIL operation, which lends support to the frail ceasefire and attempts at establishing lasting peace in the region as a whole."
"The decision to take a responsible role at the extraordinary General Affairs and External Relations Council on 25 August was a turning point in reinforcing the role of UNIFIL."
"The Member States were able to take some decisions that were very tough in the international context."
"They are committed to sending approximately 7 000 peacekeeping troops to support the UNIFIL operation."
"The entire UN operation is being headed by us Europeans, first by France and then by Italy."
"It is important, however, that the countries that send troops to support the operation are not just countries in the European Union."
"This way the parties involved will have much greater confidence in the operation’s success."
"The situation in Lebanon is complex, and is not one that just concerns security policy: it is also a political, an economic and a social problem."
"We have to support the Lebanese Government, both with regard to extending its authority throughout Lebanon and its taking responsibility for the reconstruction process."
"To improve the country’s difficult humanitarian situation, the total amount in aid granted by the European Commission and the Member States is now more than EUR 300 million."
"The conference in Stockholm late last week on the humanitarian situation in Lebanon, and in the Palestinian territories too, was a real success."
"The amount of aid given and the number of new aid commitments have been substantial."
"In addition to granting direct humanitarian aid, the Union must play a major role in the reconstruction work and in repairing the damage done to the environment."
"Lasting peace in the Middle East will require a solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians."
"The EU had a central role in establishing the road map, and now too the Union must show initiative in promoting a comprehensive plan for peace."
"Everyone has to commit to the existence of two secure and viable countries."
"Trust also needs to be built at the level of civil society and not just between governments, which in itself is obviously important."
"I believe that if women are closely involved in the peace process, the chances for a lasting solution will increase."
"I have already worked with the UN’s women’s organisation UNIFEM, which supports dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian women."
"We will also be raising this issue during the forthcoming UN General Assembly session."
"Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow you will be discussing the Middle East in depth in plenary."
"It is vitally important that in the future the European Union shows determination in establishing stability and security throughout the Middle East."
"The Middle East is our neighbour."
"Representatives of the EU have demonstrated initiative in the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme."
"Iran must comply with the UN Security Council’s resolution and now actually seize the opportunity for genuine dialogue."
"In the weeks and months to come, the EU must persist with its programme of active and wide-ranging diplomacy."
"The United States of America will be a key partner for the EU in this, not forgetting the other permanent members of the Security Council."
"The fate of Russia and that of the rest of Europe have been interwoven for centuries."
"Today, Russia is a strategic partner of the EU."
"The Russian leadership has repeatedly stated that its European choice is an irrevocable one."
"Broadly-based cooperation, ranging from trade to human rights, will benefit both parties and will also lend support to Russia’s democratic development and stability."
"Prominent on the agenda in recent times have been questions of energy."
"It is good that the EU should be aiming for a common view on energy, even if choice of energy sources is the business of the individual nation."
"Most of the issues, however, are the sort where cooperation is vitally important."
"Energy policy and the EU’s external policy need to be more tightly interwoven, so that the Union’s external relations can help guarantee reliability of supply."
"In my opinion, it is in this area that the Union and Russia can very clearly establish a positive interdependency."
"This energy dialogue between the EU and Russia must be built on trust."
"We need to try and identify common interests."
"We must all, furthermore, strive to combat climate change by cutting emissions, saving energy, developing cleaner technologies and promoting the use of renewable energy sources."
"After all, we know that current energy resources are not limitless."
"The EU must also aspire to broadly based cooperation with Russia in the area of the environment."
"There is a comprehensive Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the Union and Russia and additional roadmaps covering four jointly agreed areas. These are the economy, freedom, justice and security, external security, and research, education and culture."
"The last of these is by no means a less important area of cooperation, even though these issues are not very often in the public eye."
"For example, student exchange programmes and learning about each other’s culture are very practical ways of getting to know one another better."
"The term of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the Union and Russia expires at the end of next year."
"It will be our aim at the EU-Russia Summit in November to agree with Russia on the start of talks to renew the agreement arrangements."
"I also believe that when the Northern Dimension is reorganised as a joint policy between the EU, Russia, Norway and Iceland it will make for closer relations between us and these partner countries."
"The Northern Dimension’s main focus is on environmental cooperation and social and health issues."
"Union enlargement has enhanced stability and security in Europe and has benefited all the Member States economically, the old ones as well as the new."
"Successful enlargement also reinforces the EU’s international role."
"I think that the European Union must be open in the future to all European countries that meet the conditions of membership."
"Developments in the countries of Central Europe, in Turkey, in Croatia and in the Western Balkans are a clear indication of the power of the EU membership perspective as an incentive for reform, although, of course, the fundamental aim of the changes must be each country’s desire to improve the ordinary lives and security of its own people."
"The people will value membership on the basis of their everyday experiences."
"At the European Council in December there will be a general debate on enlargement."
"It is then that together we will look at how the enlargement process should be taken forward."
"You know very well that in June the European Council held a debate on the Union’s absorption capacity."
"The result in the end was that no new membership criteria should be set, but the existing criteria should be strictly adhered to."
"It is in the interests of both the European Union and the countries that aspire to membership that accession to the Union should only occur when the applicant country can assume responsibility for the obligations that come with membership and fulfil the conditions of membership."
"We, on the other hand, must respect the promises which we have made to the applicant countries and ensure that we are able to absorb new Member States."
"We should also remember what the list of requirements does not contain."
"We have common values, but we are not aiming at establishing one culture."
"On the contrary, cultural diversity is a source of Europe’s richness and strength."
"Varying political views are a natural part of Europe."
"You and your political groups are a unique example of political party cooperation that extends across national borders."
"A multiform Union needs multidimensional parliamentarism."
"This has been a long speech, and I know that we all have a busy autumn ahead, both you in Parliament and us in the country to hold the presidency and the other Member States too."
"This week Finland is hosting the ASEM Summit between the EU and Asian countries."
"ASEM has already in practice developed into a form of cooperation between two regional groups and working with an integrated Union has also encouraged countries in Asia to engage in the closer two-way coordination of preparation for issues to be discussed."
"I believe that it has become clear to all of us that ‘Global Challenges – Joint Responses’ is a principle and objective that we all share, and it is also ASEM’s motto."
"To conclude, I would like say that there were two good reasons for my journey here to Strasbourg."
"You are one of them: the first reason why I am here."
"I will confess to you the other reason: I also intend to pay a visit to the Council of Europe."
"I hope by doing this I will be lending practical support to that notion of broadly based European cooperation that I myself have proposed here to you."
"Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you all and take up your valuable time, and I sincerely wish you the very best during this autumn’s parliamentary term and a successful outcome to your endeavours."
"We will now continue with voting time."
"Mr President, what is at issue here is the funding of the programme."
"When we vote on Amendment 74, which has been tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, we will be voting on the sum of EUR 125 million, and so I ask that we vote on this amendment first."
"If it is adopted, then Amendment 71 – which refers to the sum of EUR 120 million – will lapse."
"That is in fact how they are arranged in the voting list."
"Mr President, as I see it, this amendment is actually superfluous on the grounds that we rejected taxation on the basis of use when we voted on Amendment 11."
"That will be reviewed."
"It may well be the case."
"I would not venture to make an decision now, but that will be noted in the Minutes and reviewed."
"Mr President, I do think it makes sense that we should vote on this amendment."
"."
"Mr President, excuse me but I think we have voted on it already, so we can move on to the next amendment."
"Mr President, before we proceed to the final vote, I would like to ask the rapporteur to say something."
"To judge by what I have taken note of, this vote has been utterly chaotic."
"At one moment we are in favour of taxing pollutants, the next we are against."
"At one moment we are in favour of taxation on the basis of fuel consumption, the next we are against it."
"At one moment we are in favour of taking efficiency into account, the next we decide not to."
"In the space of a moment we go from wanting to retain registration taxes to wanting to do away with them."
"Perhaps you could tell me what to do now we have come to the final vote;"
"I really have no idea what I am supposed to do."
"That would be an unusual course of action, since it is often, unfortunately, the case that votes are not totally consistent, but if the rapporteur were to give her opinion on the matter, I am sure we would all be much obliged to her."
"."
"Mr President, I agree that it has been chaotic, both thanks to us and perhaps some other people here in the Chamber."
"However, when I look at the end result, I would propose that we vote for it, because the key issues for me have been voted through. I am sure that when we go through it with the administration here we can check some of it and make it better."
"The main items for me are important."
"I think we should vote for it in order to give the signal to the Commission so that we can make progress in changing this tax system."
"We have chosen to abstain."
"This is because, in our judgment, the proposed aid should not be funded as part of the agricultural budget since it does not have the character of an agricultural subsidy but, rather, constitutes regional aid."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, there are many positive aspects in the Stubb report on multilingualism in our institutions."
"Mr Stubb is absolutely right to emphasise that multilingualism, of which the cost is naturally an important factor, is a political choice to preserve the characteristics of each of our particular identities and to prevent cultural uniformity, which would be the inevitable outcome were one language to dominate."
"He should apply the same logic to the slightly higher cost of interpreting in Strasbourg, because the choice of Strasbourg is also a political choice, symbolic of German-French reconciliation."
"I should like to take this opportunity to protest once again against the scandal of which non-attached MEPs are the victims."
"Non-attached MEPs are not afforded the same interpreting and translation resources as MEPs belonging to a group, which is at variance with the Court of Justice ruling."
"The Bureau has looked into this matter but, almost two years on, has yet to reach any solution."
"This discriminatory situation must stop."
". Although respect for the official languages of all Member States is enshrined in the Treaties, repeated attempts have been made to restrict the number of working languages in the EU, with bias always shown towards the languages of the countries with largest populations."
"Take, for example, the recent case of the ‘European indicator of language competence’, which comprises only English, French, German, Spanish and Italian."
"Although this report considers ‘multilingualism’ a ‘key feature’ of the EU, its overarching perspective is one of budgetary restriction, argued on administrative grounds, which may undermine this right enshrined in the Treaties."
"We therefore reiterate that we staunchly oppose any attempt to restrict the use of any official (and working) language in the EU based on the idea that spending on interpreting is high."
"We also criticise the criteria for deciding the languages to be used in the EU-ACP parliamentary assemblies, which obviate the use of Portuguese. This is discrimination."
"Furthermore, we are opposed to the way in which, on the pretext of reducing the budget, the number of interpreters in Parliament, the Commission and the Council is being reduced, attempts are being made to create a single interpreting service and interpreters’ rights in respect of contractual obligations, timetables and working conditions are coming under attack."
". Mr President, I support the broad thrust of this report and criticism of inefficiency, though would stress my own commitment to multilingualism in our workings."
"Yes, it costs money to translate our workings, but it is a crucial component of mutual respect that each language has equal dignity to all others."
"Of course, it remains open to groups of MEPs to find other ways of working, this already happens and I would expect that process to continue and expand."
"As an institution we must maintain equal access for all, to do otherwise would undermine our democratic foundations."
". Parliament is right in reiterating today that multilingualism reflects the cultural and linguistic diversity within the Union, which must be retained."
"It is also right to state that citizens are entitled to communicate with the European institutions in all the official languages of the Union."
"It also underlines that those elected are entitled to speak in their own language during all official EP meetings."
"After all, linguistic expertise could never be an additional election criterion."
"I would take this opportunity to pay tribute to the many hundreds of interpreters who, day in and day out, do an excellent and high-quality job."
"The fact that all of this costs money is a normal price to pay for European democracy to function properly."
"I support the proposals, where possible, to cut down on costs by discouraging very late cancellations and applications."
"Moreover, the fact that the average interpreting cost in the EP is higher than that in the Council or the Commission is also attributable to our forced monthly move to Strasbourg, where local resources are limited, so that Parliament’s interpreting costs in Strasbourg rise by 13%."
"We could therefore save money by calling a halt to this absurd monthly relocation."
". Multilingualism is an essential part of being able to communicate in the EU institutions."
"The cost of being able to do this increases because of Strasbourg."
"To avoid this cost there should be one seat for the European Parliament and that should be in Brussels."
"The European Parliament is the only parliament in the world which has no say over where it sits."
"This has to change once and for all."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr de Grandes Pascual on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a seven-year multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency, providing it with substantial financial resources for carrying out its new duties, which involve: combating accidental or deliberate pollution caused by ships."
"The Agency’s idea of chartering commercial ships, known as ‘stand-by ships’, which would interrupt their commercial activities in order to be used in the area of an accident, deserves to be tested."
"Nevertheless, we should carefully examine the interim reports on this system since I wonder whether it might be more effective simply to outsource this security service, which, by nature, will only be needed for one-off incidents."
"The sums in question are not inconsiderable. The cost of these ‘stand-by ships’ for 2007-2013 represents EUR 134 million of the 154 million granted to the agency."
"Finally, I unreservedly support the appropriations proposed for the establishment of a satellite imaging service which must support the Member States in their fight against illegal dumping and accidental oil spills."
"The June List supports EU cooperation when it comes to cross-border environmental issues."
"However, we do not believe that additional resources should be allocated to the Maritime Safety Agency."
"The important activities that the rapporteur proposes be allocated to the Agency can better be taken care of outside the framework of the Agency."
"The June List is critical of the huge number of agencies, authorities and decentralised bodies that have been set up within the EU."
"I have thus voted against this report."
". This report places the activities of the Lisbon-based European Maritime Safety Agency within the context of actions aimed at improving maritime safety and preventing pollution caused by ships in the waters of EU Member States."
"These activities are defined as being additional to, and in support of, the work done by coastal countries in the fight against, and prevention of, marine pollution. They help to improve the early detection of pollution and to identify the vessels responsible."
"The better the public resources given to the different coastal countries for appropriate, rapid and effective intervention, the more effective will be the prevention and combating of marine pollution."
"Aside from the other important factors that must be assessed, this report proposes to broaden the scope of the regulation to include not only oil maritime pollution but also any kind of pollution caused by vessels including liquid noxious substances, and this is something we welcome."
"The report proposes what it refers to as ‘minimum funding’ for this agency, and the fulfilment of the objectives for which it was set up would be hampered – still further, we would add – if this minimum funding were not forthcoming."
". Given the recent environmental disasters caused by vessel spills, the proposal on which we voted just now is of particular importance."
"The measures proposed by the report strike me as the most appropriate way of improving the functioning of the European Maritime Safety Agency. They introduce a new, long-term vision afforded by the fact that the budget is defined for a seven-year period (2007-2013), and provide for the contracting of stand-by ships for combating spills."
"Of similar importance is the creation of a new imagery centre, proposed by Parliament, to help identify illegal spills and discharges, which will improve the speed and effectiveness of the response."
"This proposal is of particular importance to Portugal, a country with a large Exclusive Economic Area, which hundreds of vessels pass through every day and which has previously suffered from accidental spills and environmental disasters."
". Pollution caused by ships is extremely concerning."
"The proposal to allow ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth is something I have been campaigning strongly against."
"I have been in constant communication with the European Commission regarding these controversial transfers and it is aware of the strength of local feeling in Fife, as well as the very grave risks to the local environment."
"They have told me that the transfer of oil between vessels entails a considerable risk of oil being spilt into the sea."
"We cannot allow ship-to-ship oil transfers to go ahead."
"I urge the rapporteur and the Commission to press for an early conclusion to be reached by the sub-committee assessing the risks attached to pollution from hydrocarbons."
"– Mr President, I wanted to explain that our objection to Amendment 68 on street children was not to this category per se, but to the categorisation of victims, which is something that the Commissioner emphasised."
"Similarly, as regards Amendment 70, we want a 'hotline', not a 'help line'."
"As this is not clear, we opposed it, even though we agree with the idea of the European telephone line."
"What I have just said concerns the amendments to the Gröner report."
"I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mrs Gröner, on the draft legislative resolution, at first reading, of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing for the period 2007-2013 the specific programme ‘Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information’."
"I support Parliament’s initiatives aimed at separating the problem of violence from that of drug use."
"The European Union must, in a politically visible manner, improve the way it fights all forms of violence, particularly against women, children and adolescents."
"In the humanist civilisation that we are building, physical, sexual or psychological violence, including the threat of such acts, and the arbitrary deprivation or restriction of freedom, in public or private life, are a violation of the fundamental values of the Union, which include the right to life, to security, to freedom, to dignity and to physical and emotional integrity."
"It represents an obstacle to the safe, free and fair exercise of citizenship."
"With regard to the scourge of drugs, if we are not able to prohibit it effectively, I support any programme of prevention and increasing public awareness of this painful problem, particularly amongst the young."
". – I abstained in the final vote because of the approval of Amendment 67."
"Otherwise, the document is acceptable and in many respects excellent, but I cannot consent that the fight against violence towards children be carried out partly through ‘the inclusion of new family models’, or that the European Union should ‘bring added value’ to the actions undertaken by the Member States partly by promoting new family models."
"In fact, everyday experience and a great deal of psychological and sociological research prove that the greatest violence perpetrated against children is the break-up of their parents' emotional relationships, the stability and certainty of which are assured – I mean to the greatest possible extent – by marriage."
"It is also well known that children need both a male and a female reference figure."
"The idea that encouraging homosexual unions and devaluing marriage means fighting to protect children from violence is therefore unacceptable."
". I voted in favour of the Gröner report on ‘The fight against violence (Daphne)’ (2007/2013), given the need to provide continuity for this successful project in the fight against violence, which continues to affect children, young people and women in Europe and around the world, and to protect the fundamental rights enshrined in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Preventing and combating violence against children, young people and women, and protecting victims and groups at risk (Daphne III) require a separate programme."
"It is necessary to inform, and raise awareness among, the citizens regarding the problem of violence, for example by promoting the European Year against violence against women in 2007. The programme must be given the necessary mechanisms and must work closely with the various NGOs, which have an important role in society in this area."
". We welcome the adoption of our amendment aimed at strengthening the Daphne Programme."
"With the adoption of this proposal by our group, which I undersigned, the budget for implementing this instrument will rise to EUR 125 million for 2007-2013, from the EUR 116 850 000 provided for in the Gröner report."
"The rapporteur had proposed that this figure be increased to EUR 120 million, although she also voted in favour of our proposal, which led to its adoption."
"Accordingly, the Daphne III programme has a better chance of helping to prevent and combat violence perpetrated against children, young people and women, and to protect victims."
"Zero tolerance of violence entails greater political involvement, constant endeavour and consistent action in all Member States."
". All violence, whether physical, psychological or sexual, is a serious infringement of a human being’s right to life, security, freedom and dignity."
"When directed against the weak, namely children, young people or women, violence is also a serious threat to their physical and mental health."
"These actions also have very serious consequences for the psychological and social development of whole families and communities."
"Unfortunately, violence is still an everyday occurrence in all the Member States of the European Union."
"So far, the joint action taken to prevent and to speak out about this problem, which has often been marginalised or viewed as shameful, has merely been the first timid step in the fight against violence."
"A further programme, Daphne III, with a budget of 115 million euros, aims to prevent and combat violence in all its forms, both in the public and the private sphere."
"It aims to protect children, young people and women from violence through preventative measures and to provide support and protection for potential victims."
"In order for the Daphne programme to be successful, it must be visible to the citizens."
"In addition to actions such as providing support and assistance to non-governmental organisations, institutions, organisations and associations, we also need to conduct effective campaigns to sensitise public opinion to the problem of violence and in particular to the problem of human trafficking involving women and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation."
"Aid does not simply mean short-term actions, but also helping the victims of violence to gain access to the job market, for example, thereby facilitating their efficient integration into society."
"With this in mind, the initiative for a European Year of Combating Violence Against Women deserves our strong support."
"Naturally, the June List wants to play its part in the fight against violence against women, but this report would mean that the EU would have a legal basis from which to interfere in the Member States’ most sensitive areas, namely legislation and preventative measures against violence."
"The current Member States do not share a common point of view in these areas, while their legal cultures also differ."
"What is more, this report has been drawn up in a vague way."
"Parliament’s proposals contain too many unclear terms whilst at the same time explaining to the Member States how they are to conduct the fight against violence and the oppression of women."
"A clear example of this is Amendment 14, which would tacitly recognise that certain male groups are more inclined to violent behaviour towards their women than other, prosperous men of different ethnicity."
"This claim is not backed up either by statistics or references to scientific studies."
"Parliament’s proposals also fail to take account of the cultural and legal problems that they would cause the Member States."
"The June List has thus voted against the report."
". I voted in favour of the successful amendments which call for the setting-up of a Europe-wide child helpline, and to continue the helpdesk service to NGOs."
"I also voted in favour of the amendment which includes the fight against domestic violence in the Daphne programme."
"I welcome the overwhelming vote in favour of the report, and hope that the programme will succeed in strengthening the ongoing fight against violence."
". I and my British Conservative colleagues abhor all violence perpetrated against women and children."
"National programmes in this regard should be the primary means of countering this important social problem as national governments and parliaments and local agencies are best placed to have knowledge and understanding of the issues at stake."
"While we support many of the sentiments and specific collaborative ideas in this report, we have decided to abstain on the final vote as it calls for the ‘identification of a legal basis for combating violence ... under current European legislation’."
"This statement and others in the report point to increasing communitarisation, which we do not believe is necessary or desirable as it risks undermining national and local counter-violence strategies."
". First of all I would like to express my support for the position that the struggle on behalf of vulnerable groups continues to require separate consideration and a separate EU programme in the next budget cycle."
"I fear that combining this problem – which in itself calls for joint and differentiated treatment – with other areas may endanger concerted and effective action on the part of Europe."
"At the same time – partly as a result of past expansion and partly in view of the expansion still to come – one of Europe’s least often addressed social crises is the social protection and integration of the Roma."
"These groups as a whole already suffer from considerable oppression, but it is the Roma women and children who are particularly in danger, for they are daily exposed to the threat of violence."
"The same may be said regarding refugee and migrant women and children, who are also visibly subjected to both external and internal oppression."
"To illustrate the humanitarian catastrophe linked to illegal migration, it should suffice to say that over a good decade and a half more than 5 000 people lost their lives in the Mediterranean migratory wave, within which, of course, the weakest groups are once again at greatest risk."
"I should add that among society’s most marginalised members, the gravest danger is the horror of forced prostitution and sexual coercion, which are often linked to various forms of organised crime such as human trafficking and drug trade."
"I am convinced that these various problems can be resolved only through long-term and complex plans of action and European-wide cooperation."
"I truly believe that the European Parliament will be at the vanguard of such efforts."
"."
"I welcome this report, which introduces a programme to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women and to protect victims and groups at risk."
"Physical, sexual and psychological violence against children, young people and women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life, should not be tolerated throughout the EU and should be seen as constituting a breach of their right to life, safety, freedom, dignity and physical and emotional integrity."
"Member States also need to recognise that genital mutilation constitutes a particular form of violence against women with short-term and long-term detrimental effects on their health, and that the main victims are members of minority communities."
"In order to achieve the objectives of this report, I agree that clear and credible targets are required, such as halving the number of people who fall victim to violence and human trafficking over the next ten years."
"I welcome the establishment of a think-tank to provide guidelines to the Commission on the social, cultural and political context as regards the selection of projects and complementary actions which will aid the Daphne II programme significantly."
". Violence against women, children and young people is an ever-increasing phenomenon and a fundamental breach of the human rights of some of the most vulnerable sections of our society."
"I particularly welcome the emphasis in the report on tackling the trafficking of people."
"Approximately 80% of the victims of such trafficking are women and girls, and up to 50% are minors."
"My hope is that this strategy at European level can help assist and support those most at risk from violence."
"The Gröner report and the amendments tabled to it, which pinpoint the need for the fight against violence towards women and children to be more effective, certainly deserves our support and we shall vote for it."
"On this occasion, however, Mr President, we want to emphasise that the issue cannot be addressed merely in terms of making funding available for projects designed to combat this enormous problem, but that a culture of respect for the weaker sections of society needs to be developed."
"That can only be achieved by means of an ongoing, effective information campaign, as well as regulation of the Internet to protect children from the risk of paedophilic and pornographic violence spread through sites that disseminate violent messages and images without any restriction or control."
"In this context, I have tabled a written statement (39/2006) to illustrate a new system, based on a differentiated Childkey SIM card, designed to protect children who use the Internet and mobile telephones, because it allows providers to determine whether the user is a minor or an adult and to filter calls, blocking any that are anonymous or undesirable."
"– Daphne is a nice name for the European programme aimed at combating violence against women and children."
"It is a programme that will soon be ten years old and that has enjoyed some success, with more than 350 projects funded, mainly through NGOs involved in this field."
"Violence against women is a terrible blight."
"It is alarming that in 2006 adult women still come into the ‘vulnerable people' category."
"Around the world, one woman in three has been victim of one of the numerous forms of violence."
"There are a number of weapons at our disposal in the fight against these barbarous acts: draconian legislative measures, zero tolerance, listening to the victims and awareness-raising campaigns."
"Children are also affected."
"The appearance of the PNVD alone, a Dutch political party in favour of child pornography and sexual relations between adults and children, is testimony to the failures of our system and speaks volumes about the reforms that need to be carried out."
"In ten years, the Daphne budget has increased fivefold and now totals EUR 25 million per year."
"This is still not enough in my view to combat this kind of violence, which is all too often trivialised and which affects the most vulnerable, namely women and children."
". This proposal for the reinforcement of the Daphne Programme for 2007-2013 deserves our unqualified support."
"In my own country, we have in recent years, had to deal with many instances of unacceptable physical, sexual and psychological violence perpetrated against children, young people and women."
"The recent killing of two innocent young children in Liège turns one’s stomach when one considers those perfidious acts."
"Organisations such as Child Focus, the European Federation for Missing and Sexually Exploited Children, the European Network of Ombudsmen for Children (ENOC) and the countless national and operational NGOs are doing a great job."
"Authors such as Chris De Stoop have shown us the coarse reality of human trafficking and forced prostitution."
"Despite the efforts made, a great deal remains to be done."
"It is also becoming increasingly clear that more attention will need to go to the situation of street children who not only become the victim of drug and human traffickers, but also suffer from violence and sexual abuse."
"Accordingly, the Daphne Programme ensures that Europe is not a far-flung event, but offers concrete help to the weakest in our society."
"Everyone must continue to fight those who, lacking in any moral scruple, exploit, humiliate and even kill those who are least able to defend themselves."
"Human dignity must come first."
". I would like to praise the rapportuer for her unstinting commitment to campaigning against violence affecting women and children."
"The Daphne programme provides an important tool in fighting against violence."
"In Scotland the ‘zero tolerance’ campaign highlighted that as many as one in three women had been affected by domestic violence."
"We have to do all that we can to condemn violence against women and children."
"Only by working together can we achieve an end to these crimes."
". – By mistake and inadvertently, I pressed the wrong button of my voting machine."
"This is why I immediately corrected my final vote in the roll-call on the legislative resolution, using the procedure intended for this purpose."
"Indeed, it is impossible to vote against a programme which combats violence against woman and children and which promotes the dignity of every human being."
"From the start, I have fought in favour of the Commission’s initial proposal being separated into two headings: ‘drug addiction’ and ‘violence against women’."
"All of us within the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality have every reason to be proud of our work and to congratulate ourselves on our close cooperation on such an essential issue."
"The aim of the proposed directive on passenger car taxes presented by the European Commission is to address the significant disparities in car taxation in the EU Member States and the environmental pollution caused by emissions from personal motor vehicles."
"The European Commission proposes to lift registration fees for passenger cars and replace them with taxes, which would include a CO2 tax element in the tax base."
"In Slovakia, however, we do not apply registration fees or annual operating taxes to passenger vehicles."
"Introduction of the new tax would increase the tax burden on private individuals, besides which the calculation of an annual operating tax on passenger cars based on the level of CO2 emissions may not automatically lead to the purchasing of new, more environmentally friendly cars."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Member States have exclusive competence over tax issues, in line with the subsidiarity principle – which should be observed, I believe, in this case."
"For this reason, and also because the proposal would introduce a new tax in Slovakia, thereby increasing the tax burden on Slovak citizens, I have abstained from voting on the proposal."
"In matters relating to decisions on taxes, the Member States of the EU have the right of veto."
"We would see it as a positive thing if the Member States of the EU were able to agree on cooperation in relation to taxation on vehicles that minimises the impact that transport has on the climate and leads to a more efficient internal market."
"It may be possible for us to accept registration taxes in the future if they are designed in such a way as to result in clear benefits for the environment."
". I voted in accordance with the PSE Group’s guidelines except for those amendments on which we, the Malta Labour Party MEPs, agreed to vote otherwise."
"I want to record the following in explanation."
"Carbon dioxide emissions by cars are more likely to be less voluminous in new cars."
"Car makers are now conscious of the need to reduce emissions and use the latest technologies."
"Registration tax when abused by government raises the price of cars exorbitantly."
"In Malta and Gozo, with the exception of Denmark, car prices are the highest in the EU."
"Car registration tax should be removed and until such time agreement should be reached on uniformity within the different states."
"The fee for the annual car licence should be based on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions."
"Revenues from car-related taxes should be used to improve and sustain car-related infrastructures, mainly road construction, maintenance, parking areas, safety measures and landscaping."
"Income from car registration in Malta and Gozo is comparatively very high whilst the road infrastructure is the worst in the EU."
"The problem of carbon dioxide emissions is especially acute in commercial and public transport vehicles."
"I have voted in favour of the report in order to send out an important signal concerning the reorganisation of taxes for the benefit of the environment."
"Taxes should continue to fall within the national competence, and it is fortunate that a decision concerning Mrs Riis-Jørgensen’s desire to limit tax revenues for welfare services cannot lawfully be taken at EU level."
". VRT for Ireland is a national tax and setting the rate of taxation is therefore a national competence."
"The Irish rate of VRT has been sanctioned under EU law."
"It is not the right of Ireland or any other Member State or indeed the Commission to decide upon the tax policy of Member States."
"This report suggests that the abolition of VRT will be good for the Irish consumer."
"This is not strictly true."
"Ireland gains EUR 1.15 billion from VRT."
"If it abolished VRT Irish motorists would have to bear the costs of its abolition by paying a 20 cent increase in the price of petrol or diesel, or an increase from EUR 400 to EUR 900 in their annual motor tax."
"I do not believe this would be in the interest of Irish motorists."
"I can see the benefits of introducing tax incentives to motorists to purchase vehicles with reduced CO2 emissions and improved fuel efficiency."
"However, it should be up to each Member State to decide how this should be done."
"Preserving the flexibility of Member States to decide what taxes to apply and at what rates is vital in achieving the social and economic objective of a country."
". I support both objectives of this proposal for a directive: to improve the functioning of the internal market while also taking the opportunity to achieve dramatic reduction in CO2 emissions."
"I also believe that the proposals could lead to significant improvement in road safety in that by providing motorists with an opportunity to pay less for new, more environmentally friendly cars, we would encourage the gradual replacement of the car fleet with safer vehicles."
"In voting for the Riis-Jorgensen report today I also fully support the much more imaginative environmental demands made in this report."
"Whereas the European Commission has called for graduated taxes designed to penalise carbon dioxide emissions, the European Parliament calls for the focus to cover all pollutants and fuel efficiency."
"We need imaginative steps like this if we are to stand any chance of reducing the threat of global warming."
". British Conservative MEPs strongly support the objective of improving the natural environment in which we live."
"In addition to the environmental aspects of the report that we support, we also support the avoidance of British citizens being taxed double when they move abroad and the rights of consumers to benefit from an enhanced single market."
"Our decision to abstain on the final vote does not imply that we are opposed to the requirement for urgent measures to improve the environment."
"Many of the measures in the report can be supported, but we are opposed to passing new and additional powers to the European Commission and other European institutions when the same objectives can be achieved at national level."
"Importantly, we cannot support the call in this report to give the European Commission tax powers at the expense of national governments and, for this reason, as well as our general opposition to handing more powers to the Commission, we abstained on the final vote."
". The Commission’s strategy to harmonise taxes on passenger cars dates back to 2002."
"The central idea is to abolish vehicle registration tax – known as IA in Portugal – and gradually to replace it with a higher circulation tax, or stamp duty, binding the amount to the CO2 emission."
"The purpose of this is to penalise car use and to promote free movement in the internal market, encouraging the sale of cars and the replacement of used cars."
"We agree that special measures need to be put in place for citizens who move from one Member State to another, but we do not accept the proposed tax harmonisation."
"Firstly, because of the federal question; this harmonisation undermines the tax sovereignty of the Member States and their political power in the area of transport."
"Secondly, the binding of the value to CO2 does not take account of the car's cylinder capacity and value. As well as penalising circulation, the tax will ultimately be regressive and will penalise commercial vehicles."
"Lastly, this strategy affects the value of used cars and the increased competition may have economic and social repercussions."
"We cannot therefore accept the objectives contained in this directive."
". I abstained in the final vote because the votes have not produced a coherent result."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Riis-Jørgensen’s report on car taxation claims to impose a circulation tax based on emissions of pollutants from cars in order to encourage car users to use less polluting vehicles, while ensuring a market for manufacturers that is both more homogeneous and more transparent."
"However, this tax only concerns private cars, which represent less than half of the CO2 emissions which are attributable to transport vehicles."
"Furthermore, the fiscal method does not seem to be the best solution to this problem of pollution, in the light of the prospects for technological development and the option of using standards."
"To crown everything, this directive will impose new taxes in countries like France, where taxation is already so crushing that car users feel like they are being milked like dairy cows, and also that they are being made into scapegoats."
"This Europe, so ingenious at reducing its inhabitants to paupers by means of ultraliberal policies, must avoid multiplying the costs of acquiring and using a private car, since this is a direct attack on the free movement of people – something, incidentally, that it claims to protect."
"Quite aside from the fact that we contest the right of the Europe of Brussels to any fiscal competence whatsoever, these considerations lead us to vote against this report."
". I abstained on all of the votes on amendments, and voted against the report in the final vote."
"I did so because I strongly believe that all powers over taxation, which are currently Member State competences, should remain with Member States."
"Specifically, I look forward to the day when an independent Scottish government has the power over revenue-raising through taxation, including car taxation which, in Scotland, must take due account of the fact that car transport is absolutely essential to residents throughout our rural areas."
". Some governments worry about vehicle tax; others worry about maintaining a taxation system full of irregularities."
"As regards this draft directive, I would like to emphasise the importance of encouraging a proactive approach."
"Is it necessary to debate the constricting measures to be adopted in order to slow down climate change?"
"To make progress, what is needed is to sweep aside the reluctance of the car and petrol lobbies."
"Environmental tax is a means to help both citizens and the planet itself."
"If implemented correctly, it will encourage innovation in the transport sectors and it will promote energy economies."
"We must also stop the paralysis of our governments."
"Taxation cannot be the only solution."
"We must also develop regulations to reduce greenhouse gases."
"It is essential to make citizens responsible and to develop tools to evaluate our effect on the environment."
"The Greens have voted for this project as the first step towards a CO2 tax."
"This could lead to the construction of an environmental taxation system on a sufficient scale to meet the challenges we face."
"The Greens want registration tax to be maintained."
"In Denmark, it has led to the reduction of the car park."
"The Greens remain sceptical about ‘budget neutrality’ and fear other impositions."
"We regret that the European Parliament has not followed the Greens’ amendments requiring Member States to reduce their transport-related CO2 emissions."
". The EPLP is, in principle, in favour of a link between levels of taxation and our commitments to reducing environmental pollution."
"Whilst the EPLP believes that this is an extremely important opinion that raises many relevant points in trying to develop a Europe-wide solution linking to pollution to consumption, the EPLP believes that taxation is a matter of national competence and therefore cannot support aims at harmonising taxation at an EU level to reach these aims without full unanimity."
"Therefore, the EPLP has abstained from the final vote."
". Mr President, as a proud Scottish European I believe passionately that we should work together across our continent where it makes sense, though do not believe it to be the case on matters to do with tax."
"Where I have much sympathy with the ideas in this report, it is important to consider also whether they should be dealt with at EU level."
"I believe they should not, so have accordingly abstained on the key provisions of this report which suggest otherwise."
". There are a number of points which I disagree with and therefore I had to abstain on this report."
"Although I agree that we must reduce environmental pollution, I believe that taxation should be dealt with at Member State level."
"The Commission proposal to abolish passenger car registration taxes and replace them with enhanced annual circulation taxes is to the detriment of the working and grassroots classes and solely serves the interests and to increase the profits of the automobile industry and of the uniform internal market and to increase the anti-grassroots, indirect taxes levied by the European Union and governments on the pretext of emissions and the Kyoto Protocol."
"The so-called reduction in initial prices will be cancelled out by a differentiated pricing policy on the part of the automobile industry and fluctuations in VAT."
"At the same time, the Member States will replace their revenue from registration taxes with increased annual circulation taxes."
"The new underhand tax measure to the detriment of the workers will at the same time impose the principle of pollution tax, given that the criterion for annual passenger car taxes will be their emissions."
"This measure, which will obviously be ineffective in combating atmospheric pollution, will lead directly to an increase in tax revenue and sales of new cars to replace old cars, thereby putting an even greater burden on the family purse."
"We voted against the report because, instead of protecting consumers, the proposed measures strengthen the profits of the automobile industry; instead of protecting the environment, they will put a greater burden on it, with increased numbers of cars, and instead of protecting grassroots income, they will help to fleece it in the name of the stability pact."
"That concludes the vote."
"Mr President, with reference to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure, according to which Members are bound by their own conscience, I find it absolutely incomprehensible that you, in the Chair, should have given the floor for so long to a lady Member – of your own group, no less – who, wringing her hands all the while, was seeking a common position."
"It is not one of the functions of this House to facilitate group consultations between a vote and a final vote, particularly not when they involve Members who are obviously incapable of making their own minds up."
"While I am not familiar with the relevant Rule, I am sure you will be able to find out which one it is, but I have to say that I also think it unprecedented that you should then decline to permit a point of order to be made about this."
"I would like to point out that what you said, and what Mrs Sommer said, will be recorded at length in the Minutes."
"I would also like to say that your conduct of the vote has been highly partisan and unworthy of a President of this House, and that, too, should be noted in the Minutes."
"I believe that your actions show that this House resembles more than anything a karaoke parliament, in which the pretence is maintained of adherence to democratic rules, whilst not every Member, contrary to what is written, is equal before the law or treated equally in this House."
"The fact is that, if the Member had been someone else or from a different group, I know full well that you, Mr Friedrich, would, in your capacity as president, have stopped them speaking, just as you did not even allow me to speak in the first place."
"The next item is the Council presentation of the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2007."
"."
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, having heard the presentation of the 2007 draft budget, we have an opportunity this afternoon to continue the discussions we had in Helsinki in July."
"Thank you for that invitation, Madam President-in-Office, which enabled us to establish contact as a small group, which then became a bigger one for the first reading of the draft budget in Brussels in July."
"As the budget rapporteur for the House, I should like to make four comments on this particular occasion: one general comment and three specific comments."
"The first, general, comment is that since this is the first year in the financial perspective we need to think of it in terms of being a strategic base, because in this particular year we will be setting in motion a number of ideas or ways of doing things that will reverberate over the next few years up to 2013."
"As stated in particular in Parliament’s resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy adopted earlier this year, we need in Europe as a whole to be able to adapt more quickly to the phenomenon of globalisation, which is changing the global economy and changing the orientation of our priorities to one of ‘policy for results’ – as the President of the Commission has explained."
"I sense this is going to change the way in which we budget and finance what we do, and we may see the first signs of this in the 2007 budget."
"Specifically, I would like to address the question of value for money, because this marks a departure from the norm, as I understand it from the Council’s first reading, with many of the decisions on cut-backs in various areas not being done across-the-board but by taking into account the results of the activity statements produced by the Commission in particular sectors."
"As we shape our thinking on this we will refer back to what was set out with regard to the Annual Policy Strategy, which was that there are other elements that must be taken into account when looking at the absorption capacity of particular lines or the funds available for them."
"The first of these elements is the document produced by the Commission, the budget forecast alert, which shows how expenditure is being implemented across particular budget lines for a particular year."
"Another of the cost-benefit analyses we have launched in the Committee on Budgets is to look at particular areas where we think expenditure could be weak in quantitative or, in particular, qualitative terms."
"Last but not least there are the Court of Auditors’ reports, of which we have many, on the way in which expenditure is used in particular budget areas."
"We are beginning to sense in the Committee on Budgets that we can bring together various elements that will indicate to us those lines where expenditure will be implemented correctly, and of which we can be sure, and perhaps also other lines of which we cannot be so sure."
"We certainly hope that by the end of the process, Madam President-in-Office, you will be able to align the Council with the declaration we adopted in July, at the time of the draft budget, calling for value for money to be considered in the European Union budget."
"The second specific issue is the question of priorities."
"We are all aware that we have less money available under the financial perspective than we had sought in the final negotiations earlier this year, and that it therefore behoves us to look at the priorities across the different sectors."
"When it comes to the vote at first reading I suspect that Parliament will be following the priorities set out by Mr Böge, its rapporteur on the financial perspective."
"These have not changed greatly and are also set out in the resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy."
"That is what we are expecting for areas of research and innovation, into which we understand that the Council, in the form of the Member States, would like to invest more money, but of course there is never quite that much when it comes to the final budget."
"Then there is the implementation of pilot projects and preparatory actions."
"In this field too we can think of areas in which we can spur action and in which long-term programmes could be run, in the form, perhaps, of exchanges of business and scientific personnel between the EU and China, or the EU and India."
"However, you cannot expect us at this stage to pick up on the ideas regarding administration."
"We rejected those when we discussed them at first reading in the Council, and it will take a great deal more discussion before we can come to any agreement on what to do as regards staff resources for the Commission."
"The last point is that it is very strange that often in this House we can vote on a legislative programme, as we did on the one for 2006 last December, and yet no citizen in the European Union knows what the European Union will be legislating on, because you have the Commission proposal and you then have the parliamentary resolution."
"In the Committee on Budgets, as stated with regard to the annual policy strategy, we are looking to bring those two processes together and to have the budget decision and the legislative decision in December, followed by a clear statement from the Commission as to what the legislative programme for the Union is, so that everyone would know what it was – not just us in this House but people all over Europe."
"In conclusion I would like to thank the President-in-Office for having come today to present the draft budget."
"There are a lot of discussions ahead of us, but we will seek a successful outcome for this budget that takes into account the European Parliament’s priorities, as well as those of the Council."
"."
"Mr President, the work on the 2007 budget confirms the old adage that, while procedures may be repeated, there is no such thing as a routine budget."
"In order to round off what our rapporteur, Mr Elles, has said, I would like to mention a few of the problems which we will face in 2007."
"The first is not the most important, as it is a technical, analytical problem."
"Once again, it is basically the problem of the comparability of annual budgets."
"This is a budget for 27 Member States."
"This problem of comparability became acute when the geography of the European Union changed in 2004/2005."
"However, it still exists and I agree with the view that if spending on Bulgaria and Romania is not separated, a full comparison between the annual budgets will not be possible."
"The second issue, which is the most serious, was highlighted by Mr Elles, and is as follows: to what extent should the first year of the new financial perspective encourage us to not reflect so much on the form of the budget but on the budget priorities, namely how much continuity and how much change there should be in this first year of the new financial perspective?"
"I note a certain amount of continuity on the part of the Council, including continuing horizontal cuts, this time supported more by the so-called activity statements."
"I note the traditionally privileged status of the Common Foreign and Security Policy However, I would like to clearly highlight the fact that the European Parliament rapporteur has a very strong mandate, from both the Commission and the whole European Parliament, to examine individual budget lines and check them from the point of view of what is known as cost-benefit analysis."
"This is a very strong mandate and a very strong principle which will inform the first reading of the 2007 budget in the European Parliament."
"This round of talks will begin tomorrow, after agreement with other committees, of course."
"2007 is a problem in terms of implementing a new generation of multi-annual programmes based on new regulations and a new set of instruments for foreign trade."
"The question remains: to what extent does a potential slip-up justify the careful budgeting for 2007, something that is very visible in terms of expenditure?"
"That was likely to have been the main reason for the point of departure being so low this time around."
"Spending was already below 1% of GDP in the initial draft by the Commission."
"The Council made further cuts of the order of 1 billion 757 million euro, which creates an extraordinary gap between the 2007 budget and the limits defined in the financial perspective for that year."
"In our opinion, this is not enough to fund the aims of the European Union."
"The European Union’s ambitions as an international player, that is, on the international arena, in terms of funding research and development make this fact clear."
"The implementation of next year’s budget is also a matter of quality and motivation in terms of administrative procedures, and in this respect we are very rigorously examining and analysing the Council’s approach to the issue of employment and salaries in the European Commission."
"We accept the European Commission’s warning that the cuts in salaries which amount to over EUR 50 million will make recruitment, particularly from the new Member States, virtually impossible."
"The Council has not denied this strongly enough, and therefore the problem will be raised in the first reading in Parliament, as it is not only a question of proportionality in terms of employment, but also a problem of efficiency and motivation for the administration which is facing new challenges."
"The differences over the approach to the 2007 budget became very clear, albeit in a friendly atmosphere, during the conciliation procedure on 14 July."
"A sign of these differences was, for example, the fact that no common statements were made by Parliament and Council."
"Of course, we also have time to agree the 2007 budget."
"For me, and this is my final point, it was very important to receive Minister Wideroos’ assurance which, while only verbal, is based on what was jointly included in the interinstitutional agreement, that is, that she will undertake to do all that lies within her power to ensure that the new financial regime will come into force on 1 January 2007."
"It is clear that the efficient implementation of the budget for 2007 depends on whether there is a new financial regime to accompany it."
"."
"Mr President, on 17 May the Commission presented the draft budget."
"I am not going to repeat our position."
"Today I should like to concentrate on presenting to Parliament the Commission’s evaluation of the Council’s first reading."
"I should like to confirm that we very much appreciate Parliament’s attitude and the way it has worked on the 2007 budget, especially the method which is to be used by the rapporteur in respect of cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments of all proposals from the Council and the Commission."
"We support this."
"That means any proposal on radical reforms in any area."
"We would be happy to have a consistent approach with respect to cost-benefit analyses and impact assessments on any policies, including the recruitment of administrative staff and administrative expenditure."
"Therefore, today I should like to say that we are still sticking with our proposal."
"We think it is realistic and grounded."
"We have evaluated the requirements for the 2007 budget as far as realistically possible."
"However, to our surprise, the Council has made disproportionately large cuts in administration at all the European institutions, including the Commission."
"From this point of view, there are two elements and two separate problems."
"Mr Lewandowski has mentioned that in the 2007 budget the new Member States have been given 800 posts, but the EUR 56 million for salaries has been reduced."
"That means that the Commission will not be able to recruit anyone at all."
"The Council would like to speed up recruitment at the Commission, yet recruitment at the Commission will not be speeded up at all; the Commission will not recruit at all in 2007 if this proposal is maintained."
"That means somebody here is not telling the truth."
"The second element of the budget which completely surprised the Commission was that the Council intervened in the annual budget procedure by coming forward with a multiannual approach, practically politically reopening the interinstitutional agreement which all three institutions signed in May."
"It is a seven-year approach to administrative costs and expenditure – a period of time which will cause the Commission to lose a minimum of three directorates-general, and will upset the geographical balance which, in line with the wishes of the Council and Parliament, the institution is supposed to keep in mind."
"The balance in the linguistic approach will also be upset."
"In addition, the structures and human resources necessary for achieving the new policies that the Council and Parliament have called for, including the new financial perspective, will not be forthcoming."
"We were therefore surprised by the Council’s attitude, which is not based on impact assessments or cost-benefit analyses: it is based solely on arithmetic."
"This goes against what we are trying to achieve here at the very beginning of the new financial perspective, i.e. how we are looking at the budget and how we are looking at the efficiency of the ways we use money in the European Union."
"I should like to point out to Parliament today that we are promising to cooperate openly and fully with Parliament in preparing its opinion for first reading."
"In July I promised to provide you with technical information on the proposal, which I shall do this week, hopefully by Friday."
"You will receive two notes on the 2007 budget and on the proposal for 2007-2013."
"I hope that will help all of us to achieve the final results."
"I should like to call on all those involved to be prudent, to make significant progress in respect of impact assessments, and to achieve whatever is necessary for all Community programmes to be fulfilled."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is the report by Mr Proinsias De Rossa and Mr José Albino Silva Peneda, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on a European Social Model for the future [2005/2248(INI)] (A6-0238/2006)."
". – Mr President, this own-initiative report, prepared jointly by myself and Mr Silva Peneda, with the essential support of our respective staffs, is a very important contribution to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe and the role that Europe’s social model can play in re-energising the unification of our continent."
"There are no doubts these days that the creation of the European Union has been a very effective and successful peace process."
"What is not so readily acknowledged is that it has also been a successful prosperity process."
"In his book, ‘The European Dream’, Jeremy Rifkin comments on the remarkable recovery of European countries following the Second World War."
"The fact that Europe outstripped the United States in growth terms for half a century up to the mid-1990s, by developing and putting into place a remarkable social infrastructure which ensured that prosperity could be shared, was a remarkable achievement."
"This success was not based on a dog-eat-dog approach, but on a social contract which ensured that working people would share in the wealth created, and their dependence on society generally would also benefit through the provision of universal public services."
"We are now into a new period – an unprecedented revolution in technology, in the age structure of our population, and in the globalisation of capital, where there is a growing need to create a transnational democracy that is capable of effective governance of those new phenomena."
"This report recognises that the challenges we face cannot be addressed by reheated dogmas, whether of the left or the right."
"That is not to say that there are no philosophical differences anymore, but it is to argue that these differences are being redefined by the objective conditions of the modern world we live in."
"This report is a restatement that Europe’s core values of equality, solidarity, redistribution and anti-discrimination, care for the young, the old and the sick through universal public provision must be defended in the necessary reforms already under way; that our social model is not an obstacle to competitiveness and growth but is, in fact, a necessary ingredient if we are to deliver the kind of decent European society that our citizens clearly desire; and that the concept of ‘flexicurity’, pioneered by my colleague Mr Rasmussen in Denmark, can help facilitate reforms by preventing people from tumbling into poverty as a result and can, if properly tailored to each Member State’s needs, be an important tool in the process."
". – I should like to begin by saying that the EU that we know today was founded on an ideal, the main objective of which was winning and maintaining peace."
"In half a century, Europe has, on the world stage, become a byword for peace, democracy, freedom, solidarity, prosperity and development."
"Peace, this prime objective of the European project, has manifestly been achieved, to the extent that we now take the true value of this major victory for granted, so normal has it become to live in peace for over six decades."
"We are talking about peace that is rooted in freedom, democracy and respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"Let us compare the European social model with other situations: an example close to home was the great swindle of the totalitarian Communist experiments, which for decades deprived many Europeans of their right to freedom, for most now happily regained."
"The brutal reality of Islamic fundamentalism today is a further example of a movement far removed from the core values on which the European social model is based."
"This report deals essentially with values."
"The way in which these values are implemented varies from country to country, and we therefore stress the idea that while the European social model is a unity of values, that unity is implemented in a number of different ways."
"Globalisation, technological development and demographic change are the main factors behind the difficulties faced, to a greater or lesser extent, by the social protection systems in the different European countries."
"Hence the need for timely reforms; either the European social model will survive if we take action, or will die if we do nothing."
"We know that if there is weak economic growth any structural reform will be doomed from the outset."
"This is why we have placed major emphasis in the report on the Member States implementing the Lisbon Strategy and on the need to complete the internal market."
"The following are the areas to be prioritised in the reforms to be undertaken: greater flexibility in the labour market, lifelong learning, more time to pursue an active life, the work-family life balance, changes in sources of funding, and combating poverty and social exclusion."
"In the area of competitiveness, we recommend that greater attention be paid to SMEs and to innovation."
"The general guidelines of the reforms that must be implemented and that have been highlighted in our report are indicative of reformist thinking firmly rooted in the core values of the European social model."
"As elements that inform all political action, these values are needed now more than ever."
"It is therefore important to us that Parliament affirm that the reforms that need to be carried out to the different social protection systems must not under any circumstances affect the core values on which the European social model is based."
"Parliament’s decision on the content of this report will thus be of relevance beyond the Union because it will be a political affirmation of the defence of values that are important not only to Europe but also to the world."
"In this regard, I shall quote the International Labour Organisation, which explicitly referred to the European social model as a possible source of inspiration for emerging new powers."
"I should finally like to mention my fellow rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, and to thank him for the excellent spirit of cooperation that we enjoyed, which enabled us to work in a way that was both stimulating and pleasant."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to say that I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss Europe’s social future with you."
"This is obviously a very important subject as far as the citizens of Europe are concerned."
"The Heads of State of the European Union have repeatedly confirmed their commitment to European values and the development of European social models."
"The European social model, which is capable of combining economic growth, low levels of unemployment and social cohesion, provides a solid base on which to look for answers to the challenges of globalisation and an ageing population."
"The European social model also needs to be reviewed constantly."
"We have to make it easier for our citizens to adapt to change."
"We have to show our support for European competitiveness and higher levels of employment and, furthermore, combat poverty and exclusion."
"We have to make sure that the systems for social protection are sustainable in the long term and at an adequate level."
"All these aims support one another reciprocally."
"It is vital to the future of a social Europe that the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment is assiduously put into effect."
"If the European welfare societies are to remain, there need to be better competitiveness, lower rates of unemployment and higher productivity."
"One of the objectives of the Finnish Presidency is to reinforce the basis for economic growth in Europe."
"Over the coming weeks we are expecting the Commission to present a communication on demographic change in Europe."
"These issues were discussed at an informal meeting of EU Ministers for Employment, Social Affairs and Health in Helsinki in July."
"One of the Finnish Presidency’s conclusions from these talks was that the change in the population’s age structure should not be regarded as merely a challenge: it is also an indication of how well the European welfare model works."
"Large sections of the population have the chance of a longer, healthier life."
"Although the conclusions relating to the potential for economic growth and the sustainability of public finances may well be less positive, a long-term, proactive policy of reform is essential."
"The job market debate is a fundamental part of the European social model."
"The Finnish Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen, and the Commission President, Mr Barroso, will host an extraordinary tripartite Social Summit in Lahti on 20 October."
"Its purpose is to continue the debate on managing structural change in Europe."
"We need to find a balance between flexibility and security and invest heavily in skills and expertise."
"By making it easier for men and women to harmonise work with family life we will be creating at the same time a more effective response for Europe to the challenges of globalisation and an ageing population."
"This harmonisation of work and family life is also fundamentally linked to the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy."
"This was highlighted at the European Council in spring 2006 when it adopted the European Pact for Gender Equality."
"The Union is a key global player whose aim is the promotion of democracy, human rights and sustainable development."
"The Commission has just presented a communication on the subject of ‘decent’ work."
"It is very important for the EU and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to cooperate on this matter."
"The worldwide promotion of decent work will also boost productivity in the less developed countries."
"During its Presidency, Finland wants to strengthen the European Union’s ability to adapt to the pressures of global competition."
"Improving European competitiveness is closely linked to the preservation of the European welfare societies."
"Europe can be both competitive and strong socially, but this will require us to make continued efforts and be prepared for change."
"As Prime Minister Vanhanen said here in the European Parliament plenary in July, we also have to take seriously the fear that Europeans have of global competition."
"Common values and social justice will play a central role in allaying such fears."
"."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mr Silva Peneda and Mr De Rossa for their report on the European social model for the future."
"The report makes a useful and thought-provoking contribution to the debate launched at the Hampton Court European Council in October 2005."
"Most importantly, though, it once again emphasises the significance of social Europe and the need to protect and develop the European social model."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on the European social model is, by nature, a complex one, which can be approached from a number of different perspectives."
"I feel that Parliament’s report in its original form takes a wide-ranging approach and conveys the most important points."
"I should like, if I may, to share a few thoughts with you."
"Firstly, the report ultimately states that the European social model was built on a specific set of values."
"The technical implementation of those values may vary, of course."
"When we speak of values, we speak of something worthwhile; in other words, if we are convinced that there are values at the heart of the European model we are saying that we are willing to channel our efforts into protecting and developing those values."
"When we speak about the European social model, one of the adjectives we use is European."
"I feel that the European social model is clearly based on European integration, without which there would be no hope of progress on the world stage, regardless of which Member States we are talking about."
"Accordingly, European integration is a cornerstone of the European social model, and, as the other side of that coin, the European social model is one of the cornerstones of European integration."
"Given that, from a geographical point of view, European integration is a complex concept, we could hold a series of wide-ranging debates, although in principle where we find the European social model, there we also find the boundaries of European integration."
"It exists where we have a set of values that have been adopted by the individual Member States."
"There are, of course, other values that one could add, and this is clearly a question that would provoke a great deal of lively discussion."
"In my view, these are the core elements of this debate in Parliament, and the main reasons why it is so important."
"I share the view expressed by the rapporteurs that it is important not to regard social politics or policies as a burden, but rather as a positive, proactive factor in creating jobs, in supporting growth and in strengthening social cohesion."
"Europe cannot be competitive without being socially strong."
"It cannot be competitive without a social policy."
"It is mistaken to think that if we throw away this core idea, we will gain some kind of wonderful advantage."
"This opinion has, in my view, been expressed very clearly, which I am pleased to see."
"I am also pleased that the positions of Parliament and the Commission coincide on a great many points, for example in their assessment of the situation."
"Europe must reform its policies if it wants to protect its values."
"Preserving the status quo is not a solution; preserving the status quo is in the long run simply a waste."
"We must also realise that besides an innovative and open Europe we also have a Europe with almost 20 million unemployed."
"The situation in the labour market is gradually improving, and recently the figure was more in the region of 18 million, a 2 million improvement, which is not inconsiderable."
"We have a Europe in which there is poverty; we have a Europe in which there is child poverty; we have stagnating growth and a Europe with too much social exclusion."
"If the EU is to remain active and economically strong, the challenges that must be tackled head-on also include the ageing population, which threatens the financial viability of our social systems, and globalisation, which is a source of fear mainly for countries with high unemployment and which at the same time confirms how indispensable it is to launch the structural reforms."
"I should like to thank Parliament for its proposals, which I wish to sum up in one word: modernisation, or perhaps a better word would be improvement."
"We need to modernise in order to be able to preserve high-quality education and health systems, and to deliver decent employment and decent pensions for all."
"The Commission and the Member States have launched the process of modernisation and the reforms as part of the re-launched Lisbon Strategy."
"I wish to thank the rapporteurs, in this regard, for highlighting the importance of striking a balance between the economic dimension, on the one hand, and employment and social protection on the other."
"The EU has at its disposal a range of individual instruments that will help the Member States to press ahead with modernisation."
"This legislation will support economic change and the implementation of measures to protect our values and quality of life, conferring the authority to monitor compliance with Community rights and providing a budget which is vital for supporting the Union’s economic, social and territorial cohesion."
"Most of the proposals in the report bear a striking similarity to the Commission’s current activities."
"These include activities relating to demographic change, which will be addressed in the proposals contained in the Green Paper on demography that I should like to introduce in October."
"They also include activities relating to what is known as flex-security, that is, flexibility with security, regarding which the Commission has begun to negotiate with the interested parties, and these negotiations are due to culminate in the adoption of joint principles by the end of 2007."
"Additionally, we have activities relating to services of general interest, which the Commission will address in a communication to be completed by the end of this year on the basis of Parliament's report."
"There is also similarity in the activities arising from the Commission communication of June 2006 entitled ‘A citizens’ agenda delivering results for Europe’, in which the Commission undertook to carry out, in 2007, a thorough assessment of the reality of the European Community and to launch a programme geared towards an approach to rights and solidarity, which will also examine the possibility of establishing a list of rights for Europe's citizens."
"Lastly, I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs for their report, which looks to the future and which makes some useful proposals."
"The Commission will respond to it in the coming months in the context of the main initiatives to which I have alluded."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like if I may to return to the very beginning."
"The European social model is founded on the idea that it is possible to link up political democracy, economic efficiency, economic effectiveness and solidarity."
". – Ladies and gentlemen, previously the entire sector of social expenditure was viewed as an incidental matter, as a matter of redistribution."
"I believe that the experience of recent years has shown that this is not a matter of expenditure but rather one of investment, and I am pleased that we are discussing this report during the Finnish Presidency."
"The Finnish crises of the early 1990s were overcome by investing in people, in a similar fashion to the Danes during the time of Bishop Grundtvig."
"Recently, the work of the US economist Richard Florida has drawn attention to the creative class and the economics of creativity."
"We need to create a network capable of harnessing all kinds of talent in European society and of driving development forward."
"We must, in my view, regard the European social model as an area of choice and not as a unification issue."
"Lifestyles should diversify, because where we gamble on cheap labour, such as in the Asian economies, there is dwindling choice and the range of opportunities for economic growth also diminishes."
". – Mr President, I am grateful to Mr De Rossa and Mr Silva Peneda for their work and the report on the European social model."
"I am pleased that the input of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has been taken seriously and is also reflected in the report."
"Women are indispensable in the social model, just as they are indispensable in the labour market."
"Not for nothing did we in Europe plan to enhance the labour participation of women."
"Despite this, women are often still absent from the labour market, and, for that matter, feature far too infrequently in the social model."
"Women are often the first victims of a badly-functioning social system."
"If there are no funds for day-nursery facilities or for sick, elderly or disabled people, it is often the women, wives and mothers who stay at home to look after them."
"That is why I am in favour of a model which takes women into consideration, one in which the government helps where needed in an affordable manner."
"I am against a model thought out in Brussels that must, by hook or by crook, be implemented across Europe."
"What I am in favour of, though, is social solidarity in Europe under the motto ‘One for all and all for one’."
"That is also reflected in the report we are discussing today, and that is why I am in favour of the report by Mr De Rossa and Mr Silva Peneda."
". – Mr President, when you look around in society and talk to people, you can tell they are worried about the consequences of globalisation and about globalisation itself, and that there are concerns, due to persistent unemployment in some Member States, about being affected."
"They can see the adverse effects the demographic development has, and that makes people, also in the discussion about the European social model, very reticent."
"They wonder how sustainable are all the things we have at present."
"Can we maintain the pensions, the unemployment benefits, if need be, or this welfare level as it is at the moment?"
"That is the sort of caution I am talking about."
"The central question is whether the social security systems, which are very different but are all based on certain values, can deliver what was promised when they were first set up."
"I am very glad that two fellow Members, Mr De Rossa and Mr Silva Peneda, have, despite their different political backgrounds, managed to draft an excellent report which can serve as a basis for future discussion."
"I am extremely grateful to them for this."
"At the heart of the European social model is the need for economic development, for without that we cannot give, or guarantee, social security."
"We want to be able to guarantee people basic social requirements, but we must also acquire the funds to do so, of course."
"That involves a continuous process, whereby social security is reorganised so that the citizens receive what they can expect."
"There are different models and our model is different from the others in that it is based on a social market economy and, in fact, also on Christian social teaching."
"I am grateful for the many sound recommendations in this report."
", . – Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, who have worked very well together."
"The report they have produced is a good one."
"I am often asked, when back home in Sweden, whether there really is a European social model or whether what we really have is a collection of different models."
"My response is that, while it is true that our social systems are different, they also have a great deal in common and it is that commonality which constitutes the European social model."
"We all have systems that build on solidarity with those who are unemployed or sick or who have suffered industrial injuries."
"We all have a public sector through which we pay for what is common, to somewhat differing degrees."
"We also have the social partners and civil society, which play a large part in the process whereby we shape our societies."
"These are the common distinguishing characteristics."
"If the social model is based on common values within different systems, this means that we can learn from one another in the course of the process that we now find ourselves in."
"It is, of course, not the case that the social model or the various social systems cannot be changed."
"As so many speakers in this debate have said, they must be constantly amended - the systems themselves, that is to say, rather than the values underpinning them."
"The two great challenges today are demographic change and globalisation."
"In view of the demographic change, we must also show solidarity with the next generation."
"Thus, the next generation must not have to spend an unreasonable amount of what it produces on those of us retiring and requiring large amounts of medical care."
"We therefore have to create sustainable pension systems."
"We must, however, also ensure that we create a working environment that makes it possible for people to remain in the job market for longer. Amongst other things, this means having reasonable working hours."
"We must have skills development whereby the older section of the workforce is also able to be involved in the changes in skills development and other such matters and whereby such workers are thus able to carry on working."
"This would mean that we would have more workers in the labour market."
"Perhaps we will also need to accept more people from countries outside Europe in the future, which in all likelihood will be the case."
"As far as globalisation is concerned, there are two ways to go."
"The first of these is to copy the economies of our competitors, China and India, namely in terms of wages, labour market conditions and the like. The second way is for us to attempt to compete, in fact, by having well-trained staff and by engaging in research and development and so on, which would mean that our workers and the products they produce would be the best in the world."
"This does, however, require security in the labour market, since it involves change and restructuring."
"People involved in a changing labour market need to feel secure."
"I know that the Finnish Presidency is referring to this as ‘security in the midst of change’ rather than as ‘flexicurity’, but it amounts to the same thing."
"If you feel secure, you are also able to participate in the work of bringing about change and the development of Europe."
"Then we can develop our social systems in such a way that they become a productive factor in the work of bringing about change."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the debate in recent months on the growing political integration of Europe, with its ups and downs, we have often said that Europe needs to give people a better idea of its project, its purpose and, I would say, its indispensability: the Europe of results, conceived by us specifically to give people a real key to understanding its ."
"Now, however, its social dimension needs to be promoted as well, alongside the dimensions of growth and knowledge, the objectives that we are always proclaiming. This must be accompanied by research into what Europe must become, so that we can tell Europe’s people clearly whether the future of Europe – and not just its past history and that of the 20th century, which we all know and have lived through – will still have this priority, this distinguishing mark that has characterised the diverse models and systems in the various Member States."
"It is precisely at a European level that we need to make this leap: the progress made so far in the various countries and Member States is now confronted by challenges that isolated responses alone are unlikely to overcome."
"Clearly – I must say this to those who fear that Brussels will decide everything: what, how, and with a single model – clearly, evidently and indisputably, the competence and responsibility for social policies lie with the Member States, and decisions on how much and what kind of revenue to spend on our social systems, depending on whether the emphasis is more on social security or education or reparation, must be made at a national level."
"That these are national decisions is beyond doubt, and I too uphold the idea that my country should decide what kind of welfare state to create, but I also consider it necessary to adopt a common approach at European level regarding certain fundamental rights that must be safeguarded: social rights that, I would remind you, we included in the rights section of our draft Constitution."
"We have to start here, with a common approach to lay down certain guidelines, precisely because our national social systems are faced with the worst challenge of all: economic and financial compatibility."
"Indeed, we want competitiveness and social cohesion to go hand in hand as the two sides of the same coin of integrated development of a society."
"That is why I think today’s debate is important; that is why I think it should be part of the European agenda, even though some may perhaps question it because it is just an own-initiative report on this subject."
"It is not enough to talk about institutional models; it is not enough to talk about what kind of governance is necessary; it is essential to debate the competitive model for our free economy."
"The citizens also want to know this, when they make their political choice, when they also make, or refuse to make, the economic choices that we shall ask them to make for the sake of higher employment or some other reason: they will ask whether these social rights are in any case a distinguishing mark of all the welfare systems that the various countries will be implementing."
"."
"Mr President, I am sure that everyone, in principle, is in agreement with the European social model, even if they only pay lip-service to it."
"Who can have any objection to a shared scheme of values, or have anything against peace, social justice, freedom, equality and so on?"
"While EU politics is far from lacking in fine principles and guidelines, in the day-to-day life that goes on in parallel with it there prevails a raw reality, with, among other things, the pursuit of short-term profit and often unscrupulous exploitation and competition."
"Many watch passively, or look away, while the few become richer and more and more people become poorer and poorer."
"This document makes only passing reference to the most serious social problems, such as extreme poverty, discrimination against immigrants, the grim lot of the long-term unemployed; it is insufficiently rigorous in highlighting inequality and injustice, and the blame for this must lie with the subsidiarity principle – good thing though that is in itself."
"If what is termed harmonisation in the economy is to be regarded as the most obvious thing in the world, then the EU ought also to say ‘yes’ to harmonisation measures in the social sphere, starting by bringing taxes into line and then moving on to debate minimum and basic incomes and the citizen's wage, and then saying 'yes' in particular to the harmonisation of the pension system."
"Justice can only be a valid principle in the EU if the law, throughout Europe, accords full protection to the weakest members of society."
". – This debate is extremely important given the serious nature of the issue, the so-called ‘European social model’, that is to say, the economic, social and labour rights that have been gained by the workers and the people over dozens of years, a fact not taken into account by the Commission or by this report."
"Far from it, in fact."
"The underlying thrust of the report is that social security systems hamper economic development and are unsustainable given the demographic challenges posed by globalisation and world competition."
"The report emphasises deep structural reforms that in practice will lead to the collapse of public social security systems, thereby casting aside the main weapon at our disposal for protecting social inclusion, for combating poverty, unequal distribution of income, job insecurity and unemployment, and for promoting the dignity of those in work."
"In this way, the rapporteurs of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking to continue the policy of pandering to Europe’s captains of industry and the interests of the large economic and financial groups, opening up new business areas and placing a significant proportion of pension system funding in the hands of private profit. The trend is therefore towards the increasingly neoliberal path of the so-called ‘Lisbon Strategy' and ‘Stability Pact’."
"This is not what the 72 million-plus people living in poverty and the 18 million-plus unemployed had been hoping for."
"What is needed is a change in these policies."
"This is what we had in mind with the proposals we put forward, which we hope will be adopted."
"."
"Mr President, I, too, would like to join my colleagues in thanking the joint rapporteurs for their work on this very important report."
"I welcome the Commissioner to the House also, because eventually the Commission will have to start implementing some of the things that we are talking about here."
"One of the key elements arising from the debate is the recognition at last that, unless the economic wealth can be created, together with the employment terms to guarantee jobs and security within those jobs and rights after those jobs, then the European social model is non-existent."
"As my colleague, Mr Andersson, rightly pointed out, there is not just one single model, but a variety of different ones."
"The one thing they all share is the necessity for solidarity between all peoples within the individual countries and across the European Union."
"The idea of protection for those who are most vulnerable within our society is at the very core of what the European social model should be about."
"When you look down through the list of issues and areas that need to be covered, of course there are always difficulties that will arise, whether it is with regard to long-term unemployment, youth unemployment, female unemployment, social welfare provision, protection with regard to access to housing, access to education and training, or more recently the demographic situation and the pensions crisis that is looming before us."
"No matter how you try and come up with solutions to deal with the problems that are there, the one thing we should learn from the practical experience we now have of a number of these various social models is that one size does not fit all."
"There is a need to allow for flexibility within those models, to guarantee that the core values of putting the human being at the very centre of what the social model is about remain paramount."
"But, also, when we speak about harmonisation of taxation or harmonisation of the minimum wage, this obviously militates against creating equality, because countries that at present have lower wages and a high level of social protection could be made uncompetitive, with business and companies being attracted elsewhere and jobs lost."
"That is why this flexibility must be there."
"I give my support to the report in general and I am delighted with the comments it makes."
"One area of ongoing concern is the need to ensure the link between economic performance and the generation of wealth, which must then be utilised for social protection."
"You cannot have one without the other and when we speak about raising taxes, you can have the highest taxes in the world, but if you do not have companies employing people and paying taxes, then you cannot provide social protection afterwards."
". – Mr President, this report covers ten diverse fields, practically all EU areas, from peace and security to human rights and from Lisbon to Laeken."
"It is, then, an aspiration, an attempt at founding an embryonic culture."
"When I was younger I played rugby and I recall a match that was not going well."
"The captain gathered us together imploring us to have more team spirit."
"An empty gesture, because team spirit cannot be manufactured: it arises from the game’s culture of combining various skills, of playing for each other, of covering each other’s mistakes and of the post-match social atmosphere."
"By the same token, it is no use the rapporteurs gathering us together to vote for a European social model."
"If all its various parts, reports, treaties, rules and regulations, etc. are worthwhile and are put into practice by all this team of nations, then the European social model will emerge of its own volition."
"Therefore, this report is irrelevant!"
"Recital O of the report specifies that the Constitution should reflect the concept of the social model – covering the same ground."
"It follows that the European Constitution is also irrelevant, as well as dead!"
"This report emphasises the role of the Member States and their competences, especially their role in securing jobs leading to economic growth and prosperity."
"It comments on the diversity of the European Member States and says that we must respect their traditions, all of which was endorsed this morning by the Finnish President."
"However, this will all be swept aside and lost if the EU embarks on the madness of a Constitution."
"In conclusion, you may gather that I doubt the sincerity of this report, which includes the statement: ‘recommends that Member States deepen cooperation and exchange of best practice’."
"One year ago I remarked in this House that one of the central features of the EU was that each Member State could bring to the table its best practice to share with all the others."
"However, when I said this in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs during the working time directive debate and tried to contribute some best practice from a Member State – the UK – I was firmly told by that rapporteur: ‘We don’t want you dumping your ideas on us’."
"Mr President, a year ago British Prime Minister Tony Blair addressed this House and asked a vital question: what sort of social model is it that delivers 20 million unemployed across the EU?"
"It was a good question, and so far I have not heard the answer."
"The European social model is well meaning, it is compassionate, it is meant to do good and yet it has created a regulatory and fiscal climate which is deterring enterprise, destroying wealth and undermining competitiveness."
"It is time to face reality: one man’s job protection is another man’s unemployment."
"The social model is profoundly discriminatory."
"It discriminates in favour of people in work and against the unemployed."
"If we want to achieve the Lisbon objectives, if we want to face up to the challenges of globalisation, if we want growth and jobs and competitiveness and prosperity, then we have to start to dismantle the European social model."
"The European social model faces significant challenges, related primarily to the changes in the economic environment and social transformation."
"Several elements of these changes have already been mentioned here today."
"In my view, a key question is the need to create ever more jobs."
"For this purpose, and in relation to the social model, it is important to stress: only more jobs, and therefore, obviously, support for the small and medium-sized enterprise sector can make it possible even to speak of elements of change within the social model."
"I am delighted to hear what Commissioner Spidla has also said, that this is a question of preserving European values."
"In order to succeed in doing so, it is clear that structural changes within the European social model are also necessary."
"The main question is through what EU strategy and at what rate of change can this be achieved?"
"In this regard, I am of the opinion that we need to harmonise EU policies, and I especially welcome the aim set out in the report: a strengthened, open method of coordination so that national parliaments and the European Parliament can play a more active role in this."
"I am convinced that greater cooperation and joint European consensual positions are necessary on the major political questions."
"Therefore, common European statements, and policies tailored to each Member State, are the approach we must follow."
"As regards future prospects, this declaration is sufficiently pragmatic and clearly shows that we must work together."
"Problems can only be solved by joining our forces, not by fragmenting them."
"I consider this to be a good, defensible report and I ask that the greatest possible number of Members, preferably from the widest possible political spectrum, lend it their support."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate both rapporteurs, who have done excellent work."
"Last autumn, during the British Presidency and in the run-up to the extraordinary summit at Hampton Court, members of my own government were saying two contradictory things about the idea of the European social model."
"On the one hand they said there was no such thing as a European social model – we have 25 different national social models – while on the other they said that if there was such a thing as a European social model then it was a continental phenomenon and a millstone around the necks of a number of Member State economies."
"Mr Helmer has reminded us of what Mr Blair said in this House."
"In fact, a number of ministers have said the same thing, and are obviously reading from the same script - i.e. do we really want a social model that throws 20 million into unemployment?"
"If Mr Helmer was listening to the debate then he would have heard an answer to that assertion from Mr Blair, because this report nails those lies."
"The very first substantive paragraph underlines the point that we indeed have a European social model which reflects a common set of values based on the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy and respect for human rights."
"The report makes the point that far from the model being a burden or a millstone, social policy should be seen as a positive factor in the European Union’s economic growth, not only by increasing productivity and competitiveness but also by generating social cohesion, raising living standards for citizens and ensuring access to fundamental rights and freedoms."
"That is absolutely correct, and if we see it in that sense, social policy becomes a productive factor – the theme of a Dutch Presidency some years ago."
"The report also recognises what a number of people have said, which is that there is a clear need to modernise and adapt the model to respond to the wide range of challenges we face: demographic and technological change, globalisation and so on."
"That is of vital importance."
"In Britain a number of people engage in headshaking about what they see as the over-slow progress in modernisation and reform in a number of continental European countries."
"What they tend to forget is the brutal, inhumane and destructive way in which reform was managed during the Thatcher years in Britain."
"What a number of continental countries are trying to do is to engage in that reform process through consensus, while preserving the underlying values of the European social model."
"That is the way to do it, and it is one I very much admire."
"One final point: I regret that the PPE-DE Group has tabled an amendment to paragraph 23 aimed at removing a specific reference to the need for the Commission to bring forward a framework on services of general interest."
"I very much hope that amendment falls, because had we had that framework the Services Directive itself would have had a far easier passage."
"We still need it and I hope the Commission will heed the call for it made in the report."
"– Mr President, intervention by the European Union is too often experienced by our fellow citizens as an intrusion into their daily lives."
"Moreover, sometimes they are correct."
"However, those who did not want the Constitution refused to see that this text could have clarified the powers of the Union and those of the Member States."
"In fact, our fellow citizens demand a Europe which responds to their urgent and practical concerns, but only when it is the institution which is best placed to do this."
"In this sense, a social Europe is one priority among many."
"Our duty is to set out a framework which – you said it yourself, Commissioner – is modern and balanced, and which guarantees a high level of social standards, while still leaving the Member States sufficient room to manoeuvre."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us stop these sterile debates between those for whom the word ‘social’ is a synonym for the resurgence of state control and those who, in lengthy reports, propose unworkable and counter-productive measures."
"As we already did with the Services Directive, all of us have to work together, and as urgently as possible, in order to define this framework, starting for example with the adoption of texts on working hours, on services of general interest and on the status of European mutuality."
"Mr President, it is a pity that this report on a European Social Model for the future does not get us much further on."
"None of the social models existing within the EU have, to date, even begun to do as they have claimed to do and create the conditions under which every human being really can live a self-determined life in dignity within the EU."
"As I see it, the main challenges, not least for the EU’s internal market, are the abolition of poverty, the removal of social divisions, and energetic action to protect the climate."
"I therefore believe that the Economic and Monetary Union needs to be supplemented by a European Social Union, action to establish which could be taken, for example, firstly, by creating the machinery to combat social dumping; secondly, by laying down minimum social standards across Europe, and, thirdly, by creating European social security systems that make poverty impossible."
"It is regrettable that the report before us on a European Social Model for the future contains no proposals of any substance for a truly social Europe characterised by solidarity."
"– I would like to point out that this report does of course contain some well-founded statements and rather off-putting forecasts, but I would like to speak not about the fact that each of Europe’s Member States has socially differing social systems, but about two specific groups of people."
"I represent a country where there are people who in the past participated in dealing with the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and now these people need help."
"In the past they played a part in tackling this disaster with the awareness that they were saving humanity, that they were helping Ukraine and, in doing so, Europe too."
"Today the Latvian state does not have enough resources."
"Latvia’s social system is not able to help these people, now that they have become invalids."
"The second group consists of people from Latvia as well as other Baltic countries and eastern European countries who, as a result of occupation by the USSR, were sent to concentration camps."
"These people were deprived of a normal life, deprived of an education, lived through a period of slavery and worked like slaves."
"That is why it is impossible today, with the resources at Latvia’s disposal and at the disposal of the other Baltic states, to achieve the social rehabilitation of these people."
"If we now speak of the European social model, and of solidarity, then I think this model ought to include additional social protection for these groups, protection that is supranational in nature and should not be left as a burden for just one country to bear – countries that are already in fact, the poorest states in Europe."
"– Mr President, we must admit that we really have messed up on the question of the welfare state."
"The truth is that, a few years ago, we laid down a great deal without having the intuition to see that people's life expectancy is increasing."
"At that time, forty years ago, an infarct meant death; now an infarct is dealt with in a routine operation."
"Similarly, we did not think a few years ago, ten years ago when we signed the world trade agreement, that our products are encumbered by the cost of welfare, while the products produced by the Indians and Chinese, who account for half the planet's workforce, have no such cost."
"As a result, Chinese products are flooding Europe, our companies are closing and tomorrow we shall be unable to offer this welfare state."
"The truth is that either we shall go bankrupt or we shall not be as secure as citizens."
"These are the facts."
"We must therefore see how we can realistically deal with the situation."
"We are pulling the wool over people's eyes."
"We shall be unable to keep our word."
"Now we say let us get funds from employers, while employers have already been brought to their knees by Chinese and Indian products."
"We therefore need to look facts in the face."
"Technology should show us the way."
"Forty years ago, when I was a child, we went to work in the fields in the summer and there were 50 people for two decares."
"Now it is one machine with one operator."
"Jobs are being lost to technology."
"How, therefore, can we secure this standard of living today?"
"We need to find ways that are not obvious from this way of thinking."
"We need to realise that we made a mistake when, ten years ago with the world trade agreements, we failed to take this parameter into account, namely their cheap products which are today drowning the market and keeping our products off the shop shelves."
"This is a serious mistake which we will have to pay for."
"We need to tell European citizens the truth: that we will be unable to make the Chinese into Europeans and that, unfortunately, we shall have to make the Europeans into Chinese."
"Mr President, please allow me to speak about the European Social model from the point of view of a citizen of a new Member State."
"It is said that scientists have identified four different models, namely the Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon, Continental and Mediterranean models."
"Although they differ, they also share some common traits."
"I would also add that there is another model, the Postcommunist model, which does not fit in with any of the others."
"The Postcommunist model is characterised by the absence of any model at all, where supermarket staff work until ten in the evening, even on the first of May, or work twenty-four hours a day for 200 euros per month."
"This is why the creation of a new social model, common to the whole of Europe and its implementation at least on a basic level is above all in the interests of the citizens of the new Member States."
"Unfortunately, it is in the new Member States that we see the biggest divergence between quality of work and payment for it."
"There is very poor access to healthcare; a lack of a minimum social support for those with inadequate resources, there are very low disability benefits and pensions and, finally, a hidden system of charges for access to higher education."
"Sadly, it is in the new Member States that there are the least jobs available and those that do exist are of a poor quality, the pay most often ranging between 200 and 500 euros per month, while the cost of living is almost on a par with the rest of Europe."
"Unfortunately, it is in Poland, in the country of the trade union ‘Solidarność’, that we have the most poorly protected workers’ rights in the whole European Union."
"I hope that the European Social Model will ensure that our poorest citizens will not have to fear the news of a further enlargement or of the introduction of the euro."
"In this respect, we all need the European Union to play a more significant role."
"The European Social Model should aim to increase confidence in European institutions, especially on the part of the poorest citizens."
"Mr President, two Members of this House, from different political groups, have joined together to draft a report on the future of the European Social Model, and the result has been worth their effort."
"The European Social Model defines the unity of values, but also the diversity of the national systems."
"The values by which we are guided include solidarity, social justice, access to education and health services, but the manner in which they are put into practice is left to the Member States, with their different models, whether Nordic or Anglo-Saxon, Continental or Mediterranean."
"Both globalisation and the disturbing demographic trends put the national social security systems at risk to a considerable degree."
"This is where there must be far-reaching reforms if sustainable funding is to be ensured."
"The systems must become more dynamic, and must no longer be as rigid as they have been."
"What I find praiseworthy in the report is the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises, which continue to provide most jobs and traineeships, along with 'flexicurity', the innovative approach combining flexible labour markets, modern labour organisation, security and social protection."
"There are, however, three problems areas, and it is not just the Germans in the Group of the European People’s Party that regard them as such."
"The first is to be found in paragraphs 13 and 14, which discuss the open coordination method, which must not be allowed to become a new lawmaking process, and is acceptable only if it is limited to the exchange of experience and best practice."
"Both the national parliaments and the social partners need to be involved in it."
"The second is in paragraph 23, which includes an urgent demand – originating from Mr Stephen Hughes – for a framework directive on services of general interest, in flagrant contradiction to the current state of negotiations."
"Thirdly, there is the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in paragraph 31."
"We repudiate the idea that the relocation of businesses should be funded from the European level."
"We have no need either of wide-ranging approval procedures or of new bureaucracies, and we certainly have no need of the privatisation of public capital."
"Actions to provide workers affected by globalisation with further training and retraining are acceptable, but nothing else is."
"We are counting on this House to support this line, and, if it does so, we will then be able to vote to adopt the report as a whole."
"– Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the Members who have drawn up this report on such an important issue, which lies at the heart of European integration."
"This is a very positive report, because the big political families in this Parliament and the enormous majority of Members have managed to carry on working together on a joint approach and commitment."
"I believe that today provides a very appropriate opportunity to say once again that the enormous majority of Members of this House see open markets and the European social model as part of an indivisible whole, and that that will continue to be the case in the future."
"A reasoned and reasonable report; a reasoned report, looking at the past and seeing that, by means of our model, we have achieved the largest area of economic and social progress in Europe and reached the most important stage in that progress, and a reasonable report because it enables us to look to the future not just on the defensive, but also proactively, in order to make a success of the great challenges of globalisation."
"Furthermore, there is no reason not to point out that the report has managed to emphasise the added value that the Union contributes to this model, in which, naturally, Europe does not have the ambition to carry out the tasks of the Member States, though it does have the legal competences required to complement and promote the action needed to achieve the communitised objectives of employment and social well-being."
"We have many instruments, including legislation, by means of which we can reasonably champion basic objectives and defend workers’ fundamental rights and prevent social dumping."
"We are asking for a new form of globalisation for the whole of the world – one in which we do not have this social dumping that is accompanied by instruments that spoil workers’ conditions; the Union must prevent this phenomenon from arising in its territory."
"Mr President, I shall end by saying that I am certain that our reformed model has a future, but this certainty is accompanied by another: not even the economic Europe will have a future unless its social model is respected."
"Mr President, firstly, I should like say that I do not like the fact that the two largest parties prepare joint reports as a matter of principle."
"I feel that it excludes other parties from the outset."
"As for this report, it is generally ok."
"I know that sounds churlish, but I am pleased subsidiarity has been mentioned and we call on Member States to act and not the EU."
"However, I have severe reservations as regards talking about a European social model at all."
"I know we have common goals, but we do not have common systems across Member States – as other people have mentioned – to achieve those goals. Neither, I believe, should we have, hence my concerns."
"I know others have mentioned this, but I would not like it to be thought, if this report is passed, that we want to work towards a one-size-fits-all European social model, instead of respecting the diversity that we have at the moment."
"Common social objectives, yes; a common social model, no."
"– Mr President, first of all I would like to welcome this discussion."
"There are two standard platitudes that are delivered whenever the European social model or social policy is discussed."
"The first is that a social Europe is at the heart of this project."
"The second is that it is simply a matter of creating economic resources and that a rising tide will lift all boats."
"Both of those propositions are utterly discredited and if you look at the figures for poverty, for homelessness and for social dislocation in this Union, you will understand why."
"The reality is that social Europe has been very much a ‘frill’ or an ‘add-on’ to the broader game plan of this Union."
"I believe that, if we are to have a real and fruitful discussion about social policy, we have to ask the fundamental questions and the difficult questions relating to EU macroeconomic policy."
"What has the effect of liberalisation and privatisation been on those who are marginalised?"
"What about the creeping abandonment of the welfare state?"
"And, is it any wonder that there is such a glaring gulf between the European citizen and the European Union, when the policies we pursue disenfranchise people."
"I very much hope that this report will serve as a springboard for the much deeper discussion and analysis that we require."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, experience clearly shows that the European economic model is unsustainable, significantly so in fact."
"The social model should work as a safety net, or a springboard, for citizens who cannot work due to temporary difficulties, old age or illness."
"It has turned into a comfortable resting place, however, for those who are unwilling to work."
"The European social model is an exercise in high-minded populism and operates in debt across many countries."
"It does not encourage personal responsibility; it does not motivate people to improve their qualifications and performance; it promotes laziness and a lack of responsibility, making people passive and indifferent, and ultimately it leads to companies pulling out of the EU, resulting in high unemployment in the Member States."
"The current populist social system is certainly a vote winner for politicians, but it will not bring future prosperity for our citizens."
"It should be stated clearly that the European social model is not, as the politicians would have us believe, a given right."
"It is merely a temporary bonus resulting from economic efficiency."
"It is widely accepted here that there is no single social model in Europe, but rather that we have 25 models."
"Similarly, there is an understanding that social policy falls under the jurisdiction of the Member States."
"Given these shared viewpoints, the question is not about whether it is possible to achieve the single model, but rather about whether it is sensible to aspire to one at all."
"I attach importance to the fact that this report highlights some common fundamental values and objectives of European social models, such as equality, non–discrimination, solidarity and general access to education, health care and other public services."
"For our citizens these are the essential ingredients of a successful economy and also of an equitable society."
"The Member States are, therefore, making continuous efforts to harmonise economic efficiency, competition and social justice."
"Of course, the ways in which we go about this will vary."
"Social policy is not an economic burden but a positive aspect of the economic growth of the European Union since it generates social cohesion, raises living standards and guarantees fundamental rights and equality."
"Social policy is an important factor in social peace, political stability and economic progress."
"It is precisely this issue which is addressed in this report as it calls for the reform of economic and social systems so that they can address the challenges of demographic changes, globalisation and the rapid pace of technological development."
"Naturally, the European Union is playing an important role here by coordinating various efforts for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, preparing common guidelines for growth and employment, and ensuring a certain degree of coordination in the field of social security."
"This report says that social security is neither the preserve of the right nor the left, but is essential to a modern society."
"Every Member State of the European Union is seeking the most appropriate model and this report is a suitable incentive and basis for change in the social models of the Member States."
"I should like to thank both rapporteurs."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to begin by congratulating the two rapporteurs on their work."
"With this report, supported by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – I want to emphasise this – we make a great step towards the definition of a European social model: a balanced combination of economic necessities and the imperatives of social justice."
"Too many Europeans suffer from the fact that our Union does not protect them, does not protect their public services, and it does not pay sufficient attention to the consequences of globalisation."
"Many fear threats against the most basic structural elements of their social model."
"In the face of this suffering, our responsibility is of course to guarantee values, but also to prove our willpower through concrete measures."
"It would be against our values and vain to seek the lowest labour costs, the most docile employees, the weakest taxes, and the most lax environmental, social, health and welfare standards of our competitors."
"On the contrary, our identity and our strength contribute to the excellence of our working standards of production."
"This report shows that, beyond our differences, we have a common attachment to a society which is not solely organised by the law of the market, but by solidarity and redistribution and by the protection of our fellow citizens, that is to say our human capital, the most rich and important capital we have."
"Europe has shown that social security, protection against life's risks and the right to retirement for everyone have been the ingredients of a recipe that is good for citizens, good for society, good for the economy, and one which will remain the path to follow for the future."
"Mr President, we are dealing with a very important topic, although I am sure that we have not dealt with it thoroughly enough and will have to return to it again more than once in the future."
"Nevertheless, I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the rapporteurs and the results of their work."
"I am one of those who consider that a European social model exists."
"However, it is a composite rather than a monolithic model."
"It is a model where a diversity of experience is based on a commonality of values."
"This model should be improved and adapted to the challenges of today, but the improvement must not lead to its weakening."
"These are the most significant conclusions that I think we should draw from this very important debate."
"Mr President, the co-rapporteur, Mr De Rossa, talked about the need for a ‘decent society’."
"That phrase was very much paralleled and echoed by the Council when talking about the need for ‘social justice’."
"I hope that on all sides of the House people would agree on the importance of those phrases and agree that they should not just be empty phrases but concepts of real meaning."
"I hope also that people on both sides of this House would recognise the importance of their applying to everybody in real social inclusion."
"In other words, that they should apply not just to those people who are in work, not just to those people who are not able to work, but also to those people who want to work but are unable to find work because there are too many obstacles in their way."
"That is why I would also like to congratulate – in addition to the first co-rapporteur – the other co-rapporteur, Mr Silva Peneda."
"When he spoke he referred to the need to reform the social model."
"That phrase was picked up by the Commissioner himself, who talked about the need for reform."
"What particularly impressed me about the Commissioner’s remarks was that he said that the status quo is not an option."
"He specifically referred to the 20 million unemployed, because they are indeed a constant reminder of the biggest social injustice of all."
"Something has to be done."
"We must help to do it."
"To my mind the key word is ‘reform’."
"I have tabled an amendment, with the help of a dozen or so colleagues from different countries, to insert into Amendment 1 on recital F the phrase ‘modernisation and reform’."
"The good news is that Mr Hughes has confirmed to me this afternoon that the PSE Group will support that phrase."
"We have the chance, as a House, to show that we all support that phrase and that it is not empty of meaning, but a phrase of substance."
"Our constituents want reform."
"Let us show tomorrow that we want it and are going to vote for it too."
"Mr President, I welcome this opportunity to come back and respond briefly to the debate so far."
"I have to say I am relieved that Mr Clark and Mr Helmer find the report irrelevant, because I was afraid that there was so much praise for the report and that I must have done something wrong, if they also found it acceptable."
"I am really pleased with that."
"I am curious and dumbfounded that some of my colleagues on the left in the GUE/NGL Group also seem to think the report is irrelevant, but perhaps that is a reflection of the point I made that the dividing line between left and right is changing in this modern world of ours and that it is not that there are no differences but that the lines are shifting."
"Mr Crowley welcomed the report."
"However, at the risk of losing a vote, I should say that perhaps he misunderstands the report, because, while the issue of support for the poor is important as part of the European social model, I do not agree – as he seems to – with the theory that the rising tide lifts all boats, because, in fact, it does not."
"We do not have the time to go into that."
"However, it seems to me that what is intrinsic to this report is the point that social policy is intrinsic to a prosperous Europe and that it is not a question of one or the other, or of waiting for one to deliver the other: we must deliver both and we must find ways to do that through reform."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our social security systems increasingly appear to be in difficulties."
"Recurrent economic crises, demographic changes and immigration processes are forcing us to rethink the European social model, partly because the European Union contains both the wealthiest and most highly developed areas in the world alongside others marked by high levels of poverty and pre-industrial development."
"That is why we are seeking a model that can guide development and wealth towards benefiting the many."
"What should its features be?"
"At the centre of the relationship between the people, society and the State we need to place the concept of subsidiarity, by means of which all Europe’s citizens can express their own freedoms guaranteed by non-oppressive institutions."
"Social solidarity needs to be promoted, so that social progress and increasing wealth are governed by respect for the dignity of every individual and by the help that social groups can provide for people in difficulties."
"This can be entrusted neither to an exclusive role for public institutions nor to self-regulating market forces, but to solidarity of three kinds: individual solidarity, spreading positive values among people; the solidarity of social groups that organise themselves into social networks; and institutional solidarity, with few essential and universally accepted rules, for a State that can make the most of all its society’s energy."
"European businesses also form part of this design, because full employment is a cornerstone of the social model; small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important as the backbone of a system combining economic entrepreneurship with the solidity of the social fabric, working towards a new European social model that, through a diversity of forms and of organisational systems, promotes the well-being of everyone."
"Mr President, this report that we are debating today on a European social model for the future, in relation to which I would like in particular to acknowledge the consensus that has been achieved between the two large political groups – and I would like especially to mention Mr José Silva Peneda and also Mr Proinsias De Rossa for their efforts – is good news, since it is destined to contribute to solidarity, greater social cohesion, greater quality of life and a more sustainable future for Europe’s social security systems."
"There is no doubt that the Europe of the citizens to which we all aspire requires more and more coordinated policies that allow us to tackle the new challenges that we face every day."
"For example, demographic change with higher life expectancies, which has been mentioned here this afternoon, undoubtedly obliges us to adopt new policies, and not just health policies, but also socio-health care policies which will allow us to combine the higher life expectancy with greater quality of life."
"Full employment, temporary work, youth unemployment and women’s unemployment require an ambitious employment policy, which promotes the stability and security of jobs."
"The same goes for the incorporation of women into working life, where we need innovative formulae for reconciling work and family life and for making working hours more flexible. We must also deal with immigration, which I see more as a challenge than a problem."
"This summer, more than ever, we are witnessing the drama of immigration in my country, and it is causing serious human problems."
"Without prejudice to the attitude of the Spanish Socialist Government, which has raised false expectations and has therefore helped to aggravate this serious problem, this situation affects the whole of Europe and hence requires cooperative and effective measures on our part."
"I believe that it is important that we consider a European immigration policy, and it is important that we say so today, when we are talking about the European social model, because the phenomenon of immigration is going to have a great impact on the European social model throughout Europe."
"I therefore believe that we should continue working in favour of this European social model, while taking account of all the challenges facing us, and that of immigration in particular."
"."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity to take part in this extremely lively debate which has looked at the European social model from a range of perspectives."
"I believe I can sum up my opinion as follows: the voices disapproving of the European social model seem to be very much in the minority, while a majority spoke in favour of the European social model as a significant factor in our lives."
"The latter is the opinion held, broadly speaking, by the Commission."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to come back to some of the important points that came up in this debate, so that I can use the time allotted to me to highlight the most significant areas."
"I feel that it is important to acknowledge that the EU on its own is a highly original product, a highly original political entity that cannot easily be described in the kind of terms conventionally used in political science."
"It is inappropriate to describe it as an international treaty, or to talk about it in normal political terms."
"The same is true of the European social model."
"It is much too complex to streamline into a simple theme."
"I therefore wish to express my appreciation for the rapporteurs, who have drafted a text that tackles this question extremely thoroughly, in my view."
"Another major theme of this far-reaching debate was the realisation that the European social model is not merely a statistical entity, but that it is, broadly speaking, founded on active participation, and in some cases is founded on work."
"This is because work, ladies and gentlemen, as we have heard today, is more than just a job; it has a clearly defined ethical character and it is precisely this ethical activity and ethical solidarity which underpins the social model, a fact which came through clearly during the debate."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will note the outcome of your vote with interest, and as I have already indicated, many of the approaches and positions already drawn up by the Commission more or less tally with what has been discussed here."
"Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and Mr Silva Peneda and Mr De Rossa, for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"The reform of the European social model is today at the heart of the debate in Europe."
"As a matter of fact, there are a great many challenges in the social changes consequent to the necessity to adjust to globalisation, demographic evolution and technology innovation."
"At this stage, we support the rapporteur when he stresses that the Union should not only preserve but enhance the common set of European values that are the preservation of peace, social justice, equality, solidarity, the promotion of freedom and democracy, and respect for human rights while bearing in mind that the sine qua non for social justice is economic prosperity."
"The Union must meet its citizens’ expectations and answer the spreading concerns about employment, the current low growth rate and the need to reform the social protection systems."
"The rapporteur wisely underlines that it is time to call for EU-wide renewal of the social dialogue while deepening cooperation and exchange of best practice through the enhanced open method of coordination as the key policy-making instrument in the fields of employment, social protection, social exclusion, gender equality in the labour market, pensions, and healthcare."
"– It is undeniable that the European social model was a crucial factor in the rebuilding of democratic Europe during the post-war period and that many millions of people have benefited from its success."
"It is also undeniable, however, that having been set up during a time of overpopulation and relative immobility in the business and industrial sectors, it needs to be brought up to date at a time of major population decline, of a highly competitive global economy and of constant demand for adaptable resources."
"Reform is all the more necessary in light of the increasing number of relatively new factors of social concern such as the unsustainable nature of pension systems, long-term unemployment, unemployment among the young and unemployment among those with qualifications."
"The gradual reduction of the power of the State and the redefinition of its model, greater freedom for economies and the encouragement of private initiative, creativity, competitiveness and investment play a central role in meeting the challenge of catering to the new reality."
"Notwithstanding the need for flexibility and the need to contemplate the future reduction of some rights that previous generations took for granted, I also feel it is vital that the most vulnerable sections of society be protected and championed."
"The Peneda–De Rossa proposal is an outstanding one not only in professional and political terms but also as a moral achievement."
"In our view, the European social model does not mean closing the gaps among the redistribution systems."
"The report considers the social model to be a major means of upholding European values, which we can only preserve if Europe continues to follow the path laid out in Amsterdam and Lisbon, and if no ultimate choices are made within the false dichotomy of competitiveness or solidarity."
"For the mission to succeed, it is necessary to see economic competitiveness and human security as mutually interdependent elements that jointly create the conditions for a life of human dignity."
"We wish to express particular thanks to the authors of the proposal for having formulated the statement in such a way that the new Member States can also identify with it."
"The analysis of the Peneda–De Rossa report closes the debate over whether the aims of cohesion can be reconciled with other, secondary objectives."
"The statement is unambiguous: Europe's identity and credibility depend on whether we allow countries, regions and socially vulnerable groups to go under."
"The reform of the social model is but a tool and not an end in itself; it is a tool for meeting the new challenges presented by a multinational Europe and by globalisation and the information explosion."
"The statement considers the need to avoid the poverty trap that threatens the new Member States in particular as a serious question weighing on Europe's conscience."
"We know that the ageing population of Europe is itself producing the threats that make people's futures increasingly hopeless, the greatest of these threats being that of child poverty."
"The Europe of which this statement speaks cannot acquiesce in a poverty trap that will swallow up future generations."
"I wish to congratulate the rapporteur for the deep and thought-provoking analysis regarding social Europe."
"I agree that the social model is first of all about values."
"These values, however, of which the old continent is so justifiably proud, today faces serious threats that can only be averted by common effort."
"Although economic growth and increased competitiveness are indeed preconditions for safeguarding the achievements in the social sphere, these in themselves can no longer raise up those social groups which have fallen behind or are unable to keep up with or even participate in the ever-accelerating competition."
"On the contrary, they further aggravate these social cleavages."
"A frightening reminder of this, in Western Europe, is the tragic situation of refugees and migrants, and in, Eastern Europe, that of the Roma."
"The creation of new jobs can, in the absence of suitable guarantees, still lead to the trap of exploitation."
"The creation of a level playing field does not by itself lead to true equality of opportunity for those who start out with disadvantages. On the contrary, it preserves and even heightens differences."
"The preconditions for reducing these inequities are the major social support systems, and above all making high-quality education accessible for everyone."
"Yet even the victory of those groups that are competitive is a Pyrrhic one: the glaring differences and ever greater decline destabilise society, tearing apart its connective tissue."
"The upheavals in France showed us that even the greatest wealth cannot protect you in the midst of a raging crowd."
"At the same time, even squeezing wages down to the lowest possible level will not make a socially discontented society attractive to entrepreneurs."
"For this reason, although I agree that the source of the tribulations of social Europe and of the possible solutions lies in economic growth and competitiveness, we cannot fall into the error of treating these as absolutes and as ultimate goals."
"This was perhaps best expressed by the former president of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Mr Robin Cook: the economy must always serve the people, and never the people the economy."
"– The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme: national allocation plans (2008-2012)."
"Mr President, climate change is the most important environmental problem that our planet faces."
"If the actions which we have targeted to address it do not bring about results, then the change will have very unfortunate economic and social consequences on a global scale in the future."
"That is why the Kyoto Protocol was signed and ratified within the framework of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, making provision for a 5.2% reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by developed countries and, within these frameworks, the European Union has undertaken to reduce emissions by 8% compared with 1990 levels."
"In order to achieve this target in the period from 2008 to 2012, we have taken various measures at Community and national level."
"Many of these measures are provided for in the first and second European programme on climate change."
"The main measure which we have provided for and which went into operation on 1 January 2005 is the Community trading scheme for greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide."
"With this scheme, we provide for the cheapest efficient method of reducing greenhouse gases in the medium and long term."
"The scheme covers approximately 50% of carbon dioxide emissions in the European Union."
"It covers approximately 11 500 000 undertakings and industrial and other installations and today constitutes the biggest gas trading scheme in the world."
"It is without doubt the only international scheme and many countries have joined this scheme, which covers numerous sectors of economic activity."
"The success of the Community trading scheme is of major significance because it will be able to form a base and we aim to use it as a core scheme in order to create an international greenhouse gas trading scheme."
"This is one effective way of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases globally and, in particular, for us to help ensure that developed countries such as the United States, the number one country for greenhouse gas emissions in the world, accounting for one quarter of all carbon dioxide emissions, contribute to this reduction and, of course, for us to also find any which way that is acceptable to developing countries, which are also emitting more and more greenhouse gases."
"You will have all read in the newspapers about what has been happening recently in California, with the initiative taken there for a scheme similar to the European trading scheme for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to start operating there in 2009."
"The same applies, but specifically only to companies that generate electricity, in seven north-eastern states of the United States and it would appear that pressure is already being exerted from below on the federal government to start debating the question of a global greenhouse gas trading scheme."
"I must emphasise that there can be no doubt about the European Commission's determination to maintain and improve this scheme in order to achieve the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases required in order to stabilise concentrations of these gases in the atmosphere."
"Last spring, the undertakings covered by the Community scheme, in keeping with their obligation, notified their emissions of carbon dioxide verified by independent auditors and, for the first time, we have a cohesive set of real values audited by independent agencies of emissions of carbon dioxide in the European Union."
"Actual emissions were lower than many expected. At this stage, the following conclusions may be drawn:"
"First, as far as monitoring, the submission of reports and verification are concerned, the scheme is operating very well."
"The results of the 2005 audit show that undertakings complied to a satisfactory degree with the basic obligations which derive from the trading scheme."
"The scheme infrastructure is operating smoothly."
"Secondly, market-based mechanisms are a success and the Community emission allowance trading scheme appears to already be bearing fruit."
"Thirdly and perhaps most importantly, the Member States can – and must – expect the sectors covered by this scheme to make a much greater contribution towards reducing emissions, especially if it is borne in mind that the European Union as a whole is not yet on track to honour its undertakings on the basis of the Kyoto Protocol."
"As you know, the Member States must notify their national allocation plans which, as a whole, also determine the upper limit for the entire European Union for the 2008-2012 trading period, which coincides with the first commitment period in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol."
"By yesterday, the Commission had received 10 national allocation plans representing approximately half of the total allowances approved by the Commission during the first trading period."
"These countries are Germany, Estonia, Lithuania, Ireland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom and, yesterday, Greece."
"The remaining Member States have not yet notified their national plans to the Commission. However, ten of them are already available as preliminary plans within the framework of public consultation."
"They come from the following Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain."
"The national allocation plans notified are currently being evaluated by the Commission."
"As you will understand, the Commission cannot make any material comment at this stage."
"As far as our more general approach to this matter is concerned, I shall be clear: the Commission will use every political and legal means at its disposal to ensure that national plans comply both with the commitments made within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and with the actual data on verified emissions for 2005."
"This will safeguard scarcity on the market, as well as terms of equal participation for undertakings."
"More importantly for those Member States which are not close to achieving the targets based on the Kyoto Protocol, the national plans must be used in order to help achieve the required reductions."
"More importantly, the Member States with the worst performances must distribute fewer allowances in relation to the first trading period."
"Our job will be to guarantee a strict and fair evaluation of all plans."
"Finally, I wish to assure you that the Commission attaches a great deal of importance to all the Member States submitting their national allocation plans for the second trading period as quickly as possible and we have already sent a letter, a sort of preliminary warning, to the countries which are delaying, before starting infringement proceedings."
"If the Member States fail to send the information requested of them, the Commission will examine the possibility of taking further action."
"I trust that this will not be necessary and that, within the next few days, within the next month, the Member States will send in their greenhouse gas allowance trading allocation plans."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council shares the Commission’s view that the emissions trading scheme in the European Union is one of the cornerstones of the EU’s policy on climate."
"It is this very instrument that has helped the European Union to be able to demonstrate its leadership in the response to the challenge of climate change."
"Coal prices will be a fundamental element in our efforts to stimulate the development and adoption of environmentally friendly technology."
"As with all new schemes, emissions trading has also experienced growing pains in its initial stages."
"That is why we need to evaluate carefully how the scheme might be improved further, so that it can fulfil its aim of reducing greenhouse gases cost-effectively."
"The Commission’s forthcoming evaluation report will make this possible."
"A huge project is now underway to draft other national allocation plans."
"Member States are drawing them up, and it will be the Commission’s job to evaluate them."
"This is clearly stated in the Emissions Trading Directive adopted by the Council and the European Parliament three years ago."
"In the spring this year we gained a lot of valuable experience from the reports on emissions data for 2005."
"Now we have to consider how we can improve the scheme’s transparency on the basis of that experience."
"If the scheme is a transparent one, we are in a better position to ensure that market data is available to all players in a coherent and coordinated form at the same time."
"In parallel with the process relating to the allocation plans, the Finnish Presidency will be launching a review of the Emissions Trading Directive."
"It is of particular importance that the scheme can help give a clear signal to operators that low-carbon, environmentally friendly technology is a worthwhile investment."
"."
"Mr President, I welcome the Commission and the Presidency to this debate."
"I have to ask why there was this last-minute inclusion on the agenda last Friday, without the proper teeing-up among the various political groups."
"Was it purely technical, to comply with your obligation to revert to Parliament by 30 June, even though you are a couple of months late?"
"But I will move on as time is too precious to waste."
"The PPE-DE Group fully supports the emissions trading scheme and our objectives under Kyoto and agrees with the need to keep downward pressure on every one of the 25 Member States to meet their targets in relation to greenhouse gases, as agreed under Kyoto."
"Please take that as a given."
"I note what the Commissioner has just said concerning the conclusions of the 2000 review: ‘the system works well, the results were good, the system is up and running’."
"Commissioner, I do not know whether this is a PR exercise and we do not really want the truth to get out to those who might be listening."
"I completely support a fully effective ETS, as do all my colleagues, but the system is not working well."
"I know these are early days, which is a genuine caveat for anything we say after what has been a very short 18-month review period."
"The theory is good, but the practice has been awful and has not matched the theory at all."
"We need to look at this situation urgently."
"The idea was that at the end of each year the amount of carbon dioxide actually emitted had to match the amount of emission permits a company surrendered to its government."
"That was to keep pressure on companies to decrease their emissions."
"What has happened?"
"In the first year, 2005, the actual carbon dioxide emissions of 21 countries were 44 million tonnes short of the amount of CO2 emissions permits allocated by the 21 governments in question."
"That resulted in absolutely no downward pressure to reduce emissions and in a very volatile carbon credit market that fluctuated from EUR 31 per tonne down to EUR 8 per tonne and back up to EUR 16 per tonne. I agree that we need a properly functioning carbon credit market."
"We need industry to buy into what we are saying."
"We need credibility, in practice as well as in theory."
"Could you please detail any amendments you are proposing in the directive before the second period of NAPs?"
"By the way, Ireland also submitted its NAP on 13 July and you did not mention its name in the countries that you read out."
"I would like you confirm that it has done so."
"Perhaps they are telling me whoppers in my home country!"
". Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Halonen, I am pleased with this debate."
"I am also pleased to hear that the emission allowance trading system is working well in the eyes of the Commissioner and the Council."
"Our group has put its heart and soul into bringing this directive about, and that is why it is important that it works well."
"Nevertheless, I would like to make a few observations and, like Mrs Doyle, I have a number of doubts."
"First of all, it is unfortunate that only nine countries have submitted their plans now."
"It is good to know that the Commission is on the case, but disappointing that only nine countries are ready on time."
"Secondly, I think that Member States have been too generous in their recent allocations, and that is why the Directive on emission allowance trading has had too little effect."
"Another political problem that particularly catches the eye is the windfall profits which electricity companies have made."
"Electricity companies have been allocated free allowances, which they managed to sell on to the energy-intensive industry and to consumers too, and that, is of course, hard to stomach at a time when electricity companies are increasing their profits in any case."
"Commissioner, I should like to see a full assessment of this directive, and I think that we should also, given this generous allocation and the windfall profits for electricity companies, ask whether it would not be preferable by far to switch to an auction system instead of the grandfathering system we have at the moment."
"."
"Mr President, we all knew that this was going to be an exercise in learning by doing and that we would not get it right first time – and indeed we did not get it right first time!"
"The issue of more allowances than there are emissions obviously risked undermining the credibility of the whole scheme, but now we are on the second round of the process and we need to have learnt those lessons."
"I am grateful to the Commissioner for coming here and naming by implication those Member States which have failed so far to meet the deadline for the submission of these plans."
"We are not going to go anywhere if Member States do not actually produce the goods they have promised to produce."
"I hope that the Minister will put this on the agenda of the Environment Council on 23 October."
"Now that we can see the ministers on television I look forward to seeing the embarrassment as you point your finger at them, Minister, one by one, and ask them for an explanation as to why those plans have not been submitted."
"All too often these plans are coming in late and they are coming in lax."
"The Commission has got to be fair, but it has to be tough."
"Parliament expects you to ensure that these national allocation plans meet the goals required of the emissions trading scheme, and many Member States which are genuinely committed and have submitted their plans already will be backing you and want you to ensure that there is a level playing field and that the others fall into line."
"Whatever they may say, many Member States are looking for an escape route from the emissions trading scheme."
"It is up to you to make sure that the exit doors are all closed."
"."
"Mr President, as Greens we are pretty much on the same line as our colleagues."
"We are at a critical moment: the cheating is over."
"What France, Poland and Germany have done with over-allocations cannot continue."
"However, I will use my speaking time to point out another issue, namely that of market distortion."
"If you look at the German allocation plan, there is a special clause for RWE, which gets four years of an old power plant allowance."
"On the other hand, they have completely emptied the new entrants."
"The German power market is already completely dominated by four companies."
"The German second allocation plan has a hidden agenda – not to allow gas power plant investment in Germany, because that is exactly what those four big companies are afraid of."
"Therefore, the Commission’s Directorate-General for Competition has to be fully involved in the review."
"You made another point: why do we do this – to put a price on CO2 or in order to have investments in efficient technology?"
"You have to look at the Polish and German allocation plans."
"What do they do?"
"For a coal power plant investment in Germany, they give 14 years of full allocations."
"There is no price incentive at all to switch from coal to gas, which was the cheapest option available in Europe to cut down CO2 emissions."
"The German and Polish allocation plans are scandalous."
"They destroy the whole system of incentives."
"Commissioner, you bear a great responsibility at the moment."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on emissions trading plays an important yet dangerous part in the issue of the Kyoto agreement."
"We are highly critical of what may turn into a mere trade in the right to pollute, on top of the harm done to countries suffering from underdevelopment."
"As we have heard, it is utterly ineffective in actually reducing emissions."
"We need to be quite clear about this, above all on the eve of a conference of the parties, the thirteenth on climate, which, emblematically, is to take place in Africa, in Nairobi."
"We should not be setting up a pollution market, but promoting new environmental development based on cooperation policies that should allow the richer countries to produce while polluting much less and the poorer ones to be helped to develop with access to new environmental technologies."
"This, then, is a substantial difference on which Europe must have a clear position when it takes part in the Nairobi conference: it needs to achieve a good balance between emissions trading and the promotion of truly beneficial cooperation policies."
"– () Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, climate change is one of the most crucial challenges that politicians such as ourselves have to face."
"Although emissions trading was intended to be one of the principal instruments in meeting this challenge head-on, it has to be said that the results achieved to date from its initial stage are not really convincing."
"It was planned that emissions trading should start on 1 January 2005, but there are many Member States in which that did not happen."
"The national allocation plans – including those approved by the Commission in the first phase – were not really ambitious, and what really did, of course, annoy businesses in the countries with fairly ambitious plans, was that the criteria for the grant of emissions certificates varied to a very considerable degree, so that, for example, a steelworks or a chalk plant got far more emissions certificates in one country than in another."
"These disparities were not merely a consequence of the burden sharing required by Kyoto; in some cases, they had been exaggerated, and that, of course, resulted in competition being distorted."
"During the process of framing the resolution on emissions trading, which was done by codecision, this House argued in favour of very clear and precise rules, to which the Commission’s response was that these were quite unnecessary, and that things could be managed, and excesses avoided, by the use of competition law."
"I get the impression that the Commission needs to take another, rather closer look and prevent distortions of competition between the Member States and between enterprises within them."
"As far as the next stage is concerned, the objective must not be – as it was in the first – that emissions trading should work more or less; on the contrary, it must work well."
"Distortions of competition must, in so far as is possible, be avoided, and, if European policy is to be credible, the maximum possible reductions in CO2 must be achieved."
"Mr President, Commissioner Dimas has said that the national allocation plans have been submitted by only nine countries – although, if Mrs Doyle is right in what she claims, and Ireland has done so, by ten – and that only six of them did so by the end of June as they meant to."
"Our tardiness in matters such as these is particularly disturbing in view of the fact that we have in fact seen a renewed increase in emissions, above all in the old Member States."
"What can the Commission, the European Council and the Presidency of the Council do to bring pressure to bear in this area, going beyond merely drafting resolutions to actually putting them into effect?"
"The second point I want to make has to do with the substance of these national action plans."
"What I would like to know is how the Commission or the European Council can ensure that the national action plans are rigorous, that our Member States are required to meet the Kyoto Protocol's requirements, to comply with our own laws, and prevented from buying their way out of their obligations?"
"– Mr President, I would like us to take another look at the allocation plan submitted by Germany, and the reason why I want to do that is that Germany will, next year, be assuming the Presidency not only of the EU Council, but also of the G8, both of which presidencies are crucial in terms of climate protection and energy policy."
"It is Germany that will be in charge of the preparations for next year's – 2007's – next major UN meeting, and it will be in Heiligendamm that landmark decisions will be taken."
"I do not believe that the sort of allocation plan that the Federal Republic has produced testifies to the German Government’s suitability for performing such functions."
"On the contrary, it is even now plain from the way in which certificates are to be allocated that certain major energy suppliers in Germany are going to use this trading of emissions as no more than yet another justification for price increases of the kind we have experienced already over the past year."
"It is also clear from this allocation plan that Germany is neglecting to offer any incentives for conversion from coal to fuels that generate less carbon dioxide."
"That I regard as disgraceful and absolutely indefensible in terms of the ongoing debate about the climate."
"If the EU wants to do as it should and, in future, once more play a leading role where the protection of the climate is concerned, then the German state – which will, after all, bear vital responsibility for Kyoto and the post-Kyoto process – must be urged to mend its ways."
"– Mr President, I should like to welcome the Commission statement on the greenhouse gas allowance trading schemes."
"Climate change is having a major economic and social impact."
"Consequently, pollution must be made expensive."
"One point which strengthens the credibility of the overall scheme is that of the declaration of emissions submitted by every undertaking to the competent national authority."
"There are undertakings that submit declarations certified by specialist agencies and firms, while others are not certified."
"The Commission therefore has a huge responsibility to safeguard and strengthen the credibility of the trading scheme and we call on it to take the necessary initiatives to safeguard the new scheme from any such distortions."
"I propose, in the run-up to the evaluation of the second national plans for 2008-2012, that the European Commission take the necessary measures in order to prevent Member States from granting excessively generous emission allowances to certain undertakings."
"I also call on the Commission to supervise the strict application of the methodology provided for, so that emission factors are applied not to combustion installations as a whole but to each combustion unit."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a question of the credibility of the EU’s climate protection policy."
"According to the , just five of the emission allowance allocations published by the Member States for the next phase fulfil the main criteria."
"We all know that, to protect the planet over the next few years, the largest developing countries have to be persuaded to agree to limit their emissions."
"How can we imagine them agreeing to that if the EU fails to live up to its own commitments under Kyoto?"
"The United States of America is also watching what we do."
"Until now, EU action has encouraged Americans who want their own country to be involved in global climate protection, but if we betray our commitments under Kyoto, that will be a victory for the opponents of climate protection in the United States and elsewhere."
"The Commission must now show determination and insist that the Member States of the EU comply with the key criteria in emissions trading."
"Unfortunately, one of the first Member States where the government has already bowed to the demands of a polluting company in the first phase of emissions trading is Finland."
"I appeal to the Commission not to allow this type of Finlandisation to spread."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first I would like to say thank you for this excellent debate, some points of which I wish, on behalf of the Council, to comment on."
"Firstly, with regard to these levels of emissions, we should not draw over-hasty conclusions after just one year: we definitely need to examine the issue over a period of more than a year."
"For example, for us in Northern Europe yearly temperatures – whether or not it will be a cold or mild winter – and the state of the seas, lakes and rivers are highly significant, not just for energy consumption but also for energy production, and thus also for volumes of emissions."
"Things can therefore vary greatly from one year to the next because of this."
"As has been said in this debate, the Member States are now engaged in allocation planning for the next phase, and, in addition to those countries whose proposals are already with the Commission, around 10 others have already published their own plans and are in the final stages of dealing with them at national level."
"The other Member States have not yet got quite so far, but I am very sure that they are making progress."
"It should be realised that these figures relate to 27 European countries, and not just 25."
"It has been mentioned here that there are flaws in the emissions trading scheme, and accordingly it is very important that the Commission now evaluates its viability very thoroughly and from different points of view."
"We are expecting the Commission’s evaluation to materialise later this autumn, and perhaps quite soon."
"We nevertheless do agree that, despite the flaws, this scheme is absolutely necessary, and should be taken in the direction of its original objective, which is that it should act as a genuine incentive for the players involved to invest in carbon-free, environmentally friendly technology."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all the speakers for their contributions to this afternoon’s discussion."
"We see that they are very concerned about this global problem and how the European Union is responding to it."
"Before I continue, I should like to assure Mrs Doyle that this discussion was not used as a cover by the Commission, for the simple reason that it was Parliament and not us who asked for this debate."
"So it cannot be a cover-up."
"Also, concerning my failure to mention that Ireland submitted a National Allocation Plan, I have it in my papers."
"I said ten Member States and I thought I mentioned Ireland, but if you did not hear it, then you are right."
"Looking further ahead, concerning the review, I am now preparing a high-quality review of the European Union emissions trading scheme to identify improvements to be made beyond 2012."
"This could not be done before because until 30 June 2006 we had not even received the actual emissions."
"The emissions were reported on 15 May 2006, but some countries sent their actual emissions on 30 June 2006."
"So how could we have the review before we received the actual emissions?"
"Later this year, following the adoption of the European Union emissions trading system review report in the coming weeks, the Commission will activate a stakeholder group under the auspices of the European Climate Change Programme to intensify the debate on the review."
"I firmly believe that we need to focus the review debate early in the process to ensure a high-quality outcome."
"The priority issues to be tackled in the review are, therefore, the harmonisation and extension of the scope of the directive, further harmonisation and more predictability of the cap-setting and allocation process – including consideration of competitiveness, more robust compliance and enforcement of the rules and the linking to trading schemes in third countries and increased involvement of developing countries."
"The Commission has already confirmed its intention to address aviation’s climate change impact through emissions trading."
"There are a number of good ideas to make emissions trading more effective, including giving longer-term certainty on allocations and increasing harmonisation in a number of areas."
"We need more time to discuss and further develop these valuable ideas."
"I am therefore aiming for the Commission to present a legislative proposal in the course of 2007."
"Here I should like to give a short answer regarding the concern expressed about power companies making windfall profits by pricing in the cost of allocations, although they receive them for free."
"Some companies have done that."
"The electricity price rose, not only because of the emissions trading system, but mainly because of high fuel prices and because of the lack of competition in the power and gas market – a lack of liberalisation."
"However, as one colleague mentioned, perhaps auctioning could be a solution, along with liberalisation, so we would avoid having windfall profits by power companies with consumers paying a higher price for electricity."
"According to the directive, auctioning is permitted for the second trading period, up to 10%."
"That is going to be one of the issues that will be discussed during the review period of the directive."
"Looking back, we can say that the infrastructure for emissions trading is sound and the market in allowances is developing rather well."
"In the first year of operations, 2005 – at least according to World Bank data – 320 million allowances are reported to have been traded via market intermediaries, valued at more than EUR 6 million."
"So, no one can say that the emissions trading system has failed."
"In 2006, the monthly trading volume has increased steadily, with volumes of 80 to 100 allowances in a busy month."
"A number of organised exchanges across Europe are offering platforms for trading allowances and a number of other market intermediaries, such as brokers, are also active in the market."
"I would like to say a few words about the so-called ‘over-allocation’ of allowances to installations that are covered by the emissions trading system."
"It is a fact that we had about 3% more allowances allocated than actual emissions."
"That could be for various reasons, one of which could be that companies’ installations reacted to the emissions saving system and the obligations arising from the system, and they have made the most obvious and easiest reductions in emissions by improving energy efficiency, for example, or through other easy-to-take measures."
"It was the case in Germany that we had a real reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide from installations."
"Another reason could be the very mild winter that we had in 2005, which reduced the cost of heating, and – perhaps the main reason – the companies participating in the system were over-optimistic about their business growth and over-estimated their emissions, while the Member States were complacent in accepting their figures."
"But, during the second trading period, we have made it quite clear to all Member States that the 12 criteria of the directive should be kept, especially for those countries that did not contract to achieve their individual quota target, which will contribute to the overall target for the European Union."
"Also, the actual emissions that we have now should be taken into full account."
"I am going to be tough but fair with Member States regarding the national allocation plans and am very glad for the support for this approach that has been obvious from your contributions today."
"The onus is firstly on governments to propose plans to the Commission which ensure that the European Union emissions trading system delivers its contribution to achieving our quota targets."
"At the same time, all stakeholders should engage in the process of improving and expanding the European Union scheme, so as to secure a global carbon market that can deliver the emissions reductions necessary to tackle climate change."
"I would like to thank you for the rich debate with encouraging and important contributions and for your continued support for the fight against global warming and the threat posed to future generations."
"The debate is closed."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0325/2006)."
"We will take the following questions to the Commission."
"With a view to the enlargement of the EU to include new eastern and central European countries whose borders are difficult to control, what measures does the Commission propose in order to prevent fresh enlargements from making it easier for illegal immigrants from third countries to enter the European Union?"
"."
"As you know, new Member States have to ensure a high level of border control upon accession."
"As far as the lifting of internal border control is concerned, new Member States are evaluated by experts of the Member States and of the Commission, whether they fulfil, amongst other preconditions, the high Schengen standards of external border control."
"In January 2006, the evaluation of the non-SAS related of the new Member States started, and a first assessment of their preparation will be available for the Council in December."
"I will be reporting to the ministers."
"With respect to illegal immigration, the Commission outlined the areas it considers to be future priorities in a communication which, as you know, was adopted on 19 July."
"The communication in particular explores how to further secure external borders, for instance by introducing intelligence-led ‘e-borders’ management and addresses the possible creation of an automated entry-exit system, the issue of regularisations and the need to tackle employment of illegally resident third country nationals."
"In addition, I would like to underline that in July the Commission adopted a proposal on establishing a mechanism for the creation of rapid border intervention teams."
"This mechanism, that will strengthen the solidarity between Member States and the Community, will allow Member States which face extraordinary obstacles in controlling their external borders to make use of the expertise and manpower of border guards of other Member States on a temporary basis."
"Mr President, the events of recent days appear to be demonstrating that the European Union is not prepared for waves of immigrants from areas close to the Union."
"I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania next year, we will have a new European Union sea border on the Black Sea, that there are States on the Black Sea such as Ukraine, Moldavia, Russia, Georgia, Armenia and Turkey and that that sea opens us up to the whole of Asia."
"Does the European Commission plan to establish a system for the Black Sea similar to the one it is beginning to establish on the Atlantic in order to prevent an avalanche of immigrants from descending on the European Union from the Asian continent?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can reply to the honourable Member that one of the priorities on which we are working with the Finnish Presidency is precisely to propose a European model for the integrated surveillance of our maritime borders by December, with an initial assessment in October."
"We are aware that a maritime border is very different from a land border or an airport border, and therefore the Black Sea will clearly also be one of the areas to be examined."
"May I just say to the honourable Member that I met the Bulgarian minister for internal affairs again just yesterday and once again I told him that Bulgaria and Romania must prepare appropriately for a strong European contribution in controlling an extremely sensitive border."
"– That the flow of illegal immigrants needs to be cut off is not a matter of doubt."
"The example given by Mr Medina Ortega highlights practices in his own country whereby national governments, by proceeding to – as they term it – legalise illegal immigrants, are actually sending out the wrong signal."
"Does the Commission see possibilities here, and is it contemplating indicating that a stop should be put to such courses of action, as a consequence of which these illegal immigrants can find their way into all the other Member States of the Union?"
"."
"You have touched upon an issue which really is a priority."
"I have said on a number of occasions that the huge problem of massive regularisations threatens to undermine the principle of solidarity between Member States."
"We addressed this issue for the first time in the Council some fourteen months ago."
"We decided then that every national measure to regularise illegal immigrants must be preceded by a European consultation that permits the rotating Presidency and the European Commission to give their opinion on the impact of such a regularisation measure on the other Member States."
"There too, we spoke of the principle of solidarity, and we approved a document."
"This document has not yet formally entered into force, but it has the value of a political decision."
"I therefore call upon every Member State of the Union planning to carry out regularisations to comply with this obligation to a preliminary consultation, in order to allow other Member States to adopt measures to take into account the impact of this massive regularisation."
"Commissioner, considering the huge scale of citizenship granted over recent years in Bulgaria to immigrants from Moldova, Ukraine, Russia and elsewhere, what realistic steps will be taken to control that immigration by proxy through Bulgaria and Romania?"
"With most other Member States not taking their fair share of immigration under the 2004 enlargement, would countries like mine, the United Kingdom, not be wholly justified in refusing to extend their present open-door policy to Romania and Bulgaria?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is certainly a highly sensitive subject, and I can confirm that I have personally raised the issue in my talks – including recent ones – with the government authorities of both Bulgaria and Romania."
"The answers are reassuring in that both these candidate countries, which are close to joining, realise what impact dual citizenship may have on the other European Union Member States."
"They have, however, posed us a problem that the European Union should be concerned about."
"It is the problem of countries like Ukraine and Moldova, which are demanding a new facilitation scheme for temporary EU entry visas."
"If we do not give serious consideration to these demands for a visa scheme for Ukraine and Moldova, the citizens of those countries will obviously try to resort to dangerous stratagems."
"As for workers’ freedom of movement, there are of course references in the accession treaties for Romania and Bulgaria to the possibility of extending, for a transitional period, the freedom of workers to go to other European Union countries."
"The European Commission’s argument, as regards the ten new countries that have been members of the Union since 2004, is that there is no longer any danger of an invasion by workers, and we have published a communication in that respect."
"If the two new Member States join at the beginning of next year, as I personally hope they will, they will have some restrictions. That will be understandable, considering that they will be new Member States within a second phase of enlargement."
"In the week ending 16 June, US reserves of crude oil rose by 1.4 m barrels to 347.1 m barrels."
"As a result, the country's oil reserves are now at their highest level since May 1998."
"Was this issue of the USA's unusually large oil reserves discussed at the annual EU-US summit in Vienna?"
"Might the USA be holding these large reserves in order to keep the price of oil artificially high, with all the adverse consequences this would have for the European economy?"
"How much American crude is being imported into the EU?"
"."
"It is true that the United States’ reserves of crude oil and petroleum products have recently reached record levels."
"However, growing reserves of crude oil or petroleum products in any consumer country should normally not put upward pressure on the world oil price."
"It is a well-documented statistical belief among experts that prices of oil and oil products increasingly relax with growing levels of reserves in major consumer countries."
"That is because risk premium is an important element in the price of oil in the world markets and is priced in by market operators on the basis of evaluations of various risk factors."
"Besides due political considerations, the probability of supply disruptions caused by insufficient spare capacities and reserve levels is a primary risk factor."
"Hence comfortable or even record levels of crude oil or petroleum product reserves in important consumer countries such as the United States tend to reduce the perception of risk by a vast majority of operators in global oil markets."
"Against this background, there was no need to discuss the question of levels of US crude oil and petroleum product reserves at the annual EU-US Summit."
"As for the crude oil imports from the US to the European Union, in the past three years the United States has supplied negligible quantities to the EU – less than one million tonnes per annum."
"That is less than 0.2% of EU’s total crude oil imports."
"In fact, the US itself is highly and increasingly dependent on crude oil imports."
"– Plans for affordable hydrogen-fuelled cars have in fact been lying around in drawers for years now, and some manufacturers are now in a position to put hybrid cars on the market at the same price as conventional ones."
"What practical steps is the EU taking to promote such alternatives in order to make us less dependent on both American oil policy and the oil-exporting countries?"
"."
"It is true that given the situation of oil prices, a number of initiatives have been studied and included in the five-point plan presented by Commissioner Piebalgs since September 2005."
"These were further developed in the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy."
"The Commission aims gradually to reduce the EU’s dependency on imported oil by creating energy efficiency, on the one hand, and by replacing it, on the other hand, with other energy sources, including biomass and other renewables."
"It also aims at strengthening the producer-consumer dialogue with oil-producing countries in order to promote new exploration and development to meet rising global demand; promoting transparency and predictability of the oil market and being well prepared for emergencies, especially by ensuring that Member States maintain the stocks as set out in the relevant EU legislation."
"It is important to know that all these policies – the ones on the use of fuel for cars, biomass and all the other measures just mentioned – will have a beneficial impact mainly in the medium to long term and not for the immediate future."
"– One of our aims, of course, is to make the European Union rather more independent in matters of energy supply, and there is no doubt that branching out into alternative and renewable types of energy would be important as a way of doing this."
"Which particular types of renewable energy will you be taking deliberate steps to promote in the near future, and to what extent?"
"Can you also supply figures for this?"
"."
"There is a number in the plan of Commissioner Piebalgs in this respect, so I would not, at this point, list which are priorities or otherwise."
"The issue of biofuel is one of the priorities in the European Union."
"It has been discussed in the College of Commissioners and in the Council, as have other areas such as the use of wind and solar energy."
"What I can do, given that I am not an expert on this issue, is to make sure that there will be a written reply from my colleague with more detail on this issue."
"In its resolution on the European Environment [amp] Health Action Plan 2004-2010 of 23 February 2006, Parliament encouraged the Commission to designate environmental tobacco smoke a class 1 carcinogen as soon as possible."
"However, no mention was made of this measure during the informal consultation on smoke-free policies at EU level (closing date: 14 June) organised by the Directorate-General for Health and Consumer Protection."
"Has the Commission taken any steps to classify passive smoking as carcinogenic to humans?"
"If not, why not?"
"Does the Commission intend to follow the recommendation of the ASPECT report and classify passive tobacco smoke as a carcinogenic agent?"
"If not, why not?"
"."
"I should like to thank Mr Florenz, because every time he asks questions on this subject he really helps our policies."
"It is true that it is estimated that 25% of all cancers in the European Union could be attributed to smoking."
"The World Health Organisation, the Finnish and German Governments and US agencies have already classified environmental tobacco smoke as a human carcinogen."
"As I have said to Parliament on many occasions in the past, action towards a smoke-free Europe is one of my main priorities."
"Before the end of 2006, the Commission intends to put forward a document on smoke-free environments, which will discuss the way forward to tackle passive smoking in Europe."
"It is true that DG Sanco’s informal consultation did not mention the classification of ETS as a carcinogen, firstly because it had a preliminary and informal character and it tried to get the opinion of selected players."
"However, we place great importance on Parliament’s view that classifying tobacco smoke as a carcinogen would be advisable."
"The problem is legal and not political, because we agree."
"There is a gap in the European legislation, so I would cover two aspects."
"Firstly, we have the problem that the existing legislation in the European Union that deals with dangerous products and substances does not cover smoke as such, but only products placed on the market."
"Therefore there is a gap there in the legislation."
"At the same time, the approach was similar to the legislation that deals with protection from carcinogens in the workplace."
"These two pieces of legislation unfortunately apply only to substances and preparations placed on the market."
"Under the purposes and intentions of these pieces of legislation, tobacco smoke as such is not considered a product."
"We have two approaches."
"On the one hand, in the consultation document we are to bring forward on the smoke-free environment, we shall ensure that we refer to the classification of ETS as a carcinogen – the one made by WHO, the US, Germany and Finland, so that we give the right information."
"At the same time, as components and ingredients of the smoke are already classified under European legislation as carcinogens – such as arsenic, butadiene, benzene, nitrogen oxides and other oxides – we shall ensure that we make reference to that as well."
"Therefore, legally we cannot say at this point that ETS is a carcinogen, but we can say that ETS contains components and substances which are carcinogens."
"I think the message is quite strong."
"This is what we can do in the immediate future."
"However, in the mean time and in the long run, we hope to find ways and explore the possibilities of how we can use or amend in that respect European legislation so that we have the possibility of classifying ETS as such as a carcinogen."
"This can be done both by exploring amendments to our legislation."
"There is also an ongoing debate now on the review of the legislation on carcinogens in the workplace, and perhaps we should consider including that as well."
"That would apply to the workplace, but it would be a first step."
"In conclusion, we will present every possible aspect in the paper which will be published soon – before the end of the year."
"However, in the meantime we will look at how to improve our existing legislation to ensure that we also have the legal competence to classify ETS as such as a carcinogen."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, in view of the fact that, in any given year, 10 000 people in Europe lose their lives as a result of passive smoking, I am sure you will understand why I am not particularly happy about that statement."
"While I do of course understand that there are loopholes in the law, it is – if I understand these things rightly – your job to close them."
"Thinking back to how, at the time of the BSE crisis, we responded to a vague suspicion of risk by turning Europe’s whole food policy on its head over a period of one or two years, we really should do more about this issue, where facts are actually to hand in the shape of some 10 000 victims per annum."
"We can tell you that my group will certainly do something about this by producing an own-initiative report along these lines with the aim of supporting you."
"."
"Definitely, I agree."
"I could also point to the problems mentioned in a report today, in the United Kingdom press I think, that are caused to the respiratory system and to the lungs and breathing problems caused by passive smoking."
"We also know that it causes heart problems."
"Our target, as you will realise from the paper we are to produce, is a smoke-free environment in the European Union."
"All these arguments help us to move in that direction."
"We will continue striving to achieve that target, but in the meantime we will explore what amendments are needed to our legislation so that we can proceed with the classification ourselves."
"Member States can do it and other international organisations can do it, so I do not see why the European Union should not be able to do it as well."
"Commissioner, I wonder whether you saw in the press this week – certainly in the British press – reports of a plan by a German entrepreneur to start smoking flights from Europe to Asia."
"Firstly, does the Commissioner condemn this and, secondly, is there anything the Commission can do legally to stop this from happening?"
"."
"I am afraid not."
"I do not know who would want to fly in such conditions."
"I conducted a small poll myself."
"I asked smokers if they would fly on a smoke-filled plane and they said ‘no’."
"As you know, there is no Community legislation on banning smoke on planes."
"It is the Member States that decide on that."
"Therefore it will remain the competence of the Member States."
"Given the recent messages from Germany regarding promoting a smoke-free environment, I am hopeful that they will look into that and that special legislation will come into force in 2007."
"– Although none of us want to live in a world in which everything is forbidden, I do believe that smoking – and passive smoking in particular – are examples of a situation in which our own actions are harmful to others."
"European hotels and restaurants have in fact undertaken to set aside certain parts of their premises as smoke-free areas, but this is no more than a voluntary commitment."
"Would you consider enacting a Europe-wide regulation according to which certain areas would have to be smoke-free, and with this actually being monitored, since controls on this are, to a great degree, more or less effective from one Member State to another?"
"."
"I am sure you know I have views on that, but I do not want to anticipate the outcome of the consultation process that will be launched very soon on smoke-free environments."
"Based on that we will see what will be the next steps we can take at European level."
"I am very much encouraged that one Member State after another is introducing smoking bans in public places."
"Lithuania and Slovenia recently took similar decisions, and Germany will also do so in the near future."
"However, for the European Community as a whole, the Commission will await the outcome of the consultation process before deciding what steps to take."
"As I said in my hearing before the committees in Parliament, my target would be to have a smoke-free Europe and to protect all citizens from passive smoking, not just in some Member States."
"My personal view is that just separating smokers from non-smokers is not enough and does not offer sufficient protection."
"If we really want to achieve benefits for all we have to go for full smoking bans."
"Nevertheless I look forward to Parliament’s contribution to the consultation process."
"In 2005, there were 140 000 company insolvencies in the European Union of the 15, threatening 1.5 million jobs."
"In the same year in Greece, there was a significant increase of 54.55% in the number of small and medium-sized Greek businesses which declared bankruptcy compared with 2004."
"In the light of these figures, what immediate measures will the Commission take to rescue small and medium-sized businesses?"
"."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I must begin by pointing out that the Commission has no direct responsibility where the law on bankruptcy is concerned."
"Since, however, this area is one of particular importance to smaller and medium-sized businesses, the Commission is endeavouring to act as an intermediary."
"We have ensured that tried and tested procedures have been publicised, and have encouraged Member States to adopt them."
"In the Commission’s view, its work is focused on preventing insolvencies and promoting restructuring rather than on the winding up of businesses."
"We are working towards more business-friendly provisions for non-fraudulent insolvencies, and we are, finally, giving consideration to how to support new starts and give businesses a second chance."
"Reference is made in the European Charter for Small Enterprises to the fact that some insolvencies can occur despite the exercise of responsible initiative and entrepreneurial risk-taking, and a review of national insolvency laws in the light of proven best practice is accordingly called for."
"Various steps have been taken to this end."
"Early in 2001, a seminar on the failure of enterprises was held in Noordwijk, at which the most important issues discussed were the improvement of bankruptcy legislation and the prevention of insolvencies."
"In mid-2002, the study ‘Bankruptcy and a Fresh Start’ was published, including a collection of data on the legal and social consequences of business insolvencies."
"This survey formed the basis for the Commission’s Best Procedure project 'Restructuring, bankruptcy and a fresh start’ in 2003, which focused on the two issues of to what extent national insolvency law was an obstacle to an enterprise’s continued existence and to its making a new start, and what effect the blemish of failure has on the prospects for success of a business making a new start after failure and on the culture of entrepreneurship in general."
"The outcomes of this project were presented in a report intended to support the trend in European policymaking towards changes in the legal framework of insolvency legislation."
"The principal recommendations and benchmarks ranged from an emphasis on the usefulness of external advice in preventing insolvencies via the role of up-to-date and reliable insolvency legislation in promoting settlements and restructuring measures through to the importance of drawing a clear distinction between fraudulent and non-fraudulent bankruptcy, while the report also set out the various relevant legal consequences."
"It did indeed help to step up efforts across Europe towards the reform of insolvency law."
"In response to a number of positions adopted in the ‘Entrepreneurship in Europe’ Green Paper, the Commission, in 2004, expanded the Entrepreneurship Action Plan by including in it a priority measure on business insolvencies with three specific objectives."
"The first of these was that the Member States should be encouraged to implement the recommendations of the group of experts on ‘restructuring, bankruptcy and a fresh start’."
"The second was that business failure should be better understood, and the third was the promotion of preventive measures for businesses at risk."
"Further to the second and third objectives, the Commission is currently developing, as part of the multiannual ‘Stigma of Failure and Early Warning Instruments’ project, an information kit and self-assessment tests enabling entrepreneurs to recognise at an early stage, when the prospects of getting help are still good, the risk factors by which their business is affected."
"On 28 March 2006, the Commission staged a conference in Brussels on the subject of ‘Insolvency and a fresh start’, which looked at the methods for preventing insolvencies, the ways whereby the stigma of business failure might be counteracted, and the encouragement of fresh starts following non-fraudulent business insolvencies."
"There are positive signs of these priorities being acted on at national level, with the national reform programmes for 2005 in connection with the Lisbon Strategy presented by approximately one-third of the Member States – and I might add that Greece is among them – including plans for the reform of the Member States' bankruptcy laws."
"– Madam President, thank you very much for the full reply and for the details of the action being taken by the Commission and the Council."
"I wanted to ask if the European Union's international obligations contribute towards the insolvency and sudden failure of businessmen."
"."
"As I have already said, we have, at European level, no power to deal with this matter, and so we cannot take action, whether through legislation or on the international stage."
"The only thing we can do is, as I have explained to you, to ensure, by way of cooperation, coordination and the sharing of experience in the Member States, that better legal framework conditions can be created."
"As I told you, there are some countries in which this has already happened, while others are still in the process of doing so, and in some of them the situation is still unsatisfactory."
"What I can tell you today is that we will give particular attention to this issue during the preparation of the next annual report on the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, with particular reference to those countries whose insolvency laws still amount to an obstacle to growth and employment."
"I have to start by admiring the Commission's capacity to answer detailed and difficult questions on SMEs in Greece."
"The best thing we can do as regards small and medium-sized enterprises is to liberalise markets and, in particular, to implement the four basic freedoms that already exist."
"My question is can you please guarantee to us today that you will resist the pressure that we are under from many, especially German, trade unions to further water down the Services Directive, which was the subject of such a nice compromise between the Council, the Commission and European Parliament?"
"Although I have to say that the connection between the honourable Member’s question and the problem of insolvency law, which we are discussing, is not one I find easy to perceive, I am nevertheless able to answer it."
"The Commission is quite firmly determined to do everything in its power to ensure that the services directive is adopted in the form on which a compromise has been reached with your House."
"– Madam President, Commissioner, when large firms go bankrupt, it is often the case that many small ones see their bills go unpaid."
"Could you envisage the possibility, in such an eventuality, of the European Investment Fund – for a certain period of time at least – being able to guarantee payment or make available an equity replacement loan?"
"I am sure you will understand that this question will have to be examined, for my answer to it would constitute a commitment on behalf of institutions for which I have no direct responsibility."
"What I will say, in rather more general terms, is that I do indeed believe that the instruments available to us for ameliorating the consequences of sudden structural change can be used in such cases as well, and so I could certainly envisage creative financial instruments in individual cases, but they really would have to be examined on a case—by-case basis."
"Here too, the problem is that European legislation is not possible under the framework conditions existing at the present time."
"An integrated European industrial policy is to be welcomed."
"In its current form, however, there is far too much emphasis on increasing competitiveness."
"Competitiveness is indeed important if industry is to develop but it would have been welcomed if the employment policy aspects had been taken into account to a greater extent."
"How will the Commission incorporate employment policy into the integrated industrial policy?"
"In a globalised world, the competitiveness of European industry is crucial to growth and employment."
"The proposals put forward by the Commission for a modern industrial policy are specifically intended not only to make the fullest possible use of European industry’s potential for employment, but also to extend it still further."
"There is, then, a quite direct connection between employment policy and industrial policy."
"I am obliged to you for your question, since it gives me the opportunity to clarify that the industry policy to which I am committed – as also is the Commission – is not one that defends the interests of ‘shareholder value’; on the contrary, the object of this industry policy is to secure in the long term high-quality jobs in Europe."
"The main goal of the policy I defend is to provide people with good-quality jobs, and enough of them."
"Contrary to one point of view that was formerly to be heard in Europe, we are, today, more than ever convinced that this goal will not be achieved without a strong industrial base in Europe, that is to say, industry that is strong, high-performing and competitive."
"I would also like to bring to your attention certain aspects of our policy that have to do quite specifically with the connection between industrial policy and employment policy."
"One I would mention in particular is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which has now – at the Commission’s suggestion – been set up, the funds allocated to which are primarily intended to help workers affected by rapid structural changes to gain further qualifications or find new jobs."
"I would point out to you that the Commission is currently working on a policy intended to remedy the skills shortages in Europe, improving the content of jobs and improving employment opportunities in numerous sectors, specifically in information and communications technology, machine-building, the textile and leather industry and various areas of raw materials production and manufacturing industry."
"The European Union is also helping to improve the functioning of working relationships and is strongly supportive of corporate social responsibility."
"Your question also provides me with an opportunity to say to European businesses that the achievement of high profits can never be a business’ sole objective, for a European business always has a social function to fulfil; it has a responsibility to society, and that responsibility primarily has to do with the jobs it provides."
"As you can see, considering our industrial policy in complete isolation from employment policy would be a quite artificial distinction to draw."
"It can, perhaps, be summed up in a single sentence. Modern industrial policy in Europe is a quite essential and indispensable contribution to the improvement of employment opportunities."
"Many thanks for your response, which I thought was sound."
"I likewise do not see any incompatibility between competition policy and employment policy."
"I just think that perhaps we should put more emphasis on employment policy in future."
"It is important for us to have a strong industrial policy in Europe if we are to be able to retain employment opportunities."
"In the light of demographic development, it is also important, however, for the employment opportunities in this sector to be of high quality and for us to focus on areas like skills development so that young people are attracted to going into the industrial sector."
"With competition in mind, it must not become difficult to recruit new workers."
"It is a very important task to solve this problem, given the way the demographics are heading."
"."
"I can do no more than tell the honourable Member that he and I are in complete agreement; that is precisely what the Commission is trying to do, and his question makes it clear to me that there is a need for more information and better communication."
"It seems to me that perhaps not everyone in Europe is as yet aware of what the essential substance of our strategy is, so I will repeat that the fundamental strategy that this Commission is pursuing is a strategy for growth and employment."
"That is what it is primarily about; that is what it is primarily intended to do."
"Alongside the many other means at our disposal, industrial policy is one of the instruments we use to achieve the goal of growth and employment."
"I very much welcome the Commissioner's responses, but can I also ask whether he would agree that more flexibility, particularly within the review of the working time directive, would be good for employment as well as competitiveness, and would he give a personal lead in promoting this?"
"."
"You will be aware that I have no leading role, and that I in no way wish to trespass on my fellow-Commissioners’ provinces, just as they do not interfere in matters within my remit, and so I will say, by way of reply, and with all due caution, that reference is made, in all the Commission documents on the subject of the need for reforms in Europe, to the fact that – in some sectors and in some Member States, at any rate – labour markets are too rigid, too lacking in flexibility, and that more flexibility in the labour markets – albeit always described very precisely in each instance – would indeed bear fruit in the shape of greater entrepreneurial initiative, more willingness to take risks, and, ultimately, to more jobs."
"In principle, then, I can answer your question in the affirmative; more flexible labour markets are, in the twenty-first century, a necessary part of the response to the structural problems that we have."
"– If you look at the current employment statistics, it is quite clear that the first and second sectors – that is to say, agriculture and industry – are, together with the services sector, suffering massive reversals in all the developed industrial states."
"I believe that the future lies in the services sector, and, if the Commission claims to be managing a strategy for employment and growth, would it not make more sense to focus its efforts there?"
"We could have an extremely interesting debate on this, but my answer is a clear ‘no’."
"You may be surprised that I am able to give such a clear answer."
"It is a fundamental error to think that it is possible to pursue a policy that favours the services sector over the manufacturing sector."
"In reality, the services sector cannot be developed at all without strong industry – a strong manufacturing industry – to purchase its services."
"If we look at the economic reality in Member States with a particularly high proportion of service industries, we see that many of the activities of the services sector have been contracted out by industry, but are exactly the same in substance as before."
"Our argument, therefore, is that, without a strong, efficient industrial basis, it will not be possible to carry out the expansion of the services sector that would be necessary to solve the employment problem by this means alone."
"I think that we need to look at these two as being closely interlinked."
"Can a statement be given by the European Commission listing the different measures that it has introduced in the years 2005 and 2006 to date to cut the level of red tape faced by small businesses within the European Union?"
"I have to admit, Madam President, that my problem with this question is that the sheer volume of the Commission’s recent activities and initiatives on this issue is such that I would need a very long time to relate everything we are doing at present."
"I shall give a summary, therefore, which will also help the President save time."
"Cutting red tape and reducing administrative costs for small and medium-sized enterprises, including by improving the quality of our legislation, is one of this Commission’s major political projects."
"That is what this Commission stands for."
"We have brought about a real paradigm shift."
"We are currently undertaking a systematic screening of the whole body of European legislation – and by this I mean really law by law, provision by provision – to see whether it can be simplified, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, and whether it contains requirements that put obstacles in their way."
"As the House knows, the Commission has put SME policy in its rightful place at the heart of our economic thinking, as it is they, rather than large enterprises, that are the decisive force in Europe, and what they need is to be given more freedom and more responsibility for their own affairs."
"They need an environment in which they can develop."
"We firmly believe that the ‘Bureaucracy reduction and better lawmaking’ project is a cross-cutting task for the whole of the Commission, a task that involves all the Directorates-General, and will make a vital contribution to strengthening the role of SMEs and encouraging more people in Europe to start up their own business, to take a risk themselves, and thereby provide jobs for others."
"Madam President, in the interests of time, I would perhaps suggest I provide the honourable Member with the full version of my answer, which details all these initiatives, and I am also willing to provide any further information required."
"I want to thank the Commissioner for his reply, and even though he said it would take him longer to put all the measures together, I am still encouraged by his response."
"Commissioner, is it not a fact that the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda are far from being attained, and that we are still lagging behind in measures necessary for the coordination and progress of SMEs under those objectives of the Lisbon Agenda that we initially laid down?"
"I would not now put it as strongly as that."
"Last year, I would have said just the same as the honourable Member."
"In the meanwhile, however, as he is aware, the Lisbon Strategy – the strategy for growth and jobs I have just spoken about – that was decided on last spring has been undergoing a complete revision."
"Without wanting to anticipate the report the Commission is due to present at the end of this year, I believe I can say one thing, which is that positive effects are indeed starting to emerge."
"They can be seen in the policies of Member States, and even in the European economy."
"I do not know if the honourable Members had the same feeling as I did when reading the newspaper today, but for the first time in a long time we read that production growth in Europe and economic growth in general has overtaken that of Japan and the USA."
"We are now, once more, growing faster than our American and Japanese competitors."
"That means that the gap is beginning to close, and I hope that this trend will continue."
"It is just an initial indicator, but it gives me hope and shows me that we are on the right track."
"Commissioner, without seeking to be unkind, is it not fair to say that the Commission’s record on cutting red tape has been very high on promise, but very low on delivery?"
"Indeed it is not without significance that though you promise us a recital in written form of some examples, you have not been able today in your substantive answer to give a single example of realistic cutting of red tape."
"The experience in my constituency is that businesses see no sign of it."
"They find themselves more and more burdened in circumstances where it is seriously impeding their competitiveness."
"I regret that I have to contradict the honourable Member, as the exact opposite is true."
"In the relatively short time since the launch of this initiative, we have achieved more than I had ever imagined."
"Firstly, as the honourable Member is aware, we have withdrawn one-third of all pending legislation without replacement as an initial step."
"Secondly, we have transformed legislative methods and introduced the compulsory complete impact assessment, which in itself brings a considerable improvement in the quality of ongoing legislation."
"Honourable Members will notice this here in Parliament when they discuss the proposals presented by the Commission."
"Thirdly, the simplification programme is in full swing."
"I am sorry to say that the Commission has been making rather faster progress on this than the other institutions."
"I always welcome criticism, but this criticism would be easier to bear if the speed of the decision-making by the Council and Parliament on the simplification proposals the Commission has already presented to the other institutions matched the speed at which the Commission presented them."
"Would the Commissioner accept that his warm words on small and medium-sized enterprises would have more credibility if our own research funds did not discriminate against small companies?"
"I know of a case of two companies – one large and one small – in the same programme, where the large company is audited at the end of the programme and receives its grants in advance, whereas the small company has to have an annual audit, at its own expense, and receives its money in arrears."
"Does the Commissioner not accept that this is a reversal of what the priorities should be?"
"I cannot answer this question without knowledge of the specific case."
"I would ask the honourable Member to give the relevant documentation either to me or to whichever of my fellow-Commissioners is responsible – of course, I do not know the field of competence in which this is supposed to have occurred – and then the case will be examined."
"At all events, there is no Commission policy of favouring large enterprises over smaller ones."
"The exact opposite is true."
"The requirements to be met by small and medium-sized enterprises when bidding for contracts and projects are significantly less exacting than those for large enterprises."
"SMEs can also receive a higher percentage of support than large enterprises."
"I am surprised by the practical example the honourable Member has given."
"It cannot be the rule – it must be an isolated case – and I would be happy to look into it."
"I would ask him to provide us with the relevant information."
"Question 45 will be answered in writing."
"Since Malta’s accession to the EU in 2004, thousands of European citizens have been outraged by the decision of the Maltese Government to allow hunting in spring."
"MEPs have since been pushing the Commission to ban spring hunting in Malta, the derogation being incompatible with the EU Birds Directive (79/409/CEE(1))."
"In its answer to question E-1318/06 in June 2006 the Commission stated that it had severe doubts about the Maltese claim that the hunting opportunities in autumn were minimal and that therefore spring derogation was justifiable."
"However, the Commission urged the Maltese authorities to present additional statistics to justify their claim."
"Could the Commission tell us if it has received any (satisfying) additional figures so far and, if not, when finally the Commission is expecting to make a decision on the compatibility of the spring hunting derogation in Malta in order to open and shut the case file?"
"The Birds Directive generally bans spring hunting."
"It only allows it when certain preconditions apply, the main one of which is that there are no satisfactory alternatives."
"Until now, certain Member States which requested this sort of derogation were unable to prove that there were no satisfactory alternatives to hunting, for example in the autumn period."
"The reason why hunting is banned in the spring period is because wild birds are migrating to their reproduction sites."
"They are birds that have survived the winter and numerous other hardships and are going to the sites where they reproduce."
"Consequently, there is a basic reason not to allow hunting of wild birds during this period."
"More importantly, as far as Malta is concerned, we asked for information on birds hunted during the 2004 period from the Maltese Government as far back as the autumn of 2004."
"The Maltese authorities have sent us the relevant data for the 2004 spring hunting period."
"We concluded from these data, which the Commission evaluated carefully in order to investigate if the grounds for a derogation really stood up, in other words that there was no satisfactory alternative hunting during other periods, that such preconditions applied."
"As a result, given that during the autumn period there is a significant number of quail and turtle doves which is not very different from the number of birds hunted during the spring period and taking account of the judgments of the European Court of Justice, we concluded that there is a satisfactory alternative and that the derogation is not therefore permissible."
"Having established this, the Commission started legal proceedings against Malta in July 2006 for infringement of the Birds Directive on the grounds that it had permitted spring hunting of these two species."
"I must say that similar infringement proceedings have also been set in motion against other Member States on the basis of the desired derogation for which the necessary preconditions are not met and that judgments have been returned, for example against Spain and Finland recently, on precisely these grounds."
"– Madam President, the question I would like to ask following the Commissioner’s answer is whether or not he considers it a crass error to take a decision of this nature solely on the basis of statistics gathered by the hunters. Would it not be better for the Commission to adopt a perspective that takes closer account of the reality of the situation, bearing in mind what the Maltese press and the birdwatching community have said?"
"."
"I know that there is doubt about the data submitted to us by the Maltese authorities, but even with these data, we have concluded that there is no reason for a derogation from the ban on spring hunting and we have started infringement procedures against Malta."
"What more can we do?"
"We want to show everybody that we are very serious about applying and enforcing the Birds Directive, which includes that provision."
"Otherwise, if we give different signals, many other countries would think that we have watered down the provisions of the Birds Directive and might also ask for a derogation."
"So we have started the infringement procedures and we shall see whether the Maltese authorities will comply and ban hunting during the spring period."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are now talking about 2004, but I read in the Maltese press that in the spring of 2005 and 2006, quite a few migratory birds were hunted, and a number of them shot down."
"Can you inform me whether the Maltese authorities have already sent the Commission an exemption report on this 2005 spring hunting, and what their duties are in this respect?"
"I think that this should have been done by June of this year."
"Has it been?"
"If so, could you give us an idea of its content, and what the reasons are for this exemption?"
"If not, when do you expect this report?"
"."
"There will be a meeting between the Maltese authorities and representatives of DG Environment this month."
"The various issues will be discussed, including that of the Maltese continuing to allow hunting of turtle doves and quails during the spring period."
"Ways of ensuring compliance with the Birds Directive will be looked at."
"As to the report and the figures for 2005, they are due by the end of this year."
"As the following questions deal with the same subject, they will be taken together."
"In October last year, the Commission initiated an EU ban on the import of wild caught birds."
"This decision was made on human health grounds."
"This trade should also be banned on the grounds that it is largely unsustainable, causing crashes in the populations of many birds in the wild."
"The EU imports an estimated two million birds each year."
"The Commission should therefore be congratulated for helping to save over one million birds since October."
"When questioned about the conservation impact of this trade, Commissioner Dimas assured environment ministers in December 2005 that the Commission would review the impact of this trade on conservation grounds."
"The Commission appears not to have initiated such a study."
"Can the Commission explain why this has not been started, and when the Commission intends to honour its pledge?"
"Will the Commission conduct a thorough study on the effect of the temporary ban on wild bird imports, with data from all Member States?"
"Illegal trade is difficult to measure, but it has been estimated that huge numbers of protected wild-caught birds are involved, and the argument that a total ban on the import of wild birds would drive the trade underground and cause an increase in illegally imported birds has been widely used by those who oppose a trade ban."
"However, preliminary analysis of data collected since October 2005 (when the temporary ban was established) published in a new RSPCA/Eurogroup for Animal Welfare report, shows that in fact the illegal trade has reduced, and that the fears are not justified."
"I shall try to answer the two related questions relating both to the study and to the ban on birds and the data provided by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."
"As far as veterinary and hygiene rules are concerned, the Commission took swift and effective preventive measures in October 2005 based on the existing framework of veterinary legislation."
"We had granted an extension to the import ban for all birds up to 31 May 2006; we granted a new extension up to 31 December 2006 and, due to developments in the issue of the spread of bird 'flu, there will most probably be a new extension."
"The Commission also asked the European Food Safety Authority for an expert opinion on questions of the health and survival conditions of the animals which concern the importation of birds other than poultry."
"This expert opinion is expected in October 2006."
"As regards the protection of biodiversity and wild birds, the Commission, following the Council last December, commissioned a study in January 2006 to examine the efficacy of Community regulations on the trade in wild species of flora and fauna."
"The basic framework for taking protective and trade measures is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species or CITES, which has been transposed into the law of the European Union in the regulations on trading in species of wild flora and fauna."
"For the time being, these regulations permit imports, provided that they do not endanger the regime for protecting species."
"The competent scientific committee of the European Union with which all the scientific authorities of the Member States of the European Union cooperate is responsible for examining imports of wild species of flora and fauna."
"That is where the necessary measures are taken relating to imports of species when a problem is identified; this does not only cover birds but relates to all species."
"The study we have commissioned will cover from a broad perspective the issue of the efficacy of these regulations for the protection of species of wild flora and fauna, with the emphasis on wild birds."
"The results of the study in question are expected to be available by the middle of 2007."
"Account will, of course, be taken during the preparation of this study of the conclusions of the report published by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the European Group for the Animal Survival Conventions."
"Thank you for that reply, Commissioner."
"I am glad that the study has at least started, despite the fact that we are having to wait until mid-2007, when it was first requested in December 2005."
"That seems to be quite a long way away, but let us hope it is worth the wait."
"Could you explain why the EU continues to import birds when countries such as the United States, for example, consider that those same birds are not sustainably harvested?"
"Since 1992 the US has imposed a moratorium on all CITES-listed birds unless it can be scientifically proven that they are harvested in a sustainable way."
"Since 1992 not a single one has been proved to be sustainably harvested."
"Many developing countries also have bans on the export of those birds."
"So how is it that the United States has such a different assessment from the EU as to whether or not they are being sustainably harvested?"
"."
"Firstly, I can tell you that the United States has not signed the Biodiversity Convention."
"It has different rules; it has a general ban but it also has exemptions."
"We have more or less the same result by having species considered separately."
"However, the results are more or less the same because the United States has a lot of illegal trade and we also have illegal trade."
"The Commission will look at what the United States is doing and what the results are."
"While the United States bans all imports, we have to look at it and see whether, firstly, this general ban will increase the illegal trade."
"We do not know."
"The study shows that perhaps we have less illegal trade, but we do not know what will happen in the future."
"If we introduce a permanent ban for birds we will have to consider how and why they are treated differently from all other species, like corals and reptiles, because we have a comprehensive policy."
"The United States has a different approach to this."
"We would also like to consider whether an unlimited trade ban by the United States could be challenged by exporting countries, for example within the framework of the World Trade Organization."
"This might also challenge and undermine our existing sophisticated restrictive measures which make it possible for the European Union to take temporary measures on a consultation basis with the exporting countries."
"But still, we will look at a ban with derogations in our study."
"Whatever the United States may do by way of exemptions, we have a temporary ban which has been shown to work in terms of reducing the illegal trade, but we do not have a permanent ban, and it is we in Europe who are the major importers of wild birds, at 93% - going on for a million a year until 2003."
"Between 40 and 70% of those birds die before they are exported and many more die en route to Europe."
"Surely it is time that we made our ban permanent and then led the world and set an example for countries like the United States and Australia?"
"."
"This study has shown that the recent confiscations have decreased after we had the ban for health reasons."
"It is difficult to measure exact numbers of illegally-traded animals, since these, by definition, are not known."
"The amount of seized and confiscated birds in the European Union may have recently decreased because of the current temporary ban on all imports."
"No birds are offered for any import procedures since they would automatically and immediately be refused."
"Of particular concern is that birds are still being traded illegally and seized in Member States."
"They are imported and introduced without any veterinary controls."
"Again, we shall see what the study tells us and whether a ban with derogations would be a better solution than the current system, which is a case-by-case examination of species."
"We permit the importation of only those birds that are not in danger of extinction."
"The Commissioner mentioned that he was concerned about birds threatened with extinction."
"He will be aware, however, that I and one of my constituents have written to him several times about the case of a legitimate and legal importer of birds from the United States, legally taken in the United States, who is being put out of business because of this ban – which is a ban for health reasons, for chickens, and which is not relevant to these particular wild birds in the United States."
"They are legal, legitimate and do not pose health risks."
"Why is the Commissioner imposing this draconian measure on small businesses in Europe?"
"."
"That is a question for my colleague, Mr Kyprianou."
"However, the obvious answer is avian flu and the ban which we have implemented for health reasons."
"That ban is a temporary one."
"It has to be extended until the end of December, and will perhaps be extended into next year, depending on developments in avian flu."
"In this particular case the United States is following a different policy, though the result is perhaps the same."
"They have a ban with derogations, while we may permit imports, but on a case-by-case basis."
"I wonder, Commissioner, whether you have ever considered the possibility of reversing the burden of proof."
"My question is that our current system for regulating the wild bird trade requires proof that it is harmful to wild populations before it can be suspended."
"Why can we not establish the sustainability of a wild bird or a species before trade begins?"
"In fact, that should apply to all species, not just birds."
"Also, the EU prohibits trade in its own wild birds under the Birds and Habitats directives."
"At the same time, we continue to adopt a cavalier approach towards the biodiversity of less developed countries through this trade, even though there is a ban for the moment."
"Is that an acceptable way to continue?"
"."
"World conservation of certain bird species is affected by international trade."
"Such species could be proposed for listing under the CITES Convention, depending on the appendices."
"Trade for commercial purposes is then prohibited or regulated by a permit and monitoring system."
"There is a certain way of deciding this under the CITES provisions."
"Species are only listed if specific conservation and trade criteria are fulfilled."
"Where these criteria are fulfilled, the Commission would support such listing."
"Any such listing is subject to a vote in CITES and the necessary majority might not always be attainable."
"We should remember that we must act in compliance with the law and meet our obligations under the CITES Convention and we cannot do otherwise if a vote is taken."
"Exporting countries are also involved and if we do not act in accordance with the law for a certain species, we may encounter problems for other species, such as reptiles or corals or other animals."
"Last April, the Commission served formal notice on Madrid City Council and the Madrid Autonomous Community as part of proceedings for failing to comply with Directive 85/337/EEC(2) in respect of the work on the M-30 motorway, on the basis of the information requested by the Commission following my question P-0494/04(3) of February 2004."
"Now that the City Council and the Autonomous Community have had the requisite two months to state their position to the Commission, can the latter confirm that they have done so?"
"If not, what is the Commission going to do?"
"If their position has indeed been stated, what are the details, and what is the Commission's response?"
"I think that the answer is very straightforward."
"I could perhaps say in one sentence that the Commission has sent a warning letter as regards the presumed incorrect application by the Spanish authorities of the amended directive on the impact of public and private works on the environment in the case of the project to construct the M30 orbital road in Madrid."
"This letter was sent by the Commission on 10 April 2006, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty, and Spain replied on 13 July 2006."
"We are currently evaluating the reply given by the Spanish authorities and will shortly be completing this evaluation."
"Madam President, Commissioner, in view of the response issued by the competent Spanish authorities, I hope that the European Commission will make a quick decision."
"I would like to say the following: the Commission’s letter of notice made it very clear that, in the Commission’s view, the content of Directive 85/337, which makes environmental impact studies for this type of public work essential, had not been respected."
"Since it had not been respected by those carrying out that public work, the legitimate rights and interests of the citizens of Madrid, that is to say, the European citizens of Madrid, were being harmed."
"Nevertheless, the is continuing with this work day and night despite the European Commission’s warning."
"In view of the letter of reply, it is therefore essential that that decision be immediate because, otherwise, rights will be violated almost irreversibly; that is what we must try to avoid."
"."
"I shall be as brief as possible."
"I would like to say that the Commission opened this investigation after you asked a question on the issue."
"The dimension and complexity of the project is such that it required several exchanges of information between the Commission and the Spanish authorities in order to gather all the factual and legal information needed for the Commission to properly and duly investigate the case."
"We will now perhaps need to obtain more information regarding the opening of the procedures."
"We came to the conclusion that the M-30 ring road project was not subject to a proper impact assessment pursuant to Council Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, in particular with regard to some of the subprojects into which the M-30 ring road project is divided."
"There has also been a failure to produce an assessment of the cumulative effects of those projects."
"That is the main problem."
"The project was split into 19 subprojects."
"For some subprojects there are impact assessments, but not for all, and there is no overall impact assessment for the whole project."
"That is what we consider to be a breach of the directive."
"Questions Nos 50 and 51 will be answered in writing."
"Questions Nos 52 and 53 will not be taken, as the subjects concerned are already on the agenda of this part-session."
"Questions Nos 54 to 58 will be answered in writing."
"What is the current situation as regards the legal status of non-Islamic religious communities, particularly Christians, in Turkey, especially with reference to religious freedom, the right to form entities that are empowered to act, building places of worship and parochial centres, and training a new generation of priests?"
"Does the Commissioner take the view that in this respect Turkey is now fully meeting the Copenhagen criteria on democracy and the rule of law?"
"."
"On 20 June 2006, I had an exchange of views with the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I shared with that committee the Commission’s concerns regarding the lack of momentum as regards political reforms in Turkey for the moment concerning, for instance, the issue raised by Mr Posselt."
"The Commission had hoped that the opening of accession negotiations would give a more tangible impetus to the reform process."
"As regards the difficulties faced by non-Muslim and Muslim religious minorities, there is clearly a lack of progress so far."
"In practice, non-Muslim religious communities continue to encounter significant problems: they lack a legal personality, face restricted property rights and interference in the management of their foundations, and are not allowed to train clergy."
"The Commission would also mention that the Alevi community experiences difficulties in terms of recognition of places of worship, representation in relevant state bodies as well as in compulsory religious education."
"Moreover, the draft law on Foundations, currently pending in the Turkish Parliament – and for too long – would only address some of these difficulties, namely the property regime for some of the communities, although not all of them."
"The Commission has repeatedly urged the Turkish authorities and the Turkish Grand National Assembly to amend the draft law on Foundations to bring it into line with relevant European standards."
"– I am much obliged to the Commissioner for his good answer."
"I should just like to ask again, in specific terms, whether Turkey has given him an answer, and whether it has had anything to say about what time frame it has in mind for the adoption of appropriate legal provisions."
"Or have these been put on hold until after the Turkish elections, or even shelved completely?"
"."
"We have discussed this matter, in terms of procedure."
"For instance, almost a year ago when I was in Turkey after the opening of the accession negotiations on 3 October 2005, we had an in-depth exchange of views on the matter with the relevant committee of the Turkish Grand National Assembly."
"Since then, we have raised this issue at various points, including in the context of the Association Council this spring."
"In our view, and according to the Turkish authorities, this should be part of the so-called ninth reform package which is still pending as a whole and which should be adopted without any undue delay by the Turkish Grand National Assembly and, in part, by the Turkish Government."
"This is certainly a critical precondition for accession to the European Union and we have made it very clear that Turkey cannot join the European Union without respecting this very fundamental principle."
"– Does the Commissioner think it would be possible to use the European Monitoring Centre in Vienna as a base for undertaking regular monitoring of the situation of religious minorities and commissioning studies on the subject?"
"."
"Mr Rübig has come up with a very interesting idea."
"We are using all the data and analysis provided by agencies such as the one he mentioned in Vienna."
"We are also using data from different human rights organisations."
"I will look into this matter but, as I understand it, we are already using analysis provided by that agency."
"We use a lot of analysis and data provided by bodies such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE, as well as agencies and other think-tanks."
"– Commissioner, we all know that the Halki Seminary was closed several years ago."
"Have you done anything in this direction for the Halki Seminary to reopen?"
"There is a danger that the Patriarch's ecumenical seat will have no one available in future for the election of the next Patriarch."
"Do you have anything in mind that you can tell us?"
"."
"The freedom of religion and worship is another key issue and we have raised it a number of times with the Turkish Government."
"We expect to see not only reflection but also concrete action in order to open the Halki seminary, which is very important for this particular religious community."
"In 2004 the EU pledged its obligation to sustain economic development and European integration in the north of Cyprus."
"Reducing the economic divide between the two sides would also reduce the costs of reunification for Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriot dependence on Turkey."
"In order to ensure that Turkey's accession and the UN settlement process are complementary rather than competing, would the Commission explain what the EU is doing to: commit to proceeding on trade regulation under a specified time frame and unblock funds in aid regulation for northern Cyprus to disburse on: aquis harmonisation, the civil service reform, refurbishment of Famagusta port and financing of a census in the north; implement a new funding instrument for northern Cyprus and establish a branch office of the Commission delegation in the north to oversee the delivery of funds for technical assistance and acquis harmonisation; revise current proposals for direct trade to include incorporation of northern Cyprus into the EU Customs Union with Turkey, amend the Green Line regulation, and jointly manage the Famagusta port with the Turkish Cypriots and ensure that Turkish Cypriots are fairly represented within the EU institutions?"
"."
"As regards the steps taken by the Commission with the aim of facilitating the reunification of the Island and thereby ending the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community, the following major activities can be reported."
"First, the Commission has started to implement the Council regulation that establishes an instrument of financial assistance for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community."
"That was adopted during the Austrian Presidency, on 27 February 2006."
"Our programme team responsible for the implementation of the regulation should be operational as of this month."
"It will use an EU programme support office in the northern part of Nicosia."
"The first projects envisaged for implementation encompass, inter alia, actions in the field of solid waste, energy, local infrastructure, business support and other very concrete measures."
"Within this framework, the Commission is also implementing an institution-building programme through the Technical Assistance and Information Exchange Instrument (TAIEX), in order to help prepare the Turkish Cypriot community for the future application of the in that part of the island."
"The proposed Direct Trade Regulation submitted by the Commission to the Council in July 2004 – over two years ago – is still before the Council."
"The Commission supports efforts of the Finnish Presidency to secure a speedy adoption of this trade regulation in order to fulfil the EU’s commitment of April 2004."
"We have no intention of withdrawing the proposal and submitting a revised version."
"We have been and remain ready to accept and facilitate any accompanying measures that would support reunification and economic development and that are acceptable to both communities and all parties, in order to overcome the very unfortunate current stalemate."
"It is a badly-kept secret that the accompanying measures have largely centred on the question of the Port of Famagusta."
"In reply to the question by Mr Matsis, the return of Varosha has been linked in the past to the UN-led talks on a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem."
"Therefore it is up to the parties involved to decide whether to keep this issue within the framework of the comprehensive settlement or to discuss it separately or to find a way to include it in both concepts."
"Where there is a will there is a way."
"We now expect both communities to approach the matter by focusing less on past injustice and more on future solutions."
"We expect a constructive spirit from all parties."
"It is high time to end the division and reunify Cyprus."
"Last night Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs adopted a critical report which notably urges Turkey to ‘take concrete steps for the normalisation of bilateral relations with EU Member Cyprus’."
"The report warns that a lack of progress ‘will have serious implications for the negotiation process and could even bring it to a halt’."
"What is the Commissioner’s view of this report and the likelihood that a lack of progress could halt talks?"
"Does the Commissioner agree that as far as the European Parliament is concerned there are still some harmful prejudices about Turkey with Turkophobes willing to seize upon any pretext to block the accession process?"
"."
"I have been briefed on the results of the vote in the Foreign Affairs Committee on the Eurlings Report on Turkey."
"I will comment on that report in the context of the debate at the next plenary session."
"I will do so when I am fully prepared and have studied it line-by-line and paragraph-by-paragraph."
"It is clear that a possible failure by Turkey to meet its obligations as regards the implementation of the additional protocol to the Ankara Agreement would have consequences for the overall negotiation process."
"That is almost word-by-word what the Council and Member States decided in September 2005, in the well-known EU declaration of the time prior to the opening of accession negotiations."
"Our aim is to avoid a possible train crash because it is in no one’s interests for EU-Turkey relations to be seriously damaged."
"The best way of avoiding that is for Turkey to meet the obligations it entered into before we opened the accession negotiations."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he is aware that since the opening of the passages from the North to the South in Cyprus, the per capita income of the Turkish Cypriot community has almost tripled due to the contacts with the South despite their purported isolation."
"."
"Thank you for providing us with those detailed observations concerning economic growth in the Turkish Cypriot community."
"I am glad if the Green Line Regulation and the facilities it opens up for intra-island trade are improving the economic situation of the Turkish Cypriot community."
"We want to improve the working of the Green Line Regulation."
"At the same time we are working very hard to unblock the situation concerning direct trade and to get all parties committed to resuming negotiations on the comprehensive settlement to reunify Cyprus."
"Commissioner, you spoke a moment ago of the stalemate in this situation."
"I tend to agree and perhaps there are also certain parallels with the position between Transnistria and Moldova, which we touched on yesterday in Parliament."
"I visited North Cyprus recently for the first time and found it enlightening to say the least."
"Notwithstanding all the other issues, but bearing in mind the fact that the people of the North of Cyprus voted for membership of the EU, could the EU not, at the very least, see its way forward to allowing direct flights to Northern Cyprus?"
"."
"Thank you for your question, Mr Evans."
"Our view on how to end the economic isolation of the Turkish Cypriot communities is very clear: we want to execute the financial assistance programme now and we want to facilitate a solution for direct trade, possibly with accompanying measures."
"At the same time, we trust that this will create confidence so that at some point – hopefully soon – we can resume talks, under the UN umbrella, on a comprehensive settlement leading to the reunification of Cyprus."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"– The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Thierry Cornillet, on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, on the counterfeiting of medicinal products (O-0039/2006 – B60310/2006)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, let us make no mistake about it, we are facing one of the world’s greatest scourges, and one that absolutely must not be regarded as inevitable."
"I actually think that, in this case, there is scope for the exercise of political will to a degree that there is not in the case of earthquakes and tsunamis, in the face of which we are fairly powerless."
"Here are a few figures. According to the World Health Organisation, of the million deaths attributable to malaria, 200 000 are apparently due to the counterfeiting or poor administration of medicines."
"The well-known British journal, , attributes 192 000 deaths in China to the taking of counterfeit medicines."
"How many hopes are ruined by the use of these medicines?"
"The necessary moral basis for justifying firm political action is given to us by this state of affairs, which can in no way be compared with the counterfeiting of luxury goods."
"I am thinking of products such as handbags, ballpoint pens, cigarette lighters and spectacles, the counterfeiting of which naturally requires the active complicity of the purchaser, who knows what he is buying and pretty rarely allows himself to be deceived."
"The counterfeiting of medicines is the most amoral of all forms of counterfeiting as, of course, there is no complicity at all in the purchase on the part of the buyer, who gets into debt only to end up killing his children."
"In this particular case, the Food and Drug Administration and the WHO believe that 10% of the world market is affected by counterfeiting."
"Seventy per cent of anti-malaria drugs in seven African countries are counterfeit medicines."
"On average, 25% of medicines taken in the least advanced countries – 50% in the case of Pakistan and Nigeria – are counterfeit medicines."
"What are we talking about?"
"I quote the WHO’s definition."
"A counterfeit medicine is one that is deliberately and fraudulently mislabelled with respect to identity or source."
"The medicine concerned may be either patented or a generic product. Some counterfeit products contain good ingredients and others bad ones or, indeed, no active ingredient at all."
"There are others that do not contain enough of the active ingredient and whose packaging is misleading."
"What is being done?"
"Little or nothing!"
"As I said, people are deceived, sometimes with their own consent; but if they kill, it is always without wanting to."
"We, here in the European Union, are in a protected environment."
"We have an efficient health system."
"Our health professions are monitored."
"The state keeps an eye on things and monitors society."
"We need, however, to do something for those countries that do not have all our advantages."
"That is a duty on the part of the Union, whose honour is at stake here."
"The world is, in fact, unprotected. There is little specific legislation, either international or national."
"There are few or no authorities to regulate and monitor product quality. Distribution systems are archaic and unsupervised, and there is no distinguishing between counterfeited and protected brands."
"Let us make no mistake."
"It is not a bunch of naive amateurs we are dealing with here."
"We are dealing with a very well organised underworld, as the counterfeiting of medicines is less risky and more lucrative than drug trafficking."
"We therefore need to pull out all the stops and take tough action right across the board."
"We ask that the European Union adopt a major role in drawing up an International Convention to combat counterfeiting at every stage."
"That is also the burden of written declaration no. 53, which I would encourage my fellow Members to sign."
"Since the beginning of 2006, the WHO has set up a working party to perfect model legislation for tackling counterfeiting – legislation that might then be adopted by each Member State."
"We in the European Union have the political means to take the lead, thanks to our network of partners and to the intellectual input, political support and financial backing of the bodies responsible for the supervision that we shall be able to exercise."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have all the means required for taking action. We have a wide range of partners."
"We have the amount of necessary aid – need it be pointed out that we are the world’s biggest aid donor and that just a tiny portion of this aid would enable us to solve the problem? We also have the legal machinery and the means of putting pressure on the main actors, which need to be the WHO and the UN."
"I do not wish to be sentimental, but who cannot but think of a mother mourning her child in the belief that she had given him the medicine that would save him."
"Imagine there being just one similar case in Europe and what our media would make of it."
"There are cases like this on a daily basis in the least advanced countries."
"We are not in the sphere of magic and of miracle cures. This is sordid reality."
"I should like to inform you, Commissioner, that, on behalf of the European Parliament and with the help of my fellow Members, I shall exercise my right to follow up this matter."
"In a year’s time, I shall question you again to see what has been done."
"There should be no let-up in fighting this war."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission shares the great concerns that Mr Cornillet has just expressed, and I have come to the same conclusion about the profoundly criminal nature of this counterfeiting."
"The question rightly mentions three problem areas."
"The first is the fight against counterfeit medicines within the European Union."
"The Commission is taking action on this at two levels."
"First of all, we have of course reinforced legal protection."
"In 2004, new legislation was adopted on the protection of intellectual property, and 2003 and 2004 saw the adoption of new legislation on customs action against goods suspected of infringing certain intellectual property rights."
"Discussions are currently being held on two proposals on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights."
"A recent study in the Community revealed that, within the European Union in the last five years, 27 counterfeit medicines have turned up in legal distribution channels and 170 in illegal distribution channels."
"On the basis of these findings, the Member States are currently developing measures to combat this counterfeiting."
"For its part, the Commission, together with the Member States, the European Medicines Agency and international partners, is investigating what measures will be necessary in future to protect public health."
"The issues being considered in this regard include the enforcement of existing legislation, cooperation between the various authorities, and also communication and awareness-raising."
"Nor do I exclude the possibility that the existing legislation will have to be further developed, and that we shall have to consider amending it."
"More effective customs controls are an important instrument for curbing the trade in counterfeit medicines."
"I am pleased to say that the quantity of counterfeit medicines seized by customs is already increasing."
"The Commission communication on a customs response to latest trends in counterfeiting and piracy that was issued recently addresses the problem of counterfeit medicines, and recommends specific measures to combat this growing threat."
"In the experience of the customs authorities, a large proportion of the counterfeits are transported through the EU and are often destined for developing countries."
"The fight against imported counterfeits is particularly difficult in that they often enter the EU in small quantities, and customs authorities have to detect the illegal goods in a very large number of small consignments."
"The Commission encourages right holders to take full advantage of the protection afforded by Council Regulation (EC) No 1383/2003."
"On their application for action by customs, right holders supply the information the customs authorities need in order to perform a targeted search for the highest-risk consignments."
"The second area concerns the issue of what we are doing for the poorer countries, which are actually the main victims of these counterfeit medicines."
"What are we doing to help them regulate and monitor the quality of medicines in their own territory?"
"As a matter of principle, we of course endeavour to work at multilateral level."
"The Commission therefore supports the initiatives of the World Health Organization to combat counterfeit medicines."
"The WHO Conference held in Rome in February 2006 created a platform for specific action."
"Accordingly, the Commission supports the launching of a WHO taskforce to combat counterfeit medicines at international level."
"The results of the work of this taskforce will benefit all WHO members, including developing countries."
"The Commission will play an active part in this taskforce and provide the necessary information."
"In addition, the Commission is carrying out projects supported by the European Development Fund, particularly the EC-WHO partnership on pharmaceutical policies."
"This partnership is intended to enable ACP countries to render more effective their legislation and quality assurance systems for medicines, and to improve aspects such as their controls, their action against substandard or counterfeit medicines and their information management."
"EUR 2.3 million have been provided for this."
"The third issue is the idea of an international convention against counterfeit medicines."
"The idea of such a convention was discussed in detail in the course of preparations for the February 2006 WHO Conference and at the conference itself."
"Most participants, including the Commission, were of the opinion that an international convention is not, at present, the most effective means of combating the growing threat from counterfeit medicines."
"The taskforce set up at the conference is in a better position to gather and pass on information and work out the urgently needed solutions."
"Finally, may I reassure the House that the Commission shares Parliament’s concerns and is prepared to take up suggestions and take further initiatives."
"."
"Mr President, I too should like to express my concern about the problems surrounding counterfeit medicines."
"Counterfeit medicines are manufactured and traded illegally without any form of supervision."
"Their effects cannot be checked, which makes them a potential risk to public health, and so this piracy should be stopped."
"Mr Cornillet already broached the subject, the Commissioner mentioned it as well and I welcome every measure the Commission takes to tackle this problem."
"Since problems mainly occur in the developing countries, the poor countries, that is also where I can foresee the biggest problems when it comes to dealing with this piracy efficiently and adequately."
"In those countries, the supply of reliable, legal medicines is often not organised as well as it is in Europe."
"That is why traders in counterfeit medicines have relatively more scope to sell their medicines, the effect of which cannot be checked and can, consequently, even be harmful to public health."
"In addition, developing countries often lack an adequate legal framework."
"Their laws are simply not adequate to the task of addressing this problem effectively."
"Even when these are in place, monitoring leaves a great deal to be desired."
"In developing countries, there is a need for affordable, effective and, of course, legal medicines, and that is why I should like to mention the scope which generic medicines offer."
"They cannot make the problem go away, but can go some way towards alleviating the need that exists."
"Unfortunately, little use is being made of them at the moment."
"More could be done perhaps in that area."
"The Commissioner claimed that an international convention or standard is not enough, but I can well imagine that one could make a difference, and if it proves inadequate, then more should be done."
"I take the view that a clear and universal approach is extremely important."
"Europe will need to do its bit, and that also involves the transfer of knowledge, in order to address the fight against counterfeit medicines more effectively."
"I would like to know – and the Commissioner has already partly answered in his explanation – what the new plans are for tackling counterfeit medicines and the organisation in this respect, particularly where criminal activity is concerned, in future."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to start by expressing my gratitude to Mr Cornillet, whose initiative we have to thank for the fact that we are discussing this important issue today and shall be adopting a resolution on it tomorrow."
"At the start of his speech, he gave the World Health Organization’s definition of what is to be understood by counterfeiting of medicines."
"I think that this is very important, as the discussion of this issue could easily become sidetracked, with many of us believing it was about saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to generic medicines."
"By giving this definition and through his stance, he made it clear that counterfeiting can affect both patented and generic medicines."
"As has also been said already, in developed countries it is predominantly so-called lifestyle drugs that are counterfeited, and no doubt we all have our own tales of deleting thousands of spam e-mails offering medicines at low to very low prices."
"In developing countries, medicines intended to treat diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/Aids are being counterfeited."
"Sometimes counterfeit medicines for simple illnesses such as coughs can even cause umpteen deaths, as they have had toxic chemicals added that are normally used in products such as antifreeze."
"According to the World Health Organization, 30 people died in Cambodia in 1999 after taking counterfeit malaria medicines."
"There is a whole list of tragic cases such as these and, in addition, there are probably many cases going unreported, as it is not possible to compile statistics on the problem of these criminal activities."
"This problem affects all regions of the world, but developing countries of course bear the brunt of the damage."
"Once again, the reasons are poverty and lack of access to health services."
"When people cannot afford the medicines they need, they will try to obtain them unofficially at lower prices."
"For this reason, it is impossible to combat this phenomenon properly without effective health services or affordable medicines."
"The measures to enhance intellectual property rights are good and are suitable as part of the strategy, but do not tackle the problem at its roots."
"It is important – and I should also like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for stating this so resolutely and specifically – that we assist the countries concerned in building their capacities for producing safe medicines in, and importing safe medicines into, their own countries."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I too should like to thank my colleague, Mr Cornillet, for having opened this crucial debate."
"We are all of one mind in saying that pirate medicines – and I am in complete agreement with what Mr Cornillet has stated – are a scourge that kills, above all, of course, in the least developed countries."
"Unfortunately, this potentially lethal counterfeiting is not widely known about and, in the majority of cases, goes almost unremarked."
"We are a long way here from the spectacular legal actions – recipients of much media attention – that have been brought by the manufacturers of luxury products and that, in a number of cases, have also been transferred to higher courts – actions that, it has also to be noted, have not met with much success."
"When it comes to antibiotics, the Pill, steroids, powdered milk for babies, anti-malaria drugs – which have already been talked about – vaccines – a counterfeit Tamiflu, for example – and Viagra too, the counterfeit medicines industry is quite amoral in the way it copies everything, since this is done without the consumer’s knowledge."
"Mr Cornillet quoted a whole range of revealing figures."
"I noted the EUR 25 billion per year represented by this traffic."
"Worldwide, one antibiotic in three and one medicine in ten are counterfeit."
"Over and above the damage to the economy obviously represented by these figures, the big issue here is the disastrous impact of this counterfeiting in terms of health."
"At best, these counterfeit medicines are ineffective. At worst – as I said – they kill, especially when it is a question of medicines used in the case of mortal diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis or AIDS."
"In China alone, the hub and empire of counterfeiting of every kind, 200 000 people were dying each year after having been treated with pirated medicines, including in a number of hospitals administered by the Chinese Red Cross."
"So much for the observations that can be made."
"As for the causes, these are known, at least in part."
"Mr Cornillet referred to them at length: the absence, still scarcely remedied, of any real will on the part of national governments to combat this scourge; the absence, too, in many countries of legislation that might genuinely act as a deterrent; the ridiculously low cost of these counterfeit medicines; and, above all, the poverty to be found in the countries concerned and the fact that the most vulnerable population groups, which are crying out for accessible medicines, find it impossible to gain access to health systems."
"In a debate such as this, no one claims to have the solution, or at least a ready-made one, but a responsible policy needs to be proposed, given the urgency of the situation."
"In April, while denouncing all forms of counterfeiting before this Assembly, Commissioner Frattini took a tougher stance in terms of sanctions against Europeans and developing countries."
"The European Union must take the lead and, in close cooperation with the WHO, put a global strategy in place to combat this scourge effectively."
"Certainly, judicial and police coordination needs to be set up and sanctions put in place, but people also need to be informed and, above all, warned."
"Today, the difficulty consists in making essential high quality medicines available to the whole populations in the countries concerned."
"."
"Commissioner, the counterfeiting of medicines is, indeed, a particularly serious scourge and one that, unfortunately, is not new and that has even been known about for several years."
"It might therefore be hoped that our fellow Member’s timely question will finally lead to some results."
"That being said, the main motive for counterfeiting medicines has to do with the fact that they are much too highly priced for poor countries and their populations."
"The first tactic should therefore consist in ensuring that poor countries and the most impoverished populations have access to generic medicines. This is something that my fellow Member has spoken about."
"Generic medicines still do not have a significant enough place on the medicines market."
"Furthermore, I would not want the fight against counterfeiting to consist in reinforcing the protection of patents in the pharmaceutical sphere and so protecting the future development of the already considerable profits made by the pharmaceutical industry in many sectors."
"The priority is, therefore, to encourage the development of public health policies in the countries concerned, as well as to encourage the establishment of states governed by the rule of law."
"That is indeed the priority."
"Nothing is possible unless viable states and public health policies are established enabling, in particular, medicines to be monitored and pharmacies to be set up in accordance with properly laid down rules."
"This issue of a public health policy is one basic element, the other being prevention."
"Indeed, health is not just about medicines."
"In other words, swallowing medicines is not the only route to good health."
"For example, unclean drinking water is at present a cause of death in a number of developing countries."
"Another example relates to AIDS."
"The counterfeiting of medicines is highly developed in this area, and the recently held Onusida conference placed great emphasis on prevention."
"It is therefore also through policies of prevention, information and education and by relying on the practical knowledge present in local communities that attempts might be made to solve the problem and not merely through putting dozens of substances on the market at prohibitive prices."
"In conclusion, I think that, in the fight against counterfeiting, we have to begin by strengthening existing measures and coordinating them better."
"Then, we must above all help the developing, or poorest, countries to establish viable states and to put public policies in place covering all health problems and not only that of access to medicines."
"– I have received six motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report by John Bowis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on improving the mental health of the population – towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union (2006/2058(INI) (A6-0249/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, I very much appreciate Parliament’s active participation in the consultation on the Commission’s Green Paper on mental health."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for his excellent report."
"It is almost a year since the Commission presented its Green Paper on improving the mental health of the population."
"The Green Paper was also a response to the WHO ministerial conference, which involved all EU Member States."
"In the declaration it adopted, the conference called upon the Commission to support the Green Paper’s implementation."
"The Green Paper presented mental health as a central part of overall public health and a key determinant of quality of life in the European Union."
"It argued that public mental health was also a key factor in the attainment of the EU’s strategic objectives – prosperity, solidarity and social cohesion, as well as justice."
"European values and the European social model demand that we give the necessary support to those who suffer from mental disorders and to promote social inclusion."
"Perhaps this is one of the basic messages to emerge from the consultation process and from the report and resolution, namely that tackling social inclusion and the stigma attached to mental health problems is a key factor in our efforts to deal with this whole question."
"Because of the stigma attached, people who suffer from mental health problems do not admit to them, do not seek help."
"As a result, not only do they not get treatment, but also the reality and effectiveness of the statistical data are distorted, which in turn means that the matter is not always a priority for Member States and governments, since sometimes the figures may appear misleadingly low."
"Therefore, dealing with this stigma and dealing with social inclusion is not just a human rights issue and not just an obligation, but can also have practical effects in our efforts to give priority and emphasis to actions and activities designed to tackle this problem."
"The Green Paper pursued three objectives."
"One was a broad discussion of the importance of exploring whether a on mental health strategy should be developed at EU level and identifying what the priorities of such a strategy should be."
"We held a full consultation."
"We had more than 150 contributions."
"One of the most important contributions, of course, will be Parliament’s resolution."
"The draft report that has been tabled for today’s debate addresses mental health in its full complexity."
"I welcome the fact that it includes a number of very concrete suggestions."
"That is very important and helpful to us for the next steps we are to take."
"I agree with almost all the points contained in the report and the Commission will give due consideration to these proposals when deciding on the next steps to be taken."
"We are now in the process of analysing the results of the consultation and as of yesterday, if I am not mistaken, all the contributions are available on our public health website."
"A document summarising the consultation outcomes will be prepared and published in the autumn."
"I can say at this stage that the preliminary results of the consultation showed very strong support for the development of an EU mental health strategy."
"I hope to present a Commission White Paper on mental health during the first quarter of next year presenting a strategy and proposing a framework for sustainable cooperation between Member States, policy fields and the relevant stakeholders."
"I am firmly of the opinion that what we need most in order to promote positive mental health in the community and encourage social inclusion is dialogue, consensus-building and more importantly, action."
"That is extremely important."
"Raising awareness and exchanging approaches and good practice are important steps and in the long term can be more powerful than any other initiatives."
"I look forward to the debate."
"Once again, I thank Parliament for this initiative."
"Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his words of welcome on this report."
"Colleagues, 450 million people in our world live with a mental disorder."
"One in four of us will suffer from one during our lifetime; 58 000 people in Europe commit suicide every year and ten times that number try to."
"More people die needlessly from suicide than from road accidents or Aids."
"Three in every hundred of us will have depression; one in three of us going to our family doctor will have a mental health problem, but only one in six of us will be diagnosed as such."
"That does not mean that two out of three of us will have good mental health: it means that we may not need, may not seek, or may not be offered treatment."
"It may mean that we are given inappropriate treatment with drugs, therapies, institutions and laws that at best may do no harm, and at worst may lead to physical and psychological damage."
"It almost certainly means that we are labelled, patronised, despised, feared and to a greater or lesser extent segregated in society, within our family, at work, at play and even within our health and social services."
"In a perverse reversal, we can hide but we cannot run."
"We cannot perform, we cannot contribute to society as we would wish, we cannot lead full and fulfilling lives, as we would want."
"It also means that we have barely scratched the surface of creating a policy to promote mental wellbeing among our citizens from their early years, through the adult years of work and leisure and into old age and the years of increasing frailty."
"That is why I welcome what has been achieved, firstly by a sequence of Council Presidencies – starting and culminating now with the Finnish Presidency – and by the Commission, where this Green Paper was drafted and will be driven through to active policy-making in the coming months."
"When as a child I first came across mental illness, it was something you did not talk about."
"When I first came across mental health policy it had not progressed far from the locks, bolts, restraint garments, isolation rooms, powers to detain, forcible administration of drugs and so on – or so it seemed."
"In fact mental health policy has been on the move since the 1960s, with more humane surroundings, treatments and therapies."
"Patients have been on the move too, going into community housing or back to their own homes."
"The public has not always liked that."
"No longer ‘out of sight, out of mind’, it became ‘out of his or her mind and living next door to me and my children’."
"If modern, humane mental health policy is to work, it must have a spectrum of care and a range of health and social services, housing, training, transport and other services working in partnership."
"It must have trust between professionals, patients and families, and it needs our resources."
"To get those it needs political awareness, and that needs public consent and professional support."
"A service that does not gain professional, public and political support fails patients and their families doubly."
"It fails to treat and care adequately and it prompts a downward spiral of public confidence and so reinforces stigma."
"Stigma is rampant in all our countries."
"It is a human rights abuse."
"It is unintentional, borne out of fear and ignorance, but just as damaging to the individual as any other form of abuse."
"We all contribute to the stigmatisation of people who, if they had a physical problem, would receive our sympathy and support."
"However, with mental illness we so often turn away and hope that someone else will cope."
"Living with mental illness is tough enough without adding to the burden of illness the pain of rejection and stigma."
"And so we must listen to patients and service users."
"They should be our partners and not just our patients."
"We have legislated against discrimination for people with disabilities."
"Perhaps we need to do so for people with mental health problems – both those in hospital and those in the community."
"My report is about these things."
"It points the way forward to some of the changes we need."
"If the public believes, they will put pressure on governments, and those governments will then invest in good services."
"That makes public belief possible."
"We know that neuro-psychiatric disorders are responsible for a third of disabilities, 15% of in-patient costs, a quarter of drugs costs, half the caseload of social workers and so forth. I want to be sure that if I, my wife or a member of my family has this problem in due course, as one of us is quite likely to, then I want a system in which they are hugged rather than rejected, loved rather than forgotten; a system in which it is not the case that they do not know people or do not know where they are; a system in which they are not within blank, cold, alien walls."
"I would want them to have hope and not self-fulfilling despair."
"If we understand that it could be any of us – and it will be many of us – then we will seek a better service."
"In my report I quote those words of Stefan Heym from Alexanderplatz in 1989 East Berlin:"
"(In these last weeks we have regained our power of speech and learnt once more to walk with our heads held high.)"
"The stigma of mental health is as repressive a regime as East Germany was."
"It stills our tongue, makes us hide our head and our task is to make sure that people with mental health disorders will, with our help, find their voices once again, their dignity, their self-respect and walk once more with their heads held high."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I have worked for many years on issues of concern to people with disabilities and those who serve them."
"Some progress has been made for some people with some disabilities."
"Sadly, this progress has not for the most part been shared by people who experience mental illness."
"Judging from the keen interest in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Members are aware that in our very midst people with mental illness are being subjected to the inhuman abuses of involuntary institutionalisation and hospitalisation, compulsory drugging and other medical treatments, physical restraint and force, while also being subject to discrimination in the workplace, exclusion in the community and suspicion on the part of public services."
"Fortunately, there was a real sense in the committee that this must change, that priority must be given to approaches to treatment that enable people to achieve remission and recovery, as well as to inclusion, the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health."
"Finally, there must be recognition that every human person is valuable and worthy of respect and that this respect demands that we allow people to speak and decide for themselves whenever humanly possible."
"As we work through the process of formulating a European mental health strategy, the most important question we should ask ourselves is: will this make someone’s life better?"
"I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his report, which contains many good things: an admittance that pharmaceuticals can cause more mental illness than they cure; a recognition of the importance of childhood for mental health with a call for support for families; a recognition that employment can affect mental health for better and for worse; and the need to consult those who have recovered from mental illness to learn how recovery happened."
"This is a good start but, if we are going to truly help someone with this strategy, then we must take into account the whole person and to do so the strategy will have to include concepts like nutrition and failure, especially student failure, and for this reason I particularly support the amendments by Mrs Breyer."
"We also need to look at concepts as yet unmentioned, such as hope and fear, creativity and expression, faith and spirituality."
"It amazes me that we can write a whole strategy without ever mentioning the words ‘spirit’ or ‘spirituality’."
"It is important for us to accept that there are moments of crisis, sorrow and strain in all of our lives and that when we experience them we may need support and we may need understanding, but we do not always need a diagnosis and a drug."
"Getting it right is so important."
"When we consider suicide, then we see that getting it right can even be a matter of life and death."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality has held a passionate debate on the mental health strategy."
"In the short time allowed to me it is difficult to summarise the richness of the debate, but I am pleased to highlight the unanimous vote, which, extremely briefly, suggests three basic points."
"The first point is the strong consensus for the proposal to deinstitutionalise psychiatric services; the aim of abolishing the internment and segregation of the mentally ill is seen by the committee as a step forwards in affirming the dignity of the person and, for that reason as well, Europe is fully entitled to deal with it."
"The second point is a strong emphasis on a wide range of approaches with regard to the need for prevention and for users and local services to be actively involved at all levels in the global strategy, and even more so in the area of prevention."
"The third point is a call to take the gender dimension into account, which is the most glaring omission in the Green Paper."
"We claim that the proposed measures need to include systematic research with specific studies on women, since problems such as eating disorders, neurovegetative diseases, schizophrenia, depression and suicide have not yet been studied from a gender perspective and that means that the progress made in prevention and treatment is less significant than is needed."
"Hopefully, though, we are making headway."
"Commissioner, you will allow me first of all to congratulate my colleague, Mr Bowis, who has done a remarkable piece of work on a particularly important subject that affects us all, since a quarter of all Europeans will have mental health problems during their lives, with all the considerable repercussions that these will involve for those close to them."
"I fear that this subject in reality affects everyone. Whoever we are, mental health affects us."
"For a very long time, we have, however, closed our eyes to these evils."
"Poor mental health was supposedly just a difficult patch people went through, or not even that."
"These people felt stigmatised inasmuch as they had to keep their suffering secret."
"This oppressive silence ought no longer to exist nowadays."
"To dare to talk about mental health problems is already to have taken action."
"Talking about these illnesses is a first step towards curing most of them."
"To isolate people with mental health problems and to discriminate against them is like pointing a loaded pistol at their heads."
"I am thinking of the young man with a promising future whose life is suddenly turned upside down when, on reaching adulthood, he proves to be schizophrenic."
"This is distressing not only for him but also for his family."
"The number of suicide attempts ought to make us reflect on the importance of this problem. Moreover, a certain amount of crime is a result of the increase in certain types of mental health problem."
"The ageing of our populations ought also to give us pause for thought as it is, unfortunately, accompanied by an increase in mental illness."
"We must take this phenomenon into account."
"The European Union may develop its measures to prevent poor mental health, but it must also help researchers confront this phenomenon in order better to understand the factors that affect mental health, particularly during early childhood, to manage patients’ progress more effectively, to promote the most suitable medicines available and to support efforts directed at training health care professionals."
"An adult is not cared for in the same way as a child or adolescent."
"We can also reflect on the various possible approaches to be adopted according to whether the patient concerned is a man or a woman."
"Nor let us forget the crucial role played by the doctor in monitoring the patient."
"Doctors sometimes feel very alone and ponder the whys and wherefores of forcing patients to take drugs or of locking them away."
"Together with my fellow Members, I hope that the Commission will take this approach further and that it will return to us with proposals based on those for which we shall vote tomorrow."
"It is crucial that full importance be given to mental health in European health policy and that a different view be taken of mental illnesses, with people being accorded the respect and due dignity that any human being should inspire."
"– Commissioner, the promotion of mental health is an issue that concerns not only mental patients and their families; it basically concerns society because we all at some point face some form of mental illness which may cause significant economic and social problems."
"Today's debate on the report by my honourable friend Mr Bowis, whom I should like to congratulate, if I may, on his exceptional work, is extremely important."
"Thus public consultation is being set in motion in the Union about the introduction of a strategy for mental health."
"Action needs to be taken for the prevention, timely diagnosis and treatment of the mental illnesses which strike part of the population, in order to limit the personal financial and social consequences."
"At the same time, the action in question must target better information and the development of appropriate attitudes and skills, in order to protect mental health and combat the stigma which attaches to mental illness."
"At the same time, I should like to highlight the need for continual education of primary health care professionals in mental health issues, as this ensures the best possible response to them."
"I also consider it necessary to apply individualised methods for promoting mental health, taking account of the particular needs of target groups, such as people with disabilities."
"Given the fact that the results are better when people with mental health problems are treated in society, while long-term institutionalisation in mental health hospitals may exacerbate their condition, we need to support their deinstitutionalisation."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as Albert Camus once said: 'Losing your life is not a big deal."
"But seeing how your life is losing its sense and how your existence is losing its purpose – that is unbearable."
"It is impossible to live without purpose.'"
"In this constantly developing world, more and more people become disenchanted with themselves and others, are experiencing stress, see no purpose in life, are unable to face new challenges and solve the problems they face."
"Now, we are increasingly seeking out the specialists, psychologists and psychiatrists that we avoided a decade ago."
"There is no shame in admitting the need for help."
"Unfortunately, people who ask for help are still stigmatised by society."
"10 September is World Suicide Prevention Day, and 10 October is World Mental Health Day."
"Is it not paradoxical that we are forced to draw society’s attention to such painful problems each month?"
"It is hard to admit that the number of people suffering from mental illness is increasing even at a time when mental healthcare is seemingly improving."
"The increase in the number of suicides is catastrophic."
"Every 40 seconds, someone in the world commits suicide, and every 3 seconds someone attempts to commit suicide."
"Lithuania, my country, loses more than 1 500 people each year to suicide, and sadly this ranks us first in all of Europe, leaving behind even Russia and other post-Soviet countries."
"We obviously cannot disregard the current situation."
"Immediately after the Ministerial Conference in Helsinki, Lithuania started drafting its national mental health policy, which will be soon approved by Parliament."
"Furthermore, mental health has been established as a priority within national policy."
"It is one of four areas that will receive Structural Funds for the health sector."
"We realise that we must develop community-based services as an alternative to permanent care institutions, thus solving the issues of human rights in a modern way."
"It is impossible to suffer in silence, alone with one's own grief; that is why we need to rally our efforts to solve the problems of mental health."
"I believe that the EU’s Green Paper 'Improving the mental health of the population' is the first important step in pursuing a common solution."
"It is not only treatment that matters."
"For the first time we are speaking about the promotion of mental health, illness prevention and recovery."
"We must also share information and best practices with our colleagues from other countries and develop information exchange networks."
"We have finally realised that solving these problems is not merely the province of specialists."
"Society and every one of us individually must take responsibility."
"'With understanding, new hope', the slogan of World Suicide Prevention Day, embodies the hope of those who are not indifferent to the suffering of others and the hope that society will come to the aid of those in distress."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I hope that this Green Paper sends out a signal, at long last, in favour of improving mental health in the EU."
"Increased political awareness of the mental wellbeing of European citizens is long overdue."
"In my view, however, it is a serious omission that neither the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety nor the Commission proposal contains a comprehensive causal analysis."
"We know that environmental pollution, poor diet and food allergies have an effect on both physical and mental wellbeing."
"The effects of toxic chemicals on hormonal balance are evident."
"There is a pressing need for an analysis to be carried out at long last of neurological disturbances resulting from environmental toxins and pesticides, and of the connection between attention deficit disorder and food intolerances."
"We also know that highly gifted children and young people, for example, often wrongly end up receiving psychiatric treatment owing to a failure to recognise them as such."
"There must be greater readiness to deal with this issue, too."
"This is also the reason for my concern about the risk of the pharmaceutical industry jumping on the bandwagon and promoting medicines as the only solution."
"We need to tackle the issue of the need to perform a comprehensive approach involving analysis and treatment instead of further medicalising and pathologising life cycles."
"After all, it is unacceptable that healthy, lively children, children who had previously been considered perfectly healthy, should now be diagnosed with attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and be prescribed medication, and it is also unacceptable that young people should be exposed to high levels of violence in the media and then labelled as psychologically ill and prescribed medication."
"We must also ask ourselves whether there can ever be a guarantee of happiness in our consumer society, and therefore whether it sends out the wrong signal to automatically treat people with antidepressants every time they are grieving or in a bad mood – things that we all have to go through."
"My concern, therefore, is that we may be setting the wrong course with this Green Paper, and also with a White Paper."
"We should carry out a causal analysis and should not rely solely on prescribing medication."
"Parliament’s call for medicines to be used as a last resort, once the causes of the psychological illness have been sufficiently explained, should be central, and we cannot let ourselves become the lackeys of the pharmaceutical industry and dedicate ourselves to further pathologising and medicalising life cycles and processes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report, for which I sincerely thank Mr Bowis, can make a significant contribution to a better Europe, one that respects the dignity of psychiatric patients, assists them and helps them back into society, while putting an end to unacceptable practices such as segregation in mental institutions."
"In short it will be a better Europe, since a civilisation is judged very much on how it behaves in these situations in relation to the weakest individuals and those most at risk."
"A year ago, a group of people who are commonly termed ‘mad’ came here to Strasbourg from Rome in a coach, together with mental health workers and family members."
"They had come to talk to us about the situation in Italy: a law named after a psychiatrist, Franco Basaglia, who is unfortunately no longer among us, who fought with them – ‘mad’ men and women – for patient dignity, shut down mental institutions and set up an alternative, local assistance and rehabilitation scheme, because of which people in Italy are now in a better position."
"These ‘mad’ men and women came to ask us to roll out the scheme in Europe, because they would thus feel more like citizens of this Europe, in which all too often they have been, and still are, discriminated against and deprived of their rights."
"With this report today, we are beginning to respond to that demand, and we can tell them, ‘You are citizens like everyone else’."
"But for that to happen completely, this work, which we have done with all our hearts, and the work contained in the Green Paper through positive collaboration between Parliament and the Commission, needs to be turned into something significant that will also provide the various countries with guidance: in other words, a genuine directive for a Europe without mental institutions that restores dignity to all psychiatric patients."
"."
"Mr President, it is rare for the issue of rights and ethical standards to be brought up in a debate on mental health."
"Some people even view immoral behaviour as a symptom of modernity."
"However, that kind of lifestyle leads to disorders and inhibits personal development."
"A person is then driven by biological stimuli from the subcortex region of the brain that are not checked or controlled by the cortex, where the higher emotions are based."
"In these individuals, the thought process and intelligence are governed by instincts which correspond to underdeveloped higher moral and aesthetic emotions and an inability to share social or patriotic bonds."
"In this way, disturbed personal and emotional development may affect not only individuals, but whole groups and communities."
"This goes hand in hand with a rise in psychopathic tendencies in society which further corrupt it, leading to an increase in mental disorders and a deterioration of the personality."
"Another problem facing modern medicine, in relation to the treatment of mental disorders, is that symptomatic treatment merely eliminates the symptoms but fails to provide an effective cure."
"The issue of mental health is not a new phenomenon, but it has been discussed a lot lately in Europe and the United States."
"I would like to examine this issue from the perspective of the work environment, which is one of the contributing factors in the worsening of mental health."
"The effort to improve the economy and prosperity of our regions has brought about a change in working conditions."
"Teleworking, the more intensive use of communications technologies, changes in working habits, increased mobility – all these have had an effect on the mental health of workers."
"Job requirements related to flexibility, education and skills have been getting tougher, with the result that middle-aged and older employees are unable to adapt to the changing conditions."
"The constant stress may lead to mental problems."
"In addition to the medical dimension of the issue, it is necessary to recognise the economic consequences of the population’s deteriorating mental health."
"Stress triggers poorer work attendance, inferior work performance or commitment, and problems among colleagues at work."
"Since public health is on the national agendas of the Member States, and since the European Union has limited powers in this area, we must turn our attention to those countries that encounter greater problems and have less funds available for their remedy."
"In spite of the large number of suicides in Northern Europe and the United Kingdom, I believe that we should draw our attention primarily to the new Member States, five of which rank among the countries with the highest suicide rates in the EU."
"Countries in Central and Eastern Europe, including Slovakia, have undergone significant changes, and their citizens have had to adapt to a changing working environment, acquiring new skills and habits in line with those of Western Europe."
"They have had to re-qualify and manage new, more sophisticated procedures very rapidly, which has had a negative impact mainly on middle-aged and older employees."
"In addition to that, the above-mentioned countries suffer from high unemployment, which also contributes to the worsening of mental health."
"It has been suggested that a new agency should be set up to tackle this problem."
"I do not agree with this point of view."
"I believe that it would be far more efficient to restructure the existing agencies, including those agencies that deal directly with issues related to mental health."
"Mr President, I should like to thank both the Commissioner, for an excellent Green Paper, and Mr Bowis for his report, which has added even more to what was an excellent standing start."
"Thank you, John."
"Your particular interest and feeling for this subject is inspirational to many of us here."
"Health services and healthcare are individual Member State competences, but under Article 152, we in Europe have a mandate as regards promotion, prevention and the dissemination of information."
"That is exactly what this debate on the Green Paper can do: ensure that we open up this whole area, focus on the major problems of stigma and discrimination and exchange best practice and epidemiological figures on this area."
"Commissioner, you mentioned that the figures do not show the real burden of the disease of mental health."
"Because of the stigma and discrimination, many do not access treatment and help."
"I would fully agree with you."
"In fact, I would seriously question our data."
"I would say that they reflect probably half – being generous – of what the real burden of the disease could actually be."
"Most employees with acute or chronic depression, for example, hide it from their employers for fear of the adverse impact on their careers."
"Therefore, raising awareness, changing attitudes and, above all, exchanging best practice is an enormous contribution we can make here to this most important area."
"The figures are startling: 18 million people across the EU suffer from severe depression; 58 000 of our citizens commit suicide every year – roughly equivalent to two or three small towns in any rural area being obliterated every year."
"Ten times that number attempt suicide."
"One in four of us is likely to experience mental health problems at some point in our lives and over 27% of adults in Europe are affected by mental health problems every year."
"Depression and anxiety disorders, including stress and eating disorders, are the most common mental health problems experienced."
"Studies estimate, frighteningly, that by 2020 neuro-psychiatric disorders, with depression at the top of the list, will be the highest-ranking cause of illness in the developed world."
"A major portion of that will be caused by the ageing of Europe, which will pose a particular challenge."
"Mental ill health is preventable and treatable."
"We need to encourage early intervention and ensure that, if possible, as was suggested by my colleague Mr Bowis, we look again at legislation on discrimination to see if we can include discrimination against those with mental health problems as part of that package."
"We need to do all we can with the competence we have."
"Unfortunately, with the European Constitutional Treaty not moving as some of us would have hoped, our competence is fairly limited."
"However, that does not stop us joining up the dots in the relevant areas of European law that exist at the moment."
"Above all we must open up this subject and be inclusive to those who are suffering in this particular area."
"Ignoring this problem and not providing the facilities and treatment that are needed costs Europe three to four per cent of our GDP per year."
"Thank you, Commissioner, for your work and, above all, thanks to my colleague Mr Bowis for his excellent report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has few powers in the field of public health, and that is how it should stay, for health is primarily a responsibility of the Member States."
"Europe does have a very important complementary role to play: common research policy where health occupies an important place and a public health action programme that aims to improve the quality of care and treatment methods by exchanging data, by bundling expertise and by allowing countries to learn from one another."
"Since this approach is particularly promising in the area of mental health, Commissioner, I welcome the Green Paper."
"I am also indebted to Mr Bowis for his commitment and involvement in this."
"He has written an excellent report."
"It has been said several times this evening that one in four Europeans, or one hundred million of us, experience a bout of serious illness at least once in their lives."
"That is tragic and also accounts for 3 to 4% of the Gross Domestic Product."
"Mental health problems cover a multitude of things and can range from eating disorders in girls or young women, alcoholism, drug addiction, through to behavioural problems, depression, as well as other psychiatric illnesses."
"It is difficult to develop successful treatment methods for those illnesses."
"Take drug addiction."
"What is the best way of overcoming addiction?"
"Is it medicines, methadone, talking therapy, or a Narconon programme that involves saunas and vitamins?"
"A serious comparison of the success of the different recovery methods would be useful."
"Or take eating disorders and depression: there are success stories, but just as many failures."
"What matters is that expertise is combined, that practitioners learn from one another, that patients or addicts gain awareness of successful treatment methods."
"In this sense, it is also useful to set up a European coordination-expertise group, in which patients, addicts and care institutions should all be involved."
"This should be turned into a kind of help desk with a website where one in four Europeans and their families can seek help when they suffer from mental health problems."
"That is when European cooperation comes into its own."
"Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I wish to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"Mr Bowis has thoroughly and successfully addressed all the important issues concerning a strategy for mental health in the EU and my group fully endorses his report."
"As regards the amendments tabled, the ALDE Group will support the two PSE Amendments 11 and 12, but with the following proposed oral amendment to each."
"In both amendments, the words ‘some of’ should be inserted after the word ‘in’ so that the text reads: ‘in some of the new Member States’."
"This is necessary because what is referred to in the amendments does not apply to all new Member States and it would be inappropriate and erroneous not to make this clear."
"I am sure this small alteration will be agreed by all concerned."
"On the main substance of the report, I only wish to re-emphasise a couple of points."
"Firstly, the fact that mental ill health is extremely common."
"It is estimated that approximately 100 million EU citizens will be affected by it during their lifetime."
"It does not appear to be so common in everyday life, because most people choose to hide it away."
"The time has now come to bring the issue of mental illness out of the closet of denial and shame and deal with it openly, rationally and effectively."
"Secondly, there is the fact that mental illness is unfortunately subject to stigmatisation in our societies."
"In my view, this stems from our limited comprehension of the function of one of our most important vital organs, the brain."
"The brain, like other vital organs such as the heart and the lungs, is susceptible to disease, which results in malfunction."
"A malfunctioning heart will give rise to cardiac disease."
"In the same way a malfunctioning brain will give rise to mental disease."
"The main difference in my view is that we may not yet be able to identify the exact anatomical and/or histological and/or biochemical anomaly giving rise to the particular brain malfunction."
"I am sure we will be able to do this in the future, as our scientific knowledge of neurology and neuroscience progresses."
"So mental illness should be nothing to be ashamed of."
"The mentally-ill patient is no different to a cardiac patient or any other patient."
"In conclusion, I very much wish and hope that this report will mark the end of the dark ages approach to mental disorders and the beginning of a new era of understanding in dealing with both the treatment and prevention of mental ill health."
"Mr President, I too should like to congratulate Mr Bowis on his excellent report."
"I should also like to say that it is not just a gender issue: there is certainly a very strong racial perspective as well that is attached to mental health and mental illness."
"At least we are past the age where sexual orientation was seen as a mental disorder, but there is still, as others have said, a tremendous amount of work to be done."
"As Mr Bowis himself pointed out, we have only just begun to scratch the surface in terms of what we would call promoting mental wellbeing."
"The World Health Organisation describes mental health as a state of wellbeing in which the individual realises his or her abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community."
"That has enormous implications for the social inclusion policies that we pursue and, as a Member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I want to pick up – as others have done – on the world of work, focusing in particular on paragraph 27 of the report."
"It is not just about the influence of mental health on employment, but the effect of employment on mental health."
"As others have said, stress is potentially the largest cause of time off work."
"The Bilbao Agency has done a lot of work on that."
"Self-reported work-related stress, depression or anxiety accounted in the UK recently for nearly 13 million lost working days in one year."
"If that had been the result of physical injury at the workplace there would have been an enormous outcry."
"Many companies do not have a policy for dealing with stress."
"Many managers cannot recognise it in themselves and cannot manage it in others."
"So we need to develop training there, and we need to have a culture at work where you can admit to stress, have it dealt with seriously and work with working practices that promote mental wellbeing."
"– We all naturally agree that mental health is a prerequisite for intellectual and emotional fulfilment and for integrating people into society."
"In recent years, however, mental health has not received sufficient attention compared to other areas."
"The Commission’s Green Paper, and in particular the outstanding report by Mr Bowis, plug that gap, putting forwards a great many proposals, not only for the Commission, but also for doctors and the general public."
"The report before us identifies the main problems in the area of mental health which form part of the broader context, offering food for thought on such hotly debated issues as the stigmatisation of the mentally ill, methods of treating patients and the gender differences which are so prevalent in mental health."
"First, I should like to highlight the call from Mr Bowis and the Commission’s Green Paper for prevention as the most effective way of combating the growing incidence of mental illness."
"This ought to be one of the priorities in our proactive approach."
"It is precisely the influence of environment, employment and the family that should form the focus of our attention and our action plans, as these are the areas affecting mental health where prevention can work."
"I also very much welcome the important reference to gender difference in the area of mental health, which was not sufficiently addressed in the Commission's Green Paper."
"Women are more likely to seek healthcare, and to take more pharmaceutical products, which they are less able to tolerate."
"They are also often subject to undesirable pressure from their peers, which may lead to mental breakdown."
"One area that certainly deserves attention in the future, not only from doctors and politicians, but also from the general public, is the stigmatisation of the mentally ill."
"The emphasis attached to this issue in the report is an indication of the seriousness of the situation."
"I welcome all of the comments and proposals made by the rapporteur."
"Although I consider the proposals for best practice to be very positive, and believe that they will lead to higher standards – speaking as a doctor I very much support these proposals – it is unfortunately the fact that in my country the programmes in question are extremely expensive and thus far sadly not priority areas."
"The possibility of joint EU programmes in this area could help resolve this dilemma."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Bowis on an excellent report which helps us to realise how important mental health is not only in the life of an individual but also for society."
"The prevention of mental disorders, psychotherapy for children, adults and families, the treatment of nervous disorders and the promotion of mental hygiene are all the more important since we know that real mental disorders such as psychoses can be treated but not cured."
"It is worth remembering that, in the field of psychiatry, there are no medicines that can cure in the strictest sense of the word and that those that do exist were discovered by accident."
"In Western civilisation, there is a persistent tendency to suppress and to block out of our consciousness the existence of any weakness, especially mental weakness."
"Only somatic illnesses are tolerated."
"However, if we dedicated more funds to the work of psychologists and psychotherapy, we could save money on medical consultations for treating the body and on healthcare spending as a whole."
"– Mr President, according to the World Health Organisation, mental health is necessary to the wellbeing of individuals, societies and countries and must be addressed globally on a new basis, from a new point of view which creates new hope."
"In this report, we are guided by the data of the World Health Organisation and are, for the first time, inaugurating a systematic effort to promote mental health."
"The families of sufferers, which provide material and moral support to their members suffering from mental health problems, fall victim, together with the persons in question, to the negative consequences of the stigma and of the discrimination which accompanies these illnesses."
"Consequently, support for them by professionals in order to meet their obvious needs, together with information and a systematic fight against the stigma are necessary components when addressing mental illnesses."
"I consider it equally necessary to investigate the mechanisms and causes of these illnesses and to improve the corresponding treatment, including the development of new treatment methods."
"Here I should like to emphasise that the most important difference between these patients and most other serious conditions which may even lead to death is that they upset the functioning of the brain, such as for example memory functions, cognitive functions and the conscience, in other words the functions which are inextricably bound up with the personality of the human being."
"This personality is eroded and may ultimately be destroyed by many of these conditions."
"Consequently, if the objective of prevention and cure of human illness is a very serious priority, then the corresponding objective relating to neuro-psychological illnesses is the top priority if we wish to prevent the quintessence of European society from being eroded and breaking up, especially as this society includes in its composition many elderly people who, as we know, are vulnerable to neuro-degenerative illnesses."
"To close, I wish to say that, bearing firmly in mind that prevention, timely recognition and correct treatment significantly limit the personal, economic and social consequences, I believe that, in voting for the excellent report by my honourable friend, Mr Bowis, we are inaugurating a course that will give mental illnesses the serious priority they warrant and result in more effective action against this modern scourge."
"Mr President, please accept my cordial welcome for such an unusually sincere and personal presentation of the draft report."
"This report and the debates that followed are an important step by the European Parliament in support of the development of the new mental health policy by the Commission, which is especially important to the new EU Member States."
"Poor mental health indicators, such as high suicide rates and numerous cases of violence and abuse, especially alcohol abuse, are not unusual in such countries."
"The new Member States have inherited inefficient mental healthcare systems based on large psychiatric institutions that just serve to perpetuate social exclusion and stigma."
"Presently, even these institutions are poorly financed, and thus, floundering and failing to perform their already limited functions."
"There is obviously a lack in the community-based services that should be a part of healthcare and social infrastructure."
"We can usually only report isolated cases of success in care homes for mental health patients, while home healthcare and community-based services are actually much more humanistic, better compatible with human rights and more cost-effective."
"We have no tradition of home healthcare that would be supported by society; therefore, the old system is resisting giving up its positions."
"The increasing number of children, who are growing up in state institutions, is particularly disturbing."
"This is further proof of the lack of an alternative system that would help parents in high-risk groups to properly raise and educate their children."
"Some new Member States have already taken the first steps towards implementing provisions that are compliant with EU principles."
"Lithuania has drafted a mental health policy that will be presented to Parliament for approval this year."
"Lithuania has also initiated the project 'Child and adolescent mental health in an enlarged European Union: development of effective policies and practices'."
"This project was supported by the Commission and has attracted 18 participant countries and 34 associate partners."
"Mr President, I am pleased to speak on this timely and well-considered report and I congratulate the rapporteur."
"Firstly, I agree that the added value of a Community strategy on mental health is primarily in the field of prevention and awareness-raising and that any proposals from the Commission should involve partnership and consultation with all relevant parties."
"An essential element of any strategy will be to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness and this will require a multifaceted approach, including information, education, anti-discrimination legislation, community-based approaches and responsible reporting by the media."
"I fully support the proposal in the report that Member States should work together to implement effective strategies to reduce suicide, because this is not only a national or European issue but also a global one."
"In Ireland, suicide is the most common cause of death in 18-24 year olds."
"Unfortunately, it is the highest within this age group in the EU."
"Such deaths devastate families and tear the heart out of communities."
"A recent survey conducted in my own area of North Leitrim and West Cavan entitled ‘Men on the Border’, painted a distressing picture of the reality of life for many single, older men, with 56% or respondents saying that they knew somebody who had committed suicide."
"Given that I always like to link what we do here with what is happening in our constituencies, I am pleased to say that this survey was partly funded by the EU and I hope that its recommendations will help to improve the situation."
"Finally, while expenditure on mental health is a national competence, I believe that we need to highlight the sizable differences in mental health expenditure in individual Member States and I am not proud to say that our own levels in Ireland are inadequate."
"I agree with the rapporteur that public pressure is needed to ensure adequate expenditure to promote mental health and to prevent mental illness."
"Mr President, a tsunami is sweeping the European economy and European societies, a giant wave that is known as mental illness but that I prefer to call neurological illness to prevent its being stigmatised."
"The number of patients is continuously increasing, the wave replenished by the obvious ageing of the population and by the sacred cow of ultraliberal economics, which is itself a form of neurosis."
"No doubt the European Commission has something to say about this, as does the rapporteur, in paragraph 24, who talks of rural isolation, working conditions, job insecurity and unemployment."
"What, however, has led to rural isolation if not the destruction of the common agricultural policy, and that in the name of free trade?"
"What has led to unemployment if not the political choice in favour of free trade?"
"What causes stress in the working environment, if not the ideology of competitiveness or competition?"
"What are needed in order to treat these neurological illnesses are what Mr Bowis calls for: hospitals, individual care, specialised services and a variety of health care personnel – in other words, investment, which is something prohibited by the budgetary austerity pact in the name, of course, of the ideology of competitiveness and free trade."
"That is the point at which we go round in circles because what brings on illness is a mistaken philosophy of economic competition and what is required to treat it is investment, which is something prevented by this same philosophy."
"Although it may well require an agency responsible for exploring the continent of the mind, the solution probably consists mainly in curing our leaders."
"I have just one more thing to say."
"Of Don Quixote of la Mancha it was said that he had read so many books on chivalry that his brain had dried up."
"In the case of our leaders, they have read so much Adam Smith and David Ricardo that they have gone mad."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, our greatest asset is indisputably our health – physical, but also mental."
"All too often, health policy in the past and present has focused exclusively on considerations of physical health."
"This is tangible, often even visible, and is often easier to treat."
"In addition, even maintaining physical health is very cost intensive and, unfortunately, it is often the case that not all the available possibilities are still affordable today."
"Our healthcare network, from prevention to aftercare, is bankrupting the public coffers."
"It is not the intention of this report, on which I should like to congratulate Mr Bowis, that the EU play an active part in the health field."
"That is the responsibility of the Member States and should remain so."
"Nevertheless, we are in favour of the issuing of this Commission Green Paper to stimulate discussion of the importance of mental health in the EU, of the necessity of having a strategy, and of any priorities."
"We now know that good mental health is also a precondition for good economic performance."
"We need to ask ourselves questions and seek answers, however."
"To begin with: who are we referring to when we speak of those with ‘mental ill health’?"
"Why are 13% of Europeans seeking professional help in this field?"
"Why do so many people in the EU commit suicide?"
"We have heard the figures; at the hearing a figure of 58 000 each year was mentioned."
"Why is society so ill?"
"What are the causes?"
"Are the demands of our society perhaps too great in general?"
"Then there is the big question: what happens to these disadvantaged members of society?"
"These issues need to be discussed in order to raise awareness."
"One thing is certain: social changes are also needed in order to prevent these illnesses."
"As we know, it is difficult to tackle the harshness and competitiveness of people’s working lives."
"Many things are easier to bear, however, if people have a haven, or a chance to withdraw."
"I am thinking here mainly of the family, which gives people the opportunity to rest and recharge their batteries."
"Nevertheless, families need help and support in order to fulfil all their important social functions."
"One thing is certain: it is not possible to control human beings by law, but it is possible and indeed necessary to create the conditions in which they and their health can grow – mind, body and soul."
"Let us support the family, therefore, and if that is one of the intentions of the report, that is a step in the right direction."
"Mr President, for many years the issue of mental health has been an embarrassing topic and is still overshadowed by other diseases affecting our society."
"However, the scale of the phenomenon today means we cannot ignore the dangers associated with mental disorders."
"We cannot discuss health in the European Union without taking these dangers into account."
"The statistics reflect the cruel truth."
"On average, 58 000 people commit suicide each year."
"This figure is higher than the number of those who die in car accidents, are murdered or die of AIDS."
"Depression is currently the most serious problem affecting our society."
"It is a problem that affects a growing number of people, particularly the young and, to an increasing extent, ethnic minorities."
"Economic analysts estimate that poor mental health costs the citizens of the European Union around three to four per cent of GDP, mainly as a result of falling productivity and early retirement."
"That is why it is vital to draw up and adopt, as a matter of urgency, a directive on mental health and the protection of the civil and fundamental rights of people suffering from mental health problems."
"Implementing the principles of the directive will establish the practical framework for implementing the Community programme."
"Preventative healthcare which takes into account different age groups should play an important role in the mental health strategy, according to the motto ‘prevention is better than cure’."
"The pilot programme of the European Association against Depression has already achieved a 25% decrease in the number of suicides and suicide attempts by young people."
"That is why we need to think about the matter seriously and to take appropriate action to prevent dependence on modern technologies."
"Today, we revel in the fact that we have access to all kinds of technology, that everything is possible, that we have thousands of gadgets at our disposal."
"But at what price?"
"The price is that young people in particular are addicted to their screens and refuse to accept any reasons for turning away from them."
"This is the challenge of our age and we have to meet this challenge."
"Adopting a single, coordinated European Union policy in the field of mental health will allow us to create the appropriate conditions for the harmonious development of public mental health."
"It will help people to learn to cope with difficult situations, conflict or stressful conditions and to form better interpersonal relations."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, this afternoon we discussed a smoke-free Europe."
"Action by the Commission and the whole of Europe on mental health is even more vital, however."
"In this connection, I am obliged to the Commissioner for attending to this issue, and also to our rapporteur, Mr Bowis, for dealing with the issue and delivering an excellent report."
"One of the main problems regarding mental health is that it is taboo in all societies, and we should ask ourselves why this is the case."
"Many reasons can be identified, but I shall select just a few of them."
"Firstly, no doubt we all have a fear of ending up in a similar situation ourselves one day – particularly when we think of the old age lying before us."
"Secondly, mind and soul lie at the heart of our humanity; they are something that defines the essence of humanity."
"Thirdly, there is no recourse to our beloved mechanistic interpretation of our environment in this field, as this does not function here."
"This is a phenomenon that causes great suffering not only for the individual, but also for society as a whole."
"I have picked out a couple of figures, which make very alarming reading."
"According to a study by Deutsche Angestellten-Krankenkasse, a German social security institution, there was a 70% increase in the number of psychological conditions in the workplace between 1997 and 2004."
"Against the trend of falling figures for sick leave over the same period, the number of cases of absence owing to mental ill health shot up by more than two-thirds."
"Psychological stress now accounts for 10% of all days of absence in the European economy."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) states that, whereas in 1990 the three leading causes of global disease burden were pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases and perinatal conditions, by 2020 the leading causes will be ischaemic heart disease, depression, anxiety disorders and traffic accidents."
"If we look at the loss of productivity, we can see that this amounts to billions of euros."
"Studies carried out for the EU-15 – the old Member States – have put losses at EUR 265 billion, or approximately 3–4% of Community gross domestic product."
"Europe as a whole is therefore perfectly entitled to ask itself what we can do about this together."
"Of course, we must bear in mind that Member States are very suspicious of Europe’s powers and responsibilities."
"Nevertheless, I believe that the added value of European action is extremely important."
"Mr Bowis detailed that very well in his report."
"Let us not forget the best practice model, or the more extensive figures, or the enhanced research and development."
"Our thinking should be oriented mainly towards target groups, to enable us to arrive at a solution and thus prevent the European engine grinding to a halt and the plug being pulled."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I have nothing but gratitude for the Commissioner for the Green Paper, and even more so for Mr Bowis for the important work he has done."
"It has indeed turned out to be a very balanced report."
"After all, not for nothing was it almost unanimously supported in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and we are therefore hopeful that this report will be carried by an overwhelming majority in this House tomorrow, and will bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Commission so that it can take the necessary initiatives in line with its competences, because, clearly, much can be improved in the area of metal health care in the European Union."
"Patients still have no say."
"Cooperation between the different care institutions is still lacking, and the sector is facing a serious lack of funding."
"The added value of policy at EU level which we need to pursue is mainly in the area of promoting exchange and cooperation between Member States."
"We must, above all, be able to improve the connection between the various and different measures at Member State level, both nationally and regionally."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s Green Paper has not only cranked up a debate here in Parliament, national and regional governments have also been encouraged to make more funds available."
"When in my country, in Flanders, the national health survey showed that as many as one in five Flemings experience psychological problems and one in eight even serious problems, the Flemish Welfare Minister promptly decided to considerably reinforce the mental health centres, particularly those for the target groups that suffer the most, namely children and young people."
"Patient organisations followed suit."
"They asked representatives of ADHD Europe, for example, to home in on the living conditions of ADHD patients, since originally, the Green Paper did not even make a mention of this developmental illness in children, which, if left untreated, can do so much damage and cause so much distress, not only to the patient, but also in the form of costs to the health care system, the school system and the economic system."
"I am therefore delighted that our rapporteur was prepared to approve a few important additions in this respect."
"I would also thank the fellow Members for their support."
"I am now hopeful that the Commission, on the basis of the above, will be able to present a proposal for an EU mental health strategy by the end of this year."
"I wish the Commissioner every success in this."
"First of all I, too, would like to thank Mr Bowis for the opportunity to speak on this very important topic."
"Everyone is afraid of illness, and the most terrifying illnesses are undoubtedly those which threaten mental health."
"For a long time, medical science and society were equally helpless in the face of these problems, and reacted by sweeping the subject under the carpet or by isolating the victims."
"Fortunately, today we know that children who have learning difficulties are not bad kids, that those suffering from depression cannot be expected simply to pull themselves together, but that with adequate care even individuals with mental disabilities are capable of significant development."
"At the same time, we must face the fact that just as desk jobs are bad for the back, or the use of chemicals increases the incidence of allergies, so stress, the information overload and the lack of stable reference points in our society make it more difficult to preserve mental health."
"While most people today consciously strive to maintain the health of their bodies, the protection of our mental health receives considerably less attention."
"For this reason I welcome the fact that the Commission has taken the first steps towards a Community strategy for improving mental health."
"This is particularly important from the perspective of the new Member States, including Hungary, since the shock provoked by sudden economic and social transformations has given rise to problems that our outmoded institutional systems, serious underfunding and fossilised attitudes are unable adequately to address."
"To these must be added the problems traditionally characteristic of the region, such as the high suicide rate."
"In my country, Hungary, at the peak of the suicide wave twenty years ago more than 45 out of every 100 000 people died by their own hand, a statistic with which we shocked the world. According to the figures of the World Health Organisation, in 2000 the worldwide suicide rate was 16 out of 100 000, which represented a rising trend over the last half-century."
"There were years, not that long ago, when there were fewer fatalities in Europe caused by road traffic accidents than by suicide, as some of my colleagues have already mentioned."
"But we should not think that this is true only of Europe."
"In the United States as well, suicide is often ahead of homicide among the causes of death – in 1997, for instance, there were one and a half times as many suicides registered as murders."
"The long period of neglect of our region has meant that in our country, consulting a psychologist is still considered something to be kept secret, and it is not unusual for children from disadvantaged backgrounds to be considered mentally disabled."
"Many families are left to their own devices, without effective outside help, when one of their members faces serious problems."
"This situation must be changed, and it is for this reason that I am in support of all those amendments which explicitly state that specific attention needs to be paid to the mental health-related problems in the new Member States."
"Mr President, first of all I should thank my colleague, Mr Bowis, for the work he has done."
"Furthermore, I am not just referring to this report, but to all his input and the vigour with which he has spoken on behalf of mental health work in Europe."
"I have been a Member of Parliament for seven years, and in all this time John Bowis has consistently kept this subject on the agenda."
"For me he is a heartening example of a politician who realises his vision of a better world with determination and steadfastness."
"It is only in this way that things change: when one does not yield to arbitrary political whims and trends but knows oneself what one is striving for and does it."
"Mental health problems are something which it is easy to keep quiet about."
"There is a strong stigma attached to such types of disorder, and there may even be discrimination, which in the worst case scenario might prevent someone from seeking care."
"Proper information, openness and the sort of mental health campaigns proposed in the report will help to dispel this pointless stigma."
"The path to maturity is stonier than ever."
"Growth seems hampered by society’s increased uncertainty."
"It is good that the report should demonstrate awareness of the need for early intervention and the importance of prevention."
"To prevent mental health problems in children and young people in particular, we need to invest more time and money in preventive measures in day-care centres, schools, children’s clinics and school healthcare."
"A young person in need of help might be inclined to let things continue as they are simply because he or she does not know where to turn to for help."
"The role of the child’s background, and above all the family, is therefore of major importance."
"With the right resources, school healthcare units and children’s clinics are in an excellent position to identify problems in children and young people and provide help at an early stage."
"While, for example, in my country mental health problems have become more common in young people, statistics show that the parents of one in five children work untypical hours."
"Schoolchildren suffering from anxiety can be given significant help at school in the shape of group-based support, but it is absolutely essential to provide families with support on weekdays."
"Support for a child from parents and the family creates a basis for good mental health."
"Treating the problems of the young with drugs should be the last resort."
"The main focus should be on identifying and eliminating the social and environmental factors that are causing the harm."
"The problems will not go away by keeping silent about them."
"Depression has been called the new European disease."
"Very few people under the age of 30 took antidepressants 20 years ago, but now they take them as much as the older generations do."
"If there is no intervention in young people’s mental health problems immediately, and if no attention is paid to easing the situation regarding access to help, the price paid will be just too high."
"The fine words and good intentions in the Commission’s Green Paper must be turned into effective legislation as soon as possible, and we in Parliament expect to receive a proposal for a directive to debate on soon."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to join the chorus of good wishes to Mr Bowis, who has proved once more that, for him, health policy is a passion rather than a duty."
"Successful policy and successful psychotherapy have one thing in common: both require a great deal of openness, honesty, patience and commitment."
"We are discussing here an issue that is interesting and widespread yet largely neglected in the European Community: mental health."
"The WHO defines health as a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing."
"It is also realistic to achieve these three objectives in this order."
"When dealing with mental health, we note a dramatic increase in psychological illnesses in the Union."
"There is a wide palette of symptoms, causes, diagnoses and therapies in terms of both pathogenicity and molecular biology: depression, schizophrenia, borderline psychosis, bulimia, anorexia, phobias, neuroses and mania, to name but a few."
"I do not wish to go into detail on toxicological and environmental causes here – that would be a whole dossier in itself."
"I would like to show some possible ways in which we, the European Union, could help in the field of prevention, ways in which we could reduce the burden of suffering of those with mental ill health, could recognise the early stages of the illness in time and could thus prevent the onset."
"I should like to give just a few statistics. One in four will fall ill; there are 58 000 suicides and ten times as many attempted suicides each year."
"We see suicide as something difficult, demonic, impossible to grasp, and feel obliged to prevent it."
"Suffering from a psychological disorder means being stigmatised, whilst psychological illness often involves feelings of inferiority, and the history of Europe has often seen psychiatric institutions misused for political purposes."
"We have the opportunity to call on our national governments to do more than before."
"This call does not mean we are interfering in subsidiarity, but that we want to suggest action points and demonstrate a pan-European approach for enhancing human dignity and reducing discrimination, for example healthy families within which children can grow up and equal opportunities throughout the Union, both within Europe and within the Member States."
"Our strategy must comprise comprehensive treatment close to patients’ home areas."
"The treatment must be holistic: that is, must involve both body, mind and social environment."
"Compulsory treatment can be considered only as a last resort, and abuse of alcohol and both legal and illegal drugs is to be validated and included in this global approach."
"The focus here is on prevention."
"Today, with this report, we are opening a new chapter, and it is to be hoped that it will soon be enlarged upon in a White Paper."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, allow me too to congratulate the rapporteur, John Bowis, because with his systematic work and the results of it, as contained in this report, he has highlighted the importance of mental health and the policies which we must apply."
"Clearly the public health strategy must also include mental health, both for reasons of personal wellbeing and for reasons of social cohesion and social peace and progress."
"'A healthy mind in a healthy body' was what the ancient Greeks said in order to demonstrate that both mental and physical health are an integral component of human health."
"This saying is just as topical and important in modern times."
"Numerous Members have already referred to various forms of modern mental illnesses."
"Within this framework, I should like to emphasise that particular account must be taken of the gender dimension, both in research and in preventing and addressing psychoses."
"Research has even shown that various particular biological conditions and, more importantly, social circumstances affect women."
"The gender dimension must be also taken into account in the education of and information for nursing staff."
"Generally speaking, society and the families of people suffering from mental illnesses suffer because, in many cases, women with psychological problems are dealt with as people who are over-sensitive and not as sufferers needing special care and attention."
"In other words, we must also protect sufferers and their environment, because that will also make the environment more suitable and more trustworthy in the role that it is called on to play in addressing the problems of the people within it."
"To close, allow me to mention war victims."
"The serious psychological problems they face must qualify for both our development and our humanitarian aid and, in general terms, aid to reconstruct areas, because the reconstruction of areas requires above all reconstruction of the human psyche."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank all the honourable Members for the very interesting and useful debate."
"I shall be brief."
"The best conclusion one could draw from the debate today is that here, as well as in the rest of the consultation process, there is broad support for the establishment of a new strategy on mental health."
"This is a very positive signal for the Commission going forward, because throughout the general consultation process, the parliamentary process and the process of consulting the Member States, similar levels of support have been expressed for these efforts."
"The truth is that there is added value for an initiative and strategy at European level and that is why we intend to come forward with a strategy very soon."
"Amongst other things, it is very important that we promote cooperation on mental health between Member States, between stakeholders and between different sectors."
"Involving all relevant sectors in the effort to provide better public health is an important aspect of the new strategy."
"As I said at the beginning, we intend to place mental health at the core of our health strategy and the public health initiatives."
"Schools and workplaces have a greater influence on mental well-being than the actual health sector."
"Teaching parenting skills is also important."
"Older people must have opportunities to participate actively in social life."
"Many very interesting issues have been raised and we will take them into account when we draft the strategy."
"We will look into prevention and, as you know from previous debates, it is my basic important commitment and the basis of my strategy for this term to promote prevention and not just treatment."
"Gender aspects will be taken into account."
"When we had a similar debate here on the gender aspects of health, I said that our policies from then on would take into account the gender aspects in all our health initiatives and in the various areas of research, promotion, prevention, care, treatment and rehabilitation."
"They will all take gender into account."
"It be reflected in the strategy document that the Commission will prepare."
"As I said, we will be looking into prevention and some of the causes, not all of which are avoidable, of course – such as ageing, for example."
"Ageing is a reality and a fact."
"We have an ageing population."
"The point is to make ageing healthy."
"We are living longer and we need to be healthy in our old age, and mental health is a very important aspect of that."
"I should like to finish by saying, in the light of all the numbers and statistics that have been mentioned here, that this is just the tip of the iceberg."
"It is not only those who suffer from mental health who are affected: there are also the families, friends, employers, employees and colleagues."
"The truth is that the whole of society suffers as a result of mental health problems."
"That is why perhaps the best achievement of this whole process, including the strategy, would be to make mental health a priority, not only for the European Union – I believe we in the Commission and in the European Parliament have already done that – but also for each Member State separately and the Community as a whole."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Mr President, I would like to thank John Bowis for his very comprehensive and detailed report on improving the mental health of our citizens, that is, the European Union’s mental health strategy."
"Mental health problems know no national boundaries, which is why we can speak of a mental health strategy for the whole Union."
"In any case, establishing a common strategy, creating a framework for cooperation between different institutions and monitoring its implementation could facilitate the introduction and provision of services for people with intellectual disabilities and those affected by mental disorders at the national level,"
"Throughout the ages, many measures of humanity have been developed."
"One of these is our attitude to people affected by mental disorders."
"In my view the demands for de-stigmatising the problem, eliminating prejudice, and changing attitutdes and stereotypes relating to psychological disorders are very important."
"Meanwhile, whenever a politician in Poland wants to insult another politician, he says, or implies, that the other is mentally ill or psychologically disturbed."
"Unfortunately, even some Members of the European Parliament indulge in this kind of behaviour."
"However, we should all remember that people who suffer from mental disorders deserve to be cared for and treated in a dignified and humane manner."
"In countries with a high unemployment rate, this problem particularly affects disabled people."
"That is why I strongly support initiatives to ensure non-discrimination in the treatment of those affected by mental illness and the social integration of people with mental disorders."
"These actions are particularly important because good working conditions have a positive influence on mental health."
"Europe is facing major threats to public health: cancer, heart and vascular diseases, diabetes, asthma ..."
"Mental illness also belongs to this list, though."
"After all, why do people suffering from a mental illness get treated differently from people with a heart disease, AIDS or cancer?"
"At a time when patients are increasingly seen as consumers, are better informed and are more involved in decision-making, the attitude towards mental health should change to match this trend."
"At the moment, the EU shares the responsibility for public health and health care with the Member States."
"The Member States are responsible for national health services and systems."
"The EU only has a secondary role in this."
"I would argue in favour of the EU being given a bigger role in public health matters, precisely because these are so important to the public."
"In order to promote and support cooperation between the Member States in the area of mental health, and to remove inequalities between Member States, it is a good thing for the Union to be taking action in this area by, for example, joining forces, promoting coherence and creating a platform."
"In that way, the EU can mean something to the citizen and change the negative image of bureaucracy and unnecessary red-tape which many citizens have."
"– The next item is the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission, on European contract law (O-0074/2006 – B6-0326/2006)."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today is one of the most important – I believe most important – pre-legislative proposals on the EU agenda for this parliamentary term."
"It is all the more regrettable, then, that this issue, too, is being discussed just before midnight once again, whilst other supposedly ‘important’ issues receive prime-time slots in this House."
"Incidentally, this is further proof of the urgent need for parliamentary reform."
"Nevertheless, I should like to turn to the oral questions."
"I can count a total of six resolutions to date that Parliament has issued since the early 1990s, repeatedly and emphatically supporting the project to create a common frame of reference. Parliament has done this for the simple reason that, together with legal practitioners – EU lawyers and judges – we are of the opinion that further steps towards common principles of civil law are needed in order to render many European legislative provisions such as the -Commerce Directive feasible."
"In legal disputes, particularly those between consumers and traders concerning small amounts, it is practically impossible for lawyers and judges to apply 25 – or 26 if we include Scotland – different legal systems in the EU in parallel, especially given the strange juxtaposition of the country of origin and country of destination principles, as is the case with the -Commerce Directive, for example."
"That is why we need a higher common standard – I am quite happy to use a harmonised one."
"There is actually no disagreement about this – there is a broad consensus about it in this House."
"This is also the opinion of leading legal practitioners, and is one of the reasons the CCBE – Council of the Bars and Law Societies of the European Community – is planning to hold a conference in Rome this autumn, which offers its belated support to the project."
"It is therefore vital to us that we obtain not only the bare bones of a frame of reference, applying exclusively to issues of consumer contract law, but a framework including, in principle, all aspects of civil law."
"That is a crucial point as regards later decisions on all the options for what becomes of this frame of reference."
"This will, of course, depend primarily on the quality of this frame of reference."
"We should like all options to be kept open until the Commission presents the final consultation document, however, and to be able to take a decision on it afterwards, along with others."
"It is also important that we depart from the sectoral approach to civil legislation and seek a holistic approach."
"After all, the many inconsistencies currently existing in EU civil law can be attributed to the failure to follow this holistic approach, to see things as a whole; instead always considering only individual problems."
"Another prerequisite for a frame of reference is that, in principle, the network continues to function and is still operated, as the Commission has done up to now."
"As rapporteur on this issue for the Committee on Legal Affairs, I can say that all the political groups agree in principle on this subject, and that an overwhelming majority of this House is in favour – something I have seldom experienced elsewhere."
"Mrs Wallis of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, who cannot be here this evening, has explicitly asked me to reaffirm this on her behalf, too."
"As we know, the three Commissioners dealing with this issue – Commissioners Kyprianou, Frattini and McCreevy – are currently considering, or have recently been considering, how the work should be taken forward."
"The reason we have deliberately put this oral question – together with the corresponding resolution, which you may have been able to read already in draft form, and which will undoubtedly be adopted by a large majority in this House on Thursday – on today’s agenda is to emphasise clearly once more the strength of Parliament’s support for this project."
"We want this House’s resolutions to serve as a guideline for the Commission, too, in further developing and dealing with this issue."
"There has always been very close cooperation and mutual support between the Commission and Parliament on this issue up to now."
"We ask that it stays that way – in the interest of the development of the EU and in the interest of legislation in the EU, which must also be manageable and practicable for the man in the street."
"That is why this project must continue."
"We ask the Commission to maintain the strength of its support, and also to take the opportunity of its answer to this question to make that clear publicly here in plenary."
"."
"The Commission has said from the beginning that it welcomes the interest Parliament is taking in the common frame of reference– the CFR – and the support which has been expressed for this project."
"The Commission is currently considering the possibility of including contract law issues other than consumer issues in the CFR on contract law."
"I should like to explain that even though we are now proceeding with the consumer aspect, that does not mean that we have reached any final conclusion on whether to include any other aspects of contract law."
"I am working very closely with my colleagues Mr Frattini and Mr McCreevy on this issue."
"These other contract law issues could be related to the other EU contract law or general contract law topics which are directly relevant to the EU ."
"The truth is that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on this matter, but it will take a final decision soon."
"We have taken due note of the European Parliament’s opinion on this issue, especially that expressed in the recent resolution."
"I have also had an opportunity to discuss the issue in the various committees."
"The Commission also intends to seek the Council’s position on the remainder of the work on the CFR."
"The Commission intends to use the CFR as a ‘better lawmaking’ tool for achieving clarity when legislating."
"Exactly what legal form to choose in order to best achieve that aim is a key issue, which will need careful consideration."
"It will be easier to make a decision once there is more certainty over the content of the CFR."
"Then we can examine how best to ensure that the CFR is used as effectively as possible."
"We have to realise that CFR is work in progress and will take some years to complete."
"While the Commission can take into account the CFR work when drawing up new legislative proposals relating to contract law issues, it would not be useful or necessary to delay future contract law related legislation until all discussions on the CFR have been finalised."
"Meanwhile, the Commission has already indicated that it plans to use relevant CFR results in the review of the consumer contract law ."
"As clearly indicated in its communication of October 2004, the CFR as such is not primarily meant to be a legislative instrument applicable directly to legal transactions, but a toolbox to facilitate better lawmaking for legislators."
"The Commission fully understands that Parliament wants to be kept informed of and involved in the ongoing work on the CFR and would therefore welcome Parliament’s involvement in the CFR process, in particular the creation of the Parliament working group."
"The Commission will continue to keep Parliament informed of developments in the most appropriate way, in particular through the Parliament working group."
"I would like to conclude by thanking you for Parliament’s encouragement and support for our work on this important issue."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, European contract law is certainly such as to favour regulation of the internal market."
"A legal construction of this kind must, however, be prepared through a transparent and democratic process."
"The advantages that economic agents are expected to gain in terms of legal certainty and a reduction in the cost of transactions very much depends on the clarity, predictability and stability of the rules."
"European contract law must be based on the demands of the economic world and on an assessment of its needs."
"It must do away with those instances in the where there is a lack of coherence when it comes, for example, to consumer rights regarding retraction periods or information provided to the consumer."
"The draft texts being prepared are, it seems, ambiguous and too detailed and do not really fall in with these objectives."
"Rather than embark on the utopian road of preparing, at present, a European civil code – a legal 26th regime - would it not be more realistic to prepare model contracts or sector-specific rules?"
"That being the case, the responses to the issues raised by this oral question must permit greater familiarity with the content of the common reference code."
"Selection of the legal base for an instrument dedicated to contract law must proceed from a political choice regarding the objectives concerned, rather than precede such a choice."
"It is therefore vital that the Commission clarify the objectives of the work funded since 2003 by the European budget and place the European Parliament in a position to give an opinion on practical proposals."
"It would be unthinkable to give companies the ability to apply European contract law, as devised by a working party, in place of directives and national rights without Parliament and the Council having approved its content on the basis of a very thorough legal and economic impact assessment."
"Mr President, I am very pleased that the oral question has given us the opportunity today to find out about the provisional state of affairs, at least."
"I had been hoping that, despite the late hour, our debate would be rewarded with some more specific information from the Commission on its current thinking."
"It would appear the time is not yet ripe for this, but I hope it will be in the near future."
"I think that both Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and also many others – I myself took part in a conference organised by the Austrian Presidency and the Commission, and was able to see the depth of the interest of practitioners, the academic community, the business community and consumer organisations in this – have very high and very conflicting expectations, and rely on the Commission’s providing us with rather more clarity as to what happens now."
"As Mr Lehne has already mentioned, there is a very broad consensus here on the fundamental issues, particularly on the development of Community acquis in the field of consumer protection having now begun, and on attempts being made at some degree of harmonisation."
"I myself have been rapporteur many a time on issues of consumer protection and I know the kind of inconsistencies that have naturally developed in this field over time."
"I should like to say in this regard, however, that leaving too much of the work to the experts instead of to politicians means that things are sometimes called inconsistencies that are not inconsistencies, but instead are often what we would call political progress attributable to changes in views and to which camp is in the majority, including in this House."
"There is no doubt – and this was also one of the main results of the Vienna Conference – that the business-to-business sector also needs to be tackled; it goes without saying that this cannot be overlooked."
"I would say, however, that there are of course very grave doubts concerning everything beyond this very narrow field of contract law – there is talk of a European in this connection – and these doubts must be examined rather than dodged."
"The first is undoubtedly the matter of powers and responsibilities, and another is certainly the question of public acceptance, the fact that, particularly in civil law, we have legal systems that are steeped in tradition, and we have case law developed over many years that a 26th – or in future we shall have to say 28th – system would lack."
"I ask myself what form civil law could take without a body of evolved case law to build on in this field, and how we could create precise regulations that were acceptable to all."
"I am afraid that we would end up with very general statements that would not be very helpful to us."
"I hope that we are able to reach agreement on the resolution."
"It is paragraph 6, in particular, with which we take issue, and I hope that we are able to find a wording for this specific point, too, that clearly reveals the broad general consensus that exists on this issue in other respects."
"Mr President, I agree that point six is very important, partly because there are six Members here at the moment."
"It is the first time that I have taken part in a debate that could be said to resemble the film ‘The Magnificent Seven’, the seventh hero being the President of the European Parliament."
"It seems to be a happy coincidence."
"I agree with the previous speakers that holding this debate so late, just before midnight, is not a good idea."
"I remember Polish parliamentary debates that ended at three o’clock in the morning and I never imagined this to be possible in Strasbourg."
"However, it would appear that I lacked imagination."
"The point of this legislation is to enable ordinary Polish, Czech, French, Danish and other citizens of the European Union to make use of this right. It is also a matter of agreeing on and standardising consumer rights and other legislation making up the It is a very important matter and, once again, I would like to express my regret that we are discussing it so late."
"."
"Mr President, the fact that this is a late night debate does not mean that we do not place great importance on this issue."
"The lateness of the hour is of no relevance here."
"We take note of, and indeed, we take into serious consideration Parliament’s position on this issue."
"I regret that we still cannot give a more definite position as to how we will proceed or be more specific, but we are now in the process of clarifying and determining what is to be done next and the Commission’s position on this."
"As I said earlier, we have Parliament’s position."
"My two colleagues and I will hold a debate on a joint paper within the Commission over the next few weeks and then we will consult with the Council."
"So, to take an optimistic view, I expect we will have a clearer picture by the end of this year."
"We will not be wasting any time, because we will know how to proceed by the time we finish the first part, which is the consumer , so there will be no gap there."
"Once again, I can assure you that we will keep you informed of developments and discuss our future approach with you, once we have formulated it."
"– I have received a motion for a resolution(1) pursuant to Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the oral question by Joost Lagendijk and Gisela Kallenbach, on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group, Hannes Swoboda and Jan Marinus Wiersma, on behalf of the PSE Group, Doris Pack, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and Elizabeth Lynne, Sarah Ludford and Jelko Kacin, on behalf of the ALDE Group, to the Council, on the EU's preparedness for its future role in Kosovo (O-0082/2006 – B6-0426/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, may I put a point of order?"
"Is it not the Council’s, the Minister’s, intention to respond first to the question that has been raised?"
"The question that has already been put to the Council is clear."
"Members will be given the opportunity to react to the Council’s response in due course."
"– I must point out that the services have confirmed that in all cases, before the Council replies, the authors of the question shall present the substance of their query in order to move the question itself."
"."
"Mr President, most of these questions have been raised following a visit by a Parliamentary delegation in June."
"During that visit, we got the impression that whilst the European Union is present and is getting geared up for the task which, as we all know, will be vital to Kosovo's future, the energy that is being invested in it and the attention given to it leave a great deal to be desired in a number of areas."
"This covers a number of issues."
"First of all, whilst the European Union is clearly making thorough preparations in the areas of security and justice, with a view to taking over the tasks of the UN, UNMIC, we are of the opinion that it is not in the areas of security and justice, however important that they may be, that the EU will be playing an important role."
"What is equally important, for example, is coordinating all the efforts of the international community, continuing to help in the construction of a civil administration and, crucially, monitoring compliance with human rights."
"Those are crucial tasks which soon, when the UN has left, and preparations for their departure are in full swing, will be the responsibility of the EU."
"Our question to the Council and the European Union is the following: Are people really prepared, and able, to make thorough preparations – that is to say, in all those areas, and not just in the first two of them?"
"This preparation should, in our view, be made with the full consent and in good cooperation with the Commission."
"I wonder, more out of interest than out of criticism, whether the Member States and Commission are able to get a fully-equipped Commission delegation up and running in time."
"Finally, it is, in our view, crucial in terms of the symbolism involved that the EU should do everything in its power to keep its administration separate from that of the UN, UNMIC."
"We cannot afford the EU coming across as a sort of EU-MIC, which is how it is sometimes perceived over there."
"The symbols, the buildings, the manner of presentation must demonstrate that a new start has been made with the EU, in a Kosovo that is different from what it was when the UN were there after 1999."
"Those are the questions we would like answered by the Commission and, above all, by the Council."
"– Mr President, Commission President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to underline what my fellow Members, Mr Swoboda and Mr Lagendijk, have said."
"They have actually covered all the issues already but I would like to go into certain points in further detail."
"There are four different representations in Kosovo."
"Firstly, the European Agency for Reconstruction which has done sterling work."
"We have the so-called fourth pillar within the UN framework where we are essentially responsible for economic matters as well as privatisation."
"The European Parliament has a delegation there and finally, we also have Council representation."
"All this in the small region that is Kosovo."
"The question must already be asked how all this is organised, how all these bodies are able to communicate with one another at all."
"We now have this EU planning team, something we were able to establish when we were over there, which is responsible for ensuring the rule of law, but I find this all very restrictive."
"The tasks facing us are much more extensive."
"It will not do justice to the scale and importance of what we have planned for next year if we approach all of this in such a restricted manner."
"We must endeavour to create capacities."
"We must help build up the civil administration."
"We must ensure that human rights and the rights of minorities are observed."
"How do we manage this when there are so many players of our calibre, including the OSCE, the European Ombudsman and others?"
"The UN, which is also represented there in all of our names, has certainly done a lot of good through UNMIK over recent years, although it has also made a lot of mistakes."
"It is probable that no other course of action was possible in rebuilding the civil and local administrations."
"Would we do any better?"
"Do we have any men and women at all who want, and are able, to commit to working there, who are able to establish trust, who bring with them an adequate level of commitment to actually accomplish what we need on site?"
"To what extent can we, as the European Union, influence the police forces in Kosovo?"
"We know that it is their intention to create a military organisation."
"To what extent are we maintaining more than just superficial contact with government bodies?"
"What role may European troops soon play in Kosovo?"
"I am aware that these are all questions to which we are awaiting a reply and which you are not yet in a position to answer, but I would like to say to you that I am personally afraid that we are not adequately prepared."
"When we shift our attention to the neighbouring state of Bosnia Herzegovina, we see the difficulties facing us there and the multitude of problems that we still have to deal with."
"We have a single representative there who was, and actually still is, all-powerful, and who could do anything which can actually only be achieved in a democracy using democratic legislation as a basis."
"The problem is that we now have a situation there which is not up to the new challenges because people were not accustomed to taking responsibility themselves."
"What we need in Kosovo is assistance to allow the Kosovars to help themselves."
"By ‘Kosovars’, I do not just mean Albanians, but also Serbs who live there and who we should actually expect to engage in the institutions."
"The only thing lacking as far as I am concerned is pressure on the Serbian Government in Belgrade to allow Serbs in Kosovo to participate."
"This is the real problem."
"If we listen to Mr Oliver Ivanovic in Serbia, we know what he would like to do were he allowed to."
"I believe that all that is lacking is pressure on the Serbian Government to give Serbs there the opportunity to build towards their future."
"This must certainly happen at some point or other because Serbia is no longer responsible for them."
"I am underlining what my fellow Member, Mr Swoboda, said."
"With its neighbours, this region will become part of the European Union."
"We must therefore see to it that it is in a position to resolve these tasks, that it heeds human rights and the rights of minorities, that, with our help, it develops all the administrative capabilities required to also adopt and transpose our legislation, and to then find a seamless path into the European Union in conjunction with its neighbours, Serbia and Montenegro."
"I very much hope that we are able to offer this assistance."
"I venture, however, to express a degree of doubt on this issue."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Lagendijk, our rapporteur, for raising this very timely question."
"It is true that we came away from Pristina in June pretty concerned about the EU’s capacity to take on its future enhanced role in Kosovo and to see it through, because if we look at another territory where the international community took on state-building and reconstruction responsibilities – i.e. Afghanistan – we see incipient failure."
"We need to learn from this experience that the commitment needs to be full, well-planned and consistent and not half-hearted and under-funded."
"Even more so in the future, Kosovo will be an expensive commitment for the EU, but the alternative of chaos, ethnic conflict and crime is even more expensive."
"We must treat Kosovo as the future EU member that it is."
"The second lesson – and we hardly need to learn it from Afghanistan or Iraq, because it is so obvious – is: ‘it’s the economy, stupid!’"
"The most important challenge in Kosovo is the massive unemployment."
"Obviously, status, constitutional issues and administrative capacity have to be sorted out and the security and policing challenges are acute."
"However, social and economic development is the vital key to peace and coexistence."
"In this context, education, agricultural development, visa facilitation or, ideally, liberalisation, must be at the top of the agenda."
"It is important to show Serbs and other minorities, as well as Kosovar Albanians, that they will be better off in the future."
"In that connection, I should like to mention an idea."
"It is not an original idea, but one borrowed from others, who have suggested creating an international university in Mitrovica along the lines of the South-East European University in Tetovo."
"This is an excellent idea and I hope that we can find some rich donor who might be able to take it forward in what are likely to be the two municipalities of the town."
"That could instigate economic development in the north of Kosovo."
"My final point, very briefly, is that there have been concerns in the context of extraordinary rendition."
"The former Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Gil-Robles, said that some time in around 2002 or 2003 he saw detainees – prisoners – in Guantánamo-type orange jumpsuits, apparently detained by KFOR, but was not able to pursue the matter."
"Indeed, the Council of Europe Committee on Torture has not been allowed access to prisoners in Kosovo."
"This is unacceptable when a territory is under the stewardship of an international community that purports to uphold human rights."
"I hope that in future the EU will ensure that there is no doubt about Kosovo’s compliance with international humanitarian and human rights law."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is well aware that the status process for Kosovo is a major challenge for the international community."
"A positive, lasting solution is in the European Union’s own interests."
"The status process for Kosovo is led by UN Special Envoy Martti Ahtisaari."
"The EU is fully involved in the work via its special representative."
"Likewise, the Union, and the Finnish Presidency in particular, are in regular direct contact with Special Envoy Ahtisaari, who recently gave an account of the situation at the meeting of the EU’s General Affairs and External Relations Council on 17 July."
"The UN Special Envoy is still trying to persuade both Belgrade and Pristina to take an active part in negotiations on key themes, such as decentralisation of government, religious and cultural heritage, economic issues and the rights of minorities."
"Direct discussions and consultations with experts are continuing."
"The parties continue to hold different views, but the process has been useful inasmuch as it has clarified positions and has helped to explore common ground for a future solution."
"The European Union fully supports these objectives."
"It has a leading role in matters relating to economic aspects of the process via its representative and the Commission."
"The EU is pleased with the decision by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to move on to political discussions on Kosovo’s status and urge both parties to take part in a new round of talks in a constructive way."
"The European Union fully supports the combined efforts of the UN Secretary-General’s special representative for Kosovo and Kosovo’s temporary self-governing bodies to implement standards."
"There is also a need to prepare for a progressive move from the reform process according to these standards to one that is consistent with European integration."
"Following status determination, the Union’s involvement in Kosovo will cover three areas."
"These are the Union’s participation in any future civil presence, any possible civil crisis management operation concerning the rule of law, especially with regard to the police and the judicial system, and an EU presence with the purpose of lending support to Kosovo’s European perspective."
"Preparations are under way in all three areas."
"An EU Planning Team has been established by an EU Joint Action and has already been sent to Kosovo to prepare for a possible civil crisis management operation relating to the aspect of the rule of law which I have referred to."
"The Union’s future role in Kosovo is being planned in conjunction with the European Commission."
"In this way we will use all the means at our disposal to try and ensure that there is consistency in the way the European Union acts."
"A future international presence in Kosovo will not take the form of a European Union Mission in Kosovo (EUMIK)."
"After a solution has been found and when the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) has been gradually disbanded, Kosovo’s own institutions should themselves be responsible for dealing with their affairs."
"Kosovo itself should assume local ownership and take responsibility."
"International action should help Kosovo’s own institutions to take full responsibility for Kosovo’s affairs."
"The European Union is very centrally involved in the implementation of a solution to Kosovo’s status."
"It will be part of a future international presence and involved in any civil crisis management operation, and it will support efforts to strengthen stability and socio-economic development in Kosovo."
"The EU’s future role there will also of course require a considerable amount of financing."
"The Union is presently looking into ways of guaranteeing its involvement, as appropriate."
"It is the common objective of the EU and Kosovo to ensure that Kosovo becomes a dependable partner, developing closer relations with the European Union together with our other neighbouring regions."
"A key factor here will be the establishment of a democratic, multinational Kosovo, with a good basis for economic development and greater integration."
"."
"Mr President, Kosovo is indeed a part of Europe."
"It is not our back yard, but our front yard, and in the long term, a future EU territory."
"The European Union has a major responsibility for the future of Kosovo."
"In our joint paper on the EU’s future role in Kosovo, presented in July this year, Javier Solana and I made it clear that the EU will have to take the lead in international presence after the status process has been concluded."
"Our paper analysed the nature, size and responsibilities of a future international engagement; it also set out the EU’s role after the status settlement and practical means to realise Kosovo’s future European perspective."
"I fully agree with Minister Lehtomäki and those MEPs who said that UNMIK will not be replaced by any kind of EUMIK, but rather a leaner, more streamlined international presence or international civilian mission."
"The joint paper, which was endorsed by the Council, supports the work of President Martti Ahtisaari."
"Achieving a negotiated solution on the Kosovo status issue cannot be taken for granted."
"The United Nations Status Envoy needs our full support to put forward a comprehensive package that will allow the UN Security Council to decide on the way ahead."
"The key issue at stake is the protection of minorities, in particular of the Kosovo Serb minority."
"The success of the status process will depend to a considerable degree on the ability and willingness of the EU to respond rapidly and concretely in support of an overall solution."
"The EU needs to give a clear signal that it will stay in Kosovo to play a key role in the implementation of the status settlement and to support its long-term EU perspective through the stabilisation and association process."
"The powers of the future international presence in Kosovo should be limited to overseeing the implementation of the status settlement."
"All other powers currently exercised by UNMIK should, as a rule, be handed over to Kosovo’s authorities, so that they can govern with full responsibility and full accountability."
"After the status settlement, our objective is to ensure that Kosovo becomes a reliable partner, progressing towards the EU together with the rest of the region."
"The EU will need to continue supporting Kosovo’s Government in setting up a modern, open, market-oriented and business-friendly environment, based on EU-compatible structural reforms."
"Finally, as members of the budgetary authority, you know that stabilising Kosovo will come at a cost."
"I fully agree with Minister Lehtomäki that we will have to make appropriate provisions in the future to be able to cover this cost."
"The Commission is working with the World Bank and the local authorities to prepare a ‘Kosovo Development Plan and Strategy’ for the medium term."
"After the status settlement, we will organise a donors’ conference to mobilise the international community’s support for the people of Kosovo."
"Let us remember that it is better to cover the costs of economic and social development than to send more soldiers to the Balkans."
"Dear friends, in that respect, the keys are in your hands, and in those of the Council."
"As Mr Poettering and other eminent MEPs are present here this morning, I would like to make an important point: the cuts to the Commission’s staff budget proposed by the Council would make this task in Kosovo and the Western Balkans simply impossible."
"The Council’s plan would lead to the disappearance of 1700 posts at the Commission, starting with 170 posts in 2007."
"Please do not ask the EU and the Commission to do more in ensuring external and internal security – be it in Kosovo, Lebanon or the Canary Islands."
"If our hands are tied we cannot do as you ask."
"EU policy and aid does not come from heaven: it needs competent staff to carry it out."
"It also has a cost."
"I have a special plea for the Finnish Presidency."
"The current United Nations Status Envoy comes from Finland, and I have special responsibility on behalf of the Commission concerning the Western Balkans and Kosovo."
"I hope the Council and the Presidency do not make our task of working for peace and stability in the Western Balkans and Kosovo impossible."
"I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary dead-end."
"I also call on the Presidency to solve this dilemma soon, without unnecessary delay, using the famous Finnish common sense, and not stubbornness this time."
". – Mr President, over a twelve year period, through the use of terror, mass expulsions and attempted ethnocide, the Milošević regime has created a situation in Kosovo which today means that over 90% of the population can no longer imagine being associated with Serbia in some institutional form or other."
"This is the reality we must start out from, and this was also the reality when NATO intervened there."
"This means that we cannot shirk the fact that we are at the threshold of clarifying the status question and that this clarification will comprise Kosovo’s national independence."
"On the other hand, we are currently witnessing a policy in Belgrade which must be a cause for alarm."
"Serbian politicians know precisely where the status question stands in reality, only they dare not risk admitting this to their own people."
"In other words, they are attempting to make themselves out to be the victims."
"They want the international community to basically strip Kosovo bare so as to then be able to make this out to be an act against the Serbian people."
"If one reads the information service of the Serbian Church, it can be established that the relevant bishops there are quite openly writing about the fact that the Serbian Government does not wish to participate in any clarification of the status question, as this would ruin any chance of getting the country back at a favourable moment viewed from the point of view of world history."
"It is there in writing."
"This demonstrates the still explosive nature of the whole issue."
"On the other hand, it demonstrates the pressurised situation in which the minorities in Kosovo find themselves."
"All this serves to show that a massive presence on the part of the European Union and the international community will be required for a long time yet."
"Two elements are therefore required. On the one hand, speedy clarification of the status question."
"I certainly agree with Sarah Ludford that the most important element is combating unemployment as far as this fledgling people is concerned, but nobody is willing to invest in Kosovo before the question of status is clarified."
"We have therefore lost too much time on this issue already."
"I believe speedy clarification of the status question is a prerequisite for an economic upturn and for eliminating unemployment and, hence, the most serious danger posed by radicalism."
"On the other hand, however, we need this independence to be conditioned over the medium- and long-term, first and foremost, also as far as minority issues are concerned, and I believe that for our part, our presence must be anticipated for many years to come."
"Given that, unfortunately, and this must be said unequivocally, UNMIK has failed to carry out its duties in many areas, a great many expectations in Kosovo rest on a European administration."
"I agree with the Commissioner that we should give people there as much autonomy as possible."
"We talk far too little of, and with, the government and the elected parties there, who often disappear behind the international appointees."
"On the other hand, however, our presence will be required to safeguard democracy, the rule of law and peace in a strategically important part of Europe."
"."
"Mr President, first of all, I should like to express my agreement with what my fellow Members had to say during the first round of this debate."
"I too was a member of the delegation that visited Kosovo and Belgrade in Serbia."
"It is clear that that part of Serbia, which Kosovo formally still is, is heading for independence in some form or other."
"When you talk to the local people, particularly the Kosovar Albanians, it is impossible to draw any other conclusion, and I would add to express my agreement with what Mr Swoboda said on this subject: a form of independence, as they call it themselves, or limited sovereignty is inevitable, whether we like it or not."
"I think that the facts are plain for everyone to see, so we should get used to the idea, and the Security Council will probably issue a ruling to that effect at the end of the year."
"Everyone you talk to in Kosovo is convinced that the international community, NATO in the first instance, of course, will need to remain present for a good number of years."
"NATO is responsible for military security."
"It is also expected that the European Union will play an important role, and in that regard a number of key issues present themselves."
"First of all, as others have already mentioned, there is the protection and the rights of the Serbian minority in Kosovo."
"An important point in this connection, and I confirm in that respect what has already been said, is that we can expect cooperation and openness from both the Kosovar-Albanians and the Serbians who live in Kosovo, and Belgrade, too, of course has an important role to play. That is also obvious from talking to people."
"We must also ensure that we continue to bring pressure to bear on Serbia in that respect."
"I should like to add that if we assume that independence as I described it is probably inevitable for Kosovo, we will still need to take the sensitivities of the Serbs and Serbia into consideration in one way or another, and we will also need to see what we can offer Serbia during the course of the year."
"A more flexible way of awarding visas may play a role there as well, as a token from the European Union to demonstrate that we take that country’s future in Europe seriously."
"Needless to say, the international mission will also play an important role in the further economic development and in creating political stability in a possibly independent Kosovo."
"Economic development, as is also apparent when visiting the area, is, of course, an important priority."
"I think that all of this should be seen in the light of the European prospect that is actually, when one considers the statements, including those at the Thessaloniki summit a number of years ago, also being offered to Kosovo."
"Everyone knows that the EU will, in future, be playing a bigger role in Kosovo."
"Once its status has been established, everyone expects us to take over what the UN has been doing, but I agree with what everyone has said in this connection: our role will be different and some tasks will need to be redefined."
"After all, it is apparent from discussions with people in Kosovo that many are critical of the UN’s role."
"What they no longer want in any event is an international organisation dictating how they should run their own country."
"They finally want to be in charge of their region, their country, and we should be prepared for this."
"A great deal has been said about this, because the UN has made clear its intention of leaving next year."
"That is a weighty responsibility for the European Union."
"The European Union will need to play a role in the development of the police system, but will also need to supervise the development of the judiciary, and what is more, I think it is important to invest heavily in the administrative structures as well as in the economic development to which reference has already been made."
"The European Union may well want to take over NATO's military role in due course, as it did in Bosnia."
"I should like to address my last words to the Commissioner. What struck us and what we wondered about is whether the EU is sufficiently prepared and whether we have enough human resources over there who can shoulder this important and heavy responsibility next year."
"I should like to add to your appeal to the Finnish Presidency and express the hope that in its pursuit to deploy as many people in a positive way, it will demonstrate Finnish obstinacy."
". – Today everyone knows that the international community made a big mistake by continually postponing the settlement of the status of Kosovo."
"Time has not provided any solutions, but further complicated the situation instead."
"The status of Kosovo must be resolved as soon as possible, and within this year."
"If the talks do not produce results, then the international community must take responsibility for a decision."
"We can see clearly the contours of the solution."
"We know what we do not want and what we do want."
"We do not want – because we cannot want – a restoration of the pre-1999 situation."
"This would simply further escalate the crisis."
"We do not want Kosovo to be split up, because this could launch a dangerous chain reaction in the region."
"We do not want Kosovo eventually to join one of the neighbouring countries, because this would not serve the interests of stability either."
"Kosovo can gradually regain its independence, its full statehood, depending on the degree to which it becomes viable and is able to guarantee human rights, minority rights, and the basic principles of the rule of law."
"We must help Kosovo in achieving these, and in creating the necessary conditions."
"I agree with the Commissioner that the key question is the guarantee of minority rights, especially those of the Serb but also of the Roma minorities."
"This is of crucial importance for the entire region."
"One of the starting points for the Balkan crisis was the denial of and disregard for minority rights."
"We have to find a solution that can ensure broad-ranging autonomy for the Kosovo Serbs and the Roma as well, a solution that is guaranteed by the constitution, and for which the international community takes responsibility and offers guarantees."
"But Serbia, too, must understand that its concerns about the rights of the Kosovo Serb minority are justified, but that morally they can only be accepted if Serbia in turn guarantees the same rights to minorities living within Serbia, for instance Hungarians and Slovaks living in Voivodina, and Albanians living elsewhere in Serbia."
"In conclusion, the Commissioner has spoken of a very important matter: the role to be played by the international community, and more specifically by the European Union."
"It is impossible to imagine creating a viable Kosovo without the active cooperation of the European Union."
"We must help shape the organs of state government and help develop the economy."
"Unfortunately, the 2007 budget does not make any provision for this."
"Once again, words and deeds point in different directions."
"We talk about wanting to take action, but at the same time the budgetary basis for our actions is lacking."
"I ask Parliament to support in the current budget debates those proposals – some of which I myself have made – which serve the purpose of providing the necessary resources for bringing about a settlement for Kosovo."
"."
"Mr President, I get the impression that this was exactly the right time to put this parliamentary question in relation to what emerged from the delegation’s visit, for the fact is that there really is much more left to be done if we are actually to be prepared for the tasks we shall have to carry out."
"I am particularly disappointed by the proposals put to us today by the Council, which are not particularly practical."
"The litmus test for us has to do with how the European Union manages to cope with the situation in what Commissioner Rehn so aptly called ‘our front garden’."
"I think it would be true to say that we do not need UNMIK to be replaced by EUMIK, but I do know from personal experience that we do, in very many areas, still need a long process of monitoring by our partners; it is needed at every level of civil administration; it is needed in the police; it is needed in the performance of the justice system’s functions and not least in the building of a democratic civil society, of which hitherto, alas, only the first budding shoots have been visible."
"I wholeheartedly endorse Commissioner Rehn’s view that we are not – in financial and personnel terms – prepared for the challenge that will face us from next year onwards, and that is why I beg the Council, as a matter of urgency, to listen to us and to appeal to the Member States to make it, perhaps, possible for us to remedy the situation to some degree through bilateral treaties and the supply of specialised personnel."
"We have to adjust to the fact that the countries of Western Europe will, in the near future, be returning to Kosovo a very large number of people currently living within their borders; are we at all prepared for this?"
"."
"Mr President, everyone expects that within a year, the independence the overwhelming majority of the people of Kosovo have longed for will be recognised by many states."
"What matters in the discussions surrounding this topic is the question as to the conditions which independence must meet and how the Serb, Roma and other minorities will be protected."
"It is still, in particular, uncertain what is to happen as regards North Point, which wants to return to Serbia, and the new municipalities that may have to be created especially for Serbs."
"My group has bad recollections of the attitude which the European Union adopted between 1989 and 1999."
"Nobody seemed interested in the peaceful mass opposition under the of the later President Ibrahim Rugova, during which all Serb state institutions were boycotted and the Albanian-speaking population set up its own government and school system."
"The objective of the war in 1999 was not to liberate Kosovo, but to dominate Serbia in compliance with other European and American demands."
"Unfortunately, Kosovo's independence, which is now inevitable, is not a choice motivated by the pursuit of democracy and equal rights, but the result of an industrial accident."
"After seven years, it is plain for nearly everyone to see that continued occupation does not solve anything, while handing it back to Serbia would unleash a guerrilla war and enormous floods of refugees."
"I agree with the questioners from four other groups that the European Union is now obliged to play a positive role in a peaceful and correct division of Serbia and the construction of democracy and economy in Kosovo."
"–Mr President, the nineteen-nineties have become etched in our memory due to the monstrous crimes that were committed by our southern neighbours."
"The world was shocked by how brutal and inhuman former neighbours and relatives could be in their behaviour towards one another."
"The Muslim Albanians, who constituted 90% of the population and had been decimated by the police and the Orthodox Serb minority, were ‘rescued’ by the military intervention of NATO forces in 1999."
"Since then, the ethnic cleansing started by the bloody regime of the Serbian president Milosevic has ceased, but countless acts of aggression against the Serbian minority have continued."
"Today, the Albanians are still living under international protection in areas reminiscent of ghettoes, where they are trying to rebuild their lives."
"The Council has concentrated its efforts on the issue of legitimate government."
"However, it lacks a comprehensive approach to this complex problem, particularly concerning the failure to uphold human rights, protect national minorities and take into consideration people’s right to a homeland."
"– Mr President, three minutes is a wonderfully long time."
"I would like to make three points."
"My first is that prolonging the negotiations will not bring any change to the fundamental differences between Serbia and Kosovo."
"One of them is in favour of autonomy, the other is in favour of independence."
"Therefore I feel very strongly that we should stick to the timetable and time limits envisaged by the contact group and have the issue settled by the end of the Finnish Presidency at the end of 2006."
"We must stay firm on this."
"The second point I wanted to make is that, much like Mr Posselt, I see no option other than independence, with some limitations on Kosovo’s sovereignty, of course."
"It is important, in order to maintain stability in the region, that there is an international presence and most certainly that the European Union is ready to maintain a significant presence for some time."
"The third point I wanted to make is that I think the Western Balkans by and large are a painful reminder of the weaknesses of our common foreign and security policy."
"I do not think we should repeat the mistakes of the past, and in that sense we must stand very firm in supporting the UN Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, whom I feel is doing an excellent job."
"I think that the EU’s best foreign policy is usually enlargement policy, and that is why it is very important to keep the prospect of enlargement alive for Kosovo and in the Western Balkans in general."
"As a final point, I would like to make the observation that in 1999 the Finnish Presidency interestingly started with the then President, Martti Ahtisaari, negotiating peace in Kosovo and the Western Balkans."
"I certainly hope that the Finnish Presidency in 2006 will end with a final settlement on the Kosovo issue and with independence for Kosovo."
"– Mr President, first I should like to welcome both the honesty and courage of Commissioner Rehn on the Council's stand on the 2007 budget."
"Ladies and gentlemen, to be honest, the European Union cannot be efficient and reliable without Community resources in the Balkans and the Council's proposal to reduce Community resources in the 2007 budget is, in my view, an unacceptable proposal which cannot be accepted."
"That being so, we surely all know that the European Union has an important role on the 'day after', in the period following the definition of the final regime in Kosovo."
"However, the European Union also has a very serious role to play today and it has a role in the definition of the final regime."
"We all believe in and support a peaceful, democratic, multiethnic and European Kosovo."
"However, we must show equal support for Serbia within the framework of the European strategy, as defined at the Thessaloniki Council."
"However, we believe that we should not get carried away by restricting timetables for defining the final regime."
"Any thoughts of unilaterally imposing a solution on Kosovo may prove to be counter-productive."
"The European Union should not repeat the mistakes it made in the 1990s."
"It must formulate a common stand."
"To close, I would like to refer to the question of Serbia, which particularly concerns me, because we have heard here from honourable Members with different views."
"There can be no peaceful solution for Kosovo, there can be no peace, stability and security in the Balkans unless there is democracy in Serbia within the European Union."
"From this point of view, the Council's decision to suspend negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is, I think, an important political mistake for the European Union."
"Negotiations must start at once and, of course, we must see as they progress the implementation of the preconditions to cooperation with the International Criminal Court."
"The Serbian people must not be punished for the traumatic past under the autocratic Milosevic regime."
"Today we must see some sort of prospects for Serbia because, otherwise, we shall strengthen extreme nationalistic groups."
"I close with the situation regarding minority rights in Kosovo."
"All the recent reports by the UN Secretary General, the UN Human Rights Committee and non-governmental organisations describe a drastic situation for minorities, especially the Serbian minority in Kosovo."
"We are talking about respecting Resolution 1244 passed in 1999."
"We are talking about applying standards."
"We must, at long last, move in this direction."
"The European Parliament has played a leading role in sending signals as to the future status of Kosovo."
"The appointment of the Special Envoy for Kosovo is the signal Belgrade and the international public need to help them recognise the only possible future for Kosovo."
"I am delighted to see that Mr Poettering is also with us today, as a difficult task will face us during his presidency of the European Parliament."
"For this reason, it seems to me that our discussion should focus on what our Parliament can do to facilitate the future path of Kosovo."
"Our first task should be to ensure clearer communication with the Serbian Parliament and to help Serbian politicians understand that Kosovo has already been independent for a considerable period of time."
"Secondly, we must have direct cooperation with the body which will build democracy in Kosovo, the Kosovo Assembly."
"The Serbian minority has a weak presence in the Assembly and is still manipulated to a great degree by politicians in Belgrade."
"In addition, there are divisions in the Roma minority – it is divided into Roma, Ashkali and Egyptians and they have dissonant voices."
"Here in Parliament, we can make a great contribution in this respect, and the Council can make an even greater contribution."
"I should like to remind you that at present many Member States of the European Union do not recognise UNMIK passports."
"The citizens of Kosovo arrive in the European Union holding UNMIK passports and we turn them away because we do not respect their documents."
"Commissioner Frattini and the Council should do more to minimise the number of such incidents in the future."
"The third difficulty we are facing is the disrespect shown to the different cultures in Kosovo and in this context the Serbian Orthodox Church is playing a very negative role."
"As long as the Serbian Orthodox Church refuses to look to the future, we will have great difficulty convincing the Serbian community in Kosovo to integrate itself into the democratic institutions of Kosovo."
"The key question, however, is that of status."
"We have offered the Western Balkans a European future."
"But we are well aware that only states can accede to the European Union."
"A Kosovo that is not a state cannot take part in that process."
"While we fail to resolve the status of Kosovo and ensure that it becomes a state in its own right, we will be lying to ourselves and to the public as a whole."
"This is why, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to conclude my speech by calling on us all, as Members of the European Parliament, to make our voices heard and ensure that the question of status is resolved now and not delayed until next year."
"Mr President, Mrs Lehtomäki, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the discharge for the 2004 Budget in April, Parliament, on two occasions, made very explicit statements with regard to the European Agency for the Reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo."
"This House explicitly stated, and I quote: ‘that this Agency should not be phased out according to a previously determined schedule, but that its dismantlement should depend on economic and political pre-conditions and developments."
"That, however, is precisely how the Commission is now choosing to phase out the Agency in question, and to hand over its tasks to the delegations."
"Five months after Parliament’s resolution, five months after Parliament’s explicit statements, the Commission is taking no notice of what we said."
"I should like to ask Commissioner Rehn why he ignores this statement by Parliament."
"Why does he choose to let the expertise that is present in the Agency melt away like snow in the sun?"
"Why does he not choose to use the people who are currently working for the Agency in Pristina as a first core of EU people who will soon be able to guide Kosovo's independence from very close range and with much expertise and know-how?"
"That is what I want him to tell us."
"– Mr President, it is not irrelevant to say that one cause of the present state of affairs in Kosovo is NATO’s war of aggression against Yugoslavia, in which many EU Member States participated, and in which it was their bombs that killed civilians."
"Why, then, is the Serb minority in Kosovo under threat today?"
"That, too, has to do with this situation, and with the one-sided approach that the EU Member States took back then."
"A second consideration is that people are being deported to Kosovo, even though many people find the situation there utterly intolerable."
"It is intended that there should be more deportations, and the Commission needs to make it quite clear that this is not acceptable."
"Joachim Rücker has been put in charge of UNMIK."
"I do not know whether that is a good idea in view of the fact that he was, formerly, primarily responsible for privatisations there, which did the people of Kosovo no good at all."
"What I would like to know is how, in practical terms, the Commission envisages the future status of Kosovo."
"What I have heard so far I have found highly unsatisfactory."
"Commissioner Rehn was right to say that funds should be devoted to social and economic development rather than to military matters, and I am all in favour of that."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the resolution of the status issue is not only in the interests of Kosovo itself, but also in those of the European Union."
"It is, however, conditional on our finding ways of protecting the minorities – and by that I mean all of them – in a credible manner, for it has become apparent during our numerous visits there that people are still afraid, and events over recent years have shown that those fears are still justified."
"That is something we have to take into account, and that is why the European Union still needs to be involved there, firstly in building up the police force – something that is very important indeed – and, secondly, in building up the legal system and the administration, for I share Commissioner Rehn’s view that this is where resources need to be made available, but Kosovo’s economic development will be dependent most of all on peace, stability and functioning institutions, and it is to these that our efforts must be particularly devoted."
"This will also involve resolving the issue of which military forces are to perform the function of keeping Kosovo secure once it is independent, and I could well imagine a similar solution being arrived at to that found for Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the KFOR being replaced by European armed services."
"When we visited the country, I put this question to the Prime Minister, and it was evident from the answer he gave that nobody had given the matter any thought until then."
"Greater involvement by the European Union in this area would also be in line with our security policy – or with the security policy of which I am an advocate."
"What is important is that we, at this stage in the development of our security policy, should prioritise our efforts in our geographical neighbourhood, and the stabilisation of the Balkans continues to be our most important task."
"Madam President, integrating the Western Balkans into the European Union is one of the most significant challenges facing European policy over the coming years."
"The issue relates to an area of Europe inhabited by numerous nationalities and ethnic groups, communities divided by country, religion, history and the bloody disintegration of Yugoslavia in the nineteen-nineties."
"Kosovo is the Gordian knot of European policy in this region."
"The United Nations mission is now preparing for withdrawal from Kosovo."
"This means that the European Union must be prepared to assume its role there in 2007."
"The first challenge for the European Union in this new situation will be the as yet undefined status of Kosovo."
"The recent UN-hosted talks in Vienna on 24 July did not lead to any breakthrough."
"Serbia, which formally owns Kosovo, did not agree to independence for the province."
"The Albanian authorities of Kosovo are not prepared to accept even the broadest autonomy."
"In a peculiar form of psychological war, the Serbian authorities have, in recent days, accused the UN special envoy on the future status of Kosovo Martti Ahtisaari of lacking impartiality in the negotiations."
"On the other hand, the political advisor to the Albanian premier Koço Danaj stated that by 2013, all Albanians living in the Balkans should unite and integrate within a natural Albania."
"These events of this summer, which overshadow the Middle East conflict, constitute a major problem which the institutions of the European Union need to tackle over the coming months."
"Another challenge is organising the future EU mission in Kosovo."
"This problem relates to funding, structure, staffing and above all the EU’s political strategy in the Western Balkans."
"No other country or international organisation will replace the European Union in its historic role of guaranteeing democracy, peace and social welfare, based on respect for diversity, in this part of the continent."
"– Madam President, reports about Kosovo describe the province as having become ghettoised."
"A multiethnic community has not been established."
"During seven years of international administration, the different ethnic groups have concentrated themselves in their own areas."
"One main reason for why standards have not been achieved, despite the massive input that there has been, is that Kosovo is one of the main havens for organised crime in Europe."
"International human trafficking and the trade in territory and weapons are rampant in Kosovo."
"Nothing was done about this back in 1999, when the problem was noticed: we had to wait until 2005."
"Now the global actors involved in the programme, however, have much too little time and too few staff for their many areas of responsibility."
"We therefore need to make a greater effort to address this problem of crime."
"Finally, I would like to say that now that the EU is also focusing its attention on Lebanon, we should think about just how aware we are of what has happened in Kosovo and whether there might be something to learn from it for the operation in Lebanon."
"– Madam President, the ugly situation and impoverishment of the peoples of the Former Yugoslavia are the result of foreign intervention, the unfair and dirty war unleashed by ΝΑΤΟ with the participation of numerous countries of the European Union."
"Your pronouncements on the protection of human rights are full of hypocrisy."
"The objectives of this war are visible today."
"It was to break up Yugoslavia and share it out and you succeeded in doing this by imposing foreign occupation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo and by creating protectorates."
"Today you are not even abiding by the pronouncements and the commitments you made not to proceed to an independent Kosovo."
"The creation of a protectorate, of an independent state is being promoted in Kosovo with the presence of a huge military force and a huge American base, so that you can control the area and change the borders."
"We consider that the only solution which there can be is for all the foreign troops to leave the Balkans and for the people in the area to find a solution to their problems."
"To close, I would advise you to look to history: just as the peoples of the Balkans expelled foreign conquerors, they will expel the new conquerors as well."
"It is obvious that the independence of Kosovo is inevitable, but the kind of independence this is to be will have a long-term effect on the stability of all of South Eastern Europe."
"The European Union does not have a conception in this matter, but in reality, it is simply stumbling along led by the events."
"It would be very important to adopt, at last, a consistent concept with regard to a solution for Kosovo."
"The solution should be a dignified one, one that does not punish the Serbs while openly rewarding the Albanians."
"Such a solution would lack dignity and would destabilise the region, that is to say South Eastern Europe, which includes Greece, Hungary, and the candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania."
"We cannot stabilise Kosovo at the expense of destabilising the region."
"At the moment everyone is talking about the minority question, but there is no encouraging conception on offer."
"This is all the more interesting because Mr Ahtisaari and Mr Olli Rehn are both Finns – and Finland has an exemplary minority system."
"I cannot imagine a situation that would reassure the Kosovo Serbs as long as the northern part does not have territorial autonomy and the south does not enjoy a system of personal autonomy."
"The whole process of decentralisation has not been thought through; self-government gives no guarantees in this regard."
"As regards compensation for Serbia, membership in the EU, as we know very well, is not a particularly attractive prospect given the current EU fatigue."
"We must take this into account as well, just as we must reflect on the fact that Milosevic had stripped Kosovo as well as Voivodina of their autonomy."
"Everyone is talking about Kosovo’s independence, but no one mentions the minorities in Voivodina or the situation of the Muslims of Sandjak."
"I fear that we are moving towards a bad settlement if we fail to work out a sound, dignified concept on behalf of the minorities."
"I share all the concerns of my fellow Member Mr von Wogau."
"Madam President, Commissioner, but above all, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, perhaps I might be permitted, at the end of the debate, to try to sum up the key points."
"I think that you, and I am addressing the Minister when saying this, noticed that most of the questions raised, and remarks made, on this platform spring from genuine concern about the fact that the EU ... I am not doubting your sincerity or your awareness of what needs to be done, but I am nevertheless concerned – will be unable to complete all the difficult tasks it will be given within the time available, which is three to six months, not years."
"I think, as many Members have said, that failure on the part of the EU is not an option, for that would be detrimental to both the region and the EU, and that is something we cannot afford."
"If you say, and the Commissioner confirms, that the EU’s task is to monitor and transfer competences, then I – together, I believe, with most Members of this House – will sanction this, but it is more difficult than it looks."
"It is a sort of new role, where we, on the one hand, need to let go of some things and, on the other hand, need to keep control in a divided society, where not all problems will turn out to have been resolved following independence."
"At the moment, everyone in Kosovo still thinks that independence will solve everything."
"That will not be case for economic problems, for example."
"As regards a military presence, I hope with all my heart that all due attention for Lebanon and Congo will not result in people thinking that things will work out in Kosovo and that we can handle things here with fewer troops."
"That will not be the case in the first few years."
"I can do no other than support the Commissioner in his request to the Council not to ask the Commission for any more and at the same time, to make fewer funds and people available."
"It cannot be that you and we ask the Commission to play a crucial role in Kosovo with fewer people."
"I really do hope that the Finnish President, the Finnish Commissioner and the Finnish negotiator reach this conclusion, and in order to promote this, I, on behalf of the whole of Parliament, am quite willing to visit, at my own expense, a place where most Fins get their valuable insights, namely the sauna."
"."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a status solution is the best option for Kosovo and for that reason we should support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari to find one, using all possible means."
"As has been mentioned so many times in this debate, an unconditional pre-requirement for a lasting solution is to be able to resolve the issue regarding minorities, and that is something of a multigenerational problem."
"The presence of NATO’s KFOR troops is important for the time being, but now and in the future we will need to pay special heed to the importance of the close relationship between military and civil action."
"Apart from anything else, the European Union is preparing for a huge civil crisis management operation in Kosovo."
"It will be on a scale never seen before and its main focus will be on the police and the rule of law."
"We will need a good number of experts from the Member States of the European Union in order to carry out this operation, and it will be our challenge to find such a large number of experts."
"The work of the Planning Team is as yet unfinished, but the intention is for their report to be in the hands of the Council’s working group at the end of the month."
"Preparations are thus making headway in many different ways and in many different sectors, but we can surely improve their steady flow."
"Several times here there have also been references to the Council’s draft budget for next year, especially with respect to how it will make the use of staff resources more effective."
"The Presidency is very committed to finding a solution that will satisfy all parties, but it will also naturally have to listen to the views of the other Member States."
"Besides, my opinion is that the situation is not as gloomy as we have been given to believe, especially in the Commissioner’s very emotive speech."
"In the Council’s view, enlargement is clearly a priority area and, accordingly, we are not proposing staff cuts there."
"In fact, this maligned budget for next year increases administrative expenditure by 3.4%."
"Admittedly, the cuts sought for the period 2007-2013 are very ambitious, but as the Commission is at the same time planning increases for enlargement, there will in any case be more staff in the Commission in 2013 than in 2007, even though we will be monitoring this ambitious trend."
"So there will be more staff in 2013 than next year anyway."
"We are trying to find, and we are committed to finding, solutions which will ensure that there are adequate numbers of staff to deal with important matters."
"This is obvious, of course."
"Finally, for some light relief and as the Finnish sauna was mentioned here, I will say that, however well the internal coordination of the Finnish Presidency proceeds, I shall not be joining Mr Ahtisaari or Mr Rehn in the sauna."
"."
"Madam President, I am a bit disappointed with the conservative approach of Ms Lehtomäki in her interpretation of the sauna culture."
"I should like to thank you all for a very substantive and responsible debate, which clearly shows that this House fully supports the prospects for European integration of the Western Balkans and Kosovo."
"It is very important now – as was underlined by several speakers – to firmly support the efforts to conclude the status process within the envisaged timetable."
"We will not gain anything from prolonging the process."
"It is also true that peace and appropriate institutions lay the foundation for better economic conditions and job creation, which Kosovo desperately needs."
"An unemployment rate of 40% to 50% unfortunately produces a very fertile breeding ground for crime and corruption."
"We need to give the Kosovars the tools to help themselves."
"Legal certainty and a well-functioning business environment are necessary preconditions for making economic progress in Kosovo."
"At the same time, there is another precondition: whatever the precise outcome of the status settlement, it must include treaty-making powers for Kosovo."
"As Mr Kacin said, treaty-making powers are needed so that we can negotiate with Kosovo and make it part of the stabilisation and association process."
"Likewise, Kosovo needs treaty-making powers in order to make deals and contracts with the international financial institutions, which is another precondition for making economic progress and improving the employment situation there."
"As to Serbia, it is certainly a – if not – key country for the stability of the Western Balkans."
"The best service that Serbia can render the Kosovo Serbs is to participate very constructively in the talks to ensure that minorities are truly protected, once the outcome of the Kosovo status settlement emerges."
"Serbia has firm and tangible prospects of joining Europe."
"For our part, we are willing to resume the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement even on the very same day as Serbia achieves full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which should lead to the arrest and transfer of Radko Mladic."
"It is in Serbia’s hands and Serbia can make this European aspiration a reality and release the tremendous economic, cultural and intellectual potential that exists in the country."
"I should like to correct one misunderstanding, which has not occurred here but often arises, namely the belief that the Council and Commission are competing in the Western Balkans."
"That is not the case at all."
"The Council and Commission are not competing, but cooperating fully and deeply for stability and democracy in the Western Balkans."
"We work very well in tandem with Mr Solana, as do our services."
"For instance, in relation to the rule of law, we need that cooperation because the rule of law – that is, the provisional training of judges and police – is a joint competence of the Council, the Member States and the Commission."
"Therefore, in order to use that joint competence sensibly, we need cooperation."
"That is what we have with Mr Solana and his people."
"As to Mr Wiersma’s question on resources, apart from Kosovo there are other burning issues, such as Lebanon."
"How successfully the resource question is resolved will now be up to you, as the budgetary authority."
"I am very grateful to the Finnish Presidency for its readiness to play a very constructive role in this very difficult matter."
"I fully agree that the stabilisation of the Western Balkans is the first and foremost priority of the evolving European security and defence policy."
"Indeed, as Mr Lagendijk said, we cannot afford to fail in this test case."
"The debate is closed."
"."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement signed on 12 June was an important step on Albania’s path towards its future with the European Union."
"We are satisfied that Albania has made progress in its reforms so that the talks on the agreement, which had been going on for so long, could be brought to a conclusion."
"Together with the other mechanisms covered by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the pact will create a comprehensive framework for the further development of relations between the EU and Albania."
"The Interim Agreement, which was signed at the same time, is intended to enter into force from the start of November."
"It covers trade under the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and related matters which will apply up until the Member States have ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement proper."
"It is important that we start to make effective use of the Interim Agreement once it has entered into force."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is of major importance for Albania’s future."
"It will enhance economic and political relations between the EU and Albania and make it easier for Albania to have closer ties with the European Union."
"Albania is the third country in the Western Balkans (after Macedonia and Croatia in the former Republic of Yugoslavia) with which the EU has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"Signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement does not mean that the work has ended."
"On the contrary, the real work is only really just beginning now."
"We now expect Albania to demonstrate continued and effective progress in the implementation of the agreements."
"It must work hard to take forward the reforms necessary for closer ties with the EU."
"It is important that progress should be made in particular in such areas as freedom of the media, the return of property and compensation being paid, more efficient public administration and a respect for the principles of the rule of law."
"We will continually stress the importance for Albania, as for the other countries in the Western Balkans, of stepping up measures to prevent corruption and organised crime."
"There may be local elections in Albania in six months’ time, and Albania should ensure that it can see them through in accordance with international norms."
"For the reforms necessary for closer ties with the EU to be taken forward, all the political powers will need to pull together."
"The current political climate in Albania is worrying and is a serious threat to the progress of reform."
"We are urging the parties concerned to take part in constructive dialogue and we are pleased that some initial first results were achieved just last week."
"Finally, I would like to remind everyone that at the European Council in June the European Union once again endorsed the EU perspective in respect of the countries in the Western Balkans."
"That means that Albania too has a future place in the Europe Union."
"We must nevertheless remember that each country’s progress towards EU accession stands or falls on its own merits in its attempts to meet EU requirements."
"The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement provide Albania with the best possible framework for its own attempts."
"The Union must of course continue to help, but most of the work still to do can only be done by Albania itself."
"."
"Madam President, it is a great pleasure to speak about the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania at the European Parliament today."
"The SAA is an important milestone on Albania’s path towards the European Union and a major step for the EU itself in the Western Balkans."
"It marks the beginning of a new phase in the EU’s relations with Albania and creates a new framework for partnership in a wide range of fields."
"The SAA represents an important economic and political opportunity."
"Increased trade liberalisation will bring significant economic benefits to both Albania and the EU."
"Aligning Albanian laws with those of the EU will bring Albania closer to European standards and help further strengthen the ties between us."
"Successfully implementing the SAA will be Albania’s next major challenge."
"The SAA creates significant obligations in terms of trade, rule of law, democratic standards and fundamental rights, regional cooperation and new legislation."
"The SAA sets up joint structures to foster dialogue and monitor progress, including a parliamentary committee."
"This committee will be able to take forward the good work of the current Joint Parliamentary Committee and will provide an important opportunity to guide Albania in the best traditions of European parliamentary democracy."
"I am sure it will also help to achieve a minimal degree of consensual political culture and underline the fact that a successful country in the European Union, or in the accession or pre-accession process, needs a broad political consensus on the question of European aspirations, as well as a basic consensus on a democratic culture in the country."
"It is important to take this into account as Albania pursues its European route."
"The Commission warmly welcomes the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for assent to the conclusion of the SAA."
"In our political dialogue we share the committee’s emphasis on encouraging Albania to build on progress in the fight against corruption and organised crime, and to address areas such as electoral reform, media freedom and human and minority rights with greater determination."
"We welcome the recommendations of the Committee on International Trade on improving Albania’s business environment, which is vital to enable Albania to make full use of the agreement."
"I want to conclude by assuring you that, from the EU side, the European Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the full benefit of the SAA is truly achieved."
"I have made it clear to our Albanian partners that I expect no less from them."
"."
"Madam President, of all the European countries, Albania has had the longest row to hoe in the transition from communist dictatorship to liberal democracy."
"It is a country that groaned under Stalinism well into the 1980s, thus it must be clear to all of us that it faced far greater challenges than other post-communist countries like my own, for whom the worst excesses of Stalinist totalitarianism ended in the 1950s."
"Albania has made enormous progress: the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is proof of it."
"At the same time, Albania should not rest on its laurels."
"To meet its European calling it needs to do more."
"The SAA is a milepost, it is not a destination."
"I would sum up my report as follows."
"The SAA and the interim agreement offer a golden opportunity for Albania to modernise itself and become a competitive market economy, the sine qua non for joining the EU."
"Secondly, genuine economic development requires a stable and transparent legal environment. This means a professional and independent judiciary, an effective and politically unbiased fight against corruption and an efficient, well-functioning public administration."
"Thirdly, as with all transition countries, a sound legal framework is not enough."
"Good laws on the books help little if they are not enforced."
"Progress must be made in implementing the adopted reforms."
"Fourthly, progress in achieving the standards laid down in the SAA, and therefore implementing the reforms, should be monitored by the EU by means of concrete benchmarks."
"In addition to these general themes, I would like to underline a number of specific points in the report."
"While giving full support to Albania’s European perspective in line with the Thessaloniki conclusions, the report underlines that Albania needs to pursue the fulfilment of European values and standards as a goal in itself."
"It calls for a visa facilitation agreement with Albania."
"Today, citizens of a small country with a European perspective have a less favourable visa regime with the EU than a large country with no membership prospects – Russia."
"The report calls on the EU and Albania to take advantage of the knowledge and experience of the 2004 accession states."
"The challenges faced by Albania are not unique; there is no need to reinvent the wheel when the expertise of the wheelwrights of reform from eight post-communist EU Member States is freely available."
"The report notes that a recent Amnesty International report was critical of Albania for violations of human rights in areas of access to legal defence, the problems of torture and brutality towards prisoners, and so on. These deficiencies must be corrected."
"The report says that electoral legislation must be reformed."
"This means a more reliable voters’ registry and changes in the system to avoid distortion of the proportionality system – this system is currently known as the ‘Dushk’ system in Albania – because, let us be honest, faith and democracy will not last if the voters’ will is distorted."
"I think this is one of the crucial democracy issues that the country faces today."
"The report underlines the need for Albania to continue with its responsible attitude towards neighbouring countries, particularly towards Kosovo and FYROM."
"As we know, there are substantial Albanian minorities in FYROM, and Kosovo, of course, is an Albanian area."
"We welcome the attitude taken thus far by Albania in not getting involved in those problems."
"I have received six amendments."
"I will take on board Amendment 5 from Mr Brie and Mr Meijer on the need to address the issue of trafficking of children."
"Amendments 1 and 2 are good in principle, but in the opinion of the rapporteur will be more appropriate when Albania has made far more progress in dealing with its fundamental problems involving corruption, the rule of law and economic reforms."
"In my opinion, Amendment 3 on the treatment of prisoners is already covered in the report."
"To conclude, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this report, but I would especially like to single out Mrs Pack, the dynamo driving so much of this House’s approach to bringing the Balkans into Europe."
"– Madam President, first of all my honourable friend, Mr Ilves, deserves fulsome congratulations on the very important work he has carried out on this important motion, which reflects the current state of relations between the European Union and Albania and highlights all the major problems and challenges facing the Albanian Government and the Albanian political forces."
"It is a fact that the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement opens a new path for Albania towards Europe, towards the European institutions, with the ultimate objective of integration into the European family."
"We must always remember this; it is what the European strategy decided in Thessaloniki says and I believe that the European Union has every strategic interest, despite enlargement fatigue, to strengthen these European prospects of the countries of the Balkans."
"Clearly a great deal still needs to be done in Albania, as Mr Ilves has pointed out."
"I should like to touch in particular on two or three points."
"On the question of combating corruption, we are of course all agreed."
"However, under no circumstances should the present Albanian Government use combating corruption as a pretext to settle political accounts with the opposition forces."
"This is a serious issue which we have experienced in Albania in the past."
"The second issue is the need to proceed immediately to reform the electoral system and update electoral rolls."
"This is very important, because it will help to smooth out political life and consolidate a democratic political system."
"The third issue is respect for the freedom of the media and, of course, the prevention of government interference in its operation."
"I should like to point out here – and my comments are addressed to Mr Rehn – that there has been increased government interference over recent days in the operation of media of the Albanian democratic opposition, to be specific the socialist party."
"I refer, Mr Rehn, to the Top Channel television network, which is being hampered in its operation by the Albanian authorities."
"This too is an issue which we need to highlight."
"Finally, respect for minorities."
"Albania really does need to take important steps here."
"There is a Greek minority which is playing an important role and is an asset to the democratisation of Albania and, of course, the functioning of the Orthodox Church and the spiritual role of Archbishop Anastasios must be facilitated."
". – Madam President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Ilves, your report, Mr Ilves, shows a very great deal of empathy with, and understanding of, the young democracy of Albania, but also the rigorous approach that is required when considering it; it is a very good report, and I am grateful to you for it."
"Many of you will be aware that I have, for fourteen years, been observing Albania as it has emerged from a long period of dictatorship and moved closer to the European Community."
"It is for that reason that I am particularly pleased that we are able, today, to vote to approve this stabilisation and association agreement, something I welcome as an important step towards a relationship of trust between Albania and the EU, which will help Albania and its politicians to give the country the political, economic and institutional stability that it needs."
"It will be very difficult to make progress down this road; to do so, it will be necessary to achieve the standards required, as laid down in the agreement, and for this Parliament, and our committee on relations with it in particular, to monitor this progress continuously and with the utmost precision."
"We too, as good friends, will do as we have done for many years and highlight any deficiencies, including those yet to be discovered."
"Although I think it much to be welcomed that war has been declared on corruption in Albania, I do also think that all the political forces must treat this campaign with the same seriousness, for it will not meet with real and lasting success unless they do."
"Over recent months, a number of criminal gangs have been unmasked and arrested; this is a very good result and an incentive to further action of the same kind aimed at taking passport-forgers, drug-dealers and the like out of circulation and bringing them to justice."
"The government is doing a splendid job in the educational field and thereby giving the many young Albanians a bit more of a future;"
"I very much hope that it will do everything necessary to enable them to participate in the European Union’s new educational programmes after 2007."
"It is also a good thing that the government is making the effort to attract the investment that the country needs, although that will of course be conditional on the reforms in administration and the justice system that are so urgently needed."
"Our resolution also highlights the need for the practice of the bloodfeud, still prevalent in many parts of Albania, to be stamped out; our call for this is founded on our European values, which, we hope, will soon guide the thoughts and actions of all Albanians."
"I have no wish to conceal the fact that I found much of what happened over the summer months highly disagreeable, but, without going into unpleasant details, I would like to stress that what is urgently needed is political dialogue, and that political maturity is demonstrated by democratic behaviour and nothing else."
"The political forces on all sides should also, and once and for all, stop constantly crying out for an international mediator to sort their problems out."
"Albanian politicians are elected to resolve problems in a democratic manner and to perform in a constructive manner the role allotted to them, whether it involves exercising governmental responsibility or serving in the opposition."
"Recent years have shown the futility of boycotts, and they would not be worth the effort now either; the Albanian people have had enough of that sort of stunt, and what they want is serious politicians with a serious interest in sorting problems out."
"It is for this reason that it is so heartening that the political forces have come to an agreement on the tiresome subject of electoral rolls."
"The European Union has for years been paying a great deal of money to get these lists at last drawn up properly, and it is still proving extremely difficult."
"Local elections are due to be held shortly, and if the results are to be acceptable, they must be based on largely secure data."
"The ongoing dispute between the government and a private television station can, I believe, be properly resolved only by full compliance with the law."
"I would like, by way of conclusion, to remind the House that we have for a long time been arguing the case for easier visa arrangements for Albania and for the other countries of South-Eastern Europe, and so we very much welcome the return agreements reached by Albania and the EU."
"Albania is among the few countries that have done this, and one of the things we are calling for by means of our resolution is prompt action on the part of European governments to make it easier for students, academics and businessmen to get visas, with, of course, a more relaxed visa regime for all citizens following on as soon as possible."
"Criminals either acquire visas by dubious means or have no need of them, being, as they are, familiar with other ways of getting across borders, but the success of efforts in Albania to combat crime may perhaps make it possible for European governments to at last work miracles where the allocation of visas is concerned."
"."
"Madam President, on behalf of my group, I should like to thank our rapporteur, Mr Ilves, for the work he has done."
"Albania is a difficult, complicated country, and I think that he is correct in his analysis of it and the conclusions he has drawn."
"We too welcome the signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and will vote in favour of it here today."
"The agreement reflects how much has been achieved with sheer perseverance, and opens the way to EU candidate membership on the basis of the agreements that were made in Thessaloniki."
"Our group will continue to support Albania in the steps it will have to take as it moves towards European integration."
"Until the early 1990s, Albania was the most isolationist country of the European continent."
"By signing this agreement, it joins with various other Balkan countries that have made courageous strides over the past year."
"Croatia is now negotiating with the EU about membership; Macedonia has received candidate-member status and clear progress has also been made with regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina."
"We, as a group, did briefly consider asking for deferral of vote on this agreement, as a means of bringing some pressure to bear on the authorities in Albania and getting them to ensure that the forthcoming local elections run smoothly, but we think you can also turn the argument around, by saying that signing this agreement, Parliament's approval of it, spurs all parties in Albania on to behave properly and to continue on the road towards political and economic reforms, in respect of which we can work with the criteria we used in other countries that worked on a future within the European Union, particularly, of course, the first Copenhagen criterion."
"We should, however, not lose sight of the fact that there is still a long way to go."
"This signing does not mean that the Albanian Government, which has presented the concluding of this agreement as an important victory, can rest on its laurels, and I hope that people in Albania are aware of this."
"If we consider the Copenhagen criteria, the ultimate benchmark for EU membership, the Albanian Government should be alerted to a number of things."
"I have already mentioned the local elections, which, we assume, everyone will keep free and fair."
"We will ensure that they are, while also hoping that the Commission and the Council will keep an eye on things."
"Secondly, I should like to comment on the situation in the media."
"Free and independent media are indispensable for a transparent and robust democracy."
"It is clearly up to a country’s government to make sure that those are in place, but we have to establish that the media are under pressure to some extent, partly due to the proposed change to the Act on electronic media."
"There are also some question marks surrounding the judiciary’s independence."
"Those are all issues which the European Union will need to monitor closely, even after the ratification of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement."
"Finally, we have perceived a degree of political polarisation in that country that concerns us."
"That is not new, but we still cannot see any closure in that respect."
"We would therefore like to urge the government and opposition to adopt a mainly pragmatic and constructive approach, for only then can Albania fully utilise the scope which this agreement offers."
"."
"Since it opened up to the world, Albania has made many positive strides forward."
"We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe fully understand the difficulties it is experiencing."
"After its decade–long allegiance with China, it has woken up as the least developed country in Europe."
"This is why we understand its difficulties."
"In particular, there are still echoes today, of the severe economic crises that shocked Albanian society as a result of its pyramid economy."
"They continue to be reflected in the difficulties the country is experiencing."
"Nonetheless, now that Albania has signed the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, there are new challenges both for Albania and for us."
"It now has a new neighbour, an independent Montenegro."
"It will have a new neighbour, an independent Kosovo."
"Another neighbour, Macedonia, has been granted the status of a candidate country and is only awaiting a date to begin negotiations."
"These are all changes for the better and the Albanian political elite should take advantage of these changes to boost economic development and, in particular, social development."
"The rule of law cannot be based on centuries–old traditions that have no respect for the values of the European Union."
"Blood feuds have to be relegated to the dustbin of history, otherwise Albania will not be able to move towards the European Union."
"The Albanian political elite has to make greater efforts to combat corruption and pave the way for economic, political and legal development."
"Our greatest concern, however, is their failure to combat crime in a few highly sensitive areas."
"Violations of human rights, human trafficking and child abuse are areas that erode the fundamental values of the European Union and our civilisation."
"Conditions in prisons are unsatisfactory."
"Under such circumstances, Albania cannot move forward and should be sharply criticised on our part."
"Without freedom of the press and freedom of speech, Albania cannot get a realistic picture of itself."
"So a prerequisite for Albania’s faster progress is freedom of the press, which should be a mirror for the problems of Albanian society."
"Only those who realise their mistakes can remedy them."
"So our Albanian friends should not take umbrage if we are candid in our discussions with them as we try to make absolutely clear to them things that they have to see themselves."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the work that he has done."
". – Madam President, our rapporteur, Mr Ilves, gets heartfelt thanks from our group too, for the report he has put before us is very balanced and wide-ranging, but we also want to congratulate Albania and the European institutions."
"Having lived through decades of a totalitarian regime, Albania really is making great leaps forward, and we see that as the best evidence that the process of integration into the EU really is, after all, a motor and a motivation for the realisation of human rights, the rule of law and for encouraging economic development too."
"We all know that this process is far from complete, and various Members, along with Commissioner Rehn, have already drawn attention to the really critical aspects that can all be summed up under the overarching heading of ‘enforcement of the rule of law’."
"I would also like to remind you that a European institution such as our own, if it is to do this, needs a process of partnership and support, which will in turn require funding and personnel."
"Earlier on, in the debate on Kosovo, we pointed out that our budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 does not exactly inspire confidence."
"There is also – as my colleagues have repeatedly emphasised – a need for further support in areas such as the improvement of environmental conditions, sustainable energy and transport infrastructure and in the establishment of truly independent media."
"Finally, I have high hopes of Albania, having gained useful experience in the negotiations on a stability and association agreement, really playing a constructive role in the region, and if they pass this experience on to their counterparts in Kosovo, the region as a whole will become more stable."
"."
"Madam President, the area occupied by the Albanians is Europe’s most forgotten area."
"The Albanians were farmers and shepherds who had been left behind and whom nobody wanted to take into consideration."
"When the Ottoman empire collapsed nearly a century ago, both Serbia and Italy tried to establish permanent ownership of Albanians’ territory."
"It is a miracle that, in 1913, in the most inhospitable part of Albanian territory, it proved possible to establish an independent state although it has not been a success to date."
"Following right-wing dictatorship, foreign occupation and left-wing dictatorship, what is immediately apparent at the moment is chaos and the intolerance between the political parties."
"Especially the north of that country is unsafe and disadvantaged."
"Whilst the millions of Albanians who live around Albania along the south edge of Montenegro, in the largest part of Kosovo and in the north-west of Macedonia, fight for language rights and self-government, they expect little in the way of positive developments if they were to join forces with Albania in its current state."
"Moreover, public opinion would prefer to keep Albania outside of the European Union."
"The country is now mainly renowned for child trafficking, the pyramid schemes, wasting energy, prisoner abuse and international crime."
"Its problems appear to be beyond any solution."
"During preparatory discussions, it transpired that other groups are more optimistic than my own about the course of affairs in Albania, and that they feel less inclined to invite Albania to change."
"Despite this difference of opinion, my group shares their view that continued isolation and exclusion from European cooperation offer no solution to Albania’s enormous problems."
"The promise of a prospect of EU membership must be kept."
"In the intervening period, which is set to last for some time, they need support for democracy, education, the environment and the economy."
"I find it lamentable that the proposed decision appears to be better geared for foreign companies than for the environment, food safety and good governance."
"In our opinion, the neighbourhood policy and association agreements should not unilaterally serve the interests of the current EU Member States, but should primarily help possible future EU members gain ground."
". – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft resolution on the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Republic of Albania should be considered extremely carefully and extremely positively."
"I should like to announce that the Union for Europe of the Nations Group will vote for the resolution, and it is warmly welcomed by the Italian National Alliance delegation."
"It is well known that Italy is watching the progress of the young Republic of Albania closely, favourably and with interest, especially since the clear and reassuring victory of President Berisha."
"This agreement will promote increasingly strong and extensive contractual relations between Albania and the European Union; it will certainly promote political, economic and institutional stability in that country; and it will promote Albania’s transition both towards a full, pluralist democracy that respects the rule of law, and towards a market economy."
"The main benefits of the agreement are the creation of a free trade zone, a serious commitment to cooperation in areas of mutual interest and, above all, the promotion of a more stable legal environment that will reassure foreign investors."
"It is well known that, during the previous period from 1997 to 2005, the government’s stranglehold on political and economic power stifled the market economy and constrained the fabric of society, in which tolerance and permissiveness went hand in hand with corrupting and sometimes Mafia-like methods."
"Much more needs to be done, and Albania has done much more, for instance in stopping and pursuing smugglers and preventing the traffic in human beings between Albania and Italy."
"This fight against corruption and organised crime needs to continue."
"Albania must invest heavily in infrastructure, transport and tourism, but the Commission must do more as well: it must provide more resources, particularly for transport and corridor 8, since the importance of infrastructure networks should be considered a necessary condition for development and cohesion."
"Such networks potentially allow access to all parts of the country, and so each area will be able to make the best use of its resources, process them and sell its products on the market."
"– Madam President, if an observer from Asia, Africa or South America were here following this debate, we would have created a great many questions for him."
"There has not been one spokesman from any of the wings who has not referred to Albania as a country in which crime is flourishing, in which there are numerous smugglers, in which children are trafficked."
"At the same time, we hear all the spokesmen saying, yes, Albania must join the European family."
"I find this a little strange."
"However, these are the facts and we must examine them."
"I shall start with what Mr Rehn said: that the Commission and the Council are in accord."
"They were not always in accord, Commissioner."
"In October 2002, the Commission said association negotiations should not commence."
"The Council imposed the decision unilaterally and that is what has brought us to the situation we are in today."
"I say this in order to restore the truth and set the record straight."
"We Greeks are neighbours of the Albanians and, as you know, a neighbour knows more about the person next door than someone who lives elsewhere."
"What is the story here?"
"The story is that Albania imposed the harshest of dictatorships on itself."
"When the peoples of eastern Europe were looking upon Stalin as a dictator, Albania thought he was very democratic and followed Mao Tse Tung."
"This has left a residue in the DNA of the people and, more importantly, the leadership."
"Sixteen years have passed, 16 years of democracy and yet the main church in the city of Premeti has still not been restored to Christianity."
"They are still using it as a house of commerce."
"Sixteen years later, in a European country, a country, Minister, just 500 kilometres from Austria."
"A church which was an Orthodox church for centuries has not been restored and they still retain it as a house of commerce."
"What answer is there to that?"
"Is it not a fact that something is not working properly in this country?"
"We are talking about a country that last year – not before then, just last year – took two months to return the results of the elections."
"Can you imagine, Commissioner, Minister, Finland or Austria taking two months to return the results of elections?"
"Elections were held in Albania on 2 July and the results came out on 2 September, meaning that the democratic construct is not working properly, that something is not right in the public administration sector in this country."
"There are Greek contractors in Albania who do not recognise the legal government of Mr Berisha today, or Mr Fatos yesterday as the leadership; they recognise the mafia, because if they do not pay taxes to the mafia, they blow up the building site."
"There are Greek companies which have invested several million euros and, precisely because they could not stand the mafia which imposed its own extortionate taxes, they are abandoning their building sites and machinery and moving out."
"One in three cars checked at the borders by the Greek police is carrying hashish."
"That is the percentage."
"How can we have such a country which cannot organise its state?"
"I agree that we must all try to help this country find its way, but if we believe that it is mature, then I greatly fear that we shall find ourselves in trouble."
"The time is not yet right."
"We come here, the civilised people of Europe, the representatives of the people of Europe, and decide not to let Serbia into the Union but to let Albania in."
"We do not let Serbia in because Mrs Ponte was against it; but Mrs Ponte did not want Croatia and, if Austria had not imposed a veto on Turkey last year, Croatia would still be outside the Union."
"So Mrs Ponte comes along and dictates which country will accede and which will not accede to the European Union."
"Is that not the truth?"
"How can we want Albania to accede and to keep out Serbia, which has a better organised state and better rates of development and more culture?"
"Is that not the truth?"
"Now, a short while ago, the Commissioner made a stylish but material admission that this is the reason Serbia is not joining the European Union."
"We need to face the facts, that this is a country with high levels of crime which the government cannot control."
"The government may have the intention of controlling it, but it is not in a position to do so, because it is beyond its capabilities."
"Similarly, trafficking in children cannot be controlled."
"In 2006 we have trafficking in children, for goodness sake."
"There is a great deal of drug trafficking and, of course, apart from anything else, and this is a political issue which I believe, with guidance, will be brought under control, there is rampant chauvinism which is not confined solely to Kosovo or Skopje, where we saw disruptions a few years ago, but is directed against Greece."
"The President of the Hellenic Republic went on an official visit and the Albanian Muslims booed him and there were incidents and a terrible hullabaloo."
"We must therefore examine the issue of chauvinism which characterises this country and the issue of the freedom of the press."
"When a country is deprived of the freedom of the press, it is deprived of basic rights."
"We must therefore look very carefully before we leap."
"This country needs education and strict schooling before it accedes to the European Union."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party, which endorses this draft resolution."
"For years, the image of Albania in Italy has been one of barges and motorboats full of desperate men and women who, spurred on by poverty and pain, reach the Adriatic coast exhausted in search of a future that would be impossible in their own country."
"In 1995 I took part in an international volunteering and solidarity camp during the most critical and difficult period, and I still have a vivid picture in my mind of the people’s dull, spiritless eyes."
"Today I can say that Albania is changing."
"I had the opportunity to visit the country just a few months ago and found an extraordinary will to be free;"
"I met countless young students at Tirana University who, first and foremost, love their country."
"There is also an obvious desire for Europe, especially among the younger generation: they have a need, a desire and a conviction that they want to belong to a wider family, closing once and for all a chapter of history in which Albania was isolated from Europe and the world."
"I believe that Albania, the country of eagles, is an organic part of Europe, and not just geographically. We have a specific duty to continue to encourage the current process of democracy building and, more generally, to implement interactions and tangible cooperation with the Community institutions."
"Mr President, it is a good omen that it should be today that we adopt the agreement with Albania, since it was on this day that Franz Josef Strauß was born."
"It was he who, by travelling there as a private citizen, was the first Western politician to break through Albania’s isolation."
"Anyone who remembers those days and the things then to be seen in Albania, and who has since revisited that country on many occasions will know what a tremendous journey Albania can look back on."
"No other country in Europe has, in modern times, been so oppressed and isolated and endured such persecution, whether for the sake of religion or of intellectual freedom, even though its people played a vital part in the cultural history of medieval Europe, including among their own number Skanderbeg, the last great European to fight for freedom from the Ottomans, and also – with the League of Prizren – in that of the 19th and 20th centuries, only to be betrayed by Europe at the Congress of Berlin – in other words, a country that was among the first victims not only of Fascism but also of Communism, and which is only now beginning to return to its place at the European table."
"So, then, no matter how justified our criticisms and irrespective of the need to reinforce democracy and the rule of law, we have to acknowledge that no European people in recent history has had such a tough time of it as it found its way to European structures, and that is why it needs all the solidarity we can offer."
"I am not talking here only about the state, but about the infrastructure as well; this is a country that needs massive support from us in building roads, in establishing cross-border links with Kosovo, and in connecting up to energy supplies."
"Kosovo will, in the long term, become less one-sidedly dependent on Belgrade if it is able to cooperate and communicate appropriately across the borders with its Albanian and Montenegrin neighbours."
"Overcoming the isolation to which this country was brutally subject will be a substantial task for a generation, if not for more than one of them, and I can do no other than marvel at the courage with which the government under Sali Berisha has got to grips with it."
"I am quite sure that Prime Minister Berisha has learned much from the mistakes that were made in the past, and that his approach to things is a quite different one."
"However necessary criticism might be, we are perfectly justified in taking a somewhat optimistic view of things and giving this country the backwind that it deserves on the grounds not only of its tragic history, but also of its potential, which, economically speaking, is considerable, for it is a young country with a young population, speaking many languages and with a new outlook, who are determined to accept a challenge sadly denied to their ancestors."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that, despite some of the criticisms that we have heard today, the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Albania is good news; it is good news for Albania, good news for Southeast Asia and of course good news for the whole of the EU."
"I am convinced that the Agreement will help strengthen the process of political, economic and institutional stabilisation in Albania and will help strengthen civil society, the process of democratisation and public administration reforms."
"Something that I consider very significant is the emphasis placed by the Agreement on developing regional cooperation, and I should like to focus on this point for a couple of minutes."
"The main aspects of this cooperation should be to strengthen political dialogue with all of Albania’s neighbours and also to create a free trade area in Southeast Asia."
"The experience of the Central European countries that joined the Central European Free Trade Agreement demonstrated that it was precisely this free trade area that, to a large extent, helped pave the way for those countries to join the EU."
"A further important aspect of this kind of regional cooperation is the gradual introduction of fundamental EU freedoms, including the free movement of capital, services, goods and of course persons."
"The introduction of such freedoms should significantly strengthen overall cooperation across the region, including cooperation between Albania and the aforementioned Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia."
"For these reasons, I warmly welcome the fact that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement explicitly states that Albania’s readiness to conclude agreements of this nature with its neighbours will be one of the conditions for further developing relations between Albania and the EU."
"– Perhaps I did not hear correctly but I am sure that Albania is in the Balkans, rather than in Southeast Asia."
"I must say that the mind boggles sometimes when I read Parliament’s motions for resolutions."
"Generally, I agree that the most important thing is for all Balkan countries to have the opportunity to conclude agreements with the EU."
"Concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement is the first step."
"It is wonderful that three years ago, in June 2003, the Thessaloniki European Council consolidated Europe’s position on Albania."
"I am not entirely sure whether the progress achieved is comparable with other countries in the region."
"There has been no review of the efficiency of the state, no assessment of economic development, of the situation at the borders or of the building of genuine economic and political structures."
"It is clear that, in comparison with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania is a stable country."
"Comparison with Macedonia is similarly favourable."
"I am of course not sure whether highly porous borders, large-scale migration and problems with law enforcement, together with specific difficulties in foreign trade and a near collapse in energy supplies are even partially acceptable for a country aspiring to sign an EU Association Agreement."
"I advocate the provision of more EU aid for developing the legal system, in the broadest sense of the term, including practical action on the customs and finance police, which will contribute to stabilising the legal system."
"Given that my group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, supports bringing Balkan countries closer to the EU, we shall be supporting the motion, despite the aforementioned reservations regarding Albania’s level of preparedness in respect of signing the proposed Agreement."
"– Mr President, when at a Foreign Affairs Committee session two years ago I mentioned that some Albanians were dreaming of a ‘Greater Albania’, the majority of politicians at the time had no idea what I was talking about."
"However, a couple of months ago, the Albanian foreign minister referred to this idea and at the end of August the political adviser to the Albanian prime minister stated that, by 2013, all Albanians living in the Balkans should integrate within the borders of a ‘natural Albania’, as he defined it."
"In his view, Macedonia first needs to be partitioned and the parts inhabited by an Albanian majority should be merged with Albania (every fourth Macedonian citizen is Albanian)."
"Assertions of this kind are impossible to ignore and ultimately beg the question: what will recognising Kosovo’s independence lead to?"
"Is it not a step towards incorporating the region into that ‘Greater Albania’?"
"I was an observer at the most recent parliamentary elections in Albania."
"They were not one hundred percent fault-free, but we must acknowledge the progress the Albanians have made towards democracy."
"– Mr President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania is both a creative coincidence of the will of the country in question for a more intense European orientation and the will of the European Union and its Member States for the fuller integration of Albania into the European structures."
"The agreement in question extends the European plan for security, stability, democracy, the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights to the area of the Western Balkans; a plan of good governance, respect for minority rights and the consistent cultivation of good neighbourly relations, a plan of economic reform, development and the modernisation of infrastructures, open to cross-border cooperation and to regional, economic and political integration."
"The motion for a resolution by the European Parliament formulates the facts, listing the shortcomings and describing the prospects."
"The challenge of the somewhat new dynamic relations between the European Union and Albania consists in the gradual qualitative adaptation of Albania to the of principles, values, rules and conduct."
"It also consists in strengthening public institutions, more intense technocratic efficiency and definitively bridging the confidence gap between agents with reforming intentions and the citizens of Albania."
"Lastly, the challenge consists in bridging the gap between formal acceptance and real application of the ."
"Within the framework of the required adjustment, administrative, police and judicial modernisation in order to combat organised crime and corruption, the greatest possible participation of civil society in the political process and the establishment of viable and transparent mechanisms for the operation of the market economy are vying for first place."
"My thoughts move in the direction laid down by Mrs Pack and Mr Posselt but, adding a spirit of good neighbourly relations, we support the new framework of relations between the European Union and Albania and anticipate faster rates of adjustment."
"The benefits which are expected to emerge both for the Albanian people and for the Union itself are obvious."
"All that is needed is the consistent and effective commitment of Albania to its European prospects."
"As a deviation, an from the debate on the subject of Albania and link with the previous debate on Kosovo, I should like to put a clear question to Commissioner Rehn, the guardian of Community legality, as a member of the Commission:"
"There is the recognised principle of respect for human rights."
"A recognised principle, under international law, is also territorial sovereignty."
"Can you tell me what the ratio, the weighting is between these two principles?"
"I would like to thank Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves for his thorough and detailed report."
"The path of Albania towards the European Union is probably the rockiest one in comparison with other countries of the continent."
"The 20th century was not kind to the country, which was at the very bottom in terms of many economic and social indicators even before World War II."
"Later, the term ‘Albanianisation’ emerged as a synonym for the isolationist policy that was enforced by the then regime and that was also associated with under-development."
"The scars of Albanian isolation from the world are still much deeper than in any other post-Communist state."
"Today, Albania, just as other Western Balkan countries, is attracted by the magnetism of the European Union."
"Namely this attraction is accelerating reforms, strengthening democracy and human rights, and thus improving the lives of citizens."
"However, during my visit to Albania I noticed the crackling tension between the majority and the opposition, targeted not at competition but rather at the desire to destroy each other."
"They easily promise half of the state budget to combat corruption and crime, but no specific results have yet materialised."
"Regional cooperation to overcome the ghosts of the past should be the area where Albania demonstrates the flexibility and European character of its foreign policy."
"The decisive stages of negotiations concerning the status of Kosovo will become a litmus test revealing Tirana’s constructive position or the very opposite."
"I have no doubt that this will also determine whether Albania is mature enough for EU membership, which in any case is still far off."
"The implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and sharing the experience of the states which were successful in approaching and joining the European Union, should help Albania reach a decisive turn on the path towards Europe."
"Mr President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania was concluded in June."
"In theory, this means a first step towards accession to the European Union."
"For many years, that country was weighed down by the most backward and dictatorial form of Communism."
"It is, therefore, in itself, a good thing that Albania is being integrated in the large European family."
"There are, however, instruments for doing this other than EU membership, and the first instrument that springs to mind is European neighbourhood policy."
"Albania is facing enormous problems."
"Economic problems, of course, and I would, for example, draw your attention to the fact that no less than 60% of the active population are employed in the agricultural sector."
"There is the problem of organised crime, people-trafficking and the drugs trade."
"There is also the problem of the existence of Al-Qaeda cells in Albania."
"In a predominantly Islamic country such as Albania, we also notice unacceptable practices, including bloodfeuds."
"The EU’s absorption capacity is something we have recently discussed more and more, with good reason."
"As it happens, there is certainly no support structure in place for the accession of a country such as Albania, not now nor in 15 or 20 years, and so it is better that we do not give the Albanians expectations which we in the European Union cannot deliver upon."
"Moreover, according to the most recent readings of the Euro barometer, the public opposition to Albania’s possible accession is about the same as it is to Turkey’s."
"It will therefore not be the first time that public opinion in Europe appears to have more common sense than those responsible for making policy."
"– Mr President, I have no doubt personally that Albania must have European prospects."
"It is positive both for this country and for the area of the Balkans and southeast Europe as a whole."
"If we isolate Albania, we condemn it to remain a state in which and from which crime and corruption flourish and are exported."
"I do not think that such a policy is to anyone's benefit."
"On the contrary, through a policy of rapprochement and through the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, we are giving Albania incentives to move in the direction of respect for human rights, economic reform and stronger rule of law and democratic institutions."
"It is true that, over recent years, despite the obstacles and difficulties, Albania has, generally speaking, moved forward."
"That is why we are signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in question."
"Nonetheless, it is also true that, at the same time, there are a great many problems in this country."
"My honourable friends have already referred to corruption, to problems in relation to the freedom of the press and to the way in which electoral rolls and so forth are prepared."
"I, for my part, wish to comment on three individual issues which I consider to be of crucial importance and I believe that, with cooperation in particular between the European Commission and Albania, they can be overcome and resolved."
"The first is compliance on the part of Albania with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of National Minorities."
"Progress has been already been made on setting up a state minorities committee, on granting permission, for example, to set up a private Greco-Albanian school in Himara and so forth."
"However, other issues remain, Commissioner, such as the translation of legislation into minority languages, the signposting of local traditional names, an increase in personnel dealing with minority issues and so forth."
"I believe that the Commission must concern itself directly with these issues and to record them objectively in its annual report published in October."
"The second issue concerns the census of the population, an objective census of the population which will adequately record the size of the minorities and not give rise to doubts as to its accuracy."
"The third issue that I wish to emphasise is the restoration of and compensation for property because, even though the law on this issue was passed back in 2004, there is a problem of lack of transparency, abuse and procedural irregularities."
"In the area of Himara in particular, there is the serious issue of the property of the Greek minority."
"Consequently, emphasising again that I believe in the European prospects of Albania and voting for this agreement, I believe that the time has come to move from theory to practice."
"It is the responsibility of the European Commission to put what is contained in the text into practice with pressure on and cooperation with the Albanian authorities."
"– Mr President, representatives of the Commission and Council, ladies and gentlemen, the Council decision on the EU-Albania agreement is a highly positive step."
"I congratulate Mr Ilves and believe that the agreement will allow us to develop more direct political relations with Albania, with a view to achieving a free trade zone; the movement of workers, capital and services; freedom of establishment; and, in future, the lasting stabilisation of south eastern Europe as an area of peace, democracy and security."
"With this agreement we are calling on Albania to bring its legislation more into line with that of the European Union, not only in sectors such as the internal market, but also as regards justice, security and respect for rights."
"It is precisely because of this agreement that Albania has made significant progress and is now, in my opinion, more likely to overcome the numerous problems that still remain in that country regarding electoral law and media freedom, as well as on the corruption and organised crime front."
"For our part, this agreement falls within a broader perspective, relating above all to the launch of a Euro-Adriatic strategy that should include the resumption of infrastructure projects such as corridor 8 and, more generally, the pursuit of the goal and historic mission of EU enlargement."
"In strategic terms, the project to unify the continent according to the principles of democracy, peace and development must include Albania and the Balkans as leading players in the new Europe."
"– Mr President, representatives of the Council, I would like to draw your attention to Chapter 7, which deals with justice, freedom and security, since the rule of law, civil liberties and internal security are quite simply essential to a country’s security, and economic investment – which results in economic development and also social security – is dependent on them being present."
"Development in Albania has followed a similar path to that in other states undergoing transformation."
"The structures of organised crime were established more speedily and efficiently than those of the state, and the effects of that are being felt all over Europe."
"Albania is a country of origin for international criminal organisations dealing in drugs, trafficking in people, laundering money and thereby funding terror, and it is also through Albania that such organisations pass; that being the case, and in view of the fact that we suffer the effects, joint engagement with Albania is in the interests of both parties."
"Having seen it for myself, I can tell the House that Mr Berisha’s government is getting stuck in by prioritising an internal security programme and making use of its cooperative arrangements with Europe, for example in police projects with PAMECA (Police Assistance Mission of the EU to Albania), in customs and justice projects at parliamentary level, and, in particular, of the support given by the Stability Pact for South-Eastern Europe under its special coordinator Erhard Busek."
"There has been tangible progress, but the problems – and the challenges – are still enormous."
"This stabilisation and association agreement is, for Albania, a milestone as it progresses towards European standards; the message it sends out is not only political, but also signifies practical help and cooperation."
"It is now for Albania to put into discharge in full the obligations of this agreement."
"I hope that it will use this opportunity to improve its legal system, to train judges and prosecutors, to improve law enforcement and the prosecution of crime, the control of borders at sea and on land and cooperation between police forces."
"I also hope that there will be enhanced cooperation between the EU and South-Eastern Europe, and I would particularly like to see Albania playing its part in developing the SECI Centre in Bucharest, which is a base for cooperation between police forces that could be the seedbed for something like a South-East European version of Europol and present an opportunity for combating organised crime."
"Agreements, and the implementing of agreements, represent both a major challenge and an opportunity, not only to Albania, but also to us, to the European Union as a whole."
"– Mr President, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States and the Republic of Albania is a major achievement by the European Union on the road to the integration of the Western Balkans with the European Union."
"Albania, with its population of three-and-a-half million Muslims in the centre of the European continent is an important bridge for building a future Europe based on intermingling of cultures and tolerance for different religious traditions and civilisations."
"The EU Agreement gives Albania the opportunity to modernise, to build a lasting democracy, and for economic reform."
"A direct benefit will be the creation of a free trade zone, the rule of law and a functioning market economy."
"The present stage of relations between the European Union and Albania have set the political elite and Albanian civil society new tasks and perspectives."
"There are three problems I would like to draw your attention to:"
"Firstly there is the question of dealing with nationalism, and the strategic political attempts appealing for a Greater Albania in other countries of the Western Balkans which have been addressed to the Albanian population."
"Albania now needs to re-direct its national interests towards European integration and peaceful co-existence within the European community, and to reflect on its own history and its role in the modern world."
"It needs to travel the road that other European nations have travelled in the last fifty years."
"The second issue is the rule of law, combating organised crime, and increasing the level of democracy."
"Albania has to ensure that the rights of national, ethnic and religious minorities are respected."
"The third problem is women’s rights."
"There needs to be an effective policy guaranteeing women safety and equality."
"There must be an end to violence against women in the family, and to eliminate the negative phenomena which Amnesty International referred to in its report of 30 March this year."
"– I too would like to join my colleagues in welcoming with pleasure the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania."
"By means of this Agreement, Albania will be sealing its future in Europe."
"I am convinced that, following Albania’s ending of its political isolation years ago, this agreement will now allow it to make rapid progress, both economically and socially, and that it will do this from a European perspective."
"However, the journey will not be an easy one."
"As indicated in the European partnership adopted by the Council with Albania earlier this year, Albania has several objectives to meet, both in the short-term and over a number of years."
"It must be clear that a global and courageous reform is required in the country, so that these objectives can be achieved; a root and branch reform, so to speak, in several sectors, in particular with regard to the administrative capacity of Albania’s public administration."
"Greater progress is required with regard to the civil rights of the Albanian people and in the justice sector."
"To change a country and a society in this way is certainly not easy, but neither is it impossible."
"My country, Malta, also went through a similar change."
"Over a period spanning almost twenty years it has undergone a phenomenal transformation."
"However, the difficult road we embarked upon enabled us to meet the Copenhagen criteria, thus allowing us to join the European family within the European Union, just as many other countries did."
"Albania should look upon this Agreement as an extremely important step which will lead it to its natural home, that is, to membership of the European Union."
"Today this Parliament should send a clear message to the Albanian people, the message that the European Parliament is closely following the developments affecting the Albanian people and that they can count on our support and good will."
"– Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I welcome the conclusion of this stabilisation and association agreement between Albania and the European Union."
"It is without a doubt in the interests of the European Union that it should help countries such as Albania to achieve greater political, social and economic stability, and we must not, while doing this, overlook the fact that, since Albania borders on Greece, which is an EU Member State, any attempt to bring Albania closer to the EU is the most obvious thing in the world."
"Despite the reforms already implemented, there are still great challenges ahead for the Albanian economy, in which agriculture and related sectors play a considerable part, still accounting for a significant share – 24% – of the gross domestic product."
"Many Albanians live from subsistence farming and only a few products are exported."
"Many farms do not produce enough to be competitive."
"It is for that reason that it is very important that the standards for veterinary checks, pesticides, labelling and the registration of animals applicable to products intended for export should be improved and complied with."
"It follows that anything that can be done to help promote the development of agriculture and of rural areas is to be supported, with particular attention also needing to be given to structural change and the problems posed by people moving away from rural areas."
"Finally, I would like to say that I regard the stabilisation and association agreement as an appropriate instrument for drawing countries such as Albania closer to the European Union and to its values."
"Office."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I am very glad that there is strong and broad commitment within all the Union’s institutions, including Parliament, to the Western Balkans’ European perspective."
"One of the main practical measures connected with strengthening this perspective is obviously visa flexibility, and we support the aim to have the mandates for talks on a visa flexibility agreement adopted by the Council during the last six months of this year and for these talks to be concluded with all the countries in the Western Balkans some time next year."
"As has been said often in this debate, much has been done in Albania to strengthen its European perspective, but there is still a lot to be done."
"It is one thing to draft legislation, but it is quite another to implement it, not to speak of cultural change, which normally takes even longer."
"It has to be said once again that the Council is expecting Albania to step up measures, especially with regard to promoting freedom of the media, the return of property and compensation being paid, improved administration, the protection of minorities, and ensuring that local elections are held in accordance with international norms."
"Change, which Albania has already experienced and will experience again, is not easy, and that means that a lot of work needs to be done."
"It is mainly Albania which holds the keys to the solution."
"."
"Mr President, I believe that there is broad agreement in this House on how welcome this new step is for Albania and for our policy on the Western Balkans."
"It is true that more resolute and determined reform efforts must be undertaken by Albania, as well as efforts to build up properly functioning institutions and a democratic culture."
"I agree with the rapporteur, Mr Ilves, that this provides Albania with a golden opportunity to reform the country in line with the rule of law and all democratic principles."
"Like Mrs Pack, I also noted the tense situation in the country over the summer and the parliamentary boycott by the opposition."
"I am, however, pleased that a new political agreement was reached last week, reflecting a new consensus on media and electoral reform."
"I take this as a sign of the increased maturity of Albania’s political culture, and this must be pursued further in the future."
"I was asked what the Commission’s position is on the progress in electoral reform in Albania."
"The Commission has underlined, both to the Government and to the opposition, the need to restart discussions without delay in the Ad Hoc Parliamentary Committee on Electoral Reform."
"We have reiterated that reform discussions should take into account the recommendations of the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, following last year’s parliamentary election."
"I agree fully with Mr Hatzidakis that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement helps us to coach the country towards European standards as regards electoral reform."
"There is also a question about the magnetism of the European Union and what our view is of any possible application for membership from Albania."
"On behalf of the Commission and the Union, I have made it clear to Albania’s political leadership and to the general public of that country that a sustained track record of successful implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, as well as a tangible track record of reforms and their implementation on the ground, must be established over time before any consideration of further formal steps towards the European Union is possible."
"Implementation, implementation and implementation should be the name of the game in Albania now as regards its European aspirations."
"This concerns especially the need to fight organised crime and corruption."
"The Government of Albania has demonstrated a strong will to make serious progress in that field."
"Efforts have to be sustained and in such a way that they do not violate democratic and fundamental rights."
"The Commission will report on Albania’s progress in the context of this year’s enlargement package in October or November."
"I am very glad that the European Parliament has invested a lot of time and energy in monitoring and pursuing political dialogue with Albania."
"I am sure that together we can achieve positive results in terms of coaching Albania towards its European future."
"I fully agree with the Members who have underlined the importance of visa facilitation for the countries of the Western Balkans, including Albania."
"The Commission made its proposals for the negotiating mandates for the Western Balkans on visa facilitation in July."
"I am very glad that the Finnish Presidency intends to secure the adoption of those mandates before the end of this year."
"Albania already has a readmission agreement in place, so I sincerely hope that a visa facilitation agreement can be negotiated swiftly and then soon implemented."
"It would be good for civil society and business – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – and for students, researchers and all citizens."
"It would contribute to the Europeanisation of Albanian civil society, which is our common goal."
"– I should like to advise you that written declaration 38/2006 by Carl Schlyter, Paulo Casaca, Karl-Heinz Florenz, Mojca Drčar Murko and Caroline Lucas on banning seal products in the European Union has been signed by the majority of Parliament's component Members."
"Consequently, in accordance with Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure, it will be forwarded to its addressees and published in the minutes of the sitting of 26 September 2006."
"Mr President, this spring I went with a group of European journalists to follow the seal hunt."
"Our car was run off the road, our helicopter was grounded and we were forced to remain in our hotel by an angry mob."
"Despite all this we managed to witness the cruel hunting of very young seal pups which left many suffering on the ice."
"Climate change and the receding ice threaten their survival because they need ice cover for their nursing."
"Europe is the main market for seal products."
"I thank with all my heart all the colleagues who signed this resolution."
"The last time the EU made a reduction in its market for seal products, in the 1980s, it led to a virtual closing-down of the hunt."
"This demand is an extension of the ban and will finally give eco-tourism the chance to replace mass slaughter."
"I urge the Commission to propose legislation as quickly as possible in order to scale back next year's hunt, which will start in March."
"I thank all of you very much."
"– The next item is the vote."
". – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it can be said that this is genuinely a report that is full of new developments."
"I should like to point out to you that all of the amendments in the report were unanimously adopted at our sitting in June, that we consider data protection to be closely connected with the VIS and the SIS II, and that we therefore need this instrument quickly."
"We had a moral obligation from the Council."
"The Finnish Presidency is calling on us to deal with this issue as part of the debate on the future of the area of freedom, security and justice, as provided for at the second September part-session."
"With data protection being, as it is, a political priority for our Parliament, I should like the Council to make a formal commitment before our Assembly to swiftly adopt the framework decision and to do everything in its power to involve Parliament in the debates."
"That is why I am calling on my fellow Members to kindly postpone the vote on this legislative resolution until the next part-session in September."
"– Mr President, there are not only people with severe psychotic disorders in the European Union, but also people with a number of psychological disorders."
"I should therefore like to move the following oral amendment to paragraph 48 so that it would read ‘... believes that the term “treatment” should be interpreted broadly, including the psychotherapy conducted by fully qualified specialists ...’."
"It does not change much but it adds something that reflects what we face in our societies."
". – Mr President, that is acceptable."
"Mr President, I should just like to move a short oral amendment to Amendments 11 and 12."
"In each amendment, before the words ‘the new Member States’, the words ‘some of’ should be inserted, so that the text reads: ‘in some of the new Member States’."
"The aim is to be factually correct, since what is being referred to in the two amendments does not concern all of the Member States, just some of them."
". – Mr President, that is also acceptable."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, we face the third vote on the Budget Regulation within the space of six months, and, in order that no time be wasted, I ask you to vote a rapid response from this House to the Council, which I am asking – indeed, urging – to at last enter into dialogue with this House on the subject of the Budget Regulation."
"We have left it late enough as it is, and only if we embark upon it now can the Budget enter into force by the required deadline at the end of this year."
"Only if it does that will the multiannual programmes and their implementing provisions be able to benefit from the simplified procedures in the new Budget Regulation."
"By its delaying tactics, the Council is making it less likely that it will be possible to draw on grant funds promptly and complete grant-making procedures more simply and without delay."
"I ask that negotiations be commenced."
"– That concludes the vote."
". I voted in favour of this report on the Fisheries Agreement between the EC and the Union of the Comoros."
"The last time we voted on this subject some years ago I inserted an amendment asking for joint action between the EC and the Union of the Comoros to protect that ‘fish out of time’, the Coelacanth, which, although thought to have been extinct for tens of millions of years, was rediscovered in deep water off the Comoros in the 1940s."
"As far as I am aware, little was done."
"I hope this time around real attempts will be made to protect this unique remnant of the world’s deep time."
". I voted in favour of this report on the conclusion of the Partnership Agreement between the Union of the Comoros and the European Community."
"The Agreement forms part of the new partnership approach to the external dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy, which the EU is seeking to implement. The objective of the Agreement is to develop and improve fishing conditions in the Union of the Comoros, which should benefit from part of the funding granted by the EU for the purpose of providing new infrastructure and technology that is better equipped for the sustainable management of the country’s fisheries resources."
"For its part, the EU will guarantee, in another third country, fishing opportunities that will help keep its long-distance fishing fleet operational."
"One sour note is the fact that only now is Parliament being called on to deliver its opinion on the legislative proposal on this Agreement, when the annexed protocol relating thereto was adopted by Parliament itself in October 2005 as part of a separate procedure."
". In light of the conclusions of the July 2004 Council on the new approach to international fisheries agreements, there is a need to retrieve formulas that have disappeared, such as the inexplicably removed joint enterprise scheme, which enjoyed great success in developing the fishing economies of various countries."
"Accordingly, it has become essential to adapt the current agreements to the philosophy adopted and enshrined in the conclusions of the 2004 Fisheries Council."
"One of the factors that I believe is vital to the success of these new agreements is greater involvement of the authorities of third countries in more environment-focused monitoring of their resources."
"I therefore believe that this report should be adopted. That way, the principles enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy will be upheld."
". Mr President, these fisheries agreements do little more than export our own disastrous policies to the developing world."
"They are only justifiable in the looking glass world of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy which has done so much damage to fishing communities, fish stocks and the wider environment within our own waters."
"Accordingly I have voted against this report."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we voted for the Ilves report on the stabilisation agreement between the European Union and Albania and believe that only greater integration, and even the urgent incorporation of Albania into the European Union, will be the best response to the problems of the Balkans and also, of course, those of Albania."
"The events that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s should have taught us that the self-interest of nation states is never part of the solution."
"After Kosovo, the Cham issue is the last major national issue concerning Albanian-speaking peoples. On the Cham question, as in the case of Kosovo, we radicals are among the first in this Chamber to denounce the violation of that people’s rights."
"This agreement lays the foundations for a dialogue about the cultural rights of Chams living in Greece and the return of their property; this dialogue must not be based solely on the idea of a confrontation between opposing national interests, but rather on the involvement of Europe and international institutions."
"Mr President, corruption, nineteenth-century mafia practices, Islamism ... today, Albania is still suffering the after effects of 50 years of Stalinist dictatorship."
"Not in any way is it ready to join the European Union, even though, unlike Turkey for example, it does, of course, historically speaking, belong to the European civilisation community."
"Sound neighbourhood policy should, however, be sufficient to cultivate this historical European tie."
"This neighbourhood policy should also be sufficient to address the enormous problems which that country is facing and which rule out any prospect of joining the EU."
"We should therefore not foster any false expectations among the Albanians."
"Accordingly, I have voted against this resolution on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Albania, on the grounds that it represents a first step – and let us not labour under any misconceptions here – towards Albanian accession, and Europe, as in the case of Turkey, chooses to ignore the opinion of its public."
"In spite of its sound references to a social economy, this report, which appears to extol growth, unfortunately has a preponderance of negative features."
"The public propaganda campaigns it proposes for selling the message that the world community is in need of reform are out of keeping with the times, as are the demands for a more extensive internal market in pursuit of unsustainable growth."
"There are references identifying the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe as a means of strengthening social Europe, when the draft Constitution, on the contrary, entailed further steps towards the neo-liberal internal market and military rearmament."
"In this way, voters are being lied to."
"– Mr President, the MEPs from the Czech Civil Democratic Party have voted against the report on a European social model for the future."
"The report correctly points out that there is no genuine European social model, and yet, significantly, it describes a series of values that we jointly recognise and sets out the problems that each country must resolve in its social policy."
"The report is a good starting point for future debate, but we do not support the solution that it puts forward."
"We do not agree with the report’s backing for the proposed European Constitution, which has now been rejected."
"In our view, the report will lead to restrictions on competition in the social and tax fields, and to a loss of Member State sovereignty over these areas."
"Mr President, I voted against the Peneda/De Rossa report on the grounds that the European Social Model is an achievable proposition only if the number of the unemployed and of those living below the poverty line is reduced."
"What we need to do, , is to take long-term action to address the problems of dismantled social services and of wage dumping, and, in particular, to become clear in our own minds about the fact that a social model cannot be founded upon part-time working and subsistence wages, which is why we need more people in full-time employment and high minimum standards across Europe."
"It is the states in which social security provides a strong safety net – of which Austria is one – that are reaching the limits of their financial viability, and that is why it is vital in terms of the survival of the social model and of any country’s workforce that the transitional periods for the labour market, for workers from the new eastern Member States, be strictly adhered to."
"– I voted for the report by my colleagues Mr Silva Peneda and Mr De Rossa on the European Social Model, because it is crucial that our fellow citizens understand that European integration provides our ambitions to build a humanist civilisation with a social dimension."
"Clearly, work remains to be done on the coherence of our sustainable development model bringing together economic growth, social ambition and respect for the environment."
"This report outlines some very promising initiatives which I support, while being satisfied that, in its wisdom, the European Parliament has rejected the proposal to legislate on services of general interest, since at present it is clear that the time is not right for such a step."
"I sincerely believe that a fair and balanced social model is a key element of the Union’s economic performance, while, on the other hand, over-emphasis on social policy will destroy economic growth and will in time be counter-productive, as there will be insufficient means to finance social measures."
"In this matter, let us be clear about the use that we will make of the European Union, and let us not hide the reality from our fellow citizens, and from young people in particular."
". There are many points Conservative MEPs oppose in this report, such as references to tax coordination and to the Constitution which is why I requested separate roll-calls on these paragraphs to make our position crystal clear."
"It would have been easy to vote against the whole report because of these points alone."
"However on the plus-side, we had worked hard to include references to the Lisbon Agenda, the completion of the internal market, and the involvement of national parliaments: this is the first time that such points have been accepted within such a social affairs report."
"The key to our final vote was the need for reform."
"My Amendment 1 spelled this out specifically and was readily embraced by colleagues within the EPP-ED Group."
"In return for our agreement to abstain at the end rather than voting against, the Socialists agreed to let this amendment pass."
"The prize has been formal recognition for the very first time by the majority of MEPs that the European social model does indeed need to be reformed."
"This is a real achievement, led by the UK Conservatives."
"The challenge now is for us to work together to make this happen."
". We are very disappointed that, once again, those who talk such a great deal about a decent European social model have actually adopted a report that, in reality, gives the go-ahead for, and legitimises, a process already under way in a number of Member States, namely the dismantling of high social standards, the scaling back of the rights of the workers and the people to a public, universal and high-quality social security system, and the erosion of universal access to high-quality public services, in areas such as health, education and housing."
"We regret the rejection of the amendments that we tabled, in which we registered our deeply held belief that a State with sound social protection based on high environmental, social and labour standards and characterised by progressive taxation and the redistribution of the income and wealth generated is conducive to good economic performance."
"We also regret the rejection of our proposal for a macroeconomic framework to support sustainable development, with stronger internal demand that is environmentally friendly and compatible with full employment, in such a way as to deliver economic and social cohesion."
"We therefore voted against the report."
"In this report, the rapporteurs propose a host of measures that should be taken in order to solve problems relating to employment and social policy."
"Parts of these proposals may be commendable in themselves, but we in the June List are emphatic in stressing that, in our view, the political areas dealt with by the report should fall exclusively within the competence of the Member States."
"I reject references to the Constitution, perspectives on the Member States’ tax systems, views on pension reforms and lectures on the action Member States should take in order to achieve increased prosperity."
"I share the view in recital N that the Member States should have competence when it comes to funding services of general interest and to taking decisions in this area, but I was forced to vote against this recital because of the reference to the Constitution."
"I have thus voted against the report as a whole."
". The Verts/ALE Group supported the final report today on the European social model not because the report is perfect but because it sets down an important marker for Parliament on the importance of the social dimension of EU development."
"We regret the continuing emphasis on economic growth without regard to the quality and effect of that growth."
"The Lisbon process is, for my Group, not the only way forward as it takes insufficient account of the importance of the social dimension in its widest sense – it is not only about employment but about the voluntary and social part of our lives."
"We regret that the Framework Directive for Services of General Interest did not gain majority support: we do need to find a way to differentiate core essential services provided for the public good from the services we choose as individuals."
"However, the report recognises the need for any reform of social systems to be non-regressive and to meet essential needs: a core income is essential to that goal."
"We hope that this report will be a valuable tool in our discussions with the Council and Commission and that other legislation will protect, not undermine, social Europe."
". – For a long time, Western Europe constituted a model of economic and social success, based on thriving agriculture, powerful industry, dynamic and homogeneous peoples, and solid nation-states that guaranteed their nationals both free enterprise and social protection."
"For twenty years, the Europe of Brussels without borders, in collusion with our governments, has been abandoning our industries to competition from the Asian economies, which practice social dumping, letting in more than a million non-European immigrants each year, practising a genuine form of Malthusianism against our farmers and dismantling our social protection systems and our family policies."
"We are talking here about widespread social regression, with more than 20 million people unemployed, industrial disintegration, hundreds of thousands of hectares left fallow, European countries in which the death rate is higher than the birth rate and entire regions that are being fragmented."
"That is a summary of this Europe that the people of France and the Netherlands rejected last year during the referendums on the European Constitution."
"Only a Europe of nations, based on the principles that made our civilisation great – the nation, the family and freedom – will enable our continent once again to constitute a social model."
". In voting for the De Rossa and Silva Peneda report on a European social model for the future, Labour MEPs are expressing support for social and economic policies which generate employment, productivity and fairness at work."
"Labour MEPs analyse each legislative proposal on a case-by-case basis in relation to their impact on UK business and the workforce."
"Nothing in our voting for the De Rossa report runs counter to this approach."
"Specifically, Labour MEPs believe firmly that taxation policy is a matter for individual Member States and we have voted accordingly in the De Rossa and Silva Peneda report."
"The European social model is in need of reform. The question, though, is how to reform something that is virtually ‘emblematic’ of today’s Europe."
"The answer is: without fear."
"We must become more competitive and help to improve our citizens' quality of life."
"We must not flinch, therefore, when it comes to taking decisions aimed at improving our citizens’ lives."
"There is no doubt in my mind that one of the most effective measures will be the completion of the internal market."
"We must comply with Lisbon to ensure economic coordination measures and employment and social protection policies, which will, in turn, deliver economic growth, increased competitiveness and the creation of more and better jobs, in a sustainable fashion."
"Much remains to be done, both here and in our capital cities."
"It is not enough merely to announce reforms and to promise more jobs."
"It is not enough merely to talk among ourselves."
"We must achieve our targets on employment, education and training."
"A new culture is needed, information must be exchanged, the effectiveness of companies and training must be maximised and a qualified workforce must be made available if we are finally to be able to uphold the social values of solidarity and social justice in Europe."
". The European social model is unique."
"In the EU we can balance the single market with social justice."
"We must do all that we can to keep this balance."
". – The Greek Communist Party voted against the report on the European social model, the product of the agreement between the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the social democrats, reveals in the most cynical manner the nightmarish future being prepared by euro-unifying capital for the workers."
"The political and ideological mouthpieces of capital are developing a huge propaganda campaign, using the problem of unemployment and brandishing threats about demographic ageing and the risk of collapse of social insurance systems in order to present the 'reform' of existing social protection systems as an urgent necessity."
"The promotion of capitalist restructurings, within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, calls for the complete dismantling of all the rights (which, of course, were also below the level of grassroots needs) won by the workers through the fight of the workers' movement and pressure from the existence of the socialist camp."
"Thus, the greatest possible exploitation of the working class is being promoted through the full deconstruction of employment relations and the spread of flexible forms of employment, the dismantling of pension, healthcare, welfare and social protection systems (unemployment protection, maternity protection, housing and so on) and the abolition of free state public services."
"The only thing that will remain in place will be the lowest possible level of protection from absolute impoverishment, in order to avoid social uprisings."
"– Mr President, I also voted against the Bowis report, my reason for doing so being that we really should not be surprised at the increase in mental illness."
"People are under constantly increasing pressure at work and at school, and this stress means that we do not perform at our full capacity."
"Improved psychoactive medications can at best address the symptoms but not the causes."
"It will be more helpful to build up European people’s feelings of self-worth by communicating to them our authentic, real and Christian fundamental values."
"That those who have deep roots in family-mindedness, patriotism and their national identity are less prone to mental illness is not a matter of doubt."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted for the report on acknowledging the importance of mental illness in Europe, the rapporteur of which is my friend John Bowis, who alone has ensured that this important topic will be addressed in the best possible manner."
"Mr Bowis’s fame has spread throughout Europe."
"An admirer of his by the name of Silvana Moggi has come from Italy, specifically from the town of Salsomaggiore (the town where Miss Italy was elected), to be here in the gallery because she wanted to be present when her great idol John Bowis presented his extremely important proposal for debate, so that all of us in Europe can be treated in the best possible way even when we have the misfortune of having mental illnesses and not just physical illnesses."
"I voted in favour of the excellent report by Mr Bowis on the motion for a resolution of the European Parliament – towards a strategy on mental health for the European Union."
"One out of every four people will suffer from a mental health problem during their life."
"Physical and mental weaknesses increase with age, and this is linked to longer life expectancies."
"In a world which is becoming more complicated under pressure from enormous, dramatic and rapid changes, we are faced with the collective challenge to understand, prevent and treat mental health problems while avoiding the stigmatisation, rejection or, worse still, contempt, of sufferers."
"The European Union must offer an example by guaranteeing its citizens a mentally healthy life."
"In this regard, I am proud to belong to a Member State, France, which, under the leadership of President Jacques Chirac, has always implemented the most lucid, ambitious and, ultimately, humane policy on the treatment of mental disabilities."
". Mental health is an extremely important issue for each of us, whether we are sufferers, carers or service providers in this field."
"The role of legislators in this area is even greater as we in the EU and Member States can with consultation and partnership create a better and brighter future for sufferers, family and carers."
"For too long mental illness has not been at centre stage in our legislative process and, as is clear from the Commission’s Green Paper and its startling findings, public consciousness through more informed communication is slowly coming to realise that mental illness and its consequences affect the core of our population."
"25% of the EU’s and Ireland’s population experience at least one significant episode of mental ill health during their lives."
"It is time to react!"
"I warmly welcome this Green Paper as a European debate-launcher on learning disabilities, major depression, suicide, imprisonment of suffers and the affect of inappropriate imprisonment so that Member States can share research and best practice for the benefit of our citizens."
"Since the 1980s Ireland has advocated a policy of de-institutionalisation, aiming to develop a modern mental health service via a community-based system, promoting mental health, giving the mentally ill as independent a life as possible and providing comprehensive healthcare, moving away from psychiatric hospitals."
"The mental health of the population of each Member State is an issue that should be dealt with exclusively at national level."
"There are no reasons why the European Parliament should have views on what appropriations should be granted to the mental health world and on what measures should be taken in this area."
"The proposal that the Commission should establish a Mental Health Coordinating and Monitoring Group is just one of several unnecessarily detailed and expensive proposals."
"I have thus voted against this report."
". The report has many strong points with respect to mental health issues concerning women and children."
"That is why we give our support to the report."
"However we do want to stress that, in principle, measures and decisions with respect to healthcare are within the competence of the individual Member States."
". Mr President, I warmly congratulate our Rapporteur on this report, which highlights often painful lack of progress in dealing with mental health issues across the Union."
"Too often mental health is the Cinderella of our health services, yet the implications of poor mental health are a drain on all resources as well as personally disastrous."
"I welcome the conclusions of this report and am very happy to support them."
". Mental health has for too long been ignored and neglected."
"The report today, although an own-initiative report, allows mental health to be placed on the European political agenda."
"I welcome this debate."
". – The CFP no longer meets the expectations of Mediterranean fishermen."
"That is why I welcome this plan, which includes several positive guidelines: a crucial reduction in costs and constraints for the fishermen; a revision and harmonisation of the control and monitoring provisions, under the auspices of the Community Fisheries Control Agency, which is something that Mediterranean fishermen, who all too often feel ‘harassed’, have been specifically waiting for; and closer involvement for those working in the sector in the definition of the guidelines (management of fishing efforts, control measures and catch limits), which echoes a strong demand that I am voicing at the European Parliament on behalf of Mediterranean fishermen."
"I also support Parliament’s request to play its full role by denying the European Commission the opportunity to decide on ‘technical measures’ by itself."
"The fishermen know only too well how these ‘technical measures’ have a direct and immediate impact on their activity."
"I will therefore vote in favour of this report, even though I would have liked it to have gone further in terms of demanding a specific plan for Mediterranean fisheries."
"I, for my part, will continue to wage this fight at the European Parliament, alongside the fishermen from my region."
". I fully endorse the objectives set out by the Commission, namely the action plan in priority areas such as conservation policy and the monitoring of fishing activities."
"This proposal is, to my mind, a vital factor in adapting the CFP to the current reality of fisheries in the EU."
"Among its key points are the following: the frontloading (prior consultation at an early stage) of the institutions directly or indirectly involved in the assessment of fisheries resources, that is to say consultation with the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture; more frequent use of impact analysis of measures that may be implemented; and the revision of the legal structure of existing provisions with a view to making texts clearer, more consistent, more understandable and easier to read, deleting obsolete provisions."
"I should also like to highlight the need for the Commission to extend its process of improving the procedures as regards the partnership agreements, more specifically the process of monitoring and implementing those agreements."
"I shall be voting in favour of this proposal."
"The June List has on numerous occasions made it clear that we oppose the Common Fisheries Policy."
"We believe that the EU’s destructive and immoral fisheries agreements should be abolished."
"I am highly critical of paragraph 22 of the report, which points out the importance of Community aid for funding technical facilities on fishing vessels."
"However, the report emphasises the value of increased flexibility, clearer legislation, simplified rules and the need for increased consultation with parties affected."
"These objectives are commendable."
"I have thus voted in favour of the report."
". In view of issues relating to the multiplicity and the readability of Community legislation on the Common Fisheries Policy, it is crucial that this legislation be improved and simplified."
"The simplification of procedures, clear and comprehensible wording for all interested parties, the allowance of sufficient time between the adoption and implementation of legislation and, too, the assessment of its economic, social and environmental impact are issues that must be thought through clearly in the interests of transparency and fairness in implementing legislation."
"This process must not, however, act as a pretext for trying to undermine what has been regulated, and there must be monitoring on the part of national parliaments, the European Parliament and the sector and its organisations representing the workers."
"The fact that we accept that the process must be simplified does not automatically imply that we agree on the content of the Common Fisheries Policy; indeed, we have some serious objections."
"For example, the rapporteur advocates a Community inspection system. We are opposed to this because we feel that it should fall to the Member States, as part of sovereignty over their exclusive economic area."
"Furthermore, we fail to understand the rapporteur's concerns as regards extending the principle of the Member States being able to adopt conservation and resource management measures in their waters beyond 12 nautical miles."
". I voted in favour of the amendment, which would have allowed ACP countries to opt out of fisheries agreements, if they considered such agreements to be harmful to their interests."
"Simplification of the Common Fisheries Policy is an attractive notion, given the centralised, cumbersome and often secretive processes under which management decisions are made."
"My view, and that of many Scots, is that the CFP should be concerned with the market in fisheries products, but that control and management of the resource and of catching opportunities should be returned to Scotland."
". – The plans are coming thick and fast, the European Fisheries Fund is replacing FIFG, the advisory committees are multiplying, and the Community Fisheries Control Agency is developing its activities, but none of that is leading to an improvement in the fishermen’s work situation."
"European legislation is in the process of killing off fishing and French fishermen just as agricultural legislation is going to force out our farmers."
"Two key problems have been overlooked in this report, even though, in the long term, they will determine whether or not the French fishing fleet stays: the unfair competition from non-EU fishing vessels that do not comply with all of the restrictions imposed on our fishermen in matters concerning legislation, control and monitoring, and the cost of fuel ever since Brussels called on France to do away with the fund for the prevention of risks to fishing, or fuel fund."
"The legislation certainly needs to be simplified, but that will do nothing to improve the situation of our fishermen."
"Once again, the European Commission is taking them for a ride, if I may say so."
"There now remain only 5 500 fishing vessels."
"How many will remain in 2010 with the new Common Fisheries Policy?"
"It is undeniably important that the rules on the Common Fisheries Policy be simplified. Accordingly, I welcome the measures put forward in this proposal aimed at addressing the lack of clarity of the existing texts and at making the wording simpler, as this would bring the interested parties closer together and would lead to the fisheries sector identifying more closely with the legislation."
"In spite of the numerous calls that have been made, fishermen continue to have difficulty in terms of their awareness and understanding of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"It needs to become easier both to understand and to implement."
"I welcome the gradual adaptation of new technologies on board fishing vessels and the undertaking to grant Community aid for the development of these technologies and the specific training required."
"These measures will bring benefits for both the fishing community and consumers."
"I also feel it is necessary to clarify the processes for administering fishing authorisations outside Community waters."
". Mr President, the Common Fisheries Policy has done so much damage to fishing communities, fish stocks and the wider environment within our own waters it is incapable of meaningful reform and should be scrapped wholesale."
"However, even minimal progress remains progress and this report does contain some useful suggestions, so I have supported the report while protesting that it does not go nearly far enough."
". Although I believe more work needs to be conducted on third-party fish agreements, I cannot on this occasion support Amendments 1 and 2."
"Both amendments go outside the objective of the Action Plan."
". Mr President, these fisheries agreements do little more than export our own disastrous policies to the developing world."
"They are only justifiable in the looking glass world of the Common Fisheries Policy, a policy which has done so much damage to fishing communities, fish stocks and the wider environment within our own waters."
"Accordingly I have voted against this report."
". – The European Parliament is giving its verdict today on two fishing agreements that are of importance in relation to the Indian Ocean: one with the Republic of Seychelles and the other with the Republic of the Comoros."
"These agreements, which are scheduled to last for six and seven years respectively, on a renewable basis, have the following objectives: economic, financial, technical and scientific cooperation in the fisheries sector; the laying down of conditions for Community fishing vessels to access the territorial waters of the Seychelles and the Comoros; and the setting up of partnerships between companies with the aim of developing, in the common interest, economic activities coming under the fisheries sector and any activities related thereto."
"A financial contribution will be paid to the Seychelles and the Comoros in return for the exploitation of their fishery resources."
"As an elected representative from overseas who is aware of the role of fishing in the overseas economy, and particularly that of Réunion, I am pleased that Europe is helping to establish both a responsible form of fishing in the Indian Ocean and the sustainable exploitation of its fishery resources."
"That is why I voted in favour of these two agreements."
"Before moving on to the next item, I have a communication for the House."
"You will recall that we have occasionally had disagreements over how to interpret Rule 166 of our Rules of Procedure and that certain Members thought that the Presidency was not applying it properly, since it was not giving the floor for points of order that did not refer to the issue that was being debated at that moment."
"In fact, Rule 166 does not specify clearly whether the point of order for which the floor is given must refer to the issue being debated or to that day’s agenda, or whether it can refer to any other issue."
"Nevertheless, the President’s view is that common sense should dictate that the floor should only be given on the subject being debated and not any other issue."
"Nevertheless, in order to clear up the argument that had arisen on various occasions in the House, I requested the opinion of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and, in its reply, it proposes the following interpretation of Rule 166: ‘Requests for the floor to comment on the application of the Rules of Procedure shall refer to the item being debated at that moment."
"The President may give the floor in relation to other issues at the appropriate time; for example, after the debate on an item on the agenda or before the sitting is suspended.’"
"It is therefore clear that, from now on, Rule 166 should be interpreted as common sense dictates and that it may only be invoked for the purpose of commenting on the application of the Rules of Procedure relating to the item being debated at that moment."
"I would point out that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs’ interpretation will be considered adopted unless it is contested before the Minutes of the present sitting are approved."
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in the Middle East."
"."
"Mr President, the latest Middle East crisis in the summer is the first in which the European Union has become the international actor on which the greatest hopes and expectations have been placed, in particular by the Lebanese people and government but also, more widely, throughout that region."
"I am pleased to say that the EU has managed to live up to those expectations and to play an important, and even leading, role in putting a stop to the hostilities, in keeping the ceasefire and in the efforts made to move forward the political process needed to consolidate the peace."
"In August, the General Affairs and External Relations Council held two extraordinary meetings."
"In our meeting on 1 August, we managed to reach an agreement on the conclusions."
"This was done in a very constructive atmosphere, contrary to some totally misleading press reports."
"The substance of those conclusions subsequently became the basis for United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 which brought a ceasefire, outlined the political agreement needed to restore the full integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon and created the new UNIFIL Mark 2 force needed to ensure implementation of the resolution."
"It was not the EU’s fault that it took so long for the resolution to be passed, while every day the conflict brought more unnecessary civilian casualties, suffering and devastation without anyone coming any nearer to fulfilling either the political or military goals for which they were fighting."
"Indeed, the central lesson to be learned from this conflict is that there are neither military nor unilateral solutions to any of the outstanding issues and conflicts in the Middle East."
"The role of the EU Member States has remained central since the adoption of Resolution 1701."
"At our second extraordinary Council meeting on 25 August, in which the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan also participated, we were able to ensure that UNIFIL can and will be brought up to strength and deployed as the EU Member States responded to the United Nations request by contributing up to 7000 troops."
"Also at that meeting it was confirmed that France, and from next February Italy, would have responsibility for leading the operation."
"UNIFIL is not an EU operation and it is important that other members of the United Nations, including, in particular, many Islamic countries, are contributing to the operation."
"Already, the first Italian and additional French troops have been deployed."
"There is a need to move troops into the area quickly in order to avoid a security vacuum while the IDF withdraws and the Lebanese armed forces gradually deploy into southern Lebanon."
"In order to restore peace and security, UNIFIL’s mission is to ensure the withdrawal from southern Lebanon and to help the Lebanese Government and army to extend their authority to that area and to all of Lebanon."
"While the Lebanese Army is to carry out the disarming of Hizbollah, UNIFIL will also have an important task in ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid, monitoring the ceasefire and being ready to respond if anyone tries to break the peace."
"The ceasefire has, notwithstanding some deplorable incidents, been respected."
"The Lebanese Government remains united and all the political parties, including Hizbollah, have pledged their support for Resolution 1701 and the political agreement it incorporates."
"The role of the European Union in terms of humanitarian aid and the early recovery and reconstruction of Lebanon has been remarkable."
"The Donor Conference in Stockholm last week was a major success."
"The European Union’s humanitarian aid response has been swift and significant."
"The total humanitarian aid pledged or effectively granted by the European Community and Member States is approximately EUR 330 million, i.e. over a third of the total pledges made in Stockholm."
"We are already in a position to focus more on early recovery and strengthening local capacities."
"All our efforts – the political agreement, reconstruction and support for the integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon with the presence of a strong UNIFIL – are vital for peace and stability in that country."
"It is also crucial that outside actors and neighbours support this."
"For that reason, we must be prepared to engage Syria, which can either be a constructive partner or a spoiler."
"That will also determine the future of the EU’s relations with Syria."
"In my own contacts with Syria, as in meetings with others, we have welcomed Syria’s stated intention and readiness to respect Resolution 1701 and lend support to its implementation and, moreover, also to be constructive in a comprehensive Middle East peace process."
"For all of us in the Council, it has always been clear that there cannot be any sustainable stability and peace in Lebanon, or elsewhere in the region, without a return to the peace process between Israel and Palestine that is based on the roadmap and its goal of the two-state solution, with Israel living in peace and security with an independent and viable Palestinian State as its neighbour."
"Unfortunately, many aspects of the roadmap have, and continue, to come under attack."
"Deadlock has existed since the Palestinian elections in January, which our election observers, led by your colleague, Ms De Keyser, unequivocally assessed as free and fair."
"In order for the peace process to continue, it is vital that the people and constituent parties of Palestine remain committed to non-violence, the recognition of Israel and to putting a stop to all terrorist activities."
"We have had an uncertain situation in which the international community has had to suspend its direct assistance to the Palestinian Administration while trying to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Palestinians are met and their access to education and medical services is maintained."
"That has been the difficult task of the Temporary International Mechanism set up by the EU at the request of the Quartet, and it has not been made any easier by Israel’s refusal to the release tax and customs receipts now amounting to over USD 500 million that are due to the Palestinian Administration."
"However, as its name suggests, the Temporary International Mechanism is only an interim device."
"We need to break the deadlock."
"We need to have all the abducted Israeli soldiers, the arrested Palestinian legislators and members of the Government, unconditionally released."
"We also need, above all, a broad-based Palestinian Government that is fully committed to respecting all the commitments entered into by the Palestinian Administration and which can act as a credible partner with which no one can refuse to negotiate."
"We do not need to reinvent the wheel for the peace process."
"All the requisite elements are well known and are to be found in the roadmap and other documents."
"But putting these in the right order remains a challenge."
"At our discussions at the Gymnich held in Lappeenranta last week we were in full agreement that the EU must now take an active role in initiating a return to the peace process."
"However, no matter in how united, cohesive and effective a manner the EU acts, it is obvious that we cannot achieve peace through our efforts alone."
"We need to work closely with all our partners in the Quartet, and in particular with the United States, as well as with the Arab league, whose renewed determination to engage in the process is to be welcomed."
"Above all, we need, of course, to urge the parties themselves to come to the table and seriously engage in negotiations."
"For a long time people in the region have wanted nothing more than peace and security, and they have become increasingly frustrated by their leaders’ inability or even unwillingness to deliver this, thus fostering a climate which has allowed extremism to thrive."
"It is therefore necessary for the EU and others to entice, cajole, push and pressure the parties and to be prepared, where and when necessary, to engage on the ground as well."
"The EU is already doing that, with the approval of the parties, in the EU BAM Rafah mission and the EUCOPPS mission in the territories."
"Unfortunately, the Rafah and Karni border crossing points have effectively been closed for the past few months and Israel has not responded to our repeated approaches to have them re-opened."
"In the future, we may also need to take on other new responsibilities as part of the quest for peace."
"The need for a new international conference on the Middle East has been put forward by many."
"There is much support for that idea in the Council, but there is also recognition that this is not something that can start immediately, before the parties have agreed to come to such a conference and before there is the prospect of such a conference bringing positive results that can further the peace process."
"The Council will stay centrally engaged in the Middle East peace process."
"We have made it clear that the High Representative, Javier Solana, has the full support and mandate of the Council, working together with the Presidency and the Commission, to do what needs to be done and to meet with whomsoever is appropriate in order to get the Middle East Peace process working and keep it working until we have reached a comprehensive peace settlement."
"."
"Mr President, the conflict in Lebanon, the violence in the Palestinian Territories, the suffering of civilians in northern Israel: these past months the prospect of a comprehensive peace has seemed further off than ever, and yet, paradoxically, these conflicts – especially the misery suffered by ordinary Lebanese, ordinary Israelis and ordinary Palestinians – have once more highlighted the need for a negotiated regional solution."
"They are a stark and cruel reminder that security and stability cannot be imposed unilaterally without dialogue or diplomacy."
"This is a moment of distress and suffering in the Middle East, but I believe it is also one of opportunity, and we have to seize that opportunity."
"It is specifically by mobilising the very considerable resources of the European Union, from the political and security to the technical, economic and financial, and by deploying them in close cooperation with the rest of the international community, that we may be able to put the peace process back on its feet."
"As the President-in-Office said, the European Union is playing an unprecedented role."
"Europe is fully engaged with Lebanon and determined to play a strong role in supporting the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701 and in finding lasting peace for the region."
"EU Member States are making a decisive contribution to the expanded UNIFIL peacekeeping force in support of the rapid extension of the Lebanese Government’s authority throughout Lebanon."
"The European Union is at the forefront of diplomatic efforts to remove the continuing air and sea blockades of Lebanon."
"From the outset of the conflict, the European Commission has been very active on the ground, supporting our partners and their people when they most needed us."
"Over the past six weeks, the Commission has mobilised and coordinated a very important European response to the urgent needs caused by the conflict."
"From the second week of the conflict onwards, we provided rapid humanitarian assistance."
"I was glad and grateful to learn that Parliament had agreed to our request to mobilise further resources from the emergency reserve."
"This will allow ECHO to continue its action in support of essential early recovery, notably for water, sanitation and housing, thus bringing our total humanitarian support to over EUR 50 million."
"The Commission also helped to coordinate and support evacuation efforts, providing EUR 11 million in support of the evacuation of third-country nationals caught up in the conflict, in response to a request from the Foreign Minister of Cyprus to provide urgent assistance to help launch this operation quickly."
"On the ground, the Commission also played an important role in assessing the situation and setting up the first coordination exercise among donors."
"We are already working with the Lebanese Government, as well as with the United Nations and the World Bank, to ensure that in this post-conflict phase this coordination will be led and informed by the Lebanese themselves – it is a question of ownership."
"The Commission has also responded to the environmental disaster and has supported the Lebanese Government through the Community Civil Protection Mechanism in order to tackle the huge environmental damage."
"Now we are working to assess and to address the needs relating to the reconstruction of Lebanon with a view to restoring its infrastructure, and promoting economic recovery, social development and political cohesion."
"Last week at the Stockholm Conference, I announced a package of EUR 42 million to support early recovery until the end of the year."
"This brings the Commission’s contribution so far to just over EUR 100 million."
"I believe the European Commission has shown that it is ready to act and to act quickly."
"The European Union’s contribution to meeting specific and immediate needs is crucial in order to support the implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701 and to support a lasting settlement to the conflict between Israel and Hizbollah that has for too long destabilised Lebanon and also threatened Israel."
"The Middle East needs a strong, sovereign, unified and politically independent Lebanon, able to consolidate the fragile peace that has returned and to contain the very real risk of spill-over of tension that remains."
"The Lebanese population must also feel the tangible benefits of the cessation of hostilities."
"A Beirut-driven reconstruction process will help to strengthen the role of the Lebanese Government."
"For this, and in order to really start the reconstruction phase, the lifting of Israel’s air and sea blockade is crucial."
"I join again with Secretary-General Kofi Annan in calling for its immediate removal."
"Over the longer term, the international community must remain engaged, with a focus on supporting institutional recovery and promoting Lebanese state-building efforts, including those undertaken via the national dialogue."
"That means pursuing the political, social and economic agenda already outlined in the EU Lebanon Action Plan."
"It is not an exaggeration to say that the measures we identified together before the conflict are now more important than ever."
"We must also work collectively with our Lebanese counterparts to ensure that conditions for long-term stability are met, including removing the ambiguity surrounding the disarming of Hizbollah – which can only realistically be achieved as part of a process of political integration – and clarifying the status of the Shebaa farms."
"We must not lose sight of the broader picture across the region."
"While international attention was drawn to Lebanon, the violence and suffering continued in the Palestinian territories and Qassam rockets continued to fall on Israeli towns and villages."
"I was in Israel with the Finnish President after the Rome Conference."
"We went to Haifa, where there was constant danger from rockets."
"In the Palestinian territories, in order to avoid further escalation we need a return by the Palestinian militants to the ‘calm’ that held for most of 2005, the release of hostages, detainees and prisoners, as well as progress on basic issues of movement and access, which, as we know hold the key to Palestinian economic recovery and to the creation of a viable Palestinian State."
"This should start with the rapid re-opening of the Gaza crossings, in particular the Rafah border, supported by the EU border assistance mission."
"The Commission is, in principle, ready to take further action to upgrade the infrastructure and strengthen capacity on the basis of the access and movement agreement of last November."
"The context must be our long-standing aim of building up the institutions of a future Palestinian State, working with the Palestinian Authority, which in turn means that the EU should be ready to respond pragmatically to the formation of a Palestinian national unity government."
"I repeat that we will engage with any government ready to work for peace through peaceful means."
"We must not and we do not forget the plight of the Palestinian people."
"We have, as you know, via the temporary international mechanism, ensured access to clean water and sanitation in the Gaza Strip."
"We kept hospitals and healthcare centres going through the summer and we have now also provided social allowance payments that have benefited more than 600 000 Palestinians directly and many more indirectly."
"But with the continued political stalemate, closures and also frozen fiscal revenues, the TIM can only provide temporary relief."
"We cannot go on much longer like this."
"We must seek ways to improve access and movement to get Israel to unblock the withheld Palestinian revenues that now amount to EUR 500 million and to get the Palestinian Authority to ensure public order and security."
"We owe it to the parties and they owe it to their own people."
"The rapid escalation of violence this summer produced no victory, only victims."
"We see once more the failure of military action to resolve the long drawn-out conflicts of the Middle East."
"Yet the status quo – which includes the slow chipping away of the credibility of a two-state solution, continued occupation and endemic violence – is itself a recipe for instability."
"It is also a recipe for interference by third parties and radicalism, fuelled by injustices, either perceived or real."
"There is, then, really only one choice: we need to renew the political perspective upon which the peace process depends, including for example our position on the primacy of the 1967 borders."
"We must do everything possible to bring all the parties back to the negotiating table."
"By focusing on some concrete and pragmatic measures that can bring about some positive and tangible results, we can help to create the appropriate climate and facilitate a re-engagement between the parties."
"Decisive action is needed to get the parties back on track towards a negotiated peace."
"I have called for an early meeting of President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert."
"I hope they can address the issue of hostages and detainees, as well as other pressing questions of violence, access and finances."
"It is time for Israel and Lebanon to establish channels for dialogue, and for Syria to be brought back into the equation, as they show readiness to play their part in the implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions."
"Iran must also take its responsibility and demonstrate its readiness to contribute to peace and stability in the region."
"Many ideas have been floated on a comprehensive approach to peace in the Middle East."
"The Arab League initiative in particular deserves our full attention."
"At the Gymnich meeting last weekend, many voices called for greater EU leadership in the Middle East."
"I believe they are right."
"We have to turn the tragic events of this summer into an opportunity for a long-term settlement of the still open conflicts in the region."
"Our credibility, and that of the Quartet and the UN, is at stake."
". – Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, none of the world’s regions has had so much suffering to endure, and over so many decades, as the Middle East, and those who bear the brunt of it are the people who want nothing more than to live in peace."
"Terrible consequences ensue from the abduction and killing of soldiers; innumerable civilians fall victim to the bombardment of real and supposed military targets."
"For decades, the violence has been spiralling out of control in an unending vicious circle."
"I would like to say, Mr President, how grateful I am to you for calling the group presidents to two meetings over the holiday period, and I would like to thank you, Mr Tuomioja, and you, Commission Ferrero-Waldner, for what you have done, as well as the High Representative Mr Solana for his own."
"We, in the European Union, know that a military solution is impossible in the Middle East, that any solution must be political if it is to bring peace, and that peace must first be established in the minds of those who exercise responsibility."
"At the same time, though, we affirm that a military presence can help to create the conditions for peace."
"Here in this House, we have for many years been debating European security policy, and those who can remember back twenty years can recall wishing – while, at the time, thinking it impossible – that we could, by now, have moved on from asking ourselves whether we would intervene militarily to thinking about how we would do it."
"Europeans such as ourselves can derive some encouragement from this, as we proceed down the road of taking on responsibility; it can confirm to us that this is the right way to go, that we must accept this responsibility and that we do want to."
"What are we aiming for?"
"What we are aiming for is a sovereign Lebanon; we see it as unacceptable that Lebanon should be subject to control, be it direct or indirect, from Syria or Iran, and, where the part played by Iran is concerned, its influence has to be considered in the context of its nuclear programme."
"Hizbollah is not only a political organisation, but also a military one."
"Those who seek democracy in the Middle East must take note of the fact that Hizbollah’s presence in parliament and government is something that has emerged from elections."
"It is not, however, acceptable that there should be a state within a state, or that a political party should, by maintaining its own militia, interfere with the effectiveness of the government and armed forces of a sovereign Lebanon."
"That is why the peace process must, among other things, resolve the issue of how Hizbollah is to be disarmed."
"The primary competence must be political."
"Israel’s response has brought it criticism from many quarters, and I admit that I too, at one time described it as disproportionate, but I do also want to say that I very much respect Israel for considering, in a free and democratic debate, the question of where it went wrong, both politically and militarily."
"I wish those states that are Israel's neighbours would be as self-critical in a debate of a similar kind."
"If the other states bordering upon Israel can be as self-critical, then the Middle East will have moved closer to democracy."
"Perhaps I – as a European, a German, and one born of the post-war generation – might be permitted to say how deeply moved I was to hear the Israeli Prime Minister say that a German contribution to the peace effort would be welcomed."
"That is something quite utterly novel, the like of which was unthinkable before, and so it is right that the Federal Republic of Germany, too, together with its friends in the European Union, should make its own contribution."
"I was deeply moved by that."
"The people of Palestine are equal in dignity to the Israelis or to Europeans such as ourselves, and they are entitled to live within secured borders."
"We appeal to all the interested parties in Palestine, to Fatah and to Hamas, to form a real government of national unity and thereby play their part in making peace."
"We Europeans find ourselves – and perhaps for the first time ever – in a new situation in that we are not only providing the humanitarian aid that matters so much to people, but are also, as part of the Quartet, helping to shape their future, which is what I urge all those involved with the Quartet to join with the European Union in doing."
"Let me conclude by saying that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, regarding as it does human dignity as the foundation of each and every policy, calls on everyone in the Middle East and in the Arab and Muslim worlds not to exploit young people as so-called martyrs, imperilling their own lives and the lives of others, but instead to enable them to live in their own countries under decent conditions and make their contributions to society, to respect human dignity and the value of human life, and then we can stand alongside these peoples and their governments."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the President-in-Office and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for what they have said."
"There lies, I believe, in the crisis and in the attempt at a solution – which they have described and which must now be organised – an historic opportunity for Europeans and for the Member States of the European Union, and not for them alone – as Mr Tuomioja is right to point out – for others, notably Islamic states – must also make their own contribution, but the opportunity for the Europeans who are involved is a unique one."
"I would put it in yet another way: there is not only a unique opportunity, but also a unique obligation, to do something practical, now, to bring about peaceful solutions, for it has to be said – and it has to be said here – that the USA’s solutions for the region have failed utterly, and that their failure is one of the causes of the present crisis."
"That is why we Europeans are under an obligation to make the attempt now to help bring about a solution."
"Our contribution cannot be merely military but it must have a military dimension to it, among the various others that are necessary in the region."
"What is needed is an overall concept, including military action on the basis of international law, humanitarian action and diplomatic activity, which does not overlook the core issue of conflict in the region, that being the need to resolve the Palestinian conflict, which is the cause of instability across the region."
"Let me now set out some of the things that we Socialists regard as fundamental and necessary in terms of this overall concept."
"This is indeed, above all else, about Israel's right to exist."
"We European Social Democrats are in no doubt about the fact that the existence of Israel is at the heart of our policy, and we oppose all those who jeopardise it."
"In the present situation, though, we also have to support Lebanon, which, once its civil war was over, was on the right road towards becoming a stable, secular democracy."
"Since that has, to a great extent, been brought to nothing, let us help the Lebanese people to get back to where they were before the military conflict, when the whole region had so many reasons for hope."
"We also have to build up Palestine, and the primary objective here must be the provision of humanitarian aid in what is a tragic situation."
"What I can say, on behalf of us Social Democrats, is that dialogue with all the forces in Palestine can no longer be evaded; it is necessary and indispensable."
"We must promote and build up the structures of civil society, for it is with them, and with all the forces that favour dialogue – particularly dialogue between cultures and religions – that we must be partners."
"What is needed in the region – as previous speakers, including Mr Poettering, have indicated – is not the questioning of one another’s right to exist, but respect: respect for other values, values that may be religious in origin, but are nonetheless constructive and respectful of human dignity, respect on the basis of what we stand for, of our Western values."
"We should not make Islam into some sort of hate figure;"
"Islam is a religion professed by almost a billion people around the world, and we must not allow them to be seen in the same light as a bunch of crazed terrorists."
"That would be a fatal error."
"That is why dialogue between cultures is so important."
"One thing I do think is important is that the prisoners should be released, and that must happen now."
"It is now that the parties to the conflict must keep their word, for what is needed is the sort of action that builds trust, and that is not an empty concept."
"Right now, in the situation we are in, that sort of action is indispensable – small steps, understandable steps, steps towards trust, and they include the release of prisoners and the involvement of all the forces in the region."
"All the states – not least, and including, Syria – need to brought in."
"I would not wish to deny that there has, here in this House – and, indeed within our group – been much disappointment about the things that have been said over recent weeks in Syria and elsewhere."
"The thing is that Syria is needed if the problem is to be resolved."
"If Syria is willing to engage in constructive dialogue with us, then I call upon them to indicate their goodwill by resuming the dialogue that has already tentatively begun, and to make it possible for us to address, albeit perhaps in small ways, with matters such as border issues, and to demonstrate to us their readiness to return to the negotiating table."
"Let me point out, with reference to this, that, even when the Cold War was at its height, the two sides, with all their differences, were still able to talk to each other through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which we had set up."
"Why should we not resurrect the idea of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in this region, one that would bring all the parties to the table, not only the countries of the road map – by which I mean us Europeans, the United Nations, Russia, and the United States – but also the states in the region, the Arab League, and Syria as well?"
"This is something it would certainly be worth thinking about."
"I do agree with Mr Poettering when he says that nothing in the world can justify targeted terrorist acts."
"Such terrorism, such blind destructive rage, is no more and no less than the outward face of a contempt for humanity that is always destructive in its effects."
"Nothing can justify any kind of terrorism, and that is why it is our common task to fight against it."
"Mr President, this summer’s conflict has claimed the lives of over 1000 people, the vast majority of whom were innocent civilians."
"It has reduced much of Lebanon to rubble."
"If the situation teaches us nothing else, it must teach us to look forward, rather than back."
"We should waste no time in deploying the 7000 troops that the Union has pledged to UNIFIL to stabilise the situation in southern Lebanon, to cut off the flow of arms and to support the humanitarian effort."
"We must, however, clarify UNIFIL’s mandate to turn the UN resolutions into reality on the ground."
"And of course we must go further."
"We must speak with one voice."
"We must, in the short term, demand the immediate lifting of Israel’s air and sea blockade of Lebanon."
"We must demand the lifting of the blockade of Gaza and we must help to establish an effective Palestinian Government."
"In the medium term, while condemning terrorist acts we must bring Hizbollah and Hamas in from the cold and engage them in a dialogue for the establishment of a democratic framework."
"We must set up an independent inquiry into the civilian deaths caused by all sides in the recent conflict and, as Kofi Annan has pointed out, it will not be through the barrel of a gun, but thanks to dialogue and compromise that Hizbollah will put down their weapons and negotiate a long-term solution."
"We have long-term tasks too."
"If we are to raise a new generation that is not steeped in fear and intolerance, we must build institutions that will ensure peace in the long term."
"When he was President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi talked about setting up a Euro-Arab development bank, jointly financed and managed by both sides."
"We must look, too, at a security organisation along the lines of Mr Fogh Rasmussen’s proposed conference on security and cooperation in the Mediterranean, which Mr Schulz has quoted."
"We must look at how we can tie in, with a proper immigration policy, all of the countries of the Mediterranean basin."
"And we must oversee all of this through the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly in which you, Mr President, have invested so much political – and no little financial – capital."
"Let us learn from Einstein when he told us that peace cannot be kept by force, only achieved through understanding."
"Mr Tuomioja, you spoke about the European Union’s remarkable achievement and its major success."
"I commend the work you have done, but let us not exaggerate."
"It is a crisis that has driven the European Union to the position it is in, though something Michel Barnier has called the ."
"The Union does not have the European constitution that it needs and which would have equipped it far better to deal with this situation."
"We are deploying European forces but this is not an EU force, even if – thank heavens – it is a coalition of the coherent."
"In terms of democratic decision-making we are running on a wing and a prayer."
"After your meeting in Lappeenranta on 25 August, Mr Solana said that this was the most important decision taken by the EU for many years."
"If that is so, then why is Mr Solana not here, telling us about it and telling us about the conditions surrounding this conflict?"
"He has a mandate, but of what kind?"
"When we asked we were told that the rules of engagement for the forces were: ‘a matter strictly between the United Nations and the troop contributors’."
"We were told, therefore, that this was not a European matter."
"It is absurd that Mr Solana is not here to talk to us about the rules of engagement for this conflict!"
"The danger is this: the European public at large believe that Europe has responded to the crisis."
"If things go wrong and we have large numbers of young men coming back home in body bags, people will want to know who in Europe is responsible."
"Somebody will have to take the political responsibility."
"Please, President-in-Office of the Council, get Europe’s common foreign and security policy together so that we are not faced with that kind of situation."
"In conclusion, we should give two cheers for Europe: one for Louis Michel’s rapid action and one for Romano Prodi’s courage in coordinating our efforts to deal with this problem."
"We should thank the Commission, the Finnish Presidency and Cyprus – a new Member State – for the tremendous help it has given."
"We should also thank Turkey for having the courage to help us in committing troops."
"However, we still run the risk of insistence on national sovereignty resulting in global anarchy."
". – Mr President, Mr Tuomioja, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin with a self-criticism."
"Who, within this Parliament, a year ago, asked about Resolution 1552?"
"Who, within this Parliament, asked about the disarmament of Hezbollah?"
"We need to discuss this problem because it is currently at the heart of the debates in Israel."
"For three years, the Israeli Government has not said or done a thing about the disarmament of Hezbollah."
"We have all been blind and we ought at least to recognise that we too were mistaken."
"It should be noted, firstly, that we had, that the international community had, a UN resolution."
"Once adopted, that resolution disappeared into the nirvana of politics without ever being applied on the ground."
"Secondly – and this is a real problem – that region, which is a target for all kinds of misfortune, is also a region in which the most political mistakes can be made."
"Mistakes are made because people think that they have to be the ambassador of Israel or of Palestine."
"What is the European Union's role now?"
"Certain people within the Union are very attached to Israel – I understand that, and it is justifiable."
"Others are very attached to the Palestinians – I understand that, and it is justifiable."
"Yet, being in politics does not come down to that; on the contrary, everything must be done to ensure that there is finally a Palestinian State and an Israeli State in which people can live safely."
"In order to be in politics, one does not have to be a kind soul or Mother Teresa, one has to be able to succeed in making that region change politically."
"That is the problem."
"It is for this reason that the European Union is sending troops into the region."
"Mr Watson is right."
"Some European Union Member States are sending troops."
"I woke up one morning having dreamt something."
"During a meeting, all of the Heads of State or Government had decided that the European contingent would be the largest in number, that it would be the Europeans’ rapid reaction force, that it would no longer be three quarters French, two thirds Italian or a quarter German, but that it would consist of Europeans who, as such, were going to represent Europe in that region."
"I know that that is a dream, I know that I am being childish, but why not dream such things?"
"Insofar as we are bound to fulfil our obligations, Mr Fischer recently wrote in an article, ‘Welcome to the real world’: Yes, we are living in the real world; from now on, we have to act politically in that region."
"Well, the reality is that the Americans present in the region are in Iraq, where they are stuck; they have no political presence."
"No organisation, apart from the European Union, has the ability to change things and to work alongside the Israelis in examining how the Palestinian issue should be negotiated."
"Peace will only reign in Israel if there is a Palestinian State that is fit to live in."
"The best way in which to combat Hamas is to do so by means of the Palestinian State, because Hamas does not give a damn about the Palestinian State."
"It wants an Islamic area!"
"That is why it is important to stress, firstly, that, if we establish a Palestinian State, then we will weaken Hamas’ influence."
"Secondly, we need to settle the problem concerning the borders with Syria and the Golan."
"Israel must be guaranteed a water supply and it must be guaranteed protection, but protection that does not mean Israel’s occupying the Golan."
"The European Union must use its influence in order to get negotiations under way."
"At a time when the European Union is now managing to play a major political role, we will be responsible not only for hardship and failure, but also, in political terms, for a region in which peace is prevailing."
"When our children ask us what purpose Europe serves, we will be able to proudly reply: ‘Look at what we are doing in the Middle East’."
"To do that, however, we need to achieve that objective."
"We must have the courage to say to all of these governments that it is not Italy – even though Italy has been admirable – that it is not France, and that it is not the United Kingdom, but that it is Europe as a whole that has been effective."
"To conclude, I should like to draw your attention to a debate concerning Germany."
"I have had enough of these political groups!"
"Mr Watson, as a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, is telling the German ALDE members that it is outrageous that they are rejecting the sending of the task force to the Middle East."
"And you, Mr Wurtz, are telling the German Communists that what they are in the process of doing is outrageous, that it is a bartering style of politics, when human beings are dying in the Middle East and when the whole world wants to establish this task force."
"Have courage as politicians and take action within your political camps!"
". – Mr President, Mr Tuomioja, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, what we have experienced this summer ought to be totally and utterly inconceivable in our time."
"Let us recall, firstly, that a State, Israel, is shelling and starving the civilian population of Gaza, is kidnapping ministers and politicians, who are going to join the 8 000 Palestinian prisoners already in detention, and has killed more than 200 people in this small region, which has become, according to the expression used by Mr Jan Egeland, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, a ticking time-bomb."
"Then, the same army has been pounding Lebanon for a full 34 days, making no distinction, according to Human Rights Watch, between civilians and military targets, causing the deaths of 1 100 civilians, forcing a quarter of the population to move, imposing a total blockade of the country, deliberately targeting – as Mr Annan pointed out – and killing observers from the international peacekeeping force, destroying – according to the UNDP – 15 000 houses and 78 bridges, demolishing the country’s vital infrastructure, ports, airports and power stations, causing a huge oil slick, and using shells that can contain as many as 644 explosive devices, with 100 000 of these devices continuing to blindly kill men, women and children."
"Secondly, a superpower, the United States, is supporting its ally’s strategy, both in Palestine and Lebanon, in the name of the war against terrorism, which is already underway in Iraq and Afghanistan."
"Its Secretary of State compares the suffering of the people of Lebanon to the pain of giving birth to the new Middle East."
"In the midst of war, she is delivering increasingly sophisticated weapons to Israel and has been refusing, for more than a month of relentless fighting, to call for a ceasefire, something that the Lebanese Government and the United Nations Secretary-General have nonetheless been passionately calling for."
"My third and final point is that an institution that is particularly close to us, the Council, has long proved itself incapable of calling for a ceasefire despite the commendable attempt made by the Finnish Presidency and the unanimous appeal launched along these lines by Parliament’s Conference of Presidents."
"The Council is even finding excuses for the Israeli army’s behaviour by speaking of the right to self-defence."
"Just as it was legitimate to condemn the initial capture of the Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah, then above all the latter’s serious decision to respond to the bombing of Lebanese towns by launching missiles on Israeli towns, thus in turn committing crimes against the civilian population, the green light that has been given to Israel for many days now to carry out and pursue this terrifying war is leaving people amazed and is fuelling revolt."
"We therefore cannot be content today and in the period to come with only talking about European contributions to UNIFIL and to the reconstruction process, as important as these two issues are."
"By adopting a clear-sighted approach and in a spirit of responsibility, we must learn lessons from this painful experience, beginning with the following: at the heart of all the upheavals in the Middle East, which are becoming more tragic for the populations and more dangerous for international security as each day passes, there is the occupation of the territories that were conquered in 1967 and Israel’s persistent refusal to see the relevant United Nations’ Security Council resolutions applied."
"The fact is that the European Union has taken the pressure off with regard to this crucial requirement for peace."
"What initiative has it taken to relaunch the Quartet’s road map?"
"What did it do to promote the Arab League’s plan in 2002, which was proposing the normalisation of relations with Israel in exchange for recognition of the Palestinian State?"
"What has it done to make the Israeli leaders face up to their historical responsibilities?"
"Instead of doing anything in those areas, it has suspended aid to the Palestinian institutions, delegitimised a democratically-elected government and parliament, shunned the courageous efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to rebuild a national accord and accepted without any difficulty the closure of the only crossing points between Gaza and the outside, which it was officially controlling."
"I hope that the joint decisions taken over the last few days will signal a turnaround for Europe with regard to the entire Middle East."
"At present, Europe must make the long-term choice between President Bush’s notion of the war against terrorism and a return to the fundamentals of international law."
"I believe that a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East comes at that price, as does Europe’s credibility in the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what a lot of inaccuracies and intellectual dishonesty has been printed in a good many columns on the Middle East crisis in August and uttered by a great many politicians!"
"The attacker has often been confused with the attacked, and the real motivation behind the provocation unleashed by Hizbollah, with its launching of missiles against Israel and kidnapping of two of their soldiers, has hardly ever been spelt out. It is in fact the same goal that the President of Iran has declared more than once: ‘to wipe Israel off the map’."
"If that is the aim of certain governments and of the terrorist fundamentalism that they maintain, we need to have the courage and the loyalty to say that Europe’s primary task is to support and defend the existence of the State of Israel and its people and to demand its recognition by those who still refuse to grant it out of short-sighted folly."
"It is only on these conditions and by returning to the roadmap that we shall be able to have a Palestinian State that is itself recognised, free and safe, as well as peace in the Middle East."
"These are the objectives that we must achieve by means of every possible effort and consensus."
"They are very different from Hizbollah’s objectives, which are to destroy a democratic state that is recognised by the international community and a member of the United Nations."
"Hizbollah is a religious ideological movement represented in the parliament of a neighbouring state, albeit by a minority, but it also has an armed autonomous wing outside the state structure that is supplied with arms and money by two other states in the region, both of which have the destruction of Israel as their primary aim."
"How can we maintain equally close relations with these two sides, which are so opposed and different in their objectives?"
"One side is defending its legitimate survival as a democratic state, while the other is the armed wing of the fight against democracy and the West!"
"We support the UNIFIL force, which must do everything it can to guarantee disarmament and to support the legitimate Lebanese Government, in the hope that the Lebanese authorities will no longer adopt their ambiguous positions of recent weeks."
"UNIFIL’s only interlocutors must be the Israeli and Lebanese Governments."
"The European Union, which is at last acting in unison, must enforce the UN resolutions and commit all its efforts to providing humanitarian aid, restarting the talks and promoting a culture of mutual respect."
"I still believe that, if Israel were part of the European Union, peace in the Middle East would be assured to a greater extent. Here and now I reiterate my call for the Council to declare that the embassies of EU countries throughout the world will from now on recognise Israeli citizens as European citizens."
"."
"Mr President, there are reports in the German press today of serious objections being expressed within the to the conditions that the Lebanese Government has prescribed with regard to foreign aid to protect its 225 km-long stretch of coastline from illegal arms transports."
"Beirut apparently wants to keep tabs on a strip of six sea miles from the coast, and naval troops from various EU Member States, including my country, the Netherlands, are invited to monitor the area outside of this strip."
"The President of the regards these conditions as unacceptable, and so do I, for which EU Member State navy would wish to stand by helplessly while Hezbollah is being re-armed?"
"The decision on this specific mandate now lies with the United Nations in any case."
"I should like to hear from this Council and Commission what the UN, and its Secretary-General Mr Annan, intends to do about this, and what their attitude is in this respect, what their position is on this controversial issue, because this has, after all, a direct impact on Europe's involvement in the stabilisation of the situation around Lebanon."
"It is in any event significant that even the two Hezbollah representatives in the Lebanese Government have voted against this dangerous compromise proposal."
"It is therefore only logical that Israel should, for the time being, maintain its sea blockade against Lebanon."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for the European Union’s initiative in the Lebanese situation, which means that we are once again playing a central role in Middle Eastern affairs in a way that we have not seen for a long time, and, of course, it also coincides with the failure of the unilateral initiatives adopted by others."
"Everything will depend on the outcome, however, and we have to realise that the military mission and aid for reconstruction are not the finishing line but the starting point, not an end but a means and, it must be said, a means that is liable to be totally inadequate if it is not quickly and promptly backed up with a political and diplomatic initiative aimed at restarting the talks between the two sides."
"Our debate here in Parliament should focus above all on that: the context will be the United Nations Security Council, but the initiative must inevitably come from here, from Europe, the European Union, in liaison with the United States and with the Arab League, but the central initiative being ours."
"We must debate the implications that such an initiative may have."
"The experience of recent years and months has shown that unilateralism by itself leads nowhere, that the attempt to solve the problems of the Middle East piece by piece leads nowhere."
"We need to go beyond the roadmap, beyond the specific individual Security Council resolutions on Iraq or Lebanon, and realise that the time is ripe right now for an all-encompassing approach that can somehow get all the countries involved in the region to sit down around a table for formal talks on all the unresolved issues, crisis points or areas of cooperation."
"We in Europe ought to know something about that because, 30 years ago in Helsinki, we succeeded in laying the foundations for that transformation that then astounded the world a few years later."
"A solution of that kind would be a solution for everyone: for the United States, which would get out of a tight corner; for Israel, which would escape from the unilateralism in which it is trapped; for the Arab League; and most of all for us, for Europe, because in that way we could revitalise the Barcelona process and Europe’s own situation at the same time."
"Mr President, when during the vacation I watched the news, I felt powerless when I saw the human suffering that went on every day."
"We do not need to be powerless, however: we can do quite a lot."
"This is a real opportunity, as many here today have said."
"The EU has taken some important steps, and one of these was the fact that during the crisis we were able to find consensus – one voice."
"This ‘one voice’ will be an important factor if we want to have a major international role in international policy in the future."
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Finnish Foreign Minister Tuomioja, and to acknowledge the role he has played, because his experience and expertise have played an important role in finding this ‘one voice’."
"In the future, we should be a powerful political actor, and we should not be content with a role in which we are just paymasters dealing with post-war destruction."
"We need to be actively involved in a vital political process to help try and establish permanent peace in the Middle East region."
"Mr President, I am convinced that we will gain fairly unanimous support for this broadly-based conference."
"This will be vital for achieving a lasting peace in the region."
"It is quite clear, as Minister Tuomioja has said, that the conference should not be held immediately, as it will take time for the parties to be prepared for it."
"Now, however, we need the courage and determination to seize this opportunity to genuinely bring lasting peace to the region."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, as you have said, the fact that we have succeeded in obtaining a ceasefire is already an important result in a war that, in just a few weeks, has caused a great many deaths, destroyed infrastructure and the environment, and was threatening to engulf the whole region."
"This initial result is the outcome of a European initiative in close cooperation with the United Nations."
"Allow me to mention the active role played by my own country, Italy, and also by the Finnish Presidency and by France, which is to lead UNIFIL during this phase."
"The challenge, however, remains much more arduous and requires the whole of Europe to make not just a military effort, but a political and diplomatic one."
"For the first time, Europe could demonstrate a united political will and the determination to play a constructive role in the Mediterranean and Middle East by equipping itself with the appropriate tools."
"It is a question of supporting Lebanon in the difficult process of independence and sovereignty, helping it to continue along the democratic path that raised so much hope during the ‘Beirut spring’."
"The Lebanese army has to regain control of the whole country, including the south, and it has to exercise a monopoly on military strength to the exclusion of Hizbollah, which in recent times has become a parallel power."
"Such an outcome requires everyone to take responsibility, starting with Syria, which has a role in the region, while Israel must be persuaded to abandon the idea of the indiscriminate use of force, because that is not a path that can guarantee its security."
"It has already been said that the Palestinian issue lies at the heart of the Middle East situation."
"Europe’s task is to fully accept the responsibility that all the parties in the conflict now attribute to it: to support the Palestinians’ difficult internal process of forming a new government that will enable them to come out of isolation and win back the resources that Israel must return to them."
"It could be the beginning of a new climate of relations between the two sides, but first of all the spiral of violence needs to stop."
"The years of experience that we have acquired show that the two sides cannot do it alone: the international community’s presence is essential, and so we could deploy the peacekeeping troops that are in Lebanon today to Gaza and the West Bank tomorrow."
"It could be a first step towards restoring that agreement, in the run-up to an international conference that may lead to a stable, lasting solution for the entire area, as the President-in-Office mentioned."
"– Mr President, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon will be strengthened, and the European Union will play an important part in it."
"We are right to be pleased about this."
"We must also be aware that, in order to be useful in such a difficult situation, the troops deployed will have to be respected, and, in order for that to happen, they will have to be strong, that is to say, they will need to have the resources appropriate to their mission and to have the right and the duty to implement them not only in the case of self-defence, that is to say, when their own soldiers are in danger, but also when the spirit or the letter of the mission may demand it."
"We learnt this lesson in the Balkans, with tragic effect."
"We must never forget it."
"Nor must we forget what all the peacemakers in Lebanon, as in the whole of the Middle East, are waiting for: it is not the UN, which has been present for too long and which has been rendered powerless for too long, it is not France on its own, it is not Italy, it is the European Union."
"You rightly said so, Mr Tuomioja."
"I bear witness, in this regard, to the effectiveness of the action that has been carried out for weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo by the European force that was deployed there to support the UN’s action."
"Without its presence, I believe that I can say – as you know, Commissioner – that Kinshasa would now be torn apart."
"That is why I am calling on the Council and the Commission to check whether the European forces that are to be deployed in Lebanon could not be organised in a similar way, thus enabling the European Union to do what is expected of it, namely to exercise its own responsibility."
"Thus, if we are not merely indecisive, then why, for example, do we not immediately deploy a European fleet off the Lebanese coast?"
"Euromarfor would give us the means to do this."
"No, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you are not a childish dreamer, and if you are, then I am even more of a child and more of a dreamer than you."
"– Mr President, the Middle East crisis may teach Europe a very tough lesson, a lesson resulting from disaster, which will force us out of our European crisis."
"This contact with the real world of the Middle East through our leadership of a multinational force is very important; it demonstrates that the European Union is no longer just a glorified NGO providing humanitarian aid in the Middle East, but that it has a political commitment to the region."
"That is very important, because it represents a genuine strategic commitment to the Middle East, where peace is fundamental to Europe’s security."
"There is no question that, with the courage of countries such as France, Italy and Spain, the future of Europe’s foreign policy in the world is going to be at stake, and to a certain degree, the future of the European crisis will depend on that."
"It is clear that the unilateralism of the United States has been entirely discredited throughout the Arab world and throughout most of the world in general."
"Lebanon could be a successful test of a form of international intervention that would guarantee peace in Gaza and the West Bank and a peace agreement."
"We welcome the Commission and the Council’s position on the Palestinian government of national unity and its pragmatic reaction, and at the same time we are concerned about what is happening on the ground: the maintenance of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the announcement the day before yesterday that 700 new homes are to be built in those territories, which goes against the roadmap."
"– If there has been a shift in Europe’s position, it is because a people has managed to resist."
"My respect and admiration goes out to Lebanon."
"Resolution 1701 arrived late and failed to make a distinction between the aggressor and the victim, but it did achieve a cease-fire and is providing an opportunity for peace."
"The UN mission is purely and simply the right way forward."
"Reconstruction must be supported, it must be made difficult to restart the war and time must be allowed for dialogue among the Lebanese, because this is the only way in which the problems of defending the country will be resolved."
"There are other priorities, too."
"The European blockade in Palestine sent out the wrong message to Washington and to Tel Aviv and is punishing an entire people for believing in democracy."
"In Tehran, ultimatums and threats only serve to speed up the nuclear arms race."
"The time has come to relaunch peace in the Middle East."
"Only the weapon of politics can beat the politics of weapons."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and the Commissioner for their contributions so far."
"Obviously this most recent war has brought home to us the horrors of conflict and the toll that it takes on human populations and human infrastructure."
"Rather than reinventing the wheel and coming up with new ideas, we should reinvigorate the whole idea of the roadmap that was agreed between the EU, the United Nations, the US and Russia."
"That charted the way forward in terms of bringing about peace and stability not only between Israel and Palestine, but also amongst their neighbours, including Syria, Jordan, Iran, Egypt and Lebanon."
"If we have seen anything over the last few months, it is the inability of the European Union to speak with a single voice; it is the failure by certain Member State governments within the European Union to agree with the majority of other Member States that has allowed this problem to continue and to get worse."
"At least now, late in the day, we have agreed to head the UN peacekeeping force that is going to Lebanon."
"However, now is a time for us to be braver, to look at new ideas and new ways of engagement."
"If our own history in Europe has taught us anything, if our own experience of conflict resolution within the European Union or indeed in the wider world has taught us anything, it is that only through negotiation and dialogue can we actually achieve a lasting and just settlement."
"There is now perhaps an opportunity for us to re-engage with the elected representatives of the Palestinian people – Hamas, with the Lebanese Government, with Israel and with the Governments of Syria and Iran to try to come forward with a deal."
"With regard to the Middle East, the most important lesson for us of the last six months has been our failure to speak properly, with a single voice, and to give a clear message to all those countries – whatever they try – that if they do something wrong, action will be taken by the European Union against them."
"By action I do not mean offensive action by the military, but with the strongest weapon we have, which is moral persuasion and the economic support that we give to those areas."
"Commissioner and President-in-Office, now is the time to be brave."
"Now is the time to chart the new way forward and to dust down the roadmap, invigorate it and make it new for the 21st century."
"– Mr President, since he has returned to the Chamber, I shall congratulate Mr Cohn-Bendit on his rather passionate speech, which we heard a moment ago."
"At the risk of surprising and upsetting him, I agree with him on almost all points or, at any rate, on the main ones."
"It is patently obvious: there is no solution other than a political one."
"What is more, that political solution is possible, over and above the despair of the different sides, the despair of the extremists from both camps."
"There is despair in Israeli politics right now, and the State of Israel needs to be protected from itself."
"I believe that this ‘show of strength’ policy being conducted by Israel is an all or nothing policy that is jeopardising the country’s long-term existence and worrying all those who want it to be secure, as we ourselves do."
"We simply differ on two points: no, it is not Europe that will impose this political solution because not everyone in Europe wants it; it took more than three weeks – as you know, Mr Cohn-Bendit – for the Foreign Affairs ministers to meet after the start of the bombings, and that was to voice their disagreements."
"Let us stop dreaming of a policy based on yet another European army, on a European navy, or on goodness knows what else."
"We do not agree politically; there will therefore be no true European political choice as such, at least, not as long as we follow Washington’s policy – and that is the other point on which I differ from you – as it basically consists in promoting the extremes of both camps and in destroying the geopolitical balance in the region."
"By destroying Iraq, by condemning Syria, by forcing Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, an act that weakens Lebanon – the Christians themselves realise this, including even Mr Aoun – we have created the conditions for an imbalance and we are still reaping the rewards of that imbalance, which is war, which is giving a voice to the extremists - from both camps, I might add, from the dominant and the dominated side."
"Unfortunately, I believe that it is not Europe that can impose this political solution;"
"I can see no political power other than France that can do so."
"– Mr President, woe betide the country in which an emphasis on minorities and ethnic communities prevails over the authority of the State, and woe betide disarmed States."
"Lebanon, the poor martyr that it is, has just experienced misfortune once again, by providing the motive, albeit reluctantly, for a devastating and disproportionate intervention."
"The right to self-defence and the right to take follow-up action do of course exist, but not the right to launch an all-out war without negotiating, without issuing an ultimatum, without declaring war and without first referring the matter to the Security Council."
"I fear, too, that this operation will be counter-productive for Israel, which has not achieved its political objectives and which is now incurring the hostility of the entire Lebanese population."
"Mr Tuomioja told us that there would be a cordial atmosphere at the meetings held among the European ministers; what a relief!"
"Those warm meetings did not, however, prevent the devastation of Lebanon."
"We are being told today about a European peacekeeping force, but curiously enough, that force involves only seven out of twenty-five Member States."
"Must I point out that there has been a peacekeeping force in Lebanon for 28 years now?"
"My country, France, has paid a heavy cost there, but that force was totally incapable of preventing the tragic events that we have experienced and, contrary to what the Commissioner told us, it was totally powerless in the recent tragedy and merely supplied a few extra targets for the Israeli bombs."
"The settlement is based solely on the recognition of sovereign States with secure and recognised borders."
"A free and independent Palestinian State is required, something that has not existed for decades – a state of affairs to which most of you seem pretty much resigned."
"There can be no peace without that."
"The State of Lebanon, which has recently been freed from Syria’s control, must extend its authority over the whole of its territory."
"It is only under those conditions that Israel will also be able to experience lasting peace."
"Finally, as regards our fellow citizens’ helping in the reconstruction process, we are tired of paying to rebuild what others have demolished."
"Let each side help repair the damage it has caused; the State of Lebanon for the damage caused by Hezbollah in Israel, and the State of Israel for the damage caused in Lebanon."
"Let each side shoulder its responsibilities, the rule of law also hinges on that."
"– Whether one likes it or not, the EU’s time on the international stage has arrived."
"We must first thank the Finnish Presidency, the Commissioner and the Commission for succeeding in this regard, or for at least enabling this to happen."
"This is both an opportunity and a responsibility."
"We need to be aware that all the ingredients are in place for something to go wrong."
"The mandate is full of ambiguities, Hezbollah is not disarming, Israel continues to retaliate, there is a lack of security on the Israeli-Palestinian border and Syria and Iran cannot be relied upon."
"Nevertheless, I feel that it was a good decision for us to take on these responsibilities."
"As regards peace-keeping, we must also make sure that the mission is successful."
"We must ensure there is no discord in the EU and must act quickly if the situation changes."
"I feel that an informal cell made up of the Commission, the Council and Parliament might be helpful."
"The most important thing, however, is to develop a parallel political framework."
"The proposal of an international conference seems very appropriate, given that the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon is an essential prerequisite, albeit insufficient on its own."
"Lastly, we need to mobilise more human and financial resources because the process will take time."
"We have a duty to ensure that our representatives will be successful."
"This is our responsibility."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like, in this speech, to focus on the security of Israel and Europe’s interest in it, it being something that we, by reason of our history – terrible, tragic, and full of disasters as it has been – are under an obligation to defend."
"What, though, is meant by security for Israel?"
"Firstly, Israel needs neighbours that are themselves secure, that can concentrate on their own economic and social development, that are not dependent on their neighbours, that are not themselves under occupation or suffering from blockades."
"Lebanon, then, needs to be independent, not least from Syria, without military forces occupying it and not under threat of a blockade."
"Secondly, if Israel is to be secure – which is the end we have in view – then there are UN resolutions that must be implemented, first among them the first UN resolution which, while bringing about the foundation of Israel, also envisaged the establishment of a Palestinian state."
"If such a state is to exist and be independent, it follows that withdrawal from the occupied territories will be necessary."
"Let me now quote the view expressed by Gideon Levy of the Israeli newspaper , who said, as do many other Israelis today, ‘The cancer that threatens us more than any terrorism is the occupation of a foreign country and of its people’, and so you, Mr President-in-Office, have been quite right to make it clear, as you have over recent days and weeks, that we have to get negotiations to a point where Israel’s long-term security is guaranteed."
"As was shown by the last war in Lebanon, what we seek will be achieved neither by war and violence – which brings forth only more of the same – nor by unilateral withdrawal, particularly when not accompanied by a guarantee from the armed forces or a peace policy that there will be no more atrocities."
"Negotiation means engaging in dialogue, and if people are to engage in dialogue with one another, they have to accord each other recognition, so we should not talk too much about conditions, particularly if they are one-sided."
"We demand, and rightly, of Hamas that it should recognise Israel within the 1967 borders, but then we must also demand that Israel should accept those borders as well, or we can tell them, from the outset, to sit down and talk among themselves, taking as their starting point the relevant UN resolution, after which we can talk about corrections and so on."
"That being so, there can be only one peace process – one that is based on negotiations."
"Mr President-in-Office, I would like to correct you on one point, in that we are not going ‘back to a peace process’, but rather, in fact, ‘forward to a peace process’, since there has not yet been a peace process that was really effective and promised to be successful."
"I would like to thank you both – Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office – for having, through what you have done and what you have said over the last few weeks, helped us to get a more realistic picture, so that Europe can now really begin to play a major part in setting in motion a lasting peace process of the kind that is needed for the security not only of Israel but also of the region as a whole."
"Mr President, the situation in the Middle East has a direct effect on Europe, and it is unfortunate that it took a war to remind us of this fact, which has become the central focus of diplomatic efforts."
"We all know that what the Middle East needs is a comprehensive political solution: two states, Israel and Palestine; peace in the region where the three countries Israel, Syria and Lebanon meet; assistance from non-radical Arab states; the pushing back of Iran and of its lackey Hizbollah."
"We know what has to happen."
"It is time to put the pieces of the puzzle together, because people are suffering from the violence."
"I am very pleased that you, Mr Schulz, brought up the FDP’s idea for a CSCME (Conference on Security and Cooperation in the Middle East), as Kurt Beck has also already done."
"You have our support in this, and it would be good if this were actually to come about."
"Hans-Dietrich Genscher will be delighted by this."
"Numerous Member States are involved in UNIFIL, the military operation in Lebanon, and units from them form the backbone of this force, but are, unfortunately, national units and not truly European ones."
"This is not good, since we Liberals share in this dream of an ESDP, which Mr Cohn-Bendit so eloquently shared with us."
"However, I want to say one thing, my dear Mr Cohn-Bendit: for a party which for a long time wanted to disband Germany’s armed forces and leave NATO, I find it quite remarkable that you now attack poor Graham Watson just because the FDP has, after long discussion, adopted a well-founded position on this matter and for once is not in favour of it."
"If we had followed your security policy in those days, then Mr Onyskiewicz would not be President of this House today."
"Just as it is clear that we can be grateful to the soldiers who will do their duty in this difficult region, it is also clear that we as politicians must finally create a Common Foreign and Security Policy, one which proves to be worthy of the name when things get really serious."
"The difficulties in the Council have already been mentioned."
"We need to rework existing structures, we need a genuine common decision-making process, in short: we need a big step forward, towards the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"Europe has this responsibility and Europe must discharge it."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, eyes have understandably been on the slaughter in Lebanon."
"However, we must not allow the world to forget the crimes that are being committed in Gaza, which has effectively been turned into a prison for Palestinians."
"Let us not forget that since the end of June, over 200 Palestinians – at least 44 of them children – have been killed; nor forget that thousands more have been forced to flee their homes; nor forget that when we talk about the Israeli prisoners, who must indeed be freed, there are also 9 000 Palestinian prisoners who remain in Israeli prisons, over half of whom are detained without trial; nor forget that elected Hamas parliamentarians remain under arrest."
"It is clear that no long-term peace in the Middle East is possible until we see an end to the Israeli occupation of Palestine."
"There has been much hand-wringing in this Chamber today, saying, ‘if only there were something more we could do as the EU’."
"We beg the Israeli authorities to unblock the Palestinian revenues that are being withheld; we plead with them to open the border crossings; we beg for an end to the air and sea blockade; we plead with them not to start building yet more illegal settlements; yet nothing really changes."
"I believe that the time is long overdue to echo the recommendation of the heads of the EU mission in Jerusalem and call for the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement on the grounds of human rights abuses, as provided for by Article 2 of that Agreement."
"If we, as the EU, do not take ourselves and our agreements seriously, then we cannot be surprised if others do not either."
"Madam Commissioner, you said our credibility is at stake."
"Yes, it is."
"As the EU, we have serious influence in the Middle East and we should be using it to greater effect."
"– Mr President, the invasion by Israel and the flattening of southern Lebanon, the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom received the hospitality of the people of Cyprus, the massacre of victims, all this proves the failure of the doctrine of the so-called war against terrorism. It shows that they mean the technical construction of the new Middle East which the peoples of the region reject and both these objectives are based on the power of weapons and the infringement of international law."
"The slaughter in the region will only stop if the policy of violence on the part of the strong is replaced by fair peaceful dialogue with full respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of states, especially in Palestine and more especially in Gaza, where 70% of the people are hungry and suffering."
"The European Union also bears serious responsibilities."
"President Abbas and efforts to form a government of national unity must be given political support."
"The Palestinian ministers and parliamentarians must be released, the economic isolation of the occupied territories must be lifted immediately and talks must resume."
"Nor must we forget that the core problem is the Palestinian question and whether we want lasting peace in the region."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the resolute language heard here confirms the fact that it is necessary to make CFSP decision-making more effective."
"The resolution here, which we are to adopt, contains many good points, including the requirement concerning the disarmament of Hizbollah."
"It is strange, however, that this organisation is not on the European Union list of terrorist organisations."
"That list includes Iran’s opposition movement, the Mujahedin, which we have on several occasions asked to be removed, without success."
"Why is Hizbollah not included on the list of terrorists?"
"Is it because Hizbollah is represented in Lebanon’s government?"
"Is the provocation of this conflict, involving huge losses, not a reason for speaking openly about these issues?"
"I would like to call on those who are currently responsible for Europe’s leadership not only to devote their energies to the ability to focus resources on reconstruction work and the deployment of peace forces, but also to offer accurate, solid and honest responses concerning the reasons for the conflict."
"Mr President, we have heard several times during this debate of the need for a negotiated settlement and a peace process."
"But with whom do we negotiate and on what basis?"
"The war in Lebanon was caused by Hizbollah kidnapping Israeli soldiers which, unsurprisingly, triggered retaliation by the Israelis and the escalating conflict we have witnessed."
"The leader of Hizbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said that he would not have ordered the troops’ capture and kidnapping if he had known that it would lead to full-scale war."
"What did he expect?"
"Those are not the words of a political leader but of a political gangster and terrorist."
"He ordered the kidnappings because he thought he might get away with it."
"He did not, but he got a war that he could blame on the Israelis anyway."
"The Palestinians have elected a terrorist government under Hamas and the Lebanese have two Hizbollah terrorist representatives in their government."
"These decisions have consequences for the Palestinians and the Lebanese, as we have seen."
"How does the European Union react to this?"
"By sending the protagonists more money: EUR 435 million so far this year to Palestine and EUR 42 million to Lebanon."
"We should let the Hamas and Hizbollah ministers in question renounce their intentions to drive the Israelis into the sea before we consider sending their governments aid."
"Otherwise such payments amount to nothing more than financing terrorism."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the message given out when a foreign minister of a founding Member State of the European Union – the foreign minister of my country – walks arm in arm with a top-ranking Hizbollah representative is not a positive message for Europe to send out to its citizens, to people who seriously want peace and want to help solve the dire problems in which that area is floundering, particularly a tormented country like poor Lebanon."
"France has the unquestionable merit of having laid the most important issue on the table right from the start, by calling for the UN mandate to include an embargo on arms entering Lebanon across any of its borders, primarily from Syria."
"In that respect, however, even after Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner’s speech – although I appreciate the fact that she was very clear that Lebanon needs and has the right to go back to being independent and thus not dependent on Syria – we should be critical of the fact that she did not address such basic issues at all clearly."
"We want to know, and Europe needs to know, what this force is supposed to do, what its duties are and what resources we shall have."
"If anyone says, for instance, that disarming Hizbollah means transferring these noble guerrillas to the Lebanese army, we shall reply that that is not the solution to the problem and, above all, it does not correspond to the objectives that Europe, and with it the Member States taking part in UNIFIL, should be pursuing."
"Furthermore, many military experts point to the dangers of intervening without a mandate that has been accurately and properly drawn up."
"On this fundamental point we need to have the courage to speak out plainly and to demand suitable guarantees – this is something that Europe must do – because our soldiers are out there and it is, of course, Europe’s role."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Europe was needed, and it was the nation states that went in at the stumble, albeit in the right direction."
"This is further evidence that the present structure is getting us nowhere, and it is further evidence that without the Constitution we cannot fulfil our duties to our citizens, because we lack the appropriate structures."
"Moving on to the matter in hand, what we are dealing with here is a dispute that must surely be seen in the context of the wider conflict in the Middle East."
"I can see that there is conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis, but Hizbollah is not the affected party; the Sheba farms are just a token."
"What we are dealing with here is a group not directly concerned in the conflict which, spurred on and supported by Iran and Syria, carries out attacks intended to destroy the State of Israel."
"If we want to arrive at a fair assessment of the situation, we must be clear in our own minds that this is how it started."
"Of course it is possible to debate about whether Israel’s reaction to the current situation was exaggerated."
"I believe it was, but in my opinion we must not forget the basic situation."
"For this reason there must now be clear commitments from Syria and Iran not to supply any more weapons."
"It must be made clear that until now Hizbollah has resisted Resolution 1559, and that militias must not be allowed to have weapons."
"The sovereignty of Lebanon can only be achieved if the government alone has a monopoly on the use of force in its own country and if Hizbollah is not allowed to have weapons."
"For this reason there must also be a clear mandate."
"I understand that nobody today has the power to disarm Hizbollah immediately, but all this beating about the bush – for instance, this current debate about whether inspections at sea should be carried out within the seven mile zone and suchlike - makes me suspect that they are trying continually to create new loopholes in order to make a new rearmament possible, which could then lead us once again into a war."
"This UNIFIL force must have more opportunities to achieve better results, so that 15 000 men are not reduced to the position of bystanders in the same way that 2 000 soldiers have been until now, who have seen where things have been hidden but who have been unable to do anything against this concealing of weapons."
"It is obvious that this must happen in cooperation with the Lebanese Government, but we must face up to this situation clearly."
"We must therefore genuinely demand – not just using phrases of superficial compromise - the implementation of resolutions 1701 and 1559."
"This is surely the relevant point if we are to restore peace in an essential region, a peace that gives us a better chance of tackling the real problems of the Middle Eastern conflict."
"I think it is at last high time that the Quartet makes a joint appearance on site and that it occupies the area with the greatest possible number of Quartet troops in order to ensure that its written demands are carried out."
"Only together can they offer the necessary credibility to back up guarantees of security and to assist in constructing both a secure State of Israel and a viable Palestinian State."
"No one can achieve this alone; it can only happen if we work together, and this must happen."
"We must return to a type of Madrid Conference in order to find a new beginning for the region."
"I also hope that the terror ceases in Palestine, in the Gaza Strip and in the West Bank, that President Abbas finds a way to stop it, and that the Israeli actions are halted at the same time."
"Israel must recognise that its own existence depends upon there being peace now that new weapons with a longer range are available."
"The situation has changed: this is what we have learned from the conflict in Lebanon."
"I hope that this is recognised in Jerusalem and that it is recognised in Ramallah."
"If both sides want to escape eventual destruction and give their children a chance, then they must now come to an agreement, and we too should make our contribution towards achieving this."
"– Mr President, Mr Tuomioja, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, we have witnessed a tragic scenario this summer, which has ended in a bloodbath."
"More than 1 000 Lebanese people have been killed, the majority of whom were civilians, 1 000 000 people have been displaced, a country has been totally destroyed, its infrastructure is in ruins, a sea has been polluted, a farming industry has been poisoned and weapons that are probably illegal are still killing people today."
"This equates to a disaster for Lebanon and many wounds for Israel, in which there has fortunately been less damage done."
"What is more, during this tragedy, a scandal erupted over the UN, paralysed by the United States, being unable to obtain an immediate ceasefire, because Israel needed to be given time to finish its work on the ground."
"The words have been subverted."
"A massacre of civilians is from now on called ‘a disproportionate and indiscriminate counterattack’."
"Invading a country equates to ‘fighting off a militia’."
"Killing a resistance movement is the same as ‘searching for a kidnapped soldier’, but no one is fooled."
"The war was brewing."
"We let it brew."
"It was planned."
"It is true that it involved many actors, such as Syria and Iran, but it also involved – sadly via Israel, which is a victim of the war - the United States, which is still experimenting with its disastrous concept of constructive imbalance in order to redesign the Middle East."
"This concept, which ended in failure in Iraq, has been applied once again and is showing its limitations."
"In this instance, the conflict has deep roots."
"They are in Palestine, which is still under occupation and which is still waiting for a State of which half of the members of the government and of the democratically-elected legislative council are in prison."
"It is also in Palestine that a ceasefire is needed, and where a peacekeeping force is required."
"What is more, while the people of Lebanon were dying almost in front of the cameras, 250 Palestinians were losing their lives very quietly, under the occupation."
"Nothing will be resolved in the Middle East if no solution is found to this conflict with the support of the entire international community, including the Arab countries, the Palestinians and, of course, Israel and the United States."
"I am grateful to France and to Italy for having pointed this out and also to the Finnish Presidency for having flown the European flag again, embarked on this path and begun negotiations with all of the actors, including Syria."
"We earnestly desire an international peace conference."
"That is the European response to the US concept of destruction and constructive imbalance and it is, I might add, the only possible solution."
"We are relieved today, but a page has been turned."
"Europe will, of course, help rebuild Lebanon, but I defended in my group what you want, Mr Gollnisch, that is to say the notion of making those responsible for the destruction pay, not because we will have to claim back our money, but because this is a notion of justice and responsibility and because, without justice and without shouldering one’s responsibilities, there will be no peace in the Middle East."
"– Mr President, each one of the civilian victims of this war is a tragedy, both in Lebanon and in Israel, and it is our solidarity with those who are suffering that I should like straightaway to express in this House."
"This solidarity now features among our main concerns, just as, as has been pointed out, a return to the political process and the road map do, but there is also the release of the Israeli soldiers, support for the democratisation of Lebanon – the history, traditions and culture of which have nothing to do with the terrorist ideology of Hezbollah – the lifting of the blockade of Lebanon, provided that an arms embargo is decreed, and the crucial issue of the disarmament of Hezbollah."
"I should like cordially to respond to Mr Cohn-Bendit, who was asking us just now whether anyone was concerned about these issues a year ago."
"We, Mr Cohn-Bendit – myself and other fellow Members – mentioned Resolution 1559 in March 2005."
"We, the European Parliament, meeting in plenary, mentioned and voted on – I am quoting from memory because I no longer have the note here - ‘the irrefutable evidence of terrorist acts’."
"We called for, and voted in favour of, the disarmament of Hezbollah, and also asked the Council to act along those lines."
"We did do so."
"That being said, I quite understand those who speak today before this Assembly of the need to start a dialogue and to resort once again to diplomacy, but I ask the question: how can Sheikh Nasrallah be made to comply with Resolutions 1559 and 1701 when, on numerous occasions, including as recently as yesterday morning, in the Lebanese press, he has rejected all appeals to disarm?"
"I would come back to what the Commissioner was saying: Europe is now more than ever at a crossroads when it comes to finding new paths and preventing a repeat of past mistakes, something that would prove absolutely tragic."
"Mr President, for a moment I found it liberating when our esteemed colleague Mr Watson said that we must look forward, rather than back."
"However, the people killed so cruelly and senselessly, in this cruel and senseless war, oblige us to ask whether this war could have been avoided, and that is a question that Europe, too, must answer."
"In March 2005, this Parliament adopted a resolution condemning Hizbollah’s terrorist activities and asked the Council to take measures to deal with them."
"No such measures were taken; the Council did not comply with this request."
"As for the UN resolution on disarmament: there was never any initiative on the part of the European Union to ensure its implementation."
"On the contrary, Hizbollah was arming itself massively for years."
"Did our secret services not know this?"
"Did we not notice that Hizbollah were setting themselves up with hundreds of rocket bases under the cover of civilian residential areas?"
"Nothing was done about this."
"Did we really not see that Iran was using this conflict as a means of gaining hegemony in the region?"
"Could we in Europe really not see the impending danger of war, so that we can now so simply cover up our inactivity by looking forward, rather than back?"
"Every side in this House invokes Israel’s right to exist - quite rightly too, and I am very glad about this - but why do we then look on while those who wish to destroy Israel continually reorganise themselves, until social, political and even military panic breaks out over there?"
"Could it be that in looking back we see our own joint responsibility for these events?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as a pacifist, I have never believed that peace could be achieved by means of arms."
"I am therefore not overjoyed at sending troops to Lebanon but, realistically, I realise that we are dealing with a damage-limitation intervention, which is the only possible way to get Israel to withdraw from Lebanon."
"The more neutral the peacekeeping forces remain, however, the more credible they will be."
"Therefore Italy and the other nations involved in UNIFIL must immediately break off all military aid agreements with Israel, such as the one signed by Italy two years ago."
"If the aim is to achieve a lasting peace, troops are not enough, and so I call on the European Union to organise the deployment of civilian peace corps as well along the Lebanese-Israeli border, with their own mandate and managed separately from the military mission."
"We should support the call already made by humanitarian groups for a UN committee of inquiry into possible war crimes committed by Israel against civilians, including the use of cluster bombs and the bombing of civilian infrastructure."
"I agree with the Council’s assessment that there can be no lasting peace in the Middle East without respect for the rights of the Palestinian people. The European Union should therefore formally propose to send in a buffer force between Palestine and Israel as well, and to demand that Israel comply with all the UN resolutions."
"Mr President, the EU is using the conflict between Israel and Lebanon as a pretext for strengthening the common foreign and security policy."
"Our view is that the Member States should act independently in their respective foreign policy relations and coordinate their efforts and common positions within the framework of existing international organisations."
"The UN is the international organisation best placed to bring about a lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East."
"Complex foreign policy issues require long-term global solutions rather than EU measures often characterised by narrow national special interests."
"The international community must become better at preventing conflicts and at increasing the UN’s ability to intervene in time."
"We support the ongoing development of multifunctional efforts to promote peace."
"This work must take place within the framework of UN cooperation."
"Mr President, I do not endorse every act of Israel, but I am in no doubt that in the recent conflict it was not the aggressor and was, as a sovereign State, fully entitled to defend itself against sustained and murderous rocket attacks by Hizbollah."
"The fact that Hizbollah, supplied by Iran and Syria, was able to act as it did while part of the Government of Lebanon illustrates the folly of ever admitting to government any terrorist-orientated organisation, be it in Lebanon, Palestine or, indeed, in my own Northern Ireland."
"In Israel, the level of sustained assault was such that a powerful response was necessary."
"Now, a major challenge for the future is to disarm Hizbollah."
"I trust that critical part of the mandate will not be dodged or diluted; otherwise, we merely store up more trouble for the future."
"Let us learn some lessons and let us address that critical part of the mandate."
"– Mr President, the incredibly violent events that took place this summer in Lebanon are very serious."
"We are witnessing the speeding-up of the historical process, and the ingredients sustaining this conflict have never been so concentrated: more and more military technology, more and more fanaticism and more and more arrogance."
"Given these wayward paths that are being taken, we must be fully aware that we are sitting on a ticking time-bomb that is in danger of throwing the Middle East into a state of unrest in the long term and that will affect Europe."
"Everyone recognises that the continuous build-up of violence has now reached its limits and that international law must be complied with."
"Lifting the blockade of Lebanon is now a matter of urgency, but the main priority is to settle the conflict between Israel and Palestine before it is too late."
"Europe must raise its voice."
"It must make the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean area based on peace, development for all and dialogue among civilisations of decisive importance."
"When it met on 24 August in Brussels, the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly – EMPA – a sovereign assembly that gathers together MEPs, members of the national parliaments of the 25 countries and the elected representatives of 10 Mediterranean countries, decided to send a delegation to Lebanon, Israel and Palestine."
"As chairman of the political committee of that Assembly, I shall be leading that delegation from 18 September, with our mission being to examine the conditions necessary for a resumption of political dialogue."
"Through this delegation, which links the two shores of the Mediterranean, we want to pave the way together for a new stage in a genuine Euro-Mediterranean partnership in which Europe has a crucial role to play."
"Mr Tuomioja, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, the time has come."
"Mr President, let us be clear: to have been successful in prevention, management and, now, post-war reconstruction, Europe would have required the right tools."
"We do not have them yet."
"We do not have a Constitution in force; a Constitution that includes a Minister for Foreign Affairs, allows decisions to be made by qualified majority and enables the Council to call upon a group of countries to carry out the mission which is now going to be carried out by certain Member States."
"We are being offered an opportunity, however: an opportunity that follows a brutal war."
"Italy, France, Spain and other Union countries have committed themselves to participating in a reinforced UNIFIL, the main task of which will be to ensure compliance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701."
"Politically speaking, however, the fundamental issue here is to change direction in the Middle East: change the direction that the United States has tried to impose unilaterally since the Iraq war."
"What a difference between the soldiers who occupied Iraq and the European soldiers who are now going to enforce international law and restore peace."
"Let us not forget that that difference is also based on values: the European Union’s values."
"We do not have to reinvent the wheel."
"We have the Barcelona process and we must use it to the full."
"We must imbue the Middle East conflict with the sprit of the Euro-Mediterranean process, with cooperation, with solidarity, with dialogue between cultures and peoples, in order to establish and maintain peace."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is part of that process."
"It will be my honour to take part in the delegation that it is going to send to the region, led by Mrs Saïfi."
"That is an achievement that we should stress."
"We must defend democracy in Lebanon and we must also be able to promote a new international conference based on the spirit of the successful Madrid Conference."
"Mr President, the Council of Ministers’ failure to call for an immediate ceasefire meant we stood back and let the infrastructure of Lebanon be destroyed and led to more than one thousand civilian deaths both in Lebanon and Israel, not to mention the cluster bombs which will lead to even more."
"I lay that failure directly at the door of the British Government, and Tony Blair in particular."
"What has he achieved with his dog-like devotion to George Bush?"
"Apart from wanton destruction of property and life, it has led to further alienation of the Muslim community."
"He has the nerve to say that he does not believe it will lead to further terrorist attacks."
"If I am angry – and people like me are angry – over Iraq and now Lebanon, what sort of ammunition does it give to people intent on the indoctrination of alienated young Muslims?"
"Nothing, I repeat , excuses terrorist acts, but Tony Blair must wake up to the fact that his actions make him culpable."
"– Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, for the most part I agree with you and I think that you have steered Europe - this Europe which still lacks a Constitution - very well through this crisis."
"You have said that there can be no military or unilateral solution to any of the continuing conflicts in the region, and, while I agree with you, I would like to add that we also have to talk about Iran in this context."
"If we want to prevent Hizbollah from rearming, if we want to prevent Rumsfeld’s threat from becoming a reality after the expiry of the deadline – he thought that there could be a new war – if we want to prevent this, then we Europeans have to recommence negotiations with Iran on solutions to the nuclear conflict and also on ending its support of Hizbollah."
"I believe that we owe this to Israel, but also to the entire Middle East."
"This requires the courage to overcome the American barricade and to say, very clearly: the solution is simple, we cannot consider the suspension of nuclear enrichment, at least for the time being, as a precondition, rather it is our goal."
"However, we cannot demand this as a precondition for talks; rather, we must negotiate in order to achieve our goal."
"That is the way to proceed."
"If we Europeans can achieve this together, then I think we will actually have a peaceful solution for the entire Middle East."
"– Mr President, European public opinion has reacted with satisfaction to the EU’s rapid and un-bureaucratic response to the events in Lebanon."
"It was the Council’s decision to send a seven-thousand-strong contingent of troops to Lebanon that saved the UNIFIL mission."
"Similarly, the portions of humanitarian aid that the Commission provided also saved our image in that country."
"These actions will give us the opportunity to become an important player in the Middle East, rather than standing on the sidelines, as was the case during the Iraq crisis."
"For this to be able to happen in the short term, the most important thing, in my view, is to prepare and lead the UNIFIL mission properly."
"Until recently, this was not a difficult mission and the forces’ mandate was restricted."
"However, the mission now needs to be significantly extended, meaning it will become dangerous, particularly for our troops on the ground."
"Tasks such as isolating Hizbollah terrorists from sources of armaments or disarming the group pose a major threat to the military contingent."
"Secondly, in the medium term, Lebanon needs financial aid, which needs to flow in on a larger scale."
"This is necessary to rebuild the infrastructure, to strengthen democratic institutions, and to modernise and develop the Lebanese security forces In order to achieve this, we need to make use of our , in particular the power of EU cash."
"Thirdly, in the long term, a comprehensive peace solution for the entire region is necessary."
"This means entering into serious dialogue with Syria and successful negotiations with Iran concerning its nuclear programme."
"However, a real agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is also necessary because this is where the key to stability in the Middle East lies."
"Without it the region will remain a flashpoint."
"Mr President, we must look forward, but it is also worth looking back to see how the Lebanon crisis was managed."
"Although the result achieved by European engagement is acceptable, the way in which this result was achieved is not entirely so."
"We have seen how there was confusion for weeks, with debates taking place in the national capitals, but not in the European capital, in Brussels."
"I maintain that it is thanks to the Finnish Presidency and to the Italian Government that Europe has narrowly escaped embarrassment."
"The crisis zone is in our neighbourhood, and we therefore have a particular responsibility."
"It is very nice to hear from Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner that the EU is ready to give humanitarian and practical aid immediately."
"The chain of responsibility for this is clear, as are the mechanisms and methods for it."
"When it comes to political and military aid, however, nothing is clear."
"Here there is a huge gap, a great deficiency, and it took ages for things to get coordinated."
"I would also say that this crisis has once again clearly demonstrated the price we pay for lacking a Constitution."
"We need new instruments, a President of the Council who can call upon the Heads of State or Government, a European foreign minister who can make use of this operational level, a European foreign service which can gather information on the ground, and a group of Member States to be able, through enhanced cooperation, to act on the EU’s behalf."
"Let us look forward."
"I would also say: we now have a chance to become not just financial donors, but also political actors in the Middle East."
"Europe has something to contribute. The CSCE or Madrid Conference must now be the model for the next step."
"We have put an end to the Cold War: this must also be possible in the Middle East."
"Mr President, if many of us see this moment as an opportunity for the European Union, it is not through Europeanist conviction, but rather through Europeanist conviction."
"Only when the European Union speaks and acts as one and in accordance with its weight in the world, and in accordance with its commitments, can it really be effective."
"If it does not do that, then it is not effective."
"We therefore have the historic obligation to make the most of this moment, using the instruments we have, though it is true that we do not have all the instruments we should have."
"This is a time for politics, for putting all of the European Union’s weight and moral authority behind the search for a solution that guarantees Israel’s security without its neighbours having to pay with their lives and their freedom."
"This is a time for European unity in order to demand an end to the occupation, in order to support the authority of the United Nations over the State of Israel as well, which, incidentally, owes its very existence to the United Nations."
"This is a time for united military action within UNIFIL, the legitimacy and political weight of which will increase if it becomes genuinely European, and the instruments are in place to make it so, without the need for a Constitution."
"Let us hope that a lasting peace can emerge from this miserable war."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the recent tragic events in Lebanon and the escalation of the situation in the Palestinian territories have brought the international community face to face with the impasses in this vulnerable region and their repercussions on global peace and security."
"This is of particular concern to us as Europeans, because the economic, political or ecological repercussions of the crisis directly affect the Member States of the Union, while at the same time hampering the joint plan for peace, security and prosperity in the region and the creation of a free trade zone by 2010."
"Europe therefore has vital reasons for seeking peace and development in the region."
"Its intervention must start to exert greater influence for a peaceful solution to these problems."
"Developments in this region indicate to us once again the complex and multifaceted nature of the situation, something which the European Union, due to its proximity and its historical ties and partnerships with the states in the area, knows better than other forces."
"Thus, today, despite its weaknesses, the European Union is less divided than it was during the Iraq crisis and more aware of the need for joint action."
"It is demonstrating this with its intention to apply the Security Council resolution, the need to clarify the content and the role of the peacekeeping force and its participation in this force."
"It must also work for the immediate reversal of the isolation of Lebanon in order for its political, humanitarian and development intervention to become more effective."
"It must, moreover, support the Lebanese Government, which has been damaged both by recent events and by the long-term Syrian occupation and, at the same time, strengthen the democratic institutions and the evolution of the political system towards a popular system in which the creative forces will be freed from narrow religious confines and will operate on the basis of parties and programming statements."
"Such a policy and social development will also bring Hezbollah, which remains a myth and a mystery, closer to 'Lebanisation', transparency and participation in order to resolve the problems."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the conflict in the summer of 2006, which was a bloodbath for Lebanon, we agree that the European Union has an historic opportunity to play a major role in the complex partitioning of the Middle East."
"Our road map has several objectives."
"The first is to convince the international community and all the protagonists in the region that a violent solution – by which I also mean a military solution – cannot guarantee lasting peace, stability and prosperity in the Middle East, whether it be in Lebanon, Palestine or anywhere else."
"The second is to take the lead in promoting the implementation of an overall political solution for the region and to state clearly that there would be no sense in settling the various regional conflicts separately."
"In this connection, we recommend an international conference that would necessarily have to bring together all the actors in the region, including Iran – whose nuclear status is a particularly thorny issue – and also Syria, with which we need to resume association negotiations but without giving up our demands for democratic reform."
"Nor can we any longer ignore indefinitely political forces brought to power through elections, in Palestine or Lebanon, that we ourselves deemed to be democratic."
"Where Lebanon, specifically, is concerned, we need resolutely to commit ourselves to its reconstruction, arrange for the embargo to be lifted without delay, rebuild its infrastructure and destroyed houses and remove the mines that daily put the Lebanese in danger and make a third of the country’s land unfit for cultivation."
"These are not only financial objectives but also political objectives for the European Union."
"Let us not leave the reconstruction solely to Hezbollah and another Qatar."
"Finally, we need, I conclude, to support the democrats and progressive political forces in Lebanon."
"As in the spring of 2005, let us know how to support the determination of the Lebanese to embrace their collective destiny."
"This summer, they have shown what they are capable of."
"Mr President, I will start by quoting an article by Gideon Levy published in on 3 September 2006. He says, ‘Gaza has been reoccupied."
"The world must know this (...)."
"It is in its worst condition, ever."
"Since (...) the outbreak of the Lebanon war, the Israeli Defence Forces have been rampaging through Gaza – there’s no other word to describe it – killing and demolishing, bombing and shelling, indiscriminately."
"‘Nobody thinks about setting up a commission of inquiry; the issue isn’t even on the agenda."
"Nobody asks why it is being done and who decided to do it."
"But under the cover of the darkness of the Lebanon war, the IDF returned to its old practices in Gaza as if there had been no disengagement.’"
"I turn now to the war in Lebanon."
"On this, are our hands clean?"
"Did our Council of Ministers not call for a cessation of hostilities rather than a ceasefire?"
"Did they not know that only a bloodbath could only ever ensue as a result?"
"On this, I accept my country’s responsibility."
"Is it really enough to send blankets and bandages after facilitating the supply of arms that caused the injuries in the first place?"
"Was it completely unforeseeable that Israel would undertake actions against international law by undertaking a policy of collective punishment?"
"Was it really that unimaginable that Israel would seize this as an opportunity to march back into Gaza?"
"Many colleagues speak of terror, but is it not the case that the hand of extremists has been considerably ..."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for all the information they have provided."
"I cannot, Mr President, hide my frustration as a Member of this Parliament when I have to acknowledge yet again that the European Union cannot move with as much speed, determination and authority as it should in such circumstances."
"We have initiated a partnership policy in the Mediterranean region that is not just economic or commercial but must also be political."
"I support the line you are taking, Commissioner, and the more assertive role that has been adopted."
"Italy and France have taken an important initiative: even though the European Union certainly does not yet have its own diplomatic and military capacity, there is still ample room for manoeuvre for it to develop a leading role in many of that region’s affairs."
"The European Union needs to be much more assertive if it is to find a solution for the region’s stability, and it must take action to help the Lebanese democratic authorities to strengthen their institutional structure and the organisation of their state."
"To ensure true sovereignty and real independence, it must supply humanitarian aid and resources, it must ensure that our institutions maintain a top-level diplomatic presence in Lebanon, and it must activate the association agreements with Lebanon and with Syria."
"On this subject, the Council ought to tell us why the agreement with Syria has never been signed, given that we consider Syria to play a very important role in the region."
"The European Parliament too should take the appropriate initiatives to put the EU-Lebanon dialogue into effect."
"Then there remains the problem that has been left unsolved for many years of the large numbers of stateless refugees in Lebanon, who are living in emergency conditions and constitute a potentially dangerous source of destabilising activities."
"A political solution needs to be found for them."
"Lastly, I must mention the conference proposed by the Council: the peace conference is an important moment that must be seized when the time is right, and the European Parliament will certainly not fail to support it."
"–Mr President, there is no military solution to the conflict in Lebanon."
"These words in the joint resolution which we are now debating inspire real cheer and hope."
"In the past, many countries used war was a means of enhancing their prestige and power on the international arena, but these times have passed."
"The words of von Clausewitz, a Prussian general, that ‘war is merely a continuation of politics by other means’ now belong in the dustbin of history."
"This is confirmed by the United Nations Charter, which forbids the use of force to resolve international disputes, the use of aggression and the violation of the sovereignty of another state."
"This is the reason why the entry of Israeli troops into Lebanon was in breach of international law."
"It aggravated the existing conflict, and unleashed the armed reaction of Hizbollah."
"It is a good thing that the European Parliament is paying particular attention to the human dimension of this conflict, and that it is calling on the warring parties to free hostages, to treat the civilian population humanely, and to observe the Geneva Convention of 1949."
"The Lebanese conflict is taking place near us, practically on our doorstep."
"By sending out EU troops and providing humanitarian aid, Europe has already played an important role."
"As an active player, the EU will have a real chance to make a significant contribution to resolving this conflict."
"It is through such action that the European Union creates its own Common Foreign Policy, as described in such detail in the European Constitution."
"It is for this reason, if for no other, that we so badly need a European Constitution."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, unilateralism has been showing all its limitations for some time, and the European Union has finally taken the initiative and promoted a bold intervention together with the United Nations."
"It has thus gained a little time to settle the conflict. The context is of course the entire Middle East, but the priority remains the relationship between Israel and Palestine, and that is where we must start."
"The Union has shown the validity of an approach based on positive interaction between different cultures, the primacy of politics and a refusal to use force: these are precisely the values that have enabled us to live without war in Europe for two generations."
"The European Union can and must promote the same principles and the same transparent, many-sided approach around the world, aiming at conflict prevention through political dialogue."
"For all these reasons I am proud to be European at this moment, and still more to be Italian, in view of the role that my country has played in this context."
"Mr President, the recent conflict between Israel and Hizbollah is a tragedy for Israel and the people of Lebanon."
"For some time, many of us in this House have been campaigning for the EU to declare Hizbollah a terrorist organisation."
"It is clear that Hizbollah seriously miscalculated the scale of the retribution when it decided to kill eight soldiers and kidnap two from northern Israel."
"Hassan Nasrallah, its leader, has admitted as much."
"Hizbollah has a lot of explaining to do as to why its deliberate provocation has caused so much damage to Lebanese infrastructure, with the deaths of so many Lebanese civilians."
"This is partly explained by Hizbollah’s outrageous tactic of using human shields to launch its rockets from civilian-populated areas."
"Israel also seems to have made the mistake of believing that air power alone was sufficient to dislodge Hizbollah, whereas what was required were more boots on the ground."
"Clearly, Israeli intelligence underestimated Hizbollah’s training and equipment, in particular high-tech Russian anti-tank and anti-ship weapons."
"Russia must now explain how its weapons ended up in the hands of an Islamist fundamentalist militia."
"My main concern now following UN Security Council Resolution 1701 relates to who is finally going to disarm Hizbollah."
"Madam Commissioner, what safeguards are in place to prevent the millions of euros of EU aid and reconstruction money from being diverted to Hizbollah through one of its so-called charities?"
"We remember in the past all the allegations of graft when there was direct EU budgetary aid to the Palestinian Authority under Arafat."
"I also want to know what will prevent troops from Muslim countries like Malaysia and Bangladesh, which do not recognise the State of Israel, from turning a blind eye to the rearmament of Hizbollah."
"Lastly, I believe the time has now come under the roadmap for peace to prise brutal but rational and secular Syria away from theocratic, fundamentalist Iran."
"The EU could offer significant trade and aid benefits to Syria to bring it back to the negotiating table with Israel."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by responding to the last speech."
"I wonder what Muslims in Britain and across Europe think when the British Conservatives say that troops from Muslim countries cannot be relied upon to do their job in a United Nations force?"
"Like others speaking in this debate, I believe that further crises in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region can only be averted by refocusing the debate on a just peace between Israel and the Palestinian people."
"Whilst the conflict was continuing in Lebanon, international attention ignored the rockets fired from Gaza and the 250 air strikes, 1000 artillery shells and over 200 killings inflicted on its people."
"Was it justifiable to cut off electricity to half of the inhabitants of Gaza, to close nearly every school, and even to stop fishermen from taking to their boats?"
"The UN has described Gaza as a time bomb whose people are living in a cage."
"Sometimes a moment of crisis brings new fluidity: Hizbollah’s statement conceding it had neither planned nor anticipated the conflict, the prisoners’ initiative, the possible national unity government for Palestine and the recognition by Israeli politicians and public alike of the failings of unilateralism must presage a diplomatic drive to return to a negotiated solution."
"Today we have a map for the road but no one in the car."
"Europe, which has done so much in terms both of humanitarian aid to Lebanon and in evacuating innocent people and committing peacekeeping troops, must now relentlessly pursue that political dialogue."
"We need new dialogue with the Arab world to support UN resolutions and recognise not just election results but also their consequences."
"We need to use intermediaries, such as Turkey, to help with that dialogue and speed up temporary assistance to the Palestinian people."
"Mr President, we are much obliged to the Finnish Presidency for having tried to keep the EU united on this difficult issue, but we do have quite a long way to go before we really have a common European foreign policy."
"If the EU is to have long-term political influence in the region, we specifically need a political strategy, a kind of democratic Marshall Plan for the entire region, which is in actual fact the least free region in the whole world."
"We must naturally help demilitarise and neutralise Hezbollah."
"Damascus and, above all, Teheran have the key to this process, and extensive work needs to be done from those cities."
"We must get the peace process under way again between Israelis and Palestinians, preferably in the form of the conference that fellow Members have talked about."
"To have two democratic states side by side is the only way of creating peace and stability in the region."
"In combination with this, conscious, systematic and long-term faith must also be placed in all the democratic forces in the region as a whole if we are to achieve results."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has finally made its voice heard and has been able to perform an active, leading role in the Middle East crisis, albeit a little late and not without some difficulty."
"That, however, is just a first step on the long road that should lead the European Union, together with the United Nations, the United States and the Arab League, to achieve the stabilisation of a region where all the threats to world security have their origin."
"UNIFIL is a means; the final objective must be the birth of a sovereign Lebanon free from foreign influences exercised in part through Hizbollah."
"I would ask the Council and the Commission what point has been reached in disarming the armed militia that attacked Israel."
"I should mention that last year this Parliament stated that there was incontrovertible proof of terrorist acts by Hizbollah and, by a very large majority of its Members, called on the Council to adopt whatever measures were necessary to put an end to the group’s activities."
"In that regard, Syria is called upon to stop shilly-shallying and to take active steps to help stop the flow of arms intended for terrorists."
"Within the framework of safeguarding human rights, the UNIFIL troops, to whom we send our solidarity and support, must also be entrusted with the task of protecting the Lebanese Christian community: they are not to blame but are caught between the two opposing sides."
"Alongside the Lebanese objective, we should set ourselves a broader aim: the ‘two peoples, two states’ solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis will pull the rug out from under the feet of terrorists and Islamic fundamentalists."
"Achieving this aim will require Europe to play a leading role, but how can the Union be the bringer of peace without a constitution to grant the necessary powers to those who must perform this task?"
"As a result, the debate on the constitution is thrust centre stage once again."
"Rather than an exercise for legal experts, this is the central issue, the issue of how to export beyond our borders the most important result of our 50 years of Europe: peace."
"– Mr President, I had resolved to start my speech differently, but now I shall start by asking Mrs Ferrero-Waldner to read in the magazine ‘Le Point’ the article on relations between Israel and Palestine, especially concerning the serious problem of the water supply to the Palestinian occupied territories due to the practice being exercised by Israel."
"The magazine refers to the apartheid being imposed by the Israeli authorities on the Palestinians on the subject of water."
"What has the Council done over all this time?"
"Last February it decided to freeze financial aid to the Palestinian people, while Israel continues not to pay duty and taxes to the Palestinian Authority without coming under pressure, without some sort of measure having been taken on the part of the European Union."
"I believe, and this is a challenge to the Finnish Presidency, that the European Union and the Council of Ministers should take a decision to lift the economic sanctions on the Palestinian people as soon as President Abbas forms the new national unity government in Palestine."
"This will give an incentive to the Palestinian people, an incentive to the moderate reform forces in Palestine and the Hamas forces to integrate peacefully into the democratic life of Palestine."
"Mr President, following the hostilities the European Union has been widely called upon to lead and contribute the core of UNIFIL, to implement Resolution 1701, to play a primary role in humanitarian aid and reconstruction and to encourage the parties to take part in political dialogue."
"However, prior to the end of the hostilities, we did not punch the weight of a major international player."
"We may have reached a unanimous decision, but it was not a uniform one and we were not listened to either by the Security Council or by the belligerent parties."
"If we had been listened to and these events had taken place a few weeks earlier, the military results on the ground would have been exactly the same but there would have been less loss of life, less destruction, less displacement and fewer Katyushas and cluster bombs, along with everything else qualified as ‘collateral damage’."
"The lessons are there to be learned: neither military might nor Katyushas or Qassams can solve problems, and nor can unilateralism; the EU and the UN need to talk to all the parties, whether they like or approve of them or not."
"Finally, Lebanon needs our full support to consolidate its sovereignty, because that country has suffered a war by proxy for purely extra-Lebanese reasons."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a lot has been said, but I think that this resolution that has been put to the vote is well balanced."
"It presents the facts in some detail but without ever pronouncing judgment and so avoids the pitfall of siding with one or other of the protagonists."
"I regret that our resolution reduces the causes of the Israeli-Lebanese war to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"As General de Gaulle used to say, you cannot go into the Middle East, complicated as it is, with just a few simple ideas, and that is the message that I too want in a way to convey."
"Like all of us, I want to see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict resolved, but do you really believe that this will reduce tension within Lebanon and put a stop to Syrian interference and Iranian ambitions?"
"Moreover, will Hezbollah be disarmed as a result?"
"It is the insecurity and the growing suffering of the Israeli population of Galilee that have triggered hostilities against Hezbollah."
"This state of permanent threat has been fostered not only by the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also, and above all, by Hezbollah’s constant firing of rockets into the north of Israel."
"Israel’s fears are all the greater insofar as the Hezbollah militias are armed by a powerful Iran whose democratically elected President constantly makes known his desire to wipe Israel from the map."
"This is a man who must now be taken seriously, which is what I, for my part, do."
"Consequently, I do not think that the two causes should be confused."
"In the north, Lebanon is concerned to regain its sovereignty and put a stop to the interference by its various neighbours, while Israel wants to guarantee its security."
"In the south, meanwhile, the task is to create an independent Palestinian state within secure borders that is able, over time, to co-exist in peace with its neighbour, Israel."
"Mr President, my whole life engagement with the Middle East does not lighten my own burden of responsibility."
"The situation is grave; we are almost engaged in the process of recreating an Islamic Caliphate."
"In south Lebanon, we are not facing resistance movement militias, but rather special units that are well trained, manned and equipped by Iranian revolutionary guards."
"They are equipped via Damascus international airport."
"This army is probably better than any other Arab regular army."
"Therefore, I suggest we must close and seal the Lebanese-Syrian border, send an EU monitoring mission such as the one sent to Serbia and Republika Srpska in the mid-1990s."
"We must fully control Damascus international airport."
"We need clear rules of engagement."
"I ask you, what precisely does ‘assist the Lebanese army, disarming of armed groups without right to use force’ mean?"
"We have to pull Syria back from its involvement with Russia and Russian interests immediately."
"What can we offer there?"
"We have to bring back Lebanese businessmen to increase investors’ confidence in their country, and we have to stop Iran from smuggling uranium, otherwise regional war will turn into a global problem."
"Mr President, despite the very welcome efforts of the Commission and indeed of the United Nations, it is difficult to display optimism in this dark period."
"Israel, a state that prides itself on its democratic credentials, launched with impunity a destructive war against a neighbouring, struggling secular democracy, destroying its infrastructure and killing its citizens, mostly innocent civilians."
"It has also used inhumane cluster bombs."
"How can we describe the bombing of Qana except as a war crime?"
"And yet Israel continues with impunity to maintain an air and sea blockade of its victim while continuing to squeeze the economic and political life out of Gaza, not to mention the killing of 200 Palestinians under the cover of the war on Lebanon."
"I do not dismiss the malign role of Hizbollah in all of this, nor indeed – as has not been mentioned so far – the malign influence of the United States in encouraging Israel in its actions."
"I believe that Israel must expect to pay for the reconstruction of Lebanon."
"It must release Palestinian monies and it must face an international inquiry into its actions in relation to Lebanon."
"I also believe that an international peace conference that does not carry a price for failure for the protagonists in the Middle East will not succeed, nor will it get off the ground."
"I am talking about a price in terms of money, in terms of trade and in terms of arms supplies."
"Unless there is a price to be paid, those protagonists will not come to the table and will not make a deal."
"Mr President, it is a time of crisis in the Middle East but also perhaps a time of opportunity."
"Europe faces three connected challenges in this regard."
"First, the UNIFIL peace-keeping/peace enforcement mission in Lebanon."
"UN forces led by the EU must ensure that United Nations Resolution 1701 is enforced and that, through cooperation with Lebanese troops and political leaders, Hizbollah can be disarmed."
"UNIFIL II must also ensure that further arms are not smuggled into Lebanon to rearm any groups and that Lebanon’s sovereignty is respected at all times."
"UNIFIL II must be successful."
"A lot is riding on that and failure would have disastrous consequences for the region as a whole and for Europe."
"On the issue of committing troops to UNIFIL II, some EU countries have been generous to date."
"However, most commitment has come from larger EU nations and I hope we will see future commitments from smaller countries, particularly those who have significant experience of peace-keeping in Lebanon in the past."
"In that context, I continue to call on my own government in Ireland to at least make an offer of troops, even if the numbers are small, because I believe they have a positive role to play."
"The second challenge is to help rebuild Lebanon after the devastation of the summer."
"The EU is already responding in this regard, but we should realise that we have an opportunity here, that in rebuilding Lebanon’s infrastructure we can also build the EU’s reputation in the region as a whole, as well as in the minds of the Lebanese people."
"The third challenge is the wider political challenge of the need to provide stability in the Middle East generally."
"In order to do this, we must grasp the difficult nettle of forging a way forward in the Israel-Palestinian problem."
"The wider political roadmap is still there on paper and so we do not need to reinvent the wheel here."
"However, we need to play our part in finding ways to create fresh enthusiasm and acceptance for the roadmap as the way forward and, in this regard, the difficult task of engaging with Syria will be necessary."
"– Ladies and gentlemen, it is with sadness that I have followed the tragic situation in Lebanon over recent weeks."
"Lebanon has made great strides since the end of the civil war in terms of human rights and citizens’ rights, constructing and strengthening a multicultural and multi-ethnic democracy and civil society."
"There has also been enormous progress with economic renewal."
"Unfortunately, though, many of these gains have been diminished or destroyed by the excessive use of military force in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah."
"I firmly believe that one of the conditions for sustainable peace in the Middle East is the existence of an independent, strong and sovereign Lebanon, together with the existence of Israel and a Palestinian State."
"It has been demonstrated in recent months and years, however, that Lebanon cannot achieve this goal on its own."
"It needs help from the international community; it needs help with economic renewal; it needs help with consolidating democracy; it needs help with the exercise of State authority in all of its aspects, including security and military aspects throughout the whole country."
"This is the only way in which the elected Lebanese State institutions will be able to disarm the military wing of Hezbollah and integrate the movement into the country’s political life."
"I should like to call on the Council and the Commission not to backslide in their efforts to help Lebanon."
"Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, fellow Members, on the issue of the way in which we deal with the Middle East conflict, a number of representatives of the European institutions have recently appealed for a structured and overall solution to the region’s problems."
"Mr Brok recently stated that one of the keys to lasting peace in Lebanon was the disarmament of Hezbollah and the monitoring of the Syrian-Lebanese border with a view to stopping the traffic in arms."
"Finally, one of my eminent fellow Members said that we were not the Red Cross and that we were to play a positive political role."
"I agree with all that."
"Indeed, no overall solution can seriously be envisaged without returning to the issue that, since 1948, has been at the source of all the conflicts that have caused blood baths in this region."
"By this, I mean the refusal to recognise Israel’s right to exist."
"It is vital to bear that in mind or otherwise be in danger of confusing cause and consequence."
"Today, it is Iran, together with Syria – its go-between – and Hezbollah – its military wing – that carry this message of hatred, throwing in the face of the international community their desire to wipe a sovereign state and its people from the world map."
"We have a duty as human beings to relieve the misfortune of populations taken hostage by Hezbollah’s terrorist action."
"Our commitment must be balanced if we are to play the positive political role that falls to us."
"Balance does not lie in unilaterally and systematically stigmatising a single party to the conflict, in the event Israel."
"Balance necessarily involves having the warmongers, Syria and Iran, confront their international responsibilities."
"We owe it to two states, Lebanon and Israel - with which we have friendly relations - and we owe it to two peoples, those of Israel and Lebanon, who are our friends and who aspire only to live in peace."
"I would therefore express the wish that the parliamentary mission that will soon visit the region should carry with it this concern for balance and be able to contribute actively to seeking a peaceful solution between people of good will in the region, so affirming our intransigence towards intolerance and messages of hatred while, at the same time, displaying what binds us together as human beings."
"– Mr President, I wish to begin by saying that I fully endorse the speech made by my colleague, Mr Howitt."
"It has already been said that violence cannot be an answer to the problems of the Middle East and neither can unilateralism."
"History proves this: Israel withdrew from the Sinai in the context of a negotiated peace agreement and from the Arava in a negotiated peace with Jordan."
"Israel withdrew from south Lebanon and Gaza unilaterally without agreements."
"Enough said."
"This is the EU’s chance to prove that our approach is right, but it will be a difficult sell."
"I could share with you many personal stories of Palestinian friends and their suffering living under violent Israeli occupation, but I want to share the story of a friend of mine in Israel."
"His name is Renan. He is a DJ."
"He does not want to fight, he only wants to dance."
"He is dead set against occupation and walks at the front of every peace demonstration in Israel."
"However, I was there when he received the call from the IDF to tell him to prepare for the fight."
"He was shocked and afraid, but he said, ‘What do you expect us to do?"
"Hizbollah has been bombing Haifa and Natanya for years now."
"How are we supposed to trust Europe if you are not even willing to call that terrorism?’"
"Our resolution speaks of root causes that need to be addressed."
"Let me try to define these root causes in the words of Daniel Levy, co-author of the Geneva Peace Initiative."
"He said that the Palestinian cause, the injustice of occupation, the hypocrisy of the United States and the West are a grievance for millions worldwide."
"Some abuse and use that and will continue to do so with effect until this conflict is resolved."
"In order to be effective in the region we need the trust of ordinary citizens."
"We can earn this trust only by consistently addressing these root causes, but we can earn my friend Renan’s trust only if we are willing to say out loud that Hizbollah is a radical militant group that abuses the Palestinian cause to strengthen its position as a threat to democracy in Lebanon and as a threat to ordinary Israelis."
"–Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, I would like to briefly raise three issues."
"The first concerns a common assessment of Israel’s reaction to Hizbollah’s provocative and shameful actions."
"It was a reaction that was vastly out of proportion to the kidnapping of two soldiers and which is reminiscent of the Trojan wars fought over the beautiful Helen."
"There are many examples of abductions and political solutions in the world."
"It is difficult to support the reaction of a state whose existence is widely recognised by most of the global community, except for a few fundamentalist states, when this state has shown itself to be a military aggressor."
"This is difficult even for Israel’s allies to accept, as we have heard from prominent Members of this House."
"Secondly, did we really not know that Hizbollah had armed itself with several thousand Katyusha rocket launchers?"
"It was not something that could be done in a week."
"It must have taken months or even years."
"Where were the international observers?"
"If the relevant knowledge and the will had existed, I believe it may have been possible to take preventive measures."
"Now we have started to act by earmarking large sums of money to repair the damage, but is not it too late?"
"After all, we can not bring the dead – the children, the civilians – back to life."
"Now for the final matter, Commissioner."
"This conflict is being prolonged due to the fact that it is part of a so-called social legacy, and may last for a long time yet."
"In order to create the opportunity for a positive two-state solution for Palestine and Israel, both sides need to be thoroughly prepared for such a solution through appropriate education, from primary school upwards."
"Such preparation may create a social foundation that will allow political decisions based on compromise to be taken more easily in the future."
"Perhaps the next generation – the children and young people of today – will reach the decision that we consider to be the only sensible solution for us."
"– Mr President, 2005 saw the tenth anniversary of the Barcelona process, a relatively lengthy process aimed at establishing sound ties with the other side of the Mediterranean."
"Previously in this Chamber, I gave you an optimistic overview of its ambitions, of the whole process and of the path of trust that had been trodden up to that point."
"Yet, as a Member of this House, a defender of the European project and a staunch advocate of international law, it was extremely difficult to observe without alarm the way in which the majority of Europe’s institutions monitored the events that took place this summer."
"Until June, Lebanon was one of the most promising democracies, politically and economically speaking, in the Mediterranean and was capable of continuing that progress. The country was also one of the biggest receivers of EU funds to support its reconstruction and development."
"Today, however, Lebanon has to start again from scratch, everything has to be done again, everything has to be rebuilt – at least in terms of what euros and concrete are able to redo and rebuild."
"Is there nothing we could have done earlier?"
"When we saw the conflict between Israel and Palestine unfold, should we not have taken prompt action?"
"When we saw the various international observers at the Palestinian elections having their authorisation removed, diplomatic and parliamentary immunity repeatedly violated and legitimately elected Members of Parliament and ministers detained, should we not have taken action?"
"Is it not the case that our relative indifference at the time and our inadequate response bore some of the responsibility for the whole situation?"
"I am sure that Europe did not do all it could to prevent this situation and did not take the necessary steps to turn words into real action."
"We must not make the same mistakes again, and after today’s debate this is absolutely clear to all speakers."
"The EU’s role in this process is a vital one and demonstrates once again that the political strength of the EU is crucial to the world’s stability and balance."
"Mr President, these are not just isolated incidents that we are witnessing in the Middle East, but rather a broad panorama of crises with global impact."
"When we discuss and even criticise the efforts of the United States to eradicate tyranny and support democracy in Iraq and elsewhere, we must not ignore the games of Russia and China in the region, which may easily end up transforming the region into a burning crater of global terrorist war."
"Everything is pointing to this threatening direction."
"Under the auspices of Russia, Iran is becoming a major aggressive player in a region that is extremely important to humankind."
"The political expansion of Iran is now targeted at precluding democracy in Lebanon and Syria, stability in Iraq and peace in Palestine."
"The Iranian regime is easily distracting the attention of the UN and the EU and gaining more time for its key objective – nuclear hegemony in the Middle East."
"The utopia of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is not likely to ever materialise."
"The next page in history will be terrorist organisations taking power in elections: Hamas and Hezbollah are already participating in state governments and no one dares to ask Hezbollah ministers in Lebanon to choose between working for either a democratic government or a terrorist organisation."
"On the contrary, the United Nations is entering negotiations with Hezbollah; negotiations with Al-Qaeda will surely follow."
"Many of our problems arise from our reluctance to put up a united fight to defend ourselves against the evil; however, we are late to surrender."
"Israel is left alone in its desperate struggle."
"The Western democracies have shown no initiative – they are still defending themselves without any strategy and thus losing."
"It is time for Europe to wake up."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to announce that, at the end of the talks with the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, the Israeli Prime Minister has announced that Israel's air and sea blockade of Lebanon will be lifted tomorrow at 5 p.m."
"– Mr President, in recent weeks, amid the appalling loss of life and humanitarian misery in the Middle East, it has been difficult to see any shaft of light."
"At least the moderate Arab States have now witnessed the catastrophe that can so easily be provoked by organisations such as Hizbollah, and Lebanon has seen the effect of tolerating a State within a State."
"Perhaps now there can be more sympathy for Israel’s concern to ensure that Palestine is not entrenched as another terrorist State and a base for perpetual war against the Israeli people."
"It would be a tragic wasted opportunity if the reinforced UNIFIL merely became a bystander while Hizbollah prepares for its next attacks in the months and years ahead."
"If there is not the international resolve to disarm Hizbollah – and that is a pity – then at least there should be a requirement to monitor and report on Hizbollah’s activities."
"The Council should encourage Member States to make representations to this effect at the United Nations."
"Resolution 1701 mandates UNIFIL to assist the Government of Lebanon to secure its borders."
"We would encourage the Lebanese Government to take robust action in this field."
"–Mr President, the Israel-Lebanon crisis is no longer typical of the conflicts in the Middle East that we have become accustomed to over the decades."
"It clearly marks the start of a new global conflict between Iran and Syria, Hizbollah and Hamas, the Sunnis in Iraq and Al Qaeda on the one hand and the United States and its allies on the other."
"This means we need new political measures to resolve the conflict in this part of the world."
"Europe now needs to get involved in resolving the conflict in Iraq."
"In the same way, the European Union must also look at ways of dealing with Afghanistan."
"The global threat requires a joint response from the European Union, the United States and NATO."
"Europe needs a common foreign and defence policy."
"Russia has to decide which side it stands on."
"And Europe must emphatically demand such a decision, both in relation to Iran’s nuclear programme and arms shipments to Syria."
"How did Hizbollah manage to arm itself with Russian weapons?"
"."
"Mr President, I have to thank the European Parliament for this debate, which has been, as always, very colourful, interesting and pertinent, as well as wide-ranging."
"For me, the essential message has been that the European Parliament is appreciative and supportive of the Council’s efforts to end the conflict in Lebanon, to oversee the restoration of full Lebanese sovereignty and to facilitate a return to the Middle East peace process."
"Indeed, if anything, you want the European Union to do even more; to be more coherent, to be more efficient."
"As President-in-Office of the Council, I share this desire for us to speak not only with a single voice, but one which will be heard in all quarters and noted by all parties."
"Realistically speaking, even in the best of times, there will always be limits to what the European Union can do acting alone."
"Indeed, as a Community committed to effective multilateralism, that is as it should be."
"The EU does not seek, in this conflict in the Middle East, to act by itself."
"In Lebanon, we are working with others and we have to bring others on board to work alongside us."
"That is the role of the European Union, but we also have to take the initiative and show leadership."
"It should be remembered, too, that we would never seek to bypass or replace the United Nations."
"We are there to support the United Nations, to help it to bear its responsibilities. In this respect, the European Union has been able to live up to those expectations."
"I have also read carefully Parliament’s motion for a resolution on the Middle East, which I assume and hope will be adopted unanimously."
"I regard it as a very good resolution, fully in line with what we have been trying to do and will continue to do in the Council."
"It shows the ability of the European Union, and of the European Parliament, to concentrate on the essentials and give a message that will prompt all those involved in the peace process to engage in it fully."
"."
"Mr President, I would once again like to return very briefly to the humanitarian aspect of the question, which has also been discussed here."
"A few weeks ago, Commissioner Louis Michel and I visited the area, and it was very obvious that there was immense suffering among civilians on both sides of this conflict."
"It is very important and meaningful that the European Union, that is to say the Commission and the Member States together, should be committed to providing Lebanon with massive volumes of economic aid in this crisis right from the start, both in terms of emergency humanitarian relief aid and early recovery, which is now under way, as well as longer-term reconstruction."
"In this connection we should recall that we have stressed everywhere that the humanitarian situation is also very serious in Gaza."
"It is very important that the Lebanese Government plays a central and leading role in the long-term reconstruction process, one in which it acts as coordinator, and for that reason it is good that a new unit has been set up in Prime Minister Siniora’s office to put this coordination process into effect."
"The reconstruction process also needs a thorough needs analysis, and the Union will collaborate with Lebanon on this."
"It is absolutely clear that a state of peace is also the main precondition for improving the humanitarian situation and, because of that too, we will need a comprehensive and long-term political solution to the whole range of problems that exist in this region."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I should like to thank everyone for this discussion."
"It has been an excellent one and given us great support."
"Nearly everybody said that there can be no military solution to the conflict and that there can only be a political solution."
"Now, with the European Union having again undertaken to move forward with an initiative, it is highly important to have gained your support for adopting a broad approach, for looking at the possibility of going to the root causes and for eventually finding a comprehensive solution."
"That is the overall picture and I thank you very much."
"I should just like to answer two or three specific remarks."
"Firstly, the Commission believes that we should work together with Israel and not suspend the Association Agreement."
"We believe it is very important to work with the Israelis in order to exert an influence, and that we must engage with them, not the contrary."
"Regarding Mr Tannock's point, no one has ever managed to prove the allegations that the European Union provided the money to others and not to the government."
"With regard to Hizbollah, it is clear that our money will go directly to the government or to organisations that work with the government because, as I have said, we want to empower the government and to give the country back its sovereignty."
"To wind up the debate, I have received six motions for resolutions, pursuant to Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon."
"In this Middle East crisis, as in so many before in this area and around the world, the innocent have suffered most for their leaders’ ambitions."
"Hizbollah will claim that it is attempting to retake the Golan Heights, and Israel will claim that it is retaliating for these incursions by bombing Lebanon."
"The difficulty is that everyone has some justification for taking action, but there is no acceptable justification for displacing tens of thousands of innocent Israeli and Lebanese civilians."
"When we see the children killed in Qana, all justifications seem petty and shallow."
"The Irish army was stationed in Lebanon for many years as a peacekeeping force, and there is a great affinity between the Irish and the Lebanese because of this."
"We as a country have become familiar with Lebanon through family members or friends or neighbours who were stationed there and we feel the damage inflicted on their country all the more for this."
"These people do not want this life; they want peace and safety for their families and a chance to live their lives."
"There is no military solution to these problems, only peaceful solutions."
"And whether that means imposing sanctions on all involved until they end their war or offering advantage to those who end it, we who have the capability must act."
"– Nobody can turn a blind eye to Israel’s latest war against Lebanon, which was bombed for 34 days, with the support of the USA and the passivity of the Council of the European Union, causing the acknowledged deaths of 1 084 civilians in Lebanon and 41 in Israel, and with thousands more injured. Furthermore, around a quarter of the Lebanese population have been forced to leave their homes, essential infrastructures such as airports, ports and electricity power stations have been destroyed, and a large area of sea off the Lebanese coast has turned black."
"According to the United Nations Development Programme, the bombing has destroyed 15 000 homes and 78 bridges and has damaged 630 kilometres’ worth of roads, amounting to a loss of at least USD 15 billion to Lebanon. What is more, bombs have been directed at civilian targets, in flagrant violation of international humanitarian law."
"Our condemnation of this war should also involve calling on Israel to pay the costs of rebuilding Lebanon, to end its occupation of the Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian territories, to end the blockades of Lebanon and Gaza to release Palestinian ministers and Members of Parliament immediately and to negotiate the exchange of prisoners held by Israel for detained Israeli soldiers."
"There will be no lasting peace in the Middle East until Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese sovereignty is upheld."
"Broken by 34 days of war, Lebanon – which was, however, enjoying rapid development – is again the hostage and victim of a crisis with which it is unable to deal."
"The European Union will help the Lebanese to rebuild their destroyed country and to get back on their feet and resume normal life and, in this connection, our humanitarian and emergency aid is vital."
"Our role should, however, go beyond that of providing emergency aid."
"The European Union should act in its own right to bring about peace in the Middle East."
"By participating in UNIFIL, several Member States are making a commitment on the ground under the banner of the UN, and they have made a just decision."
"It is, however, united as Europeans that we should intervene to have Security Council resolution 1701 complied with, help to free prisoners, arrange for the blockade of Lebanon to be lifted, support the demarcation of borders and re-establish political dialogue."
"In this crisis, the European Union has shown that its intervention could change the course of events and help resolve a conflict."
"Reality confronts us with our political responsibilities."
"It is time for us to carry out the reforms needed by the European Union if it is to be the political actor of our neighbours’ hopes and our own expectations."
"I regret that the European Council did not call for an immediate ceasefire after the outbreak of hostilities by Israel on Lebanon."
"Israel’s action was disproportionate."
"Israel should now be asked to help rebuild Lebanon on the basis of ‘the destroyer pays’."
"There should be a committee of inquiry on war crimes and the EU should revisit its economic and military cooperation with Israel."
"We should also be aware and condemn the fact that the conflict in Lebanon was used as cover for even more intensive and brutal oppression of the Palestinian people."
"The EU must work for a peaceful and just settlement to the disputes in the Middle East, particularly by pressing for a secure and independent Palestinian State."
"– At the root of the brutal attacks on Palestine and Lebanon is the USA’s plan for Middle East domination. The USA actively pursues a policy of interference and shows scant regard for sovereignty and international law, and its ultimate goal is the geostrategic control of the region and control over the region's ample energy resources."
"Within a context of contradictions, there has been broad agreement between the major powers of the EU and the USA, with the process of drawing up Resolution 1701 a prime example of this."
"The EU has never condemned Israeli aggression, demanded a cease-fire or called for international law to be respected."
"The reality of the situation must not be obfuscated by transforming the victim into the aggressor and vice versa."
"It is Israel that is illegally occupying Arab territories, Israel that fails to honour the many UN resolutions and Israel that actively undermines the creation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian State by means of a policy of State terrorism."
"For there to be peace in the region, Israel must withdraw from all occupied Arab territories, dismantle the settlements and the wall and release political detainees; refugees must be able to return, and an independent, sovereign Palestinian State must be created with East Jerusalem as its capital."
"All States in the region must be guaranteed their sovereignty and security, and the region must be demilitarised and rendered free of nuclear weapons."
"– Exactly five years after 11 September 2001, the current conflict in Lebanon offers the international community a chance to review and correct the clearly inappropriate approach taken to solve the friction between the so-called Western and Islamic worlds."
"For five years, in fact, ongoing conflicts (in Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan) and the most serious diplomatic tensions (on terrorist attacks, the Iran issue, etc.) have all revolved around the same point, and therefore they cannot be eradicated just by means of more or less legitimate military missions created every time and always under different names."
"The opportunity must now be grasped to form a genuinely multilateral force, with the participation and commitment of all the interested parties. Its aim must be to solve the problem that lies at the root of all of these conflicts, which is the clash of ideologies between two different cultural blocks."
"We need to seek and find a basis for dialogue as soon as possible, an opening that we, as ‘democratic’ countries, have a duty to pursue."
"It must address the most pressing issues on which we diverge the most, from political and religious ideologies to economic systems."
"I hope that the European Union will not miss the opportunity to promote such a dialogue but will sponsor it at an international level."
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0325/2006)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Council."
"What plans does the Finnish Presidency have in relation to making progress on the revision of the Working Time Directive (COM(2002)0149 final(1)) and the Temporary Agency Workers Directive (amending Directive 2003/88/EC(2))?"
"Does the Council seek further progress in relation to these issues during its six-month period of office?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the honourable Member for his interest in the progress on the revision of the Working Time Directive and the Temporary Agency Workers Directive."
"Following the tremendous efforts of the Austrian Presidency preceding us, it is one of the main aims of the Finnish Presidency to reach agreement on the Working Time Directive."
"The directive quickly needs to find a jointly agreed solution in order to comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the SIMAP and Jager cases."
"The Presidency thus also intends to do all it can to ensure that the Council reaches a compromise settlement as soon as possible regarding the as yet unresolved ‘opt out’ issue."
"The Temporary Agency Workers Directive is another complex and politically delicate issue."
"As you know, differences in labour market structures and practices have led to differing views between Member States, and the problem has been to find an appropriate balance, where temporary agency employees would be given adequate levels of protection while at the same time the market in companies that provide a temporary workforce would be allowed to develop and grow."
"Recently, the Member States have renewed their commitment to the Lisbon objectives, including increased levels of employment and the availability of better jobs, which are evident in their national reform programmes."
"The Council believes that these objectives can be achieved in such a way that the different practices and traditions that obtain in national labour markets are respected."
"The matter was last discussed by the Council in June 2003."
"Since then, different Presidencies have had discussions at various levels to ascertain whether opinions had altered."
"Up till now there have been two distinct views on the matter, so it has not been worth putting this issue on the agenda of future meetings of the Council."
"The Finnish Presidency will examine the issue and is also expecting some input from the Commission, which said in its communication on the screening of pending legislative proposals that it would reserve the right to reconsider the proposal based on what emerges in other discussions on future proposals."
"The Presidency understands very well that it is important for the European Parliament to make progress in this area."
"We will be aware of the general opinion on this when the vote on the first reading of the Services Directive is voted on."
"If the Commission delivers its vital input with regard to this matter during our Presidency, we will be ready to undertake some constructive work to find a solution that is acceptable to all the Member States."
"Thank you, President-in-Office, for that very full answer and for your honesty, particularly on the question of temporary agency workers."
"You will be aware of our frustration in this House, particularly with regard to the Working Time Directive, and are right to say that this has been discussed in previous Presidencies."
"However, I would like to ask you a very frank question: what is different about the Finnish Presidency, and can you get the Members of the Council together and broker a deal in the interests of working people?"
"Can you give a commitment today that every effort will be made to take the Working Time Directive forward and to put the Temporary Agency Workers Directive on the agenda?"
"."
"Mr President, the commitment can be given that the Presidency will work very hard to find a solution for the Working Time Directive."
"An incentive for this is, for example, that the way in which doctors’ working hours are interpreted causes huge problems for the Member States, and for this reason too it is very important to find a solution for this directive."
"It is still too early to say, however, whether we will be able to achieve the outcome that we would like to see."
"In his supplementary question Mr Moraes referred to the interests of working people."
"Is the Council aware of some research concerning large European countries published in the in recent days, which shows that the majority of working people in all those countries, with the possible exception of Spain, want more flexibility in their working hours, not less?"
"Will the Council take this into account when trying to broker a deal?"
"."
"Mr President, I am not too sure if we are aware of this article in the Financial Times, but of course we are in many ways aware of the general trend, and as I have already said in my original answer and my last one, and in view of the developments that have taken place in the Member States, it is important to achieve a solution both in the matter of the Working Time Directive and that of temporary agency employees."
"– Do you believe that it is possible to solve this problem with the social partners in the context of a social dialogue – since they are, in fact, mainly responsible for the problem, also as far as working times are concerned?"
"Taking this into account, do you also believe that a solution is possible if this matter is delegated to the social partners – to the representatives of the employers and the employees?"
"."
"Mr President, this is obviously something worthy of debate, and is an issue that can be raised at the tripartite discussions, but for the moment we are in fact actively seeking a solution that is acceptable among the governments of the Member States specifically."
"In what way will the Finnish Presidency support the commitments given by the Member States' governments with the adoption of the European Youth Pact to increase employment for young people?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should stress how important it is that the European Youth Pact should cover a wide area."
"The needs of the young have to be taken into account in all relevant policy areas."
"For example, in attempting to improve employment for young people, it may be important to enact various measures removing barriers to education and mobility."
"The question by the honourable Member relates in particular to how the Finnish Presidency intends to support the commitments of the governments of the Member States to improve employment."
"The Member States are responsible for planning and implementing their own employment policies, including those concerning young people."
"Member States are also responsible for most of the other policies connected with this issue, such as education policy."
"The Presidency may nevertheless have an important job to do in raising these issues, especially while the work of the Council of Ministers is being organised."
"During the Finnish presidential term, the Council convening in December intends to deal with several questions directly connected with employment of young people."
"The Council will be presented with a report by the Employment Committee which examines the Member States’ national reform programmes, including their employment policies."
"The result of the survey by the Employment Committee just last year was that all the Member States tackled youth unemployment with reference to the Youth Pact and mentioned a raft of measures that had been introduced to build appropriate paths to employment for the young."
"There had been very great progress made in linking this to another priority area, the investment in human capital."
"This had been done, for example, by developing the transition from education to employment."
"Finland expects that the Member States’ employment policies this year will also focus attention on resources for youth employment and ways of improving it."
"Youth employment is also certainly high up on the agenda in the talks to be held by the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 1 December on demography and enhancing productivity through more and better jobs."
"During the Finnish presidential term, the Council will discuss two issues that directly relate to improving employment for young people."
"Firstly, improving opportunities for lifelong learning is something that affects everyone, including the young."
"Secondly, the Finnish Presidency will try to propose concrete measures to improve accessibility to young people’s information services and provide quality information for all young people on important matters such as employment."
"Special attention needs to be paid to deprived young people."
"In March, the European Council asked Member States to include young people and youth organisations in the implementation process relating to the European Youth Pact."
"The Finnish Presidency proposes to discuss initiation of an analytical dialogue at Council level with and between all youth sector actors, including young people and youth organisations."
"To sum up, I will say that during the Finnish presidential term the matter of improving youth employment will be on the Council’s agenda in many connections."
"Finland urges all Member States to focus attention henceforth on the European Youth Pact and on the various ways of improving youth employment."
"– Mr President, thank you for such a complete reply and for the prospects which are opening up."
"The third part of the European Youth Pact makes provision for measures to reconcile the family and professional lives of young people, so that they can create new families in Europe."
"At a time when unemployment is being successfully combated, do you not believe that a vicious circle is being created?"
"That young people cannot easily create new families and that the demographic problem will get worse as a result?"
"Does the Finnish Presidency intend at the end of its term of office to present us with the positive results of its actions on reconciling family and professional life?"
"."
"Mr President, one element of this Youth Pact, of course, is the attempt to improve young people’s education, their social participation and the transition to employment."
"For that reason it is very important, and this autumn we also propose to support the decision allowing endorsement of such multi-professional skills, in order to facilitate young people’s transition from education to employment as well, this being one of the thresholds involved."
"Obviously, reconciling work and family is still a separate category, but all these things are linked individually to the competitiveness strategy, that is to say the Lisbon Strategy."
"On the basis of the agreements reached by the European Council of 15 and 16 June 2006, what concrete measures has the Council adopted or will it adopt to restrict illegal immigration by citizens of third countries and facilitate their possible return to their countries of origin?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the readmission and repatriation of illegal immigrants is one of the key factors in the Union’s policy on immigration, especially within the framework of a comprehensive approach to the question of immigration."
"I would refer the honourable Member to the concrete measures and initiatives which the Council cited in the general answer it gave this year to oral questions H-0440, H-0455, H-0473 and H-0478/06."
"Regarding the period since the European Council in June, I would refer the honourable Member to the Euro-Africa Conference on Migration and Development, which Morocco organised, with the active involvement of Spain and France, in Rabat on 10 and 11 July."
"At the conference an action plan was adopted."
"Its third section specifically covers matters relating to the fight against illegal immigration and the repatriation of illegal immigrants."
"All the countries attending the conference stressed their commitment to the rapid implementation of the action plan."
"On 17 July, the Council adopted conclusions on immigration, stating once again that illegal immigration must be effectively prevented at Union level."
"The conclusions also made mention of the significance of other immigration routes, especially in the Union’s neighbouring regions to the east and south-east, and the preparations that are under way for the next Euro-Africa Conference on Migration and Development, which Libya has promised to host."
"On 19 July, the Commission published a communication on policy priorities in the fight against illegal immigration of third country nationals."
"It also deals with matters relating to repatriation and readmission."
"It was presented to the Council on 24 July, and the Council will examine it at a later date."
"At present, the Council is discussing a proposal for a directive on common norms and procedures to be applied in Member States when repatriating nationals of third countries who are illegally resident."
"Talks on readmission continue in accordance with the guidelines and competences agreed by the Council."
"The Commission and the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union also reported back on the implementation of key measures included in the comprehensive approach at a meeting of the Council held on 24 July."
"President-in-Office of the Council, thank you very much for your reply, but I would like to point out to you that, despite all of these agreements, illegal immigration via the Canary Islands is still increasing."
"Almost a thousand immigrants are currently reaching the Canary Islands every day."
"Reception centres are overflowing, there is no way to return the immigrants to their countries of origin and the commitments made by 16 countries have not been fulfilled, except in the case of your country, since Finland, together with Italy and Portugal, has sent a naval unit."
"At the end of the day, however, all of these measures, which look very good on paper, are not actually applied."
"We are facing a real avalanche of immigrants, causing alarm amongst the civil population and concern for the whole of the European Union, since these immigrants have not come to get into the Canary Islands, but to get into the European Union, and that has consequences for its labour markets."
"."
"Mr President, the case that the honourable Member raises is in every respect a very important one from the point of view of the European Union and the Council."
"The European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union has asked Member States for surveillance vessels, radar and border security experts to implement its own operation in the Canary Islands."
"It is in the Council’s interests to strengthen cooperation in this area by developing forms of combined operations, and the Finnish Presidency intends to improve Europe’s integrated system for controlling external borders."
"I just wondered how the Council expects the EU to meet the increasing challenge of illegal entry and the need for returns when in its draft budget for 2007, and compared to the Commission’s bid, it has actually cut the appropriations for Frontex, the Borders Agency to which the Minister referred several times, and the European Return Fund."
"I hope Parliament will be able to restore these cuts, but how can these be priorities when the Council is not following through on the financial commitments?"
"."
"Mr President, it is obviously important that we also have adequate resources available to repatriate illegal migrants and to monitor that process, but I would also stress here the importance of the comprehensive approach to the problem of illegal immigration."
"Then there is the matter too of cooperation with the other countries from which these illegal immigrants are arriving, and whether we can also improve conditions in the countries of departure, so that it would not be necessary to repatriate so many illegal migrants from the European Union."
"– I would be interested in hearing your opinion about the possibility of establishing a model of best practice in the field of return to countries of origin."
"Do you think that the agency that the Commission has set up in Vienna might be able to produce a study of which methods have led to people choosing to return to their countries of origin?"
"."
"Mr President, the European Agency for the Management of Operational Co-operation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union can also help in greater cooperation in the area of repatriation operations."
"As with everything else, the exchange of experience and good practice are obviously important."
"In spite of the Toronto Declaration from the World Health Organisation and the United Nations' mention of the abuse of older people in the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, Member States have implemented legislation that deals with the related issue of domestic violence but that omits specific reference to protection for vulnerable older people."
"The private care sector, for example, is not sufficiently covered by the current legal framework in many Member States."
"This can be seen in the UK, where the Human Rights Act does not apply to those who receive privately-funded care."
"Will the Council urge the Member States to close these legal loopholes and respect the basic human rights of their older citizens?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council would first like to thank the honourable Member for having drawn attention to the matter of respect for the fundamental human rights of the elderly."
"Because the Union is based on the principle of respect for freedom, democracy, human and fundamental rights and that of the rule of law, the Council is naturally concerned about any possible loopholes in the legislation that would mean that the rights of older people are not being respected."
"Respect for the fundamental human rights of all EU citizens and all people residing in the European Union is included in the Treaty on European Union, and the Charter of Fundamental Rights adopted in December 2000 by EU leaders confirms those rights which result from the constitutional traditions and international obligations common to the Member States."
"Abuse of the elderly in care is not only a human rights issue, but also a social, and in some cases, a criminal one."
"This being the case, legislative action must be decided upon at national level, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."
"The Council also wishes to stress that it upholds the principle of non-discrimination."
"It has already implemented measures to prevent discrimination and prejudice based on the six criteria of discrimination in Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, and intends to continue implementing such measures in the future."
"One of the criteria referred to is age."
"We should nevertheless remember that it is the European Commission’s task to monitor the implementation of, and compliance with, EU legislation in the Member States, and to submit proposals for justified legislative measures for approval by the European Parliament and the Council."
"The Commission has made a proposal for recommendation by the Council regarding the prevention of injuries and better safety."
"One of the priorities is the prevention of violence between people."
"The proposal will be on the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council’s agenda when it meets on 30 November and 1 December."
"I am very pleased that the Minister has said that there is further legislation coming forward on Article 13 regarding age."
"Can the Minister assure us that elder abuse will be given appropriate attention by Member States in the national action plans on health and long-term care?"
"Will the Minister urge the Council and the Commission to release any results on elder abuse across Member States, so that we can have an exchange of best practice?"
"."
"Mr President, we obviously have to remember that, concerning the need for a separate law on the protection of the elderly, it should be decided upon nationally in the Member States."
"As I said in my answer, however, the issues on the safety of the elderly are to be discussed at the Council meeting on the subject at the end of November."
"In Austria, the families of old people who need care are increasingly resorting to employing illegal care workers, since the state care allowance is insufficient to pay for authorised professional workers."
"In addition to proposing an increase in the care allowance, we are therefore also discussing a Social Year and appropriate retraining for the unemployed, as well as ‘care semesters’ for prospective medical students."
"Has the proportion of undeclared employment in the care sector also risen in other Member States, and which suggestions for solving this problem are being discussed, or rather, which proposals should be supported by the EU?"
"."
"Mr President, naturally, the aim is to build and promote a common European policy in a direction that would allow us to create joint quality criteria for services, regardless of how they are produced and financed."
"I cannot take a view on what the share of the grey workforce is, but this entire area of controversy is in my view linked to the question of the European social model, on which subject there was an excellent debate here yesterday in plenary."
"Yesterday we had a debate on the Daphne programme, especially as regards women and children."
"We are hearing a lot about the abuse of the elderly and it might be possible to take this question on board, because it covers a similar area."
"Two months ago there was a large meeting with eight European organisations of elderly people."
"Could this question be taken on board within the framework of Daphne?"
"."
"Mr President, the current Daphne Programme to which the honourable Member refers, and which is against violence, at present applies in particular to violence against women, but, as the honourable Member says, there are obviously also ways of exploring how the situation might be improved at European level with regard to elderly people too."
"In March 2005, Nicola Calipari, an officer in the Italian Military Intelligence and Security Service (SISMI), was killed at a road block in Iraq during the liberation of an Italian hostage."
"Despite the representations made by the Italian Government, the US Justice Department has stated that it will provide no information over and above that contained in the report by Multi National Corps Iraq."
"Unfortunately, the highest Italian authorities, and especially the Italian judiciary, have found the information contained in that report to be insufficient and incomplete, making the closest possible cooperation with the US authorities essential."
"Will the Council address this matter within the scope of its CFSP remit so that these events can be fully clarified?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has not examined the incident referred to by the honourable Member, an incident it considers to be a bilateral issue between Italy and the United States of America."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, so is the answer that the Presidency does not intend to take any positive action at all on the matter that has been raised?"
"."
"Mr President, the answer is that the Council has not discussed or looked into this issue, but we have various kinds of mechanisms in progress, in the sense that the European Union and the United States have negotiated an agreement on mutual judicial assistance, which also has a certain connection with cases of this kind."
"At present we need more internal procedures to have this agreement enter into force."
"I wonder if the Council would agree that this specific case highlights a more general problem that the United States expects Europe to cooperate with it on judicial matters, but when Europe asks the Untied States for cooperation, that country is much less willing to give it?"
"Will the Council have a debate among its Members to discuss how it might put more pressure on the United States to cooperate with the European Union on judicial matters?"
"."
"Mr President, the agreement on mutual judicial assistance that I just referred to will help speed up the assistance process, when it enters into force, in many kinds of legal problems, and could also be one key factor in faster and more effective cooperation between the Union and the United States."
"As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together."
"What is the Council Presidency’s view of the current state of democracy and the rule of law in Russia, particularly as regards media freedom, the situation of non-governmental organisations, independence of the judiciary and the conditions under which, for example, former Yukos managers Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky are detained?"
"Does the Council Presidency consider that a strategic partnership between the EU and Russia is compatible with the European values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which Russia does not respect, as the following examples indicate: the violation of freedom of the press, restrictions on civil society through the NGO law, human rights violations in Chechnya and the conditions of detention of Platon Lebedev and Mikhail Khodorkovsky?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council believes that the strategic partnership with Russia must be based on the common values endorsed in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement, especially those to which Russia is committed as a member of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe."
"The same values are also mentioned in the new treaty arrangements between the EU and Russia."
"It is the Council’s opinion that if there is to be better stability and welfare in Russia, effective democracy will need to be established at all levels in the Russian Federation, as will compliance with the rule of law, an independent judiciary, and unconditional respect for human rights, including freedom and independence of the media, and for a viable civil society."
"Like the honourable Member, the Council is concerned about recent developments with regard to the rule of law, obvious curbs on freedom of the press, the concentration of power, and new legislation in Russia that restricts the work of NGOs."
"The Council is likewise concerned about the human rights situation in Russia, and especially in Chechnya."
"The Council is following developments closely and will raise these problems and issues regularly in political dialogue with Russia, in particular at the talks on human rights held twice a year."
"The Council will also be monitoring the implementation of the recently amended law to prevent action by extremist movements, with particular reference to the now wider definition of extremist movement."
"We read that the German foreign minister wants to table in the Council a proposal to bring about common values by creating closer, long-term networks between the EU and Russia."
"Is this not absurd, when Russia is not even prepared to change the poor conditions under which Mr Khodorkovsky is being held, conditions which contravene its own laws, or rather not even prepared to bring these conditions into line with its own laws, according to which prisoners must be kept close to their home town?"
"Have you spoken specifically and directly with Russia about the case of these two Yukos detainees?"
"I would like to ask the same thing as the previous speaker, because this represents a case in which Russia is in glaring violation of its own laws."
"However, obliged though I am for the answer to this question, it does, I think, raise yet another, namely whether, given the increasingly deteriorating condition of human rights in Russia, you believe that the concept of a strategic partnership with Russia is in itself possible or has a promising future."
"Do we not rather have to develop new models of cooperation, models which, alongside economic and security policy considerations, actually guarantee respect for human rights?"
"."
"Mr President, there is no longer any need to establish these common values as such, because they already exist."
"They have been endorsed in the Partnership and Co-operation Agreements, and Russia is committed to them as a member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE."
"Obviously, however, there are challenges of all kinds associated with making these values conspicuous in practice and in the implementation of legislation."
"These areas of dissatisfaction in the independence of Russian courts are indeed challenges for an evolving constitutional state, which we will be monitoring very carefully."
"It is nevertheless very important that there should be a good deal of two-way communication within the framework of this strategic partnership."
"For example, consultations on human rights are being held next in November."
"Moreover, political dialogue, which is engaged in with Russia on a regular basis, provides an opportunity to discuss and raise these problems in the area of human rights."
"The economic situation in Russia is indeed very prosperous, but in the field of human rights there is a massive deterioration going on."
"Does the Council really believe that the measures it has introduced - namely, dialogue within the context of a strategic partnership – are up to solving this problem?"
"Rather, does not this truly massive deterioration suggest to the Council that it should try a new strategy: reminding a neighbour of the European Union of commitments that it made in the context of its international relations?"
"."
"Mr President, the European Union and Russia are strongly linked in very many different ways: through peace and stability, economic cooperation and many other things."
"That is why it is important that the strategic partnership should establish a good basis and framework for this mutual dependence which exists between us."
"With the communication and political dialogue that accompanies this, and which exist at present, we can remind Russia of these human rights challenges, and that is what we do."
"So, at this stage at least, the Council considers that the existing mechanisms provide a good basis for improving communication and the situation regarding human rights."
"Mr President, Minister, while we are on the topic of the strategic partnership between the EU and Russia, I would like to draw the attention of the Council to the fact that this Parliament noted in its resolution this year that ‘the present partnership with Russia is more pragmatic than strategic, since it puts common economic interests in the first place, while failing to achieve any changes in human rights and the rule of law’."
"Does the Council not think that the position of the European Parliament should be considered more closely, especially as the term of the present Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Russia is nearing an end?"
"."
"Mr President, the Council does listen to Parliament’s opinion and listens very carefully."
"These matters obviously need to be gone over now, while we are preparing for the renewal of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement and the establishment of a mandate to renew it."
"I, however, believe that, while this collaboration is a very pragmatic one, it could in addition be much more dynamically strategic in nature than it is today, and that the European Union and Russia can also work in parallel, and as each other’s partners, in global forums."
"Will the Council clarify the legal position resulting from the European Parliament vote of 15 June allowing embryonic stem cell research in the EU?"
"Can an organisation based in any Member State apply for EU funding for embryonic stem cell research, even if that research is illegal in the Member State where it plans to carry out that research?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 15 June 2006 the European Parliament adopted its opinion on the first reading of the framework decision on the Seventh Framework Programme in accordance with the codecision procedure."
"The Council, for its part, reached political consensus on the Seventh Framework Programme for research on 24 July 2006, and this consensus is responsible for the outcome of the vote by the European Parliament."
"I would refer at this point to document number 11978/06, which mentions the political consensus reached on the Seventh Framework Programme."
"The point of consensus is to be able to prepare a second reading of the Seventh Framework Programme scheduled for the autumn."
"The result of this will presumably make it possible to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme before the end of the year."
"The Community Framework Programme for research makes it possible to grant Community aid only to those research projects that are covered under the programme’s scope of application and have passed through the selection process."
"Research must of course comply with the legislation in those Member States in which it is intended to carry it out."
"Thank you for your answer, Madam President-in-Office, I appreciate it."
"My question really refers to a situation in which a country does not have a legal framework in place."
"Looking at what was voted through here in Parliament, we talked about research being subject to strict licensing and control in accordance with the legal framework of the Member State, but what if it turns out that a Member States does not have a legal framework in place?"
"In my own Member State, Ireland, for example, there is no law governing embryonic stem cell research."
"Where, then, does that leave this decision by Parliament, and would the Council suggest that all Member States would need to put such a framework in place immediately?"
"."
"Mr President, the situation is of course problematic if such things have not been precisely regulated in national legislation, but according to the position adopted by the Council, the main conditions for funding are a precise ethical evaluation of each project proposal and consideration of the legislation in Member States."
"It is therefore important to realise that the intention behind this single solution and decision is not to create rules on bioethics that apply to Europe generally but to make a clear decision on something less broad in scope, which is what sort of stem cell projects can obtain funding from this Community programme."
"I am very glad that you have made it clear that it is up to the legislation of the Member State concerned as to whether it can undertake research."
"This is purely related to the funding of it."
"I should be interested if the President-in-Office could tell us what opportunities she sees in the ability to undertake stem cell research and to fund it at a European level."
"."
"Mr President, national legislation is certainly something which will evolve in the years to come, because stem cell research is something new, although, as part of general European competitiveness and cooperation on research, it will be necessary to see whether added value can be achieved from cooperation at European level for research into this area too."
"At the annual summit of European and American leaders in Vienna, President Bush said that he wished to close the controversial prison camp at Guantánamo Bay but that he was awaiting a ruling by the US Supreme Court as to where the prisoners could be tried."
"In addition, it is necessary to ascertain how countries can take prisoners back."
"Some will have to be tried in the USA if there are no guarantees of due process in their own country."
"According to Bush, some 400 prisoners currently remain in the camp."
"Does the Council know how many Europeans are being held at Guantánamo Bay?"
"Could they not be returned with a minimum of delay and tried in Europe, where the most guarantees of correct treatment exist and as President Bush himself has suggested?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council is not responsible for the protection of EU citizens abroad; that is up to the Member States."
"Nor has the Council discussed anything to do with the number of Europeans held in Guantanamo Bay."
"Mr President, it will come as no surprise that the reply to this question which I submitted as early as at the beginning of July, immediately following the summit between the European Union and the US in Vienna, is somewhat disappointing, because the question is very much linked to one of the topics that was discussed at that summit."
"I would therefore be very interested to know whether any progress has been made and whether the Council has any intention of urging the United States to make haste in letting us know how many European citizens may be tried in the European Union and whether the Council is prepared to insist on a specific time schedule in this respect."
"."
"Mr President, Guantanamo Bay is of course still a serious matter of concern, but the European Union warmly welcomes President Bush’s announcement that he wishes to close Guantanamo Bay, providing that a solution is arrived at on these practical matters."
"Let us hope that progress is made in this area."
"On 29 June, the US Supreme Court ruled that military tribunals were illegal."
"At 7.45 p.m. CET, President Bush is due to make an announcement that he is seeking to change the law to make it possible to try Guantánamo Bay prisoners – including EU citizens – by military tribunal."
"If he makes that announcement – which I believe he will – can the Council protest in the strongest possible terms about this travesty of justice, as a matter of urgency?"
"."
"Mr President, the European Union has on many occasions stated that the treatment of prisoners captured on the battlefield must comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the customary rules of international humanitarian law, and must respect human rights."
"Furthermore, it was the view of the informal meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Klosterneuburg in the spring that the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay should be closed as quickly as possible, so the Union has clearly expressed its opinion on the subject."
"I do not think I have heard such a feeble statement as ‘the Council is not responsible for the protection of EU citizens abroad, that is just up to the Member States’."
"We take international action to try to protect the citizens of other Member States, for instance in the Balkans, but we will not have any joint action to protect our own citizens."
"Does the President-in-Office not agree that if the EU had said way back in 2002 that it was unacceptable for our citizens to be detained without charge or trial in Guantánamo, then they might all be free by now, or put on trial and convicted if that was what should happen to them?"
"."
"Mr President, it is important for the Presidency, representing the Council as it does, to keep within the limits of its competence."
"Any discussions which the Member States may have entered into bilaterally concerning the protection of their citizens are their own business."
"It still needs to be said that the European Union has on several occasions raised the matter of Guantanamo Bay in discussions with the United States, and these talks will be continued."
"Will the Finnish Presidency renew efforts to get agreement in the Council on a framework decision to combat race and religious hate crime as proposed by the Commission in 2001 and strongly backed by the Parliament?"
"Will you encourage the Commission also to come forward with a measure to combat homophobic hate crime?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has been waiting for an outcome on a framework decision, as at least one Member State has had serious reservations about the text in the form that it was in in 2004."
"As the Member State in question recently withdrew its general veto, the Finnish Presidency intends to work closely with the next country to hold the presidency, Germany, to have the issue discussed by the relevant working groups so that a framework decision can be taken as soon as possible."
"There are no proposals on the Finnish Presidency’s agenda relating to homophobic hate crime, which the honourable Member refers to in her question."
"I am very grateful for that positive news, which is most welcome."
"But I am sorry that the Minister feels that there are no proposals on homophobic hate crime."
"Does she not think that the EU really ought to be tackling the challenges of both racism and homophobia in their acute form of violence and hatred across Europe?"
"We are becoming years out of date with the challenges that we are meeting, not least because of the third-pillar problems of the veto in the Council to which she had referred."
"Will you also make progress as regards the in bringing the third pillar – the intergovernmental part – into Community competence so that we can be more effective and democratic?"
"."
"Mr President, I agree with the honourable Member that the European Union should try and intervene in key challenges, but, obviously, we have to do so step by step, and we cannot respond to all the challenges at the same time."
"We intend to prepare a follow-up to the seminar for experts held in June in connection with the framework decision, and after that we can certainly consider this proposal for a framework decision for a working group to deal with."
"As regards the , which the honourable Member mentioned in her additional question, as has been stated here before in Parliament, during its presidential term, Finland will actively look into ways of improving decision-making, leading to joint action in the area of legal matters and internal affairs."
"I am delighted that the one Member State's objection has been lifted to the adoption of the framework decision."
"Will the Presidency urge the COREPER Working Group to expedite their work on this matter so that we can get this adopted as soon as possible?"
"Would the Council further agree that the adoption of such a framework decision would send a positive signal to our ethnic minorities in the European Union, particularly the Muslims, who feel under a lot of pressure in our continent at the moment?"
"."
"Mr President, the fact that we are making progress with the framework decision does not mean that it is now problem-free: differences in attitude to freedom of speech, the principle of legality and legal systems in the Member States in this regard still lead to unanswered questions."
"On the basis of discussions held so far, we now propose to draft a more focused proposal for a framework decision, about which it nevertheless has to be said that it will hardly have had time to be drawn up before the next presidency is behind the wheel."
"On Monday 12 June 2006, approximately one hundred Iranian women activists demonstrated in Teheran."
"They were demanding changes to the laws which discriminate against women in Iran."
"The demonstration was brutally broken up by police and 70 demonstrators were arrested."
"What political condemnations will the Council make and what practical action will it take in bilateral contacts in response to the Iranian regime's violent attacks on women's rights activists and the violations of women's human rights which are taking place in Iran?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council has frequently expressed its concern regarding the plight of women in Iran."
"In its resolution last December on the human rights situation in Iran, one that also had the Union’s support, the UN General Assembly expressed its grave concern over discrimination and other human rights violations, including the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice."
"The Council deplores the worsening human rights situation in Iran."
"When it met on 20 March 2006, it condemned the harsh response to the peaceful demonstration organised on International Women’s Day."
"When it met on 15 May, the Council expressed its concern about the increase in the number of executions, random arrests, the tightening of restrictions on access to information, and the increase in violations of freedom of speech and freedom of religion."
"The Council was referring in particular to the intimidation and harassment of advocates of human rights lawyers and minority groups."
"When it met on 17 July, the Council focused special attention on the continuing violations of freedom of expression and association, including the violent break-up of the peaceful demonstration by those demanding an end to laws that discriminate against women."
"The Council is therefore aware of the incidents connected with recent demonstrations."
"The EU still intends to raise questions of human rights, including the rights of women, both with Iran directly and in international forums."
"The Union intends to state its concern both in the confidential and in the public context."
"During the Finnish Presidency, the EU has already made three public statements on the human rights situation in Iran."
"On account of the death of the student activist, Akbar Mohammad, at the Evin prison on 24 August, the Presidency said that the EU was seriously concerned about the harsh treatment of dissidents, opposition leaders, student activists and all defenders of human rights in Iranian prisons."
"In an official statement made at the end of July, the Presidency stated that the Union was gravely concerned about the worsening plight of the defenders of freedom of speech and human rights in Iran."
"The statement made separate mention of the prominent human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani, who was sentenced to five years in prison."
"Mention was also made of Ali-Akbar Mousavi Khoeini, who was arrested during the demonstration in support of women’s rights on 12 June, the lawyer Farshid Jadollahi and Omid Beruzi, who were also sentenced to prison, and the arrests of defenders of labour laws in Tehran."
"An official statement was made on 10 July, in which the Finnish Presidency expressed the European Union’s concern that the Iranian academic Ramin Jahanbeglu is still in detention."
"The Council is still trying to organise a meeting between the EU and Iran within the framework of the human rights dialogue which began in 2002."
"At the meeting both parties would have the opportunity to discuss all their worries concerning human rights."
"Thank you, Mrs Lehtomäki, for your detailed answer."
"I am also very pleased that there has been such a strong and prompt reaction to these incidents, for I believe that there are many who, like myself, think that things are moving in the wrong direction."
"This event is proof of the fact."
"When one cannot even have a debate on these issues without being attacked in this way, fundamental work needs to be done."
"I therefore wonder if there is any possibility of the Council taking the initiative of supporting the women’s organisations that exist."
"Parliament recently adopted a report on women in conflict management, at which time we talked about how we could take the next step in this area."
"My follow-up question arises, then, from my belief that many people are concerned about the fact that things are moving in the wrong direction."
"."
"Mr President, as I said, the Council is very worried that the situation seems in many areas to be deteriorating."
"At least as a matter of policy, we have also supported and will continue to support women’s organisations in a way that continues to highlight these human rights issues and the current problems, both in direct contacts and in international forums."
"We have also asked the Iranian authorities several times for further clarification of the violations of human rights that have occurred in the country."
"Does the Council feel that the decision by some Member States to insist on a referendum before any further enlargement is a form of protectionism, deliberately designed to prevent certain countries joining the EU?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ratification procedure for any treaty or convention, including one connected with the accession of new Member States, is up to each Member State itself to decide on."
"For that reason, the Council cannot comment on the ratification procedure, nor would it be proper for it to do so."
"If the Council says it is inappropriate to comment in any way, it is probably difficult."
"However, I wonder if I can tease something out from the Council, perhaps in a broader sense."
"Does the Minister not feel that the mood perhaps changed in Europe after the negative referendums in France and the Netherlands, and that some people in certain countries have a fear of enlarging the European Union and perhaps see that calling a referendum would put a block on any future enlargement?"
"."
"Mr President, the mood has not changed, at least in the sense that, much to our satisfaction, the conclusions of the European Council in June, in which the matter of the Union’s absorption capacity was also covered, clearly stated that absorption capacity would not be a new criterion imposed on applicant countries, but something separate which would also have to be taken into account within the European Union."
"The Finnish Presidency proposes to have a thorough debate on all aspects of enlargement at the European Council in December, and after that we will certainly have a better idea than we do now of what the general mood is in the Member States with regard to this issue."
"Can the European Council make a statement as to what measures it has implemented this year at an EU level to combat international terrorism and also say whether it intends to bring forward any new EU initiatives in this political field of activity in the immediate future?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the Counter-terrorism Coordinator drew up a comprehensive report in May 2006 on EU action to combat terrorism, which also covers the area of external relations."
"The report is the response to a request by the European Council to have a six-monthly review of the implementation of the action plan on counter-terrorism adopted in June 2004 and last amended in February 2006."
"The report contains a summary of the progress made since December 2005."
"The European Union’s policy to combat terrorism is defined in its counter-terrorism strategy adopted last December."
"With the recent events in London, it became clear that there would be a need for closer cooperation than ever between terrorism and air security experts."
"EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers will be continuing these discussions at the informal meeting of the Council in Tampere."
"Thank you for your response, President-in-Office."
"On foot of your final comment, particularly with regard to what we saw happening in London recently, there did not seem to be any coordination with other Member States in the European Union."
"Perhaps they were not at the same level of threat as the UK on that occasion."
"However, there is still a lot of uncertainty concerning the security measures in airports."
"These depend on where you are travelling to and from."
"Perhaps there is now a necessity for closer cooperation and coordination concerning these matters."
"At Tampere will the transport ministers be included in these discussions on how to protect civil aviation from these threats?"
"."
"Mr President, we intend to step up that sort of cooperation and coordination as soon as we can."
"During the Finnish presidential term, we will be updating the counter-terrorism strategy and the action plan that goes with it."
"Furthermore, as I mentioned, it has become clear that there is still a need for closer cooperation between terrorism and air security experts."
"The other example concerns liquid explosives."
"The law enforcement authorities in the Member States will focus special attention on this question and others at their various meetings in the future."
"On the subject of combating international terrorism, can the Council tell us what steps it took to encourage the return of three IRA members convicted of international terrorism in Colombia, who later took refuge in a Member State of the EU – namely Ireland – and continue to enjoy sanctuary there?"
"Is it not clear that the EU undermines its credibility as regards taking a stand on international terrorism if it acquiesces in Member States harbouring wanted and convicted international terrorists?"
"."
"Mr President, it is obviously important that the European Union is able always to act coherently, in order to preserve its credibility too, and above all to remain effective."
"Perhaps we will be able to meet this challenge of coherence better if we engage in cooperation in the field of legal and internal affairs and in more effective decision-making."
"I hope the Minister will bear in mind that the current restrictions on travel and the security measures at British airports are causing enormous disruption to normal commercial and economic life."
"I hope the Presidency will bear in mind, when coming to any concerted position at a European level, that it must make sure that economic and commercial life is able to continue."
"."
"Mr President, the restrictions on air transport and travel, which obviously apply especially to luggage, are not just disrupting commerce, but a large number of passengers too."
"It is for this reason that it is so important for experts on terrorism and air security to work closely together to find the right level of security: sufficient to protect citizens from terrorist attacks, but at the same time making it possible to travel as normal in the future."
"As the authors are not present, Questions Nos 14, 15, 16 and 18 lapse."
"Question No 17 has been withdrawn."
"As the EU is preparing to operate with combat forces, various countries' combat units will in turn be sent on tours of duty."
"Does any agreement exist between the Member States concerning the division of costs in the event of a combat unit being mobilised for military action during its tour of duty, and has it been agreed within the Council what is to be done if a country component of a duty unit does not wish to participate in an operation decided on within the EU?"
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, taking a decision to send troops for the EU’s crisis management operation is in all cases up to the Member States concerned."
"Troops are assembled from volunteers in accordance with decisions taken nationally on the matter."
"The joint operational costs of the European Union’s military crisis management operations are financed with reference to Article 28(3) of the Treaty on European Union."
"This paragraph 3 states that any operational expenditure to which the implementation of these provisions gives rise is to be charged to the budget of the European Communities, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications and cases where the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise."
"Similarly, paragraph 3 goes on to say that in cases where expenditure is not charged to the budget of the European Communities, it will be charged to the Member States in accordance with the gross national product scale, unless the Council acting unanimously decides otherwise."
"This is what is stated in Article 28 of the Treaty then, and the Member States sending troops are liable for other costs on a national basis."
"Mr President, Minister, the second part of my question was completely ignored."
"What should be done in a situation where a country on stand-by duty has no inclination whatsoever to take part in an operation like this?"
"."
"Mr President, as I said, the operation is initiated by a unanimous decision of the European Union, and a decision is taken in the Member States regarding any single operation."
"Stand-by duty troops would at the same time be made up of a larger whole."
"It remains to be seen what the reaction will be in a situation such as that proposed by the honourable Member."
"First of all, I congratulate the Presidency-in-Office for the work that has been carried out in organising the coordination between the Member States of the peacekeeping group that is going to Lebanon."
"Following on from what you have said, President-in-Office, on the division of labour – some countries are obviously more able to provide logistical support than others – I would like to ask whether there is any coordination as regards who can best implement the various facets of the operations, or is that still a matter for bilateral relations between Member States?"
"."
"Mr President, any stand-by duty troops would be assembled to form a team that works well together, and so there will have been coordination, as mentioned by the honourable Member, right from the preparation stage."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"The next item is the report by Bastiaan Belder, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on EU-China relations (2005/2161 (INI)) (A6-0257/2006)."
"I have received a request from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, pursuant to Rule 168 of the Rules of Procedure, to refer the report by Mr Belder on EU-China relations back to committee."
"Does anybody wish to move this request by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament?"
"Mr President, my group has requested that Mr Belder’s report on EU-China relations be referred back to committee because we consider it to be inadequate and unbalanced in addressing a number of issues covering relations between the EU and China."
"The PSE Group also believes that there are a number of factual errors in the report which could only be corrected via a huge number of amendments."
"However, we are of the opinion that such an important report from the Committee on Foreign Affairs concerning a global power like China needs to be re-examined and re-discussed in detail."
"This is because the report contains 125 recitals and paragraphs, of which only two paragraphs are on EU-China cooperation."
"Just 13 paragraphs concern foreign policy, while some of the EU’s basic principles of the last 30 years are ignored."
"Global security and energy issues are barely mentioned, and therefore we need to bring balance into this report."
"We urge the House to refer this report back to committee, where we will have sufficient time to address these extremely important issues as regards EU-China cooperation."
"The Commission is currently doing a tremendous job in dealing with EU-China relations in more than 20 different policy fields, including foreign policy, global security issues and energy issues."
"We need to act together to define a coherent position based on facts and clear information from the relevant departments in the Commission and the Council."
"Parliament’s position will be greatly strengthened and we will be more influential in achieving our common goals if we give ourselves some extra time to prepare and reflect on this report again."
"Now that the request has been moved, does anybody wish to speak in favour?"
"Please be patient, Mr Speroni."
"In accordance with the Rules of Procedure, there is one speech in favour and one against."
"At the moment I am asking whether anybody wishes to speak in favour."
"Mr President, I feared that no one else would come out in favour."
"Allow me, then, to do so."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we are tackling this request in a totally constructive spirit."
"I should like to say that, in the human rights area and whatever the outcome of the vote to follow, we shall of course support all the amendments in favour of human rights."
"These are not, therefore, even at issue today."
"What we should like to remedy – and this is what Mrs Dobolyi wanted to emphasise – are factual errors, shortcomings and deficiencies that are still extant."
"We should also like to re-establish somewhat closer relations with the rapporteur."
"That is all."
"Mr Tajani has the floor in order to speak against the motion."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a comprehensive piece of work, which has been endorsed by a large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, must be voted on by this House."
"I acknowledge and I also take on board some of the comments made by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, given that we have tabled (as the PSE Group is well aware) an amendment designed to bridge a possible gap in the report, namely the reference to the one-China policy (ruling out Taiwanese independence)."
"By choosing to debate the report, we will thus be able to reach a comprehensive agreement, a sign that tensions are easing and that attention is also being paid to the requests made by the PSE Group."
"In my opinion, the report is thorough, it can be examined and various parliamentary groups also want to examine it and to endorse it."
"I believe that we are right to tackle the debate this evening and to proceed with the vote tomorrow."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the right time, only a few days before the EU-China Summit in Helsinki, this House is sending a clear and forceful signal to the Council and Commission with a view to establishing a strategic partnership that is truly worthy of the name."
"The present report offers Brussels and Beijing benchmarks for all facets of mutual relations: credibility, stability and responsibility."
"As a European rapporteur, I saw it as being of the utmost importance that I should listen very carefully to the Chinese discussions about the impressive peaceful development of the People’s Republic over the past three decades."
"These also spelled out the dark sides, with all the implications that these entail for the EU-China partnership."
"It is only logical that these should also be included in the draft resolution."
"A large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs endorses this specific approach on account of its indispensable and valuable contribution, for which I extend warm thanks to the Members concerned."
"The public responses from the Chinese Embassy in Brussels during the various stages of my report oblige me to give you my position, in summary, in three key areas: the Ankang system, freedom of religion in the People’s Republic and the issue of a peaceful annexation of Taiwan to China."
"In a letter of 25 April, the Chinese Embassy flatly denied that political and social dissidents were subjected to compulsory psychiatric treatment."
"This abhorrent torture method is officially known as Ankang, which translates as: health through rest and peace."
"As it happens, the 3 November 2005 issue of the German weekly included eyewitness testimonies of three victims of this Ankang system under the revealing title ‘Electric shocks against the freedom virus’."
"On 14 December 2005, the published an equally damning article on Ankang."
"Disregarding these, the Chinese Embassy advised this House to delete Paragraph 24 of the draft resolution on Ankang as being completely unfounded, and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, acting as if there were nothing wrong, tabled an amendment to that effect."
"I asked the Committee on Foreign Affairs to withdraw the amendment on two occasions, but to no avail."
"The Ankang system is completely at odds with the basic human rights that surely all of us warmly support, as I heard Mrs De Keyser say only a moment ago."
"I am therefore completely perplexed by her attitude."
"I would urge you to remove this blot on Parliament’s escutcheon, and support the original text on Ankang which I am re-tabling as an amendment."
"We already know enough about the many violations of the basic fundamental right of freedom of religion in China."
"This applies just as much to critical internal discussions about this government action, even down to the offices of the state bureau of religious affairs."
"I would have really enjoyed talking to those officials who were so approachable during my visit to this state institution last autumn."
"According to the Chinese mission to the European Union in its 31 August news bulletin, the Chinese people enjoy extensive freedom of religion."
"I would hereby invite it publicly to translate and publish the recent interview with China’s ‘religious big boss’ to clarify just what control the party exercises, for what is positive and negative in religions is to be assessed by the Chinese Communist Party and nobody else."
"The overwhelming majority of the Taiwanese people do not in any event wish to be subject to the same control."
"This is what I heard from European diplomats on the ground and from many Taiwanese citizens themselves."
"One of them explained why Beijing’s doctrine of peaceful reunification, certainly the ominous one-child policy, which is the PSE's key issue, does not have a chance in hell at the moment with those people: ‘It is not so much about ideology or nationalism as it is about the difference in political system and in respecting all human rights as a way of life."
"This does not stand a chance as long as China does not abandon its authoritarian regime, which is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future’."
"I assume this adequately addresses the socialist amendments, which, moreover, curiously deviate from the officialise used in EU documents, raise the subject of two systems with regard to China and Taiwan. That is rather revealing."
"This report represents Parliament’s commitment to a solid partnership between the European Union and China."
"That is why it is honest in listing the obstacles in this political pursuit, certainly now that these are being recognised just as much on the Chinese side – I invite you to read the report which contains statements by the Chinese, not least by Chinese academics – but which, politically, are not at all sufficiently recognised as obstacles and eliminated as a result."
"The message we must send to the Council and Commission on the eve of the summit with the Chinese leaders is that China needs to be helped to establish the rule of law and to be encouraged to carry out political modernisation as the necessary social parallel of its astonishing economic development."
"."
"Mr President, let me begin by welcoming this debate. I thank the honourable Members and the rapporteur in particular."
"Let me make a few strategic remarks at the outset."
"As you will be aware, the ninth EU-China Summit will take place in Helsinki in just three days’ time."
"It will be a very important opportunity to discuss current issues and concerns at the highest level."
"However, I should also like to focus my contribution today – particularly in the light of the focus of your report – on how we can bring a more strategic approach to our relations."
"I may then add a few words on some specific items."
"Our relationship with China is one of the key issues facing the European Union today and one that is constantly on my mind."
"This is true across the board, whether on environment and climate change, energy security, non-proliferation, global and regional security, economic and trade relations and specific issues such as illegal migration."
"There are also all the issues relating to the rule of law that you have mentioned."
"We all know the key challenges."
"Firstly, China’s economic growth has been phenomenal, but, at the same time, it is still a developing country and more fragile than we might think."
"To be sustainable, economic growth must be accompanied by social and political reform."
"Secondly, China has a vital role to play in creating more stable international energy markets and dealing with environmental challenges."
"Thirdly, accelerating globalisation – which is increasingly identified in the public mind with cheap production in China – is an issue and is leading to pressure for protectionism in developed markets, which both the European Union and China need to work to avoid."
"Fourthly, China, like the European Union, wields global influence."
"Will this support or hinder a rules-based multilateral world order?"
"Put simply, the question facing us is how we should respond to the rising superpower with whom we certainly share interests and common ground, but – and let us be realistic here – with whom we also disagree as regards some very fundamental values and beliefs."
"Before suggesting some principles that should guide our strategic response to this challenge, I should reiterate that the basic premise for the EU’s policy towards China must be one of engagement and partnership."
"There is no suggestion of containment or of hedging our options."
"Engagement and partnership are the most effective basis for encouraging and supporting China’s development in a way that meets the aims and interests of both the EU and China."
"What principles should guide us?"
"In terms of China’s internal reform and development we must be constructive and we must complement Chinese policy where possible."
"However, the European Union must also send firm and very consistent messages on our areas of interest, such as the need for social and political reform to ensure China’s sustainability, the importance of international non-proliferation regimes, and immediate market access and a level playing field for EU companies."
"Secondly, internationally, the European Union has an interest in encouraging more active and responsible international engagement by China."
"We need to enhance our understanding of Chinese foreign policy if we want to work together effectively."
"We should emphasise the regional component, increasing our awareness and sensitivity as regards regional issues and encouraging regional integration and greater multilateralism in Asia."
"Thirdly, the European Union needs greater focus and coherence internally."
"Before exploring new areas, there should be a full internal review of our existing cooperation, leading to a clearer focus on priorities and, as necessary, moving on from areas which are ineffective or are no longer priorities."
"Our aim should be a holistic approach, with the European Union as a whole speaking again with one voice on its China policy."
"Fourthly, we should also work to ensure that our bilateral relations are strengthened by embracing all constituents of societies."
"Parliament will also have a very important role to play in this context."
"We need a long-term programme to promote mutual understanding and an effective strategic policy mechanism that is sufficiently informal and flexible."
"Fifthly, throughout this process, the European Union should be aware of its strengths."
"There is particular EU expertise on a range of issues relating to internal stability where China wants help, for instance on energy, the environment, regional integration and public health, and we should exploit this as fully as possible."
"Sixthly, there are other areas in which we have less leverage."
"I know the human rights situation in China is of particular concern to Parliament, as it is to the Commission."
"The past year has not been seen as a year of significant progress on any of the areas in which we are particularly interested, such as the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the release of the 1989 prisoners, the abolition of reform through labour and greater protection for freedom of expression and of religion, where we continue to have real concerns."
"But I can assure you, honourable Members, that these issues will remain a central part of our policy agenda and we will continue to engage and to push for progress."
"The Commission is taking steps to turn these principles into reality."
"We will, as the report requests, set out a new strategic vision for our policy towards China, which we will be in a position to present formally to the Council and Parliament in November."
"I look forward to assessing the situation for myself during my trip to China early next month."
"In addition to our continued support for China’s internal reform process, I think we should also focus on four basic priorities: first, we need a greater balance in our bilateral relations, whether described as reciprocity, equality or mutual benefit."
"That includes a more meaningful dialogue on human rights and related issues."
"Questions such as progress on social and economic rights would be included there."
"We are worried by the situation on civil and political rights in China, and in particular, as has been mentioned, as regards freedom of expression, religion and association and the protection of the rights of minorities."
"We are, in that context, concerned that internet use is being more and more restricted and controlled."
"As I heard the rapporteur say, we attach great importance to the issue of organ harvesting."
"It is clear that the legislation on that issue recently adopted by the Chinese Government does not adequately address the issue of donor consent, particularly for those who have died in custody or who have been executed."
"We have made our concerns known very clearly to the Chinese Government, both through our human rights dialogue and wider political channels, urging it, in quite strong terms, to take measures to address these concerns as a matter of urgency."
"We need to make China a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder, it needs to be a positive and active contributor."
"On trade issues, if EU markets are to remain open, we have to see to it that we need a genuine, bilateral and multilateral response from China implementing the letter and spirit of the WTO commitments."
"We need to overhaul the management structures for our relationship to avoid fragmentation and to ensure our allocation of resources on China is appropriate."
"There is much to be done in defining a realistic but also an ambitious strategic vision for moving EU-China relations forward."
"We should not ignore the difficulties involved in achieving this – and I do not think we are ignoring them."
"But let me reiterate that it is crucially important that we get the relations right."
"Both sides want a genuine strategic partnership that merits its name."
"It is our responsibility to translate this political desire into practice."
"I think we have a good basis on which to move forward and, as we do so, I hope we can count on your support, because it is too important an issue for us not to succeed."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what would happen if we were unable to speak today about the issue of China?"
"As was mentioned previously, the forthcoming summit between the EU and China takes places on 9 September, with the Prime Minister, with Foreign Ministers, and with Ministers for Reform, Planning and Trade."
"On 12 September, also in Helsinki, there will be a high-level Chinese-European economic forum."
"From the perspective of the world economy there are other important dates approaching, namely a new distribution of votes within the International Monetary Fund in favour of China and possibly to the disadvantage of Europe, and, at the end of September, new groupings and alliances will need to be formed in the Doha round in Australia."
"As the draftsman of the opinion on this issue in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I will concentrate on economic and monetary policy perspectives."
"In 2005 the Chinese trade surplus was USD 102 billion; in 2006 it will be even greater, and by the end of 2006 China will have more than 1 000 billion USD in its currency reserves."
"Demands are being made from many quarters for a rapid change in the exchange rate, and in the medium term China prepared to listen to these demands."
"In view of the close interconnection of the financial markets, however, in my opinion I have argued in favour of a cautious change, because radical and swift measures could lead to incalculable consequences for the financial markets."
"The International Monetary Fund must monitor such developments and take timely action where necessary."
"At the IMF’s forthcoming annual meeting, China is due to receive more weight in the Fund, and in this development it is getting strong support from the United States."
"One might ask the question why the USA, with its enormous budget deficit, is so keen to support China."
"Perhaps this is because China, as was noted previously, with its exchange rate policy and its high currency reserves, now has a say in matters affecting the US dollar."
"How is this perceived in the Member States of the European Union, and what do the officials in the ECOFIN council have to say about this?"
"The European Union is the most important trading partner for China, China is the second most important trading partner for the European Union."
"We therefore owe respect to the Chinese for the way in which they have partly fulfilled, and are trying to fulfil, the commitments they made when they joined the WTO, although there is still considerable room for improvement on copyright protection and especially on credit issues."
"The further opening of the banking and insurance markets, and the advances in the search for common standards, are visible steps forward."
"At the end of September it is hoped that talks in Australia will breathe new life into the Doha round."
"Here too the USA would be glad to see an increased Chinese influence."
"Which people will the European Union choose to accompany this process, in order to give the Chinese the feeling that Europe can work in partnership with China in developing common strategies?"
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we wholeheartedly support the Belder report."
"It is a comprehensive report, it addresses all of the problems concerning relations between the European Union and China and it is based on the important debate that took place within the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for which I thank Mr Brok, who sought to thoroughly analyse the topic."
"We hope for a broad consensus on this report, and so we call on the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to vote in favour, not least because we are committed to supporting the one-China policy, which underpins efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question by means of constructive dialogue."
"The report certainly does not portray China as an enemy of Europe; quite the contrary."
"China is a very important partner in the sectors of trade and industry; many European companies find the kind of hospitality in China that allows them to discover new markets."
"However, if relations between the European Union and Beijing are to improve, and if both sides are to benefit in future, then definite rules must be set and must be complied with, just as there are fundamental human values, which, when they are violated, can make cooperation between the European Union and China a less positive prospect."
"We are concerned about the undemocratic decisions made by the Chinese Communist party, the violation of human rights and trade union rights, the freedom of minorities, freedom of information and the Tibet question."
"The parliamentary group, which is following this problem closely and tabling and gaining approval for various amendments, has highlighted the issue of religious freedom: we are concerned about the Communist party’s appointing of bishops; it is like the Vatican appointing generals in the Chinese army; it is incomprehensible, and the freedom of so many Chinese citizens is being violated."
"There is also the matter of the rules concerning economic and trade relations; we call on the Council and the Commission to commit themselves to protecting businesses in Europe and in other countries bordering Europe, particularly in the textile and footwear sectors."
"Mr Mandelson has sent out certain signals, but we must continue undaunted with regard to the protection of human rights, as must the Finnish Presidency, which I regret is not present in this House."
"For all of these reasons, we shall vote in favour of the Belder report and shall endorse certain amendments that also relate to environmental issues."
"."
"Mr President, there is much we can agree with in Mr Belder’s report."
"We agree that China needs to shoulder a growing international responsibility because of its status as a permanent member of the Security Council and now as the world’s fourth largest economy."
"We agree with the importance of China’s role in Africa and the Middle East."
"We need to have a dialogue with China over the situation in North Korea, where it has been playing an important role chairing the six-party talks; over Iran, where China can play a role in trying to find a solution to the nuclear crisis; and over Darfur, where China, because of its oil interests, has to date been resisting the deployment of UN forces."
"We look forward to the establishment of an EU-China strategic partnership and we certainly support the need for the abolition of the death penalty – something we urge in all countries, including Japan, the Republic of Korea and the United States."
"We need to see continued improvement in human rights."
"However, unfortunately, in total, the report suffers from both a lack of balance and the sins of omission."
"I thought they were sins of omission, but in his opening speech Mr Belder has made it clear that the reason that the one-China policy is not in the report is not because he has forgotten, but he is actually in favour of changing it."
"I hope that those in the Christian Democrat Group who still support it will not go along with that, but will support our amendment."
"We have two lines on the plight of 150 million migrant workers – more than 10% of China’s population, one sentence on free trade unions and yet there are five paragraphs on a religious minority that is a hundred times smaller."
"The trouble is that Mr Belder cannot see the wood for the trees."
"Yes, of course, we need to stand up for all the oppressed groups, but where is the rapporteur’s sense of proportion?"
"Equally, it is right to believe some of the bad things we are told about China, but it is not right to believe of them, without the evidence necessary."
"There are areas in which we tread very much on the Committee on International Trade’s territory, but the report takes a much more protectionist line than that committee’s recent report."
"The question of market economy status is dismissed very easily, yet 40 countries in the world have already granted market economy status to China – most recently the Republic of Korea in November 2005. I respect the European Parliament’s view on the embargo, but here we are insisting that all our partnership countries follow an embargo that puts China in the same situation as Burma and Zimbabwe – which I consider personally to be rather worse in terms of their oppression and discrimination – while, at the same time, asking the Chinese to assist us in putting pressure on those two countries that we say are exactly the same as China."
"In paragraph 4, we note that China will have at its disposal EUR 1 billion in farm reserves by the end of 2006."
"The accuracy of the report is fine; it is only one thousand times wrong: it is actually a trillion and not a billion and yet nobody has noticed; yet this is a wonderfully accurate report that everybody is endorsing."
"Nowhere do we complain that China holds too few euros – rather than dollars – or say that China should continue to work with the European Union on the six-party talks."
"We do not mention the fact that China’s concern about the Yasukuni Shrine is reflected in the recently revealed fact that the Japanese Emperor refused to visit it once class-A war criminals were included there."
"Finally, as the Commissioner said, we want engagement and partnership, not confrontation and containment."
"I am afraid the wrong message comes from this report."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I welcome this report on behalf of my group."
"It is important for the European Parliament to come up with a statement prior to the important summit at the weekend."
"The EU’s relations with China have, of course, become ever more extensive, and not only in terms of trade policy."
"It is therefore good that we should tackle these relations in a more strategic way."
"China is a growing economy and an ever more important trading partner."
"We liberal democrats see trade as an important way in which countries can become closer to each other and have more contacts and forms of exchange."
"Trade also leads in the long term to increased openness, better regulations, less corruption and in time, we believe, to democracy."
"Trade has also led to economic growth, enabling millions of Chinese to raise themselves out of poverty and meaning that we can, of course, also discuss how the fruits of that growth are to be distributed."
"China has growing ambitions on the international stage."
"That is good, but in that case it must also accept increased international responsibility and be a responsible partner."
"We believe that China can play an important role in relations with North Korea, but we cannot accept China making use of its UN veto to prevent global intervention designed to put an end to the genocide in Darfur or aimed at putting pressure on Iran to open up its nuclear power programme to international scrutiny."
"Given its size, history and population, China has huge potential."
"At the same time, we have to recognise that China is also a dictatorship."
"We cannot accept thousands of people being put in prison for having different political views or for being of a different religion or from a different ethnic group."
"We cannot accept China’s censorship of the Internet, and we view with great concern the reports now coming from right around the world – and most recently from a respected institute in Canada – on trade in organs from, for example, Falun Gong sympathisers."
"We are also concerned about the threats directed against the Taiwanese democracy."
"We must never miss an opportunity to point out to Chinese politicians and companies that we condemn these breaches of human rights."
"At the same time, we must also be constructive in trying to help China travel the long road towards democracy."
"In the same way, all of us as politicians, entrepreneurs and consumers must demand that Chinese companies permit trade unions and allow their employees to enjoy security and fundamental rights."
"China is also an environmental time bomb, the environment being a huge potential area for cooperation between China and ourselves in the EU."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner talked of the need for a strategic partnership involving many practical elements."
"We welcome this and hope that the European Parliament can play a critical but also constructive role in this work."
"Mr President, I too am pleased that we are holding this debate at last."
"I believe that it would have been a mistake to refer this report back to committee and it would have sent out the wrong message, particularly given the importance attached to the sovereignty of this House."
"China is clearly making great progress and modernisation is currently moving ahead, but we must bear in mind that the accelerated and rapid pace of that modernisation poses risks from the social and environmental points of view."
"In this regard, the European Union must contribute to the development of the positive aspects of this modernisation and not encourage the negative aspects or the risks attached to it."
"We must therefore make our position very clear at a time when we are discussing European Union-China relations."
"Friends must speak clearly to each other; it is with friends that we must maintain good relations and also speak very honestly."
"In this case, I believe that we must do so while making the values that we consider to be fundamental to a good, fruitful relationship very clear."
"Some of them have already been mentioned, but I would like to raise them again, in order to make it crystal clear that we are in favour of abolishing the death penalty and that we believe that to be a universal value, that we are in favour of democratisation and freedom of expression, including on the Internet, and of freedom to exercise one’s culture and religion, that we condemn systematic torture and the existence of re-education camps for prisoners and that we consider respect for the rights of people such as those of Tibet to be fundamental."
"We therefore call upon the Council to implement the applicable policy and to agree to sending a special envoy."
"With regard to the arms embargo, we have said many times that we cannot and will not accept any lifting of the arms embargo unless there is firstly a solution, a justification or a clear acceptance of responsibilities with regard to the events of Tiananmen Square; until that issue is cleared up, we cannot consider lifting the embargo."
"Finally, with regard to the One-China policy, I agree that that must be the objective and that it provides a good framework for negotiating relations between China and Taiwan, but it must be between democratic entities."
"If that is not the case, of course, the One-China policy may have negative consequences."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is going to vote against this report because, if its intention is to exert an influence in such a sensitive area as human rights, the direction it takes is a mistake."
"This mistake is made explicit in its point 75, which proposes that the European Union and the Member States be urged to establish a policy based on a consensus with the United States with a view to establishing a strategic relationship with China."
"I would put the question: in what areas can a consensus be established with the United States?"
"The death penalty?"
"Respect for international law?"
"The demilitarisation of security?"
"Climate change?"
"In other words, are we going to go hand in hand with the United States in establishing that consensual relationship – the European Union and the United States – so that we can tell the Chinese what to do in those areas?"
"I believe that that would be a terrible mistake and moves in completely the wrong direction."
"Furthermore, the report also proposes telling the Chinese – the Chinese Government, the Chinese authorities – what policy they must implement in their region, with which countries – with North Korea, with Iran – and on the basis of what principles. As if the People’s Republic of China can be told what to do and as if they will accept being told what to do."
"As if the People’s Republic of China could tell the European Union what kind of relations and what kind of policy we should implement here."
"That cannot be taken seriously."
"We must bear in mind which country we are talking about. We are talking about a country with 1.2 billion inhabitants, of 9.5 million square kilometres, and one which in 1910 was still a feudal society."
"Unless we consider this report within the correct context, we will be lashing out in the dark."
"Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I also believe that this report oozes purely economic interests."
"Nothing more."
"The rest is nothing but fine words."
"Our group is therefore going to vote against this report tomorrow, because I believe that it moves in the wrong direction."
"When trying to influence the People’s Republic of China, we must do so on the basis of a clearly autonomous European Union, not on the basis of a link between the European Union and the United States."
"."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to comment on relations between the European Union and China as seen through the prism of relations between China and Taiwan and that of democracy."
"It is no secret that China refuses to engage in direct dialogue with the democratically elected government of Taiwan."
"The European Union therefore ought to urge China to maintain an atmosphere of mutual trust with Taiwan, and to employ peaceful means in developing relations to achieve stability throughout the region."
"China’s actions in restricting Taiwan’s participation in international processes cannot be endorsed."
"China must respect the fundamental human rights and freedom to make political choices of Taiwan’s 23 million inhabitants."
"We should condemn the fact that the Chinese law legitimising the possible occupation of Taiwan hangs over Taiwan like a sword of Damocles."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in my view, in the concept of ‘one China’ the idea of peaceful reunification should be replaced with something that is more applicable – a peaceful solution."
"The deployment of approximately 800 guided and other types of missile on China’s southern coast, opposite the Taiwan Strait, must be significantly reduced."
"This is threatening and stressful for the inhabitants of Taiwan."
"It results in the need for counter-measures to build up arms in Taiwan, taking significant resources away from the needs of the economy and society."
"The European Union’s arms embargo ought to be maintained."
"To lift it would be misinterpreted as encouragement for further increases in China’s military might."
"That might seriously affect stability in the Asian region and lead to the escalation of expenditure on weapons."
"A lifting of the arms embargo would not foster the desired democratisation of China."
"The impetus for the one-party regime to end the significant human rights violations that we have seen for so long would disappear."
". – Mr President, we must congratulate the people of China on the progress they have made since the death of the tyrant Mao Zedong 30 years ago."
"Mao’s legacy of murder, oppression, suffering, misery, starvation and death is in a league of its own."
"He brought China to its knees."
"His instrument for enforcing this tyranny was, of course, the Chinese Communist Party, which still governs China."
"The recognition by Mao’s successor Deng Xiao Ping and his successors of some capitalist and free market realities has enabled China to progress economically to the point it has reached today."
"However, at the heart of the Chinese economic phenomenon lies an unresolved contradiction: China’s new-found prosperity is based on capitalist principles applied by the Chinese Communist Party, which is the only political party in China."
"We have the curious spectacle of a communist party that no longer believes in communism applying capitalist ideas that it is not supposed to believe in."
"Its only real belief is in ensuring its own survival, and the European Union should not assist it in that aim by lending the kind of support that we have already seen."
"Progress in China will inevitably be limited to the economic sphere for as long as the Chinese Communist Party retains power."
"Progress will not extend to freedom of association, freedom of speech and democracy."
"The Chinese people are at long last beginning to reap some of the material benefits of the capitalist system."
"But when are they going to reap the benefits of the Western democratic system?"
"Mr Belder’s report rightly calls for political pluralism, an independent judiciary and for the EU not to lift its arms embargo until China properly addresses the situation regarding human rights and civil and political freedoms."
"Mr Belder calls for a consistent and coherent policy towards China."
"Such a coherent policy should promote the interests of the Chinese people, but not the interests of the Chinese Communist Party."
"Therefore, we should not lift the arms embargo and we should continue to recognise Taiwan as an independent democratic State."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that this report should be rejected because it advocates the further development of an EU strategy regarding relations with China."
"That would be bad for the Chinese people."
"It would also restrict the political and economic decisions of the United Kingdom and would dilute its influence and priorities."
"In the long run, that would also be bad for the Chinese people."
"– Mr President, the fact that we are discussing EU-China relations illustrates their importance."
"The individual speakers, the report itself, as well as all those taking the floor here have stressed how important relations with China are to the future of the European Union."
"However, we also agree that these relations are fundamentally different."
"Our approach has to be different, in discussions on this issue, from our relations with another large country of the region such as India."
"When discussing China, we should always bear in mind the foundations on which this House, and the entire European Union, are built."
"Therefore, our priority is to promote, foster and create conditions allowing people to live in democratic conditions, without fear of repression and without acts which are part of the daily life in China."
"In debating this report, which is, on the whole, correct – and I hope that all amendments, and all elements relating to human and citizens’ rights will be adopted by this House – we should remember that repression of religious communities – and that includes all, from the Catholic Church to religious movements such as Falun Gong, which are being oppressed in a quite shocking manner – as well as repression of fundamental human rights is not a thing of the past in China, and continue on a daily basis."
"Forced sterilisation and forced abortions continue to be practiced."
"The repression of national groups, as is the case in Tibet at the moment, is also still not a thing of the past."
"We need to draw attention to all of this in our report, as it is extremely important that both the European Parliament and the whole European Union do not simply focus on economic statistics and on trade in their relations with China, but that they also focus on the ideals that the European Union does and should promote."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, our group is genuinely committed to developing the strategic partnership between the EU and China, but these relations must be based upon complete openness, credibility and responsibility."
"We must not sacrifice our convictions for the sake of economic or political considerations; rather, we must use plain language when speaking with our Chinese partners."
"I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for the clear words which you have spoken in your opening speech, and I encourage you to make the same speech at the summit in Helsinki."
"If we are open and honest with each other, then we have a good chance of further developing the strategic partnership in a sensible way."
"Please allow me to make three further points."
"Like the Commission, we must continue to demand from the government of the People’s Republic of China that it implements the basic principles of fair world trade, now that it has joined the WTO."
"They cannot get away with the excuse that central government does not know what is happening in every province."
"The protection of intellectual property must be enforced, and if the Chinese Government can enforce its political convictions in every prison, then it must also be able to implement the protection of intellectual property on every factory floor."
"Secondly, we call upon the National People’s Congress to finally ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"They have signed it, but they are postponing the ratification."
"They return to this point in the discussions which we are always glad to have with them and they say that it is so difficult and that they have to prepare themselves first."
"No: they have signed, so they should ratify, and they should implement human rights."
"Implementation means, in practice: freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech."
"This must be guaranteed."
"There must also be cultural autonomy for Tibet."
"I do not think that Mr Ford has understood things quite rightly: China must make the first move in changing the way it relates to its neighbours."
"It must also change its relations with its neighbours Japan and Taiwan."
"Indeed, as far as Taiwan is concerned, of course all of us in the House would like there to be a political dialogue between Peking and Taipei, but this must not occur in the form of threats."
"It is therefore completely nonsensical of the Socialists to have called – as they did recently – for the lifting of the arms embargo."
"You should instead get back to showing solidarity with the democrats in this House."
"As long as there are human rights violations in China, there should be no lifting of the embargo."
"Mr President, I welcome the work done by the Commission on China so far and the input of Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner tonight."
"If the report were as balanced as your contribution tonight, Commissioner, I would wholeheartedly support it."
"However, throughout our discussions in the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have argued that the report was weak in the EU-China cooperation and foreign policy sections."
"For no reason that I can understand, the report does not take a position on the One-China policy or China’s role in the Security Council, and it does not take a balanced view on the Taiwan issue, the six-party talks, EU-China cooperation and global security issues."
"The report singles out only one of the major partners for cooperation in dealing with China."
"Why?"
"I, like the vast majority of people in Europe, believe that we should work together in cooperation with all our major partners, rather than with only one."
"There are also factual errors in Mr Belder’s report, which is supported by the PPE-DE Group and other groups."
"I shall refer to just one example: in paragraph 24, Parliament invites the Commission to initiate a structured dialogue with its Chinese counterpart in the fields of employment and social affairs."
"Well, Mr Belder and colleagues from the PPE-DE and ALDE groups, either your homework has not been done properly, or we must congratulate the magical powers of the Commission, because two years ago it must have eaten some Chinese fortune cookie which said that in September 2006 Parliament would make such a call to initiate a structured dialogue."
"The truth is that the Commission has been having structured dialogue on these issues and many other issues for years now."
"Our group’s suggestion, which was rejected, was to get the Commission to give us regular updates on the different sectoral dialogues, which now cover a wide range of areas from space technology to enterprise regulation, from environmental issues to education and the information society."
"Commissioner, the PSE Group would warmly welcome it if you were to give us those regular updates as regards your work in building structured dialogues with China."
"My idea was that this report should be Parliament’s contribution to EU-China relations based on pragmatism, facts and respect for each other’s sensitivities, and aiming for the progressive deepening of the relationship between the two sides, which is rapidly maturing into a comprehensive strategic partnership."
"In fact, Europe is engaged with China in cultural, economic and strategic terms."
"Correct me if I am wrong, but the big question is whether China will respond wholeheartedly in trying to understand and accept European values."
"Is there any way to find answers to these questions other than through constructive dialogue?"
"My idea was that this report could contribute to a process in which both sides could understand one another better."
"This would be for our mutual benefit."
"Unfortunately, the report as it stands makes no such contribution."
"It greatly weakens Parliament’s position and influence in achieving our common goals, especially now with a view to the forthcoming summit."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Belder, as chairman of Parliament’s delegation for China, I am left with rather mixed feelings about this report."
"The rapporteur has worked very hard, and the report contains many valid points made or repeated by this House, but what is missing, in my opinion, is an assessment, a critical and constructive assessment of what the Commission is already doing in China at the moment."
"How critical are we about some of the things the Commission is doing over there?"
"After all, it boasts a very extensive delegation over there, second only – or so I believe – to that for relations with the United States."
"Where are we offering the Commission encouragement?"
"For example, is there sufficient cooperation between China and the Commission in the area of regional policy, the development of China’s disadvantaged regions?"
"We could teach them a thing or two in this respect."
"Are we working together sufficiently and could we not, for example, ask the Chinese Government to be a little more receptive to this?"
"Those are the kinds of things that are missing."
"There is insufficient scrutiny or critical and/or constructive analysis of the activities the Commission is engaged in."
"What suggestions are we putting forward for the Helsinki summit?"
"My mixed feelings stem from the fact that those are not reflected anywhere."
"I am pleased that you are facing the problems head-on."
"Since Members have already pointed them out, I will not dwell on the issues of human rights, trade union rights, the free expression of opinion and so on."
"I am not that enthralled by the way you are asking for EU-US consensus on China policy."
"That would make me very unhappy."
"In fact, we in our group have tabled amendments on this very subject, because there are differences between us, the European Union, and the United States, as to how to approach China."
"There are also different interests in play."
"We should not ask for consensus with the United States after all, for I think that would restrict us enormously in our policy."
"Moreover, China is not just any old country."
"We can pretend that the Chinese only need us, but we should not labour under any misconceptions: we need the Chinese as well, both economically and strategically."
"Let there be no mistake about that, Commissioner."
"I assume that the one-China policy is a cornerstone of the stability which we would like to see across the whole of Asia, and that it is also a cornerstone and an elementary component in the EU’s policy in respect of China."
"I cannot find any extensive detail about this in this report."
"We are assuming all kinds of things, but we as Parliament should also confirm the one-China policy, because it is important for the sake of stability."
"China needs us where the environment is concerned, for example."
"I think that that country could take on board a huge number of suggestions from us, including in the area of energy."
"As far as conditions for partnership are concerned, it has to be said that every day, some minister or other, commissioner of a region or a country, sets off for China in order to discuss this strategic partnership over there."
"We should therefore stop pretending that it does not exist and that we can simply prescribe whatever conditions we please."
"Mr President, I welcome this report not only because of its strong emphasis on the need for respect for human rights in China, but also because it echoes a key finding from my own report on EU economic relations with China, namely that the challenges posed by Chinese competition are not limited to individual sectors like textiles or footwear, but are in fact systemic in nature and require a much more comprehensive approach."
"The Commission response to date has been to say that Europe simply has to move up the value-added chain; we simply have to diversify into higher-skilled, more specialised work."
"However, it is rather complacent and patronising to assume that Europe and the West can keep a monopoly on innovation and high-tech solutions, while China simply does the manufacturing."
"Chinese graduates are rightly, and to their credit, moving up the value-added chain and very soon we may need to face the possibility that there will be very little that Europe can produce which China cannot produce more efficiently."
"The old colonialist assumption that the EU and the industrialised countries will keep the leading edge in knowledge-intensive industries, while developing countries focus on lower-skilled sectors, is now open to huge debate."
"Our response to the challenges posed by China needs to include a thorough-going reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory until now."
"Not for our own sake, necessarily, but certainly for the sake of many workers in developing countries, because the reality is that China’s deflationary pressure is already driving down wages right across the developing world, pushing global suppliers to reduce their workers’ rights and conditions in their bid to remain competitive at all costs, and forcing ILO conventions on freedom of association and bargaining on China is certainly part of the solution."
"However, I would also ask the Commission to look much more closely at some of its assumptions about the winners and losers from the globalisation process."
"– I should like to thank the rapporteur for his comprehensive report and even though I do not fully agree with many of the themes of the report, I welcome it as a contribution to the debate."
"Clearly, the rapporteur was aiming for the broadest and most detailed overview of EU-China relations, yet I believe that there are two areas on which we need to focus particular attention in the future."
"The rapporteur stresses on a number of occasions in the report that the growing importance of the People’s Republic of China in world politics, together with its growing importance as a global economic superpower, bring greater international responsibilities."
"Against this backdrop, I should like to highlight two issues that strike me as highly important."
"Firstly, there are issues relating to environmental protection."
"Representatives from the People’s Republic of China are aware of this important issue, but are held back by the costs associated with more environmentally-friendly forms of production and consumption."
"I believe that the EU should be much more proactive on this issue than it has been so far."
"Perhaps protecting the environment and green technology could be future areas in which EU businesses can invest in China."
"The second issue which is mentioned in the report, and which I feel should become a major topic of negotiation with representatives from the People's Republic of China – but also an area in which Europe should share experiences – is that of health protection in the work place, social support, social dialogue, the prevention of child labour and ensuring basic rights for workers."
"Let us lend a helping hand and contribute towards finding solutions to these complex problems that will above all lead to raising the standards of those who are most directly involved in the Chinese miracle."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is well known that, in recent years, the European Union has become China’s second most important trading partner."
"It is therefore becoming crucial to clarify the relations that exist between our continent and China, so as to do the best possible job of tackling future global challenges, even though I believe that there are still too many critical points to be highlighted."
"Despite being part of the WTO, China has often shown that it does not observe the rules shared by its other trading partners."
"As we have denounced all too often up to now, China is placing goods on the European markets that are counterfeit or that do not comply with EU legislation, with quality and safety standards."
"China does not adequately comply with the TRIPS agreements on the protection of intellectual property rights and inventions and does not help its foreign partners to access its markets."
"The trade agreements on footwear, textiles and clothing must also be reviewed with the utmost urgency, as unacceptable imbalances still exist."
"What are even more worrying are the problems relating to human rights and, more specifically, the rights of women and children; the absence in many cases of minimum health and safety standards in the workplace; and even the existence of labour camps."
"These are unfortunately all prominent issues, but it is time to identify the solutions and, above all, the specific means for more incisively tackling the unfair competition and the social and environmental dumping practised by China."
"To conclude, it is worth hoping that the Finnish Presidency can finally take upon itself the role of champion of the real interests of European citizens, consumers and producers, and that includes during the forthcoming EU-China summit being held in a few days’ time."
"– Mr President, I am appalled at what has happened in this House today."
"Clearly, for some Members, the interests of international communism take precedence over European values!"
"Mr President, it is a good thing that the European Parliament is debating the issue of EU – China relations."
"China is the second largest world power in the world and is neither a democracy nor has a market economy."
"By 2010, China wants to create the world’s most powerful economic block, together with the ASEAN countries."
"Even today, China is its largest factory."
"Since enlargement, the EU has become China’s largest trading partner, which is why relations with China are so important to us."
"We should, however, remember that a purely economic approach to our relations will not reveal to us the true face of the Chinese dragon."
"Politically, China continues to be a threat to the world."
"Utopian socialism continues to flourish there."
"There are political prisoners in its jails, there is no freedom of speech and there is censorship."
"The communist party continues to be the only true path."
"Torture is widely used in China, as is religious discrimination."
"On the other hand, China is the world’s third largest importer of crude oil."
"Economic interests have brought China closer to countries with problems such as Iran, Sudan or Venezuela."
"Competition for raw materials will put increased pressure on our relations with China in the future."
"China’s energy policy has led the country to make bilateral agreements that undermine all efforts to stabilise the price of oil."
"The increase in China’s military spending, particularly in the light of its provocative announcements of the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan, also provides grounds for concern."
"China regularly stages military manoeuvres that simulate an attack on Taiwan."
"The EU must take a decisive stance on this."
"Only a fully independent Taiwan is a guarantee of peace in the Far East."
"I repeat: only a fully independent Taiwan is a guarantee of peace in the Far East."
"The Belder report, which we are now debating, provides an objective view of EU-China relations."
"Let us hope that it will be the start of a more critical approach by the EU to the issue of China in the world."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when huge business or financial interests are at stake, lobbying in support of those interests very often takes place or threatens to take place, and that includes within politics and within Parliament (not just this evening in actual fact, but we have perhaps witnessed this type of game played out this evening)."
"We endorse the Belder report because we believe that Europe should not be afraid to ask China, as the giant and the economic power that it is, for satisfactory answers on the various topics mentioned."
"I should therefore like it if, when the protection of human rights is spoken of, including by the Commission, it were not done in the same way as when all of the countries’ old European Affairs offices used to insert clauses as a mere formality, things that had to be said: we must now talk about Tibet, both in order to create a good impression and to show that we take an interest."
"Having heard here the words of such a high spiritual authority as the Dalai Lama, which moved us all, I feel – and I am expressing myself freely here – that our responses to the Tibetan tragedy, which is the tragedy of a holocaust and of the cultural genocide of a nation, are very weak and fundamentally ineffective."
"As regards the economic and monetary field, I go beyond the Belder report and I would criticise it in the sense that, as far as the monetary field is concerned, it is time we called for a rather swift, though gradual, revaluation of the yuan renmimbi, if we want to protect our economies from the Chinese offensive."
"How is it possible, then, that, while knowing that 70% of the counterfeit goods that circulate in our countries come from China, we still have to address issues such as those concerning the running of Chinese courts, the responses, the fact that there is a court here that finds in our favour and to which one can turn; in short, how is it possible that we have to call on China to completely overhaul its system so as to meet the requirements of democracy and development, and so on?"
"Finally, I would like to mention the issue of religious freedom, which is a fundamental issue: Christians, Catholics, Protestants, but also, as we have seen before our Parliament, members of the Falun Gong; in other words, human beings who believe in their ideas, in their philosophy and who are treated like criminals, tortured, incarcerated and probably also have parts of their bodies removed."
"The traffic in organs that is practised by a country with which we continue to trade is a disgrace!"
"Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, for his work in considering the raft of amendments linked to this report."
"It has not been an easy job to construct an EU-China report, because there are a multitude of factors that have needed to be considered."
"The final result needs to be a balanced one that reflects the developing, positive relationship between two huge economic blocs while not shying away from the real and difficult concerns that exist on issues of human rights and the promotion of democracy; issues which we in Parliament claim to be serious about."
"I am strongly in favour of continuing to develop a closer relationship with China."
"The EU is China’s largest trading partner, after all, and it is our second-largest trading partner."
"Massive economic opportunities exist for both parties to grow and take advantage of new markets."
"Therefore, anyone who advocates the isolation of China as a foreign policy strategy, for whatever reason, is being unrealistic."
"That being said, however, we must be firm and consistent in our efforts to ensure that with the developing trade relationship must also come democratic development and an increased respect for human rights."
"The two must go hand-in-hand."
"That is why, as a human rights spokesperson, I am so glad to see such a strong emphasis on human rights concerns in this report."
"I was relieved to hear Mrs De Keyser clarify that the PSE Group’s objections are not based on concerns over the references to human rights issues; but that was until I heard what Mr Ford had to say."
"The report is certainly not dominated by human rights concerns, but it does ask the hard questions, and rightly so, if we are to be taken seriously by China in relation to human rights issues, such as the need to guarantee genuine religious freedom; the concern at reports of widespread torture in Chinese prisons and reports of inhumane, degrading treatment and internment without trial; the laogai system of detention centres and labour camps; forced compliance with family planning policy; censorship of the internet and recent reports of sourcing human organs from prisoners."
"I was delighted to hear the Commissioner make a very strong statement in relation to that issue."
"In fact, I would congratulate her on her very balanced presentation this evening."
"These are serious concerns that demand our attention as we proceed to develop the closer relationship with China that we all accept is inevitable and desirable."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, according to the official statistics of the Chinese national statistics office, the rate of growth of the Chinese economy for the whole of 2005 has been revised from 9.9% to 10.2%, due to faster growth in industrial activity and the services sector."
"At the same time, the Central Bank has decided to increase the lower limit on deposits in foreign currency from 3% to 4%, with the ulterior motive of limiting the supply of dollars, given that the country has exchange reserves of EUR 941 billion."
"Chinese products, due to their low cost and exchange parity have a comparative export advantage."
"China is the biggest consumer of electricity in the world and the third biggest oil importer, which makes it the regulator of energy policy and of economic development at international and regional level."
"It is a development scenario which is an unobtainable dream for Europe and the United States."
"However, the European Union must not under any circumstances deal with the emergence of China in global trade and the economy as a threat, but as an important new market which offers new possibilities and important opportunities for the economic development and strengthening of the European market itself."
"It suffices if this is demonstrated and sought in agreements and with specific policies."
"I think you will find the European Parliament agrees with your reference to the policies and tactics of the European Union and I would like, on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to welcome this political move by the Commission."
"We need to put at the centre of a cooperation agreement with China the further opening up of the Chinese economy to European companies, something which requires legislative and administrative regulations."
"Recent announcements by the Chinese Government about increases in the capital which investors are allowed to hold in domestic companies and the anti-monopoly bill are particularly positive steps in this direction."
"Commissioner, our future strategy should not be based on a colonial attitude or 'trade war' practices, but should protect the interests of European citizens, companies and workers by promoting cooperation and dialogue with the Chinese authorities."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate Mr Belder; it would have been a real shame if the very strange request for a referral back to committee had been upheld, as we have an opportunity to give our verdict only a few days away from the summit."
"In my view, the request is slightly biased by the idea that a distinction can be made between the debate on human rights and the debate on the necessary report on China; in reality, we are talking about the same thing: enforcing international law and the international regulations on dumping and on free competition is the same as seeking to enforce the international charters on human rights and on the individual right to freedom and democracy, particularly for peoples such as the Tibetans, but also for the Yugur, who are often forgotten."
"While we are on the subject, we must concentrate, as I would say to the Commissioner (and as I would like to say to the Council, too, but unfortunately it is not present) – the President has the light behind him, so he might be taking part in a Chinese shadow puppet show – on three issues that require our attention, starting with Internet freedom."
"This is undoubtedly a Chinese problem, but it is also true that the technology for oppressing Chinese citizens via the Internet comes from the United States and Europe."
"Secondly: Europol."
"It seems that Europol’s management board would even like to begin talks with a view to concluding a cooperation agreement with the Chinese."
"It really seems the height of contradiction to me that we should cooperate with the Chinese police."
"The third issue, which is also a campaign led by the transnational radical party, concerns the death penalty: the task is ours too; at the forthcoming sitting of the UN General Assembly, we, as the European Union, must raise the issue of establishing a universal moratorium on capital punishment."
"It is all very well saying these things to China, but we ourselves, as Europe, must try to deal with them."
"– Mr President, the late reaction of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has quite astonished me, since there was plenty of time in the long process leading up to the resolution for it to express its opinion."
"I too received the letter from the Chinese representatives, to which perhaps this reaction is attributable, for it does indeed contain some astounding so-called refutations of the claims made in the resolution."
"Among other things, the Dalai Lama is once again called a separatist, even though he has repeatedly stated in public that he does not question the One China policy."
"Moreover, the Falun Gong was described as an ‘evil group’, a choice of words in which we no longer have much confidence."
"We must ask these questions when we talk with China, for failure to do so will not gain us more market share, but rather lose us the respect of our partners."
"A good partnership is based on frank discussion and on each partner being able to say what they do not approve of about each other."
"This is a partnership between equals, and this requires that we ask these human rights questions frankly and clearly."
"–Mr President, in a rapidly globalising world economy, it is absolutely essential for Europe to promote cooperation with emerging economic powers such as China or India."
"However, such cooperation should bring benefits to both parties."
"Unfortunately, as far as relations between China and the EU are concerned, this healthy principle has been skewed, to the detriment of Europe. The reasons are as follows."
"Firstly, Chinese manufacturers do not include social welfare contributions, the costs of environmental protection, etc. in their manufacturing costs."
"This allows Chinese producers to offer products at much lower prices."
"Secondly, in China, the manufacture of a variety of goods, including metal products, enjoys various forms of state support which constitute prohibited state subsidies under European Union regulations."
"Exporting these products to the European market therefore constitutes unfair competition with European manufacturers."
"Thirdly, the Chinese currency is significantly over-valued compared to the dollar or the euro."
"Artificially maintaining the exchange rate at the current level significantly increases the effectiveness of Chinese exports, whilst hampering imports on to the Chinese market."
"Fourthly, the Chinese authorities are doing practically nothing to restrict large-scale piracy of branded products by Chinese manufacturers."
"Suffice it to say that as many as 70% of all pirated products on the European market originate in China."
"In such circumstances, the European Commission must do everything in its power to minimise unfair competition from China."
"It should step up the following activities in particular:"
"Firstly, the Commission must increase pressure on China, both through the WTO and directly, to eliminate unfair competition, and in particular the unfair competition resulting from an assisted exchange rate policy."
"Secondly, the Commission must adopt a joint anti-dumping policy towards China as soon as possible."
"It particularly needs to introduce high anti-dumping customs tariffs in the sectors most susceptible to unfair competition, especially the textile, shoe-making and metal sectors as well as the farming sector."
"Finally, the European Commission must offer a comprehensive aid package to those sectors of the European economy that have, to date, suffered from unfair Chinese competition."
"Mr President, I am pleased there is room for a brief comment."
"I should like to address a few observations to my fellow Members."
"First of all, I should like to extend warm thanks to the Commissioner for her response to the content of my report."
"Her commitment is evident."
"I am not at all opposed to the People’s Republic of China and even less so to the Chinese."
"I intend to carry on doing what I have always done, namely listening carefully to the Chinese discussions."
"You were talking about a developing country."
"There are some heated debates at the moment, with one country boasting various economies, while seeking to work towards one harmonious society."
"Chinese experts who are involved in this say they need social values."
"Well, it appears to me that it would be excellent if we were to take a cautious, yet committed approach to the discussion, for the benefit of both the partnership and internal stability."
"We would then be part of the thinking process, not from the outside, but from the inside, for the benefit of the wellbeing of the Chinese people as well as for the partnership."
"I am, then, greatly indebted to you for your approach, and I hope that you will be able to put it across at the summit."
"I have again noticed that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has still have not replied to my question about the Ankang system, while claiming to be champions of human rights."
"Mrs Dobolyi, you have failed to respond to an emphatic question that I have put to you three times now."
"If there are factual mistakes, as Mrs Ford suggested, then I would like to see those put right in an amendment."
"Some things have been added to the text thanks to the recommendation by Mr Hoppenstedt."
"I have tabled an amendment to have this deleted."
"Be fair in your ..."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak after the rapporteur’s concluding remark."
"I believe that the debate we are having today is an important one, because China – and this not just a throwaway remark – is a great country with a great culture, one which can play an important role in the future if everything happens as it is expected to."
"Even so, the rules must be observed."
"We want this constructive strategic relationship and partnership with China."
"However, if a country wishes to join the WTO, then it must respect intellectual property, it must address the rules on dumping, it must ask what the labour of prisoners in prison camps means, what competition on an equal footing means, it must cooperate in Doha, it must maintain an appropriate currency policy, and it can achieve a trade surplus through its own achievement, but not by ignoring the rules."
"It is also important that such a country plays a part in solving political crises, as China is indeed doing to a certain extent in connection with Iran, however at the same time it is buying energy everywhere, for example in Darfur."
"The question arises: is this how the responsibility of a future superpower is to be envisaged?"
"It is vital that this responsibility should be linked to human rights."
"China has experienced intensive economic development, but it must produce evidence of the large-scale liberalisation not only of the economy, but also of the political system. If it does not do so, then there could be a big rupture which might undermine its economic development."
"So far China has offered no such evidence."
"I will defend the One China policy, but only if it is based on the free decision of all interested parties, and this cannot be achieved through violence."
"Last year’s Chinese legislation on the subject is unacceptable, and, for as long as it remains so and threats continue to be made, then the arms embargo cannot be lifted."
"We want relations with this great country, with China, but I think that in doing so we must also respect the common rules of international humanitarian law, and that this is the only basis for stable progress."
"– I should like, if I may, to concentrate in the short time allotted to me on one aspect of economic relations between the EU and China."
"Statistics show that mutual trade is growing sharply and flourishing."
"Indeed, the last 25 years has seen a 40-fold increase."
"The EU has become China’s biggest partner and, on the other side of that coin, China has become the Union’s second biggest partner."
"Nevertheless, alongside these positive developments, one cannot fail to notice a great many negative developments that are blocking further expansion of significant trade, including, first and foremost, the piracy and counterfeiting of European products and trade marks by Chinese manufacturers."
"It is no secret that more than two thirds of fake goods intercepted on the European market come from China."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission and the Council to address this problem at the forthcoming summit in Helsinki."
"China should be called upon to make substantial improvements in the protection of intellectual property rights and international inventions, to strengthen current legislation on the protection of intellectual property rights and of course to reinforce the activities of the country’s civil courts in solving cases of industrial piracy."
"The rules of the World Trade Organisation, to which China is a signatory, are after all binding in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, China is one of the rising powers of the twenty-first century."
"Economically and politically, the People’s Republic has become an important player."
"Of course, the differences between our political systems mean that there are limits to cooperation, but, nevertheless, the EU must view good relations as a central priority for this partnership, and I think, Commissioner, that - as Mr Coveney has already said - you have, today, struck this balance extraordinarily well."
"One example of positive cooperation is in foreign policy."
"We want China to assume a greater responsibility in matters of foreign policy; a China that is credible and reliable in terms of foreign policy could make a substantial contribution to international stability."
"We are having a dialogue with China on human rights and civil rights, and on the right of non governmental organisations and political foundations to go about their business freely."
"I therefore welcome emphatically this House’s call for the reopening of the office of the German liberal Friedrich Naumann Foundation in Peking, which was forced to close in 1996."
"It is important that the Foundation should resume its work of promoting democracy and development, and this must be implemented."
"It would be an important contribution to the development of the strategic partnership."
"Let me conclude by responding quite briefly to what has been said today: should we have a dialogue with the USA about China?"
"I think we should."
"We are witnessing a power shift within the international system."
"We can see it happening before our very eyes, and I believe that it is the responsibility of the great democracies in Europe and North America to consult with each other about such a change in the international system."
"It is better, it is most important for us to talk about it with each other."
"I would like to add that I believe we should be conducting this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, I would like to offer my greetings to the Presidency, to you, Commissioner, and – in its absence – to the Presidency of the Council."
"The excitement about this China report shows us that in our own House there are double standards of morality. This is improper for a debate on politics and human rights."
"The EU is known around the world as a champion of human rights, at the same time it is China’s most important trading partner."
"It is on this basis that we need to act."
"We all know about the serious violations of human rights in Tibet and in China, and that, time and time again, our Parliament calls upon China to respect those human rights."
"I am addressing Mr Brok when I say that this clear demand must be reinforced by the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Tibet."
"An amendment to this effect has been tabled by my group and by Members from other groups, and I would ask for it to be supported."
"The EU makes respect for human rights into a condition of cooperation with all countries, without exception."
"Moreover, I reject the Chinese Embassy’s shameless to us on the subject of Tibet."
"Mr President, China is the EU’s second-largest trading partner after the USA and, in economic terms, cannot be ignored."
"Nevertheless, it remains a one-party communist dictatorship, sharing little in the way of common values with the EU, unlike India, which shares the West’s respect for democracy and human rights."
"One rare example of common interest is in the fight against international Islamist terrorism, as China has problems with its own Uighur Muslim minorities."
"Regrettably, however, in its quest for international support and, in particular, energy security, China has recently courted terrorist-sponsoring Iran, and along with Russia refused to impose UN sanctions for Iran’s continuing uranium enrichment programme."
"Similarly, on the principle of non-interference, China has good relations with maverick regimes ranging from Venezuela to Zimbabwe."
"EU criticism of human rights in China is a good thing in itself."
"China has an appalling record of inappropriate and wide-scale use of the death penalty, persecution of religious and other minorities, such as unregistered Christian groups, Falun Gong practitioners, Tibetans, etc. However, its inhumane treatment of forced labour prisoners, including allegations of organ trafficking from those executed, poor standards of animal welfare and ignoring of ILO standards, also mean that it has an unfair competitive cost advantage in its exports, which will give rise to legitimate calls for more protectionism, when we should all be striving instead for global free trade."
"China is also obstructing full democracy in Hong Kong, dear to my heart as a British MEP."
"In its recent anti-secession laws, China has also shown a belligerent attitude towards democratic Taiwan, which serves as a model to completely rebut those who say that China is too big and Chinese people too culturally different from the West to have democracy and high standards of human rights."
"Therefore, we must maintain the arms embargo imposed by the EU."
"We cannot ignore China with its annual 11% growth rates, but we must also not shy away from criticising this very great country when it is appropriate."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to say, firstly, that we clearly all agree on the strategic importance of relations with China and I believe that we all share the concern about the situation in terms of human rights and public freedoms."
"There are no disagreements over the need to demand that China make rapid and clear progress on these issues."
"This is not a competition to see who cares most about human rights, because I truly believe that this House is united in that respect."
"We must also acknowledge, however, that China has to deal with enormous challenges, political, social, economic and environmental challenges; it must deal with the consequences of its rapid growth and at the same time it must respond to the growing expectations of its citizens in the field of freedoms, naturally, and of education, health and many other fields."
"We cooperate with China in many of these fields, with European Union human and material resources, in order to contribute to China’s progress and, when problems arise, as in the case of certain commercial issues involving the textile and footwear sectors, we demand reciprocity, but at the same time we remain firm and employ dialogue in order to resolve those problems, because it is also in our interest, of course, to access that market and for our products to be respected under reciprocal conditions."
"Nevertheless, I frankly wonder whether this report is going to help us to strengthen relations, whether it is the right way for us to have more influence on these processes of transformation, whether it helps us to be united in order to exert greater influence, or whether it divides us, and whether it strengthens us so that we can play an active role in the process of change in China, or whether it weakens us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking about EU-China relations, I would like to emphasise the economic ties that are closely associated to the political and human rights aspects emphasised in the report."
"China is becoming one of the most important foreign trade partners of the EU; therefore, the development of cooperation between the EU Member States and China is of great importance, especially in economic and trade relations."
"In the meantime, economic relations between the EU and China are facing some problems."
"China is still not a free but rather a mixed market and planned economy."
"The Communist Party governing the country and controlling national funds is able to interfere in the economy, while state institutions are trying to maintain their influence via bureaucratic procedures and administrative requirements, thus impeding access of EU investments and goods to this market as well as their effect upon the market."
"After China joined the WTO, Chinese products flooded the EU market."
"The balance of trade of EU Member States with China is becoming increasingly unfavourable to the EU."
"Chinese goods are displacing local ones, but China is not willing to open its markets."
"Considering the EU-China strategic partnership that began in 2003, we must pursue China's contribution to make conditions beneficial to foreign trade, improve legal protection for foreign investments and open markets for EU goods and investments."
"Mr President, in the first draft of the EU-China report, the name Tibet does not even appear."
"I am very grateful to the Committee on Foreign Affairs for having supported the amendments proposed by myself and my colleagues in the Tibet intergroup."
"The report describes the foundations and the future orientation of our relations with China and it has an important signalling effect."
"Human rights are not a minor issue, but the starting point of our political activity. They are by no means the expression of so-called typical Western thinking."
"This is not about empty words which sound pleasant and are not binding; it is about practical respect for fundamental rights."
"In paragraph 37, Mr Belder has found a decent compromise and included my amendments."
"We condemn the severe human rights violations in Tibet, the oppression of religious freedom, arbitrary arrests or torture."
"We repudiate the so-called ‘patriotic education campaign’, which involves monks and nuns being forced to make statements denouncing the Dalai Lama as a ‘dangerous separatist’ and proclaiming Tibet to be a part of China."
"We call upon China to grant unimpeded access to the abducted Panchen Lama, the second highest spiritual authority after the Dalai Lama."
"We expressly support the negotiations between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of His Holiness, also regarding genuine autonomy for Tibet."
"In paragraph 82 we demand the abolition of the death penalty and increased protection for minorities."
"I hope that this House will approve both of these amendments tomorrow."
"They are so important for a people that has been robbed of its identity by stealth."
"I recall the Dalai Lama’s visit to Brussels on the 31 May."
"He met MEPs as well as several Commissioners and the President-in-Office of the Council, Wolfgang Schüssel."
"We hope that an increasing number of people in positions of authority in China succeed in freeing themselves from their ideological ballast."
"– There is no such thing as a perfect report."
"The Belder report bears out this view, but it does contain some important, relevant points."
"Firstly, it goes into great detail about the human rights situation and the political, economic, social, labour and environmental problems in China, which are particularly prevalent among minorities such as the Tibetans and the Uighur."
"Amnesty International has just forwarded a document to the Finnish Presidency as regards the EU-China summit, in which it describes the human rights situation in the country, concluding that the little progress that has been achieved is unsatisfactory."
"Forced labour camps, Internet controls, the death penalty and curbs on religious freedoms form part of this sad reality."
"Secondly, the Belder report highlights the importance of China taking seriously its responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council."
"In the EU, we do not accept Beijing’s occasionally threatening stance towards Taiwan."
"Ultimately, China knows that it can achieve what it wants through peaceful means, as in the examples of Hong Kong and Macau, not least as regards its relations with African countries."
"Beijing has not shown that it is committed to sustainable development, democratisation and peace. Far from it in fact;"
"China is one of the main arms exporters to Sudan, a country in which the regime is preparing for yet another bloody onslaught in Darfur. China also imports oil from Sudan."
"Lastly, and most importantly, this report reminds us of the Tiananmen massacre and the importance of maintaining an arms embargo against a regime that refuses to face its own past. It is a country in which people continue to be detained and to disappear, their families kept in the dark."
"We are not naïve."
"We are well aware that European countries, along with the United States and others, continue to sell military technology, or technology for military use, to China, in spite of the arms embargo."
"Clear evidence of the symbolic political importance of this embargo is Beijing’s eagerness to see it lifted at all costs."
"I support the maximum amount of interaction between the EU and Beijing at all levels and in all fields, for example, the economic, political, trade and cultural fields. Yet I also support a language of truth."
"China deserves nothing less, and therefore the embargo is a useful tool to have in place until China faces up to what happened on those fateful days in June 1989 and until it stops exporting arms to, and supporting, regimes that massacre and oppress their people, as in the cases of Sudan and Myanmar."
"It is vital that the EU maintain this embargo, especially as the EU has yet to make its Code of Conduct legally binding."
"We owe it to the EU, to our values, and to the thousands of Chinese citizens who are now living better, economically speaking, but who are ever more fearful about freedom and democracy."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, China is now at the heart of the world economy, which is why, through its new trade strategy, the European Union must construct a balanced partnership with China."
"With regard to the latest trade disputes, the European Union must not fail to ensure that intellectual property rules are respected and permit easier access to the Chinese market."
"If China’s emergence as an economic superpower creates obstacles, it also makes new prospects available to the European Union, on condition however that international trade regulations are respected."
"It is not so much a question of avoiding putting protectionist measures in place as of making China aware that, as a full member of the WTO, it has a duty to respect the rules of a fair and balanced world market."
"That being the case, the implementation of anti-dumping or safeguard measures – which are legal instruments for protecting trade – is merely the outward effect of trade imbalances and no obstacle at all to our taking up the challenge of fairer globalisation."
"In adopting its new strategy on China, the European Union will have to protect itself against accusations, and possible indications, of engaging in unfair competition and facilitate European manufacturers’ and exporters’ access to the Chinese market."
"Parallel with this, and in order to abide by a partnership based on balanced exchanges, Europe will have to take up the challenge of competitiveness, technological progress and innovation."
"Let us ensure, Commissioner, that China has as much need of us as we have of China."
"– Mr President, China is a strategic partner for the EU and Europe acknowledges China’s status as a rising power on the international stage."
"In recent years, relations between China and Europe have improved in many fields, particularly in trade, as well as in the field of technical and scientific cooperation."
"The most important example of strategic partnership is perhaps cooperation on Galileo, the European satellite navigation programme."
"The EU is China’s most significant partner and investor, while China is the EU’s second largest trading partner."
"As a rising economic power and permanent member of the UN Security Council and a member of the WTO, China bears increasing responsibility for international security and global peace."
"It is from this point of view that I would like to draw attention to the information sent by Amnesty International to the Finnish presidency in relation to the EU-China summit to be held on 9 September this year."
"Amnesty International has drawn attention to violations of human rights in China."
"Their information raises the question of the use of capital punishment in China, ‘re-education’ through forced labour, arbitrary arrest and detention, the use of torture and persecution against human rights activists and lack of media freedom in that country."
"Amnesty International has also raised the issue of the sale of arms by China to Sudan as an example of a foreign policy that ignores fundamental human rights in the modern world."
"The European Union must combine its strategic partnership with China with work to persuade the Chinese authorities to expand political and personal freedoms in the Chinese system and to truly observe the constitution and international treaties to which China is a signatory."
"Mr President, when engaged in a partnership with a dictatorship, the crucial issue is to create a credible balance between economic and strategic interests on the one hand, and democratic values on the other."
"This report expresses serious concern over the latter, and rightly so."
"Indeed, we must face the reality that increased economic relations have not resulted in any real progress in the field of the rule of law."
"Also, experience shows that merely expressing concern over human rights has no impact on dictatorships."
"Therefore, our message for the EU-China summit should be that there will be no automatic progress in economic relations without real progress in the rule of law."
"The EU, as China’s largest trading partner, has the leverage to force China’s leaders to start implementing genuine democratic reforms."
"I have a few comments."
"The economic relations themselves need to be balanced."
"In China there is wholesale counterfeiting of EU brands, competition is distorted and intellectual property rights ignored."
"EU Members States are, in all probability, importing large quantities of goods produced by prisoners in laogai torture camps."
"That is a moral outrage."
"Secondly, there is Tibet."
"The EU must make it one of its priorities to insist that China grants Tibet cultural and religious autonomy, and also opens a dialogue with the Dalai Lama."
"Tibet is rated by Freedom House as being, along with Chechnya, one of the world’s two worst-off territories."
"The EU should stress the seriousness it attaches to this by appointing an EU special representative for Tibetan affairs."
"Thirdly, there is Taiwan."
"Taiwan-China policy should fully respect the democratic choices of the 23 million inhabitants of Taiwan."
"We should also insist that Beijing allow Taiwan to enter into practical cooperation with the World Health Organisation and other international bodies."
"– Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is the region in the world with the greatest buying power, and that speaks for itself."
"We are an attractive market for Chinese manufacturers, and we are a good source of income for Chinese workers."
"We are in a win-win situation."
"Thanks to affordable purchases and a wage situation different to our own, our consumers can buy affordable products, and meanwhile in China they have financial reserves totalling hundreds of billions enabling them to buy products from us as well."
"I am thus talking about opening our markets to each other, reducing quotas, lowering customs duties, which will lead to a win-win situation on both sides."
"As the speaker on questions of energy for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the issue of energy and the issue of Kyoto are matters of particular importance to me."
"China plays a very important role in the field of coal: 75% of its energy is produced from coal and, Mr Brok, only 1% from nuclear energy."
"We must therefore face up to reality: 75% of the Chinese require a great deal of technology in order to get onto a level footing with Kyoto and with the general implementation."
"Here there are great opportunities for both sides, just as there are in the use of water power."
"In this field China has enormous potential: worldwide, it has the largest share of water power."
"Here there are still many resources that can be developed in the future."
"The consumption of crude oil, too, which at the moment amounts to around 5.5% of world consumption, will rapidly increase in the future."
"At present, China accounts for 40% of the additional worldwide demand for oil."
"We can see that energy is a central challenge, and I would ask the Commissioner to properly address this issue at the summit."
"Mr President, I would like to make a few brief comments."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the Chair of the Committee and the rapporteur, and, secondly, the Commissioner for her presence in the plenary here this afternoon and this evening, while others were absent because they were busy waiting for a flying visit from the Iranian mediators and therefore do not have time for this House."
"Thirdly, we refused to appoint a Special Representative in the Committee because a Special Representative is impossible to control."
"Such Representatives are expensive, and there is already in any case an inflated number of Special Representatives, whom no one is able to inspect."
"For this reason, it is important in my view that we find solutions that can work within the framework of the Commission."
"I am in favour of supporting Tibet and supporting its cultural identity, but we should not undermine the Commission, which has the powers to deal with human rights."
"The Special Representative would set himself up in the Council, where, because of the legal situation, this House would be unable to intervene."
"We therefore agree with what you have to say in terms of content, but we think that your methods are incorrect."
"."
"Mr President, this debate was very timely and it has provided me with food for thought for the EU-China summit in Helsinki."
"I should like to add that the vast majority of subjects raised tonight will also feature clearly on the summit agenda and I will report back to you on that."
"Let me make a general point on the relationship between trade and human rights, which is a central theme of this report."
"I am not sure whether specific linkages are desirable or feasible, but I would argue that this is an inevitable connection, insofar as China’s opening is strongly predicated on its WTO accession, which, apart from frequently raised important issues like intellectual property rights, involves also an overhaul of the Chinese legal system, with an emphasis on the rule of law."
"It must be said that real progress has been made."
"That is fundamental in moving forward in of the human rights questions raised today and it is even happening almost by stealth."
"Let me come back to some specific points that have been raised tonight."
"Firstly, on Tibet, we share the concerns expressed by the European Parliament regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and in particular the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people."
"We have regularly addressed the issue of Tibet in the framework of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, including summits."
"As part of this overall policy vis-à-vis Tibet, for many years we have been asking for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, as that is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question."
"We have therefore taken note of the talks between the envoys of the Dalai Lama and the representatives of China."
"Let me also say a word on Taiwan."
"We have been consistent throughout in urging the two sides to resolve their issues through a peaceful dialogue."
"In this regard we have also noted some recent positive developments in the cross-strait situation."
"We have to recognise that there are new Chinese efforts to restart discussions with Chinese and Taiwanese opposition politicians."
"Flights across the Straits have resumed, but an inclusive dialogue with all parties in Taiwan is also needed."
"This is important."
"Let me also make a point concerning our bilateral relationship and the relationship with the United States of America."
"As Mr Lambsdorff said, it is important to talk about China to the US about common concerns, for example on open markets and human rights, because we can achieve more together vis-à-vis China."
"However, it is also clear that a strategic dialogue with the US, which we have at official level, does not mean that we have to agree right across the board."
"On the long-standing issue of the arms embargo, it is true that we are willing to continue working towards a possible lifting of the embargo, on the basis of our joint statement of 2004, the EU-China Summit and the subsequent European Council conclusions."
"However, at the same time, we have left China with no doubt as to the importance of progress on human rights in order to create a more positive atmosphere for lifting the embargo."
"We have also made clear our commitment to ensure that lifting the embargo would not lead to any substantive change in the strategic balance in the Asian region and that the national security of friendly and allied countries would be fully taken into account."
"So, again, this is one of those issues that is very important."
"On the very specific and important issue of shoes, let me say that on 30 August 2006 the Commission adopted a proposal to impose anti-dumping duties on certain leather shoes from China and Vietnam."
"Reflecting the finding that dumping exists and EU producers are suffering harm, we have proposed a duty of 16.5% for China and 10% for Vietnam for certain leather shoes."
"This proposal now passes to the Member States, which have one month in which to consider it for adoption."
"That is the situation at present."
"On the sectoral dialogues, my services produce regular updates and these are on our websites."
"A further update will be available shortly."
"I should like to close with two general statements."
"Again, as I said at the start, we are committed to human rights, social and economic rights, which include in particular freedom of expression, religion, association and protection of the rights of minorities. I should also like to say that the death penalty is one of those questions continually being addressed."
"I should also like to re-emphasise what I said before about the Falun Gong."
"Finally, in response to Mr Brok, and as I said at the beginning, we need China to become a responsible member of the international community, but more than just a stakeholder: it needs to be a positive and an active contributing partner."
"It is a very important member of the international community, being a permanent member of the Security Council."
"All of that will feature prominently in our communication, which will be available in the autumn."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the report by Carmen Fraga Estévez, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on launching a debate on a Community approach towards eco-labelling schemes for fisheries products (2005/2189(INI)) (A6-0219/2006)."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for this report, the first thing I would like to stress is the unquestionable role that a credible label or certification can play, among other measures that can be taken, in our efforts to guarantee sustainable fishing."
"Nevertheless, the issue has been on the table in the European Commission since the 1990s and so far nobody has decided to deal with it."
"In the meantime, in a market that is becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues, private promoters of eco-labels for fishery products are feathering their nests, causing complete confusion amongst consumers, at best, and more than likely discrediting the system in general, since when a premium can be added to a product by saying that it is ecological, without the need to prove it, then fraud is a likely outcome."
"I am one of the people who have often reminded the Commission that it should deal with this issue as soon as possible."
"Hence the disappointment that some of us felt when the Commission finally published this communication: a document almost without content, lacking in analysis, which makes no commitment whatsoever and which does not provide any criteria or guidelines to follow."
"It clearly did not require more than ten years to achieve this result and the Commission is clearly totally overwhelmed by the reality of the attractive market in eco-labelling and the many private interests that sustain it, some of which are laudable and some of which are not."
"In that regard, I would like to mention that, when he appeared before the Committee on Fisheries on leaving office, the former Commissioner Mr Fischler confessed that something he had been unable to tackle by the end of his term-in-office had been rules on eco-labelling and that that – and I quote – was ‘due to pressure from many quarters’."
"To this we can add the fact that reliably establishing the criteria for defining a sustainable fisheries product is undoubtedly a much more complex task than it may at first appear."
"We must get to work though, because other interested parties are doing it for us and many of them only have their own interests in mind."
"The Commission is not alone in this task either, because it already has the guidelines issued by the FAO, and debates in many international fora, including the World Trade Organisation."
"Governments, NGOs, private companies and fishermen have also expressed their opinions."
"By means of this report, with the invaluable and varied contributions of many colleagues, including those of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the European Parliament is also offering its contribution to the definition of guidelines that will enable consumers, politicians and the fisheries sector to become more involved in the sustainability of fisheries resources."
"We believe that, in a global sense, a Community system of labelling must be consistent with the existing guidelines of international bodies, that it must not lead to any kind of discrimination, nor create obstacles to trade, particularly that of the least-developed countries, and that it must act as a weapon for combating illegal fishing by denying it access to the markets."
"With regard to its internal functioning, the Committee on Fisheries believes that, regardless of whether there are one or several labels, always of a voluntary nature, the system must be a single system and must be promoted by the European Union, which must establish its operating rules and guarantee the independence of the accreditation and certification bodies, as well as the transparency and accuracy of the information at all stages in the chain of custody, from the fishing vessel to the final consumer."
"We also call upon the Commission to present, within six months, a communication on the minimum requirements and guidelines for a Community scheme for labelling fisheries products. I would also like the Commission, finally, to clarify whether it is in favour of calling it an eco-label, or whether it is opting for another name and why, and we would urge it to take account of the considerations addressed to it by this House."
". Mr President, firstly I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur Mrs Fraga Estévez and the Committee on Fisheries and to Mrs Ries and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for a constructive report on a Community approach to eco-labelling for fisheries products."
"I am pleased at the high degree of interest they have shown in the Commission’s communication."
"In fact, the report is a fitting and valuable contribution to the debate on eco-labelling."
"It contains many elements and ideas that are helpful to strengthen further the debate."
"The Commission indeed attaches great importance to the development of a consistent policy on eco-labelling and to a consistent integration of environmental concerns into the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Together with other actions proposed by the Commission, such as the implementation of sustainability which leads to sustainable yields, or the promotion of more environment-friendly fishing methods, I see eco-labelling as a complementary tool for a more environment-friendly fisheries policy."
"At the same time it satisfies the interests of both consumers and the industry."
"I would like to thank Mr Morillon for his description of eco-labelling as a positive sanction supporting sustainable behaviour."
"Eco-labelling is a relatively new approach in the context of sustainable fisheries management. It is based on a voluntary and participative approach, through which fishermen will in future, within the limits of the standards set by legislation, define requirements and implement them."
"Such a voluntary approach has been adopted in other fields, particularly in that of food safety with the enforcing of the HACCP system, and has proved highly successful."
"I thank you for lending your support to that approach."
"I am happy to see that the Commission and Parliament share the same views on the overall objectives of eco-labelling schemes, on the principles and features that credible schemes should contain, and on the need to address properly a complex and currently rather anarchic reality."
"Traceability, transparency, a sound scientific basis, and third-party certification are essential."
"I see these as the prerequisites that will help us make the most of eco-labelling schemes and that will contribute to the sustainability of fisheries."
"In the Commission we opted for launching a debate on the right approach rather than proposing operational provisions at too early a stage."
"I understand that many of you feel that the Commission should have been more assertive."
"However, I am convinced that it was wise to proceed as we did."
"Due to the originality of the approach, the ambitious objective we have and the controversy that issues like these invariably raise, it would have been premature to bring forward an operational proposal as early as June last year."
"I assure you that our choice to launch a debate first has proven to be successful."
"It has facilitated and accelerated the exchange of views and relevant experience between all sides concerned."
"As a result we now have a sound and almost complete picture of the situation, on which we can base further Community action."
"The active participation of the Community in the FAO debate has given us an early advantage, and by launching the debate and participating in fruitful exchanges of views we have strengthened our leading position in this matter."
"The definition of the notion of sustainability is at the heart of the debate."
"Many of the parties involved have inquired about relevant criteria."
"To follow up on this, DG Fisheries has set up a group of independent experts to work on that very issue."
"The expert group is on the point of concluding its work."
"Based on that work the Commission will draft guidelines for the setting-up of eco-labelling schemes and will propose a list of minimum requirements against which private eco-labelling schemes could be assessed."
"I have taken note of the resolution’s request for a communication to be addressed to the Council and to Parliament within the next six months."
"I have no difficulty in reverting to Parliament."
"However, at this point in time, the shape and form of the Commission’s proposals have still to be determined."
"Looking at the broader picture, I believe it would be more appropriate to come back to Parliament once the whole consultation exercise has been concluded."
"That would allow us to carry out a thorough assessment of the following discussions and consultations: a second shareholder consultation, to be held before the end of this year, which would be an opportunity to gather views on the future guidelines; further discussions in the Council in the months to come, which will conclude the current discussion phase; and, additionally, the report from the expert group, which will form the basis for the preparation of operational provisions that could be tabled during the course of next year."
"All this will give us a further opportunity to discuss the future Community approach towards eco-labelling on a consolidated and even more informed basis."
"That whole process should lead to the adoption of specific and concrete decisions."
"With regard to Amendments 1 and 2, the Commission believes that eco-labelling is a tool that will contribute to a more sustainable exploitation of fish stocks and improve the effectiveness of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"With regard to Amendment 3, it reiterates some of the advantages of adopting the third option for establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes, as mentioned in the Commission communication."
"I thank you for this report and the wider debate generated on eco-labelling."
"I am confident that at the end of this process we can put into operation a proper basis for eco-labelling schemes that should have far-reaching and positive effects."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mrs Fraga, on the quality of her finely nuanced report which successfully reflects the complexity of what is at stake."
"The overall objective is to encourage the sector to adopt fishing methods more in keeping with the objectives of sustainable economic, social and environmental development."
"Indeed, there is no denying the facts: the overexploitation of fisheries resources affects 25% of species and, in the case of a number of these, in a particularly worrying way."
"Where cod alone is concerned, stocks are down to a third of the minimum volume recommended by scientific experts if this species is not to become extinct."
"These are the terms in which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has emphasised its priorities in the opinion it has drafted."
"We have our doubts about the option favoured by the Commission in this debate, namely that of establishing minimum demands – as referred to by the Commissioner – regarding these eco-labelling schemes."
"Our own choice is meant to be more ambitious: single, centralised labelling according to essential criteria whereby the scheme is transparent, optional in character, accessible and credible – a point emphasised by the rapporteur."
"Admittedly, the success of this initiative depends on the actors in the sector being properly consulted."
"In the end, it basically depends, however, on consumer choice."
"In this connection, it is instructive to visit, as I myself have done, the fish counter of a supermarket and read the injunctions to ‘protect the sea’, ‘support sustainable fishing’, ‘fish ecologically’ and so on. There is a host of confusing messages."
"With this proliferation of labels, the risk we run is that of missing our target."
"Consumers will feel neither involved nor encouraged to make the more informed choices we should like them to make, and we shall not have succeeded in achieving our objective, that is to say of creating a virtuous circle."
"I therefore share Mrs Fraga’s conclusions and hope that the Commission will, in the end, take a serious and analytical look at the options proposed and will take account of our recommendations in the next stages of this process."
"."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, what does sustainable fishing mean?"
"How do the various labels that currently exist succeed in protecting fishing and in enabling us to say that fishing is sustainable?"
"The report states that the European Union must address the issue of curbing the proliferation of different eco-labels and guarantee the establishment of a Community system that is based on the same principles and on the same basic requirements."
"We support that decision, but it must be stressed first and foremost that the implementation of an eco-labelling system will have a strong impact on production in the entire sector: we must begin by starting and developing a debate with operators in the sector so as to carefully assess the consequences for the sector that will result from the decisions adopted for this certification system."
"Secondly, we must bear in mind the specific characteristics and features of the coastal areas in which the system will be applied: in other words, the standards and rules will have to be adapted to the reality of the local ecological, environmental and socio-economic system."
"Thirdly, the application of the label must be backed up by socio-economic activity-based initiatives aimed at encouraging operators in the sector to join the voluntary system and by information campaigns aimed at consumers."
"Finally, we must pay attention to the fact that the implementation of an eco-label for fishery products must be thoroughly integrated with the recognised quality systems in force so as to prevent any overlapping or discrepancies between laws, so as not to cause confusion among consumers and so as to create synergies among the systems, thus enabling resources to be saved."
"."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Fraga on the interesting report we are debating today in this House."
"In-depth study of consumers’ preferences and attitudes is a fundamental need for any industry, and that clearly includes the fisheries products industry."
"The change in living habits and the introduction of new technologies have led to an evolution amongst European consumers, who are increasingly concerned about their health and also the protection of the environment."
"One of the best methods for providing information is labelling, which must therefore be clear and comprehensible and contain accurate information."
"I am therefore delighted that the Commission is at last dealing with this debate on systems of labelling for fisheries products with a view to defining the European Union’s approach to this issue."
"The truth is that the increasing importance that consumers attach to sustainable development has led to a disconcerting range of private labels, without any kind of control, which may undermine their initial purpose, that is, as guarantees of a catching and processing system that respects the environment."
"If, furthermore, it provides additional information on the sustainability of the product, the independence of the control and certification body must be guaranteed, as the rapporteur quite rightly points out."
"In this regard, I agree with the words of the Spanish Director-General for Fisheries Structures and Markets, Alberto López, who pointed to the need to prevent the trivialisation of eco-labelling."
"In fact, if the labels do not conform to standardised, accredited parameters, all we will achieve will be labels that are all at that level; harmonisation will take place, but for purely commercial reasons, rather than with a view to tackling the real issue."
"In this regard, I can only applaud the FAO’s initiative to audit all eco-labels in order to identify those which have technical and scientific support and seek consistency and harmonisation."
"We in the Committee on Fisheries share the Commission’s objectives, such as sustainability and the need for European action in this field."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on a very thoughtful report."
"It identifies the crucial issues and contributes considerably to the debate concerning them."
"Of the amendments, we support only Amendment 2, taking the view that Amendments 1 and 3 are covered sufficiently by the existing text."
"Clearly, whatever system we develop must be voluntary, in the sense that companies should be able to choose whether or not to become involved."
"It must also respect the need for other types of labelling, such as those concerning quality."
"That said, the report rightly draws attention to the difficulties of doing no more than establishing minimum criteria for voluntary schemes."
"FAO standards mean that there must be a dimension of public ownership. This requires some form of independent monitoring at the very least."
"For these reasons, we believe that a single Community labelling scheme merits fuller exploration."
"There are clearly potential advantages and disadvantages, but it should be possible to devise something which recognises different fisheries and products, but is neither cumbersome nor bureaucratic."
"Whatever the eventual choice, speaking personally as a consumer rather than a legislator, I would make one plea for the use of some clearly identifiable common symbol, comparable to the CE mark currently employed, where we have harmonised rules concerning the health and safety of products."
"We hope that Parliament will give overwhelming endorsement to the report and we look to speedy progress towards an appropriate outcome."
"Mr President, thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez, for your constructive and well-balanced report."
"We have an election in Sweden."
"One of the election issues is the lack of cod."
"Voters ask me: ‘How am I to be ethical in eating fish?’"
"Only this week, I have given them six pages of recommendations on precisely that subject."
"We need labelling that is easily understandable so that we can go home with a clear conscience and eat good fish."
"Those who buy eco-labelled fish also want to know that the stock is not threatened."
"If the last cod is eaten, having been caught with very good equipment, in the correct way and under the right circumstances, it is still the last cod."
"Such a situation is emphatically not sustainable ecologically."
"I therefore think that Amendment 2 is important, emphasising as it does that threatened species, precisely by virtue of being threatened, simply cannot be fished in an ecologically responsible way."
"I wish to emphasise two aspects of Mrs Fraga Estévez’ report. Independent control, as mentioned in paragraph 6, is very important in conferring credibility."
"Moreover, it is very important that we in some way facilitate clear labelling for small-scale fisheries."
"Clear labelling may constitute a competitive advantage for small-scale fisheries."
"We must therefore ensure that it can be exploited and puts small-scale fisheries in a fair competitive position."
". – I too would like to thank Mrs Fraga Estévez for her report."
"The first issue raised by this report is whether there really is a need for eco-labelling for fisheries products, and whether this can actually help add value to the product and in turn bring benefits to the consumer."
"As the rapporteur points out, according to Regulation (EC) 2371/2002, all fisheries activities carried out in the EU should by definition be sustainable, since they should conform to Community standards. It therefore follows that all fisheries products caught on the basis of those standards will have eco-labelling."
"Nevertheless, any eco-labelling of fisheries products caught on the basis of criteria other than those laid down in existing legislation concerning the fishing catch may lead to discrimination between producers."
"We therefore feel that eco-labelling would be a positive step. Eco-labelling also takes place in farming, aquaculture and processed foods, enabling issues relating to the environment and food safety to be properly addressed."
"Eco-labelling would also work in relation to all imported products, which would have to comply with the Community regulation on fisheries products."
"A further issue is whether a Community-level label of this nature would bring benefits over the variety of existing labels on the market, as highlighted by previous speakers, given that these labels can be misleading to consumers and are often simply the result of a marketing strategy by companies, without any public certification."
"In this regard, we believe that a Community-level label would be complex, bureaucratic and excessively restrictive for organisations in the fisheries sector and for the Member States."
"What is needed is to set up a public certification framework with the direct involvement of the authorities in the Member States."
"This is the right way forward for defining the rules on this issue, in which there is a legal vacuum."
"As regards the issue of the added value that may accrue from this kind of labelling, we believe that there is a need to ensure its distribution in the value chain in order that producers’ efforts and investments might be rewarded without consumers being penalised."
"Mr President, the principle of eco-labelling is sound."
"The danger is that when the EU bureaucracy and red tape get to work, the system that emerges could be unwieldy, excessively burdensome and very expensive."
"The fisheries sector already suffers enough from EU stipulations and restrictions."
"The most that the EU should do is to set minimum requirements to be met by voluntary eco-labelling schemes."
"Thus I would have to part company from those who support a single Community scheme with what is termed ‘ambitious criteria’, but which to the industry might seem more like excessive regulation."
"Fundamentally, we are looking for good traceability and proof of sustainable practices. These can be secured by setting sensible and manageable minimum standards."
"We do not need another array of regulation or army of inspectors."
"We need sometimes to temper Utopian environmental demands with business reality."
"Whatever the eventual outcome, I hope that will be a hallmark of the scheme."
"Nonetheless I congratulate the rapporteur on her thoughtful report."
"Tonight I also take some pleasure in commiserating with our rapporteur."
"I refer of course to the fact that tonight my small country of Northern Ireland famously defeated the mighty football team of Spain at Windsor Park in Belfast."
"That is something that does not happen very often, but when it happens it is worthy of note!"
"It comes on a good day: a day when Northern Ireland football supporters won the coveted Brussels International Supporters Award for 2006, which is sponsored and supported by the EU."
"I shall end on that happy note."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on her outstanding report and to say that in view of the growing interest in safe, high-quality food products, the need to preserve marine ecosystems and the recent upsurge in products with what is known as eco-labelling, a Community approach to eco-labelling is urgently needed."
"A number of new, high-quality eco-labelling schemes have appeared around the world, including one in my country, POPA (the Azores Fisheries Observation Programme), which certifies the tuna catch in the Azores Autonomous Region. The problem is that not all environmental certification programmes prioritise the protection of the biological heritage of our oceans."
"Instead, there is a range of economic interests often hidden behind this kind of labelling, and this is why, in order to protect the environment and the consumer, we must proceed with great care and assume our responsibilities as political decision makers."
"Among the different proposals put forward by the Commission in this communication, the one that can best serve the interests at hand is that of establishing minimum requirements for voluntary eco-labelling schemes."
"In this way, on the basis of these pre-established minimum requirements, eco-labelling schemes can develop freely, on a flexible, voluntary basis, via public or private initiatives, yet within a generic regulatory framework."
"As a public entity, the EU must define these minimum requirements because only then will it be possible to protect the general interest and the prerogatives enshrined in the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Lastly, I should also like to point out that this is work that we have to do, both in the context of the Union and in the framework of trade relations outside the Union, in order to guarantee transparency, credibility and fairness, not least because eco-labelling is set to become a further means of distinguishing between products with repercussions for competitiveness."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur on her exceptional work and to say that we all know that the various food crises that have come to the public's attention over recent years have created a feeling of insecurity among consumers, with the result that a strong trend towards the demand for high quality products and more frequent quality certification is developing on the market."
"Eco-certification and labelling lie at the centre of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy."
"Promoting and applying eco-labelling systems strengthens environmental awareness among consumers, thereby encouraging environmental responsibility among producers, by making them more aware of the environmental repercussions of fisheries and aquaculture."
"What is needed today is to safeguard the development of a uniform labelling system by informing and working with all the agencies involved, a system based on identical basic principles and preconditions, in accordance with the guidelines of the UN Food and Agriculture Office and the guidelines issued by the International Organisation for Standardisation."
"I should also like to point out that public health and the viability of fisheries should not be exhausted merely within a labelling system."
"They should be the subject of a constant quest to formulate the sustainable fisheries policy which is our basic objective."
"Mr President, I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Fraga Estévez on her report on the Commission’s communication and also Mrs Ries, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I am pleased to see – and this also demonstrates that the Committee on Fisheries can deal with topics in an adult manner – that there is a certain level of harmonisation with regard to the way in which an eco-label can be introduced into the fisheries sector."
"One would be tempted to say that in the fisheries sector, every free fish that is caught at sea or in inland waterways deserves an eco-label: it was, after all, raised in a sound, natural living environment, but that is probably not the intention and we will therefore need to look at what can be done at international level, including outside Europe, on the basis of criteria issued by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO)."
"In that sense, I have to say that I agree with the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez."
"If you opt for a European eco-label, you have to do it properly."
"That means that the fish that falls within its scope must meet all the rules with regard to the enforcement of the quota."
"The rules of environmental legislation must also be met, which also requires the necessary efforts from the Member States, but it could be a good guarantee."
"If you do not do it that way, then it is better to get the industry to deal with it and ensure that a good label is introduced in response to consumer demand."
"I, however, would opt for the rapporteur’s line, with clear-cut conditions, also for the Commission, so that the eco-label meets the European quota regulations and everything that is connected to this."
"In that way, the Commission facilitates and industry submits the applications, which appears to be the right way of going about things."
"I should like to add a brief comment about small-scale coastal fishing, something to which, I think it good to devote attention."
"I myself come from an area where small shrimps are caught."
"An eco-label has now been introduced in that sector as well, which I welcome, certainly if that also emphatically involves sustainable fishing, as well as a number of other things."
"In that sense, I am pleased with this report and pleased that this House, by means of Mrs Fraga Estévez’ report, can make a positive step towards sound qualified European eco-labelling."
"– I should also like to congratulate both our rapporteur from the Committee on Fisheries and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"I have found this debate extremely interesting and I feel that the rapporteur is quite right to highlight the lack of tightness in the definition of the options presented to us by the Commission."
"What I find absolutely central to the issue is what is referred to in point 8 of our resolution, which is also found in the opinion of the Committee on the Environment; namely that the labelling will only be properly effective if it is uniform and easily comprehensible to the consumer."
"This is incompatible with a system in which the Commission has a secondary role and in which publicity concerns carry greater weight than a series of tight, objective criteria."
"From this point of view, therefore, I feel that we must adopt a strong, centralised position, as highlighted by the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment."
"We must not backslide on this position, because otherwise we run the risk of wasting our efforts and losing the initiative completely."
"– Mr President, I too wish to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, on her usual excellent work."
"I also wish to congratulate the Commission on starting a dialogue on eco-labelling."
"Eco-labelling on fisheries products states that they were produced in accordance with a specific series of environmental rules and that their method of production does not have adverse repercussions on the environment."
"It is very important that we ensure that eco-labelling is reliable."
"This will protect both fish stocks and consumers."
"An effort must be made to inform consumers, who must support it, be informed and understand that, in buying eco-labelled products, they can be sure that they are buying healthy and safe food and that they are protecting the environment."
"We will all win from these efforts: consumers will win because they will be supplied with safe and healthy products, undertakings will win because they will increase their competitiveness and the environment will win because its resources will be exploited ecologically."
"To close, I wish to recapitulate: firstly, labelling must be voluntary; secondly, labelling must be dominated by a spirit of transparency, so that no one doubts its reliability; thirdly, labelling must be by an independent authority and fourthly, this effort requires – and I emphasise this even though it is self-evident – fishermen to be present at the talks."
"Woe betide if we ignore them."
"We need to sit down at the same table, we need to consult them and they need to understand that the effort being made is in their interest."
"Fifthly and lastly, this effort and the principles laid down and adopted by the European Union must be combined with similar action on a global scale and all the states must adopt these principles, because it makes no sense if the European Union alone is protecting the environment."
"– Mr President, the rapporteur’s of the environmental debate sums up our current experience, and particularly that of the FAO."
"It stresses the basic function of labelling and its importance in improving the quality of fish products and giving the fishing sector a proper social structure."
"I can state with satisfaction that the new Member States from the Baltic region agree with the aims of the Commission’s communiqué."
"However, their position expressed a preference for certain aspects of the problem of labelling."
"Four issues are of particular importance in this case."
"Firstly, the Baltic states decidedly support the idea of establishing minimum requirements for eco-labelling programmes, in line with the expectations of the parties involved, namely the fishermen, processors and consumers."
"These programmes should be based on voluntary participation."
"Secondly, the principle of voluntary participation must mean, in practice, the rejection of all economic discrimination or trade barriers."
"Thirdly, a major element of these guarantees must be to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises and firms from less developed countries have equal access to the system."
"Fourthly, there is also concern in Baltic states about the limitations related to the control and supervision of fishing in open waters, which has been occurring for years and has been difficult to eliminate."
"At the moment, it is easier to see a difference in terms of environmental consequences in the aquaculture sector, where labelling is far easier to introduce."
"Finally, I would like to say that I agree with Mrs Fraga’s ‘tool in the box’ message, which is an inspiration for the European Union, and provides us with a real opportunity to show the world how to look for ways of implementing long-awaited schemes in the field of eco- labelling."
"Mr President, first of all, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"As usual, she has produced an excellent report; we expect nothing else from her."
"Labelling is the ‘in’ word at present, and if we must have it, let us keep it simple and clear."
"It should not be a further burden on the industry."
"I would also plead for input from those who have to implement this labelling to make sure that it is clear and transparent, that it is of good design and can easily be seen and understood."
"Mr Maat was right when he said that the Commission must make a good job of it."
"I fully support what he says."
"This must not be used as a stick to beat the industry."
"I am concerned that it could be used by some of the scientists and others as an opportunity to curb TACs and quotas when there is disagreement between fishermen and the scientists."
"I do not believe we need or require a ‘one size fits all’ policy."
"If we go down that road, we will create a hornets’ nest."
"Not everywhere has the same problems and I am deeply conscious of the need, where necessary, to ensure that regional differences are respected."
"I listened to the Commissioner with interest."
"He said he would come back to Parliament when the Commission had taken a decision."
"Might it not be better to consult Parliament along the way, rather than come back and tell us what you have decided, Commissioner?"
"You talked about a ‘tool in your box’."
"This must not become another tool in your box thanks to which you can place bureaucratic control on the industry."
"I am not totally convinced that the consumer is really demanding this."
"Finally, can I say to Mrs Fraga Estévez and to you, Mr President, there is great joy in Belfast tonight: we beat the Spanish football team 3-2."
"Northern Ireland is a very small place of one and a half million people, and we have had many problems over the years."
"It seems that at football we can beat the English, we can beat the Germans and we can beat the Spanish, but last Saturday there were lots of tears in Belfast when Iceland beat us 3-0."
"So it is a source of great joy tonight that we have beaten Spain."
"Thank you, Mr Nicholson."
"I cannot say you deliver good news for us, but congratulations to you anyway."
"."
"Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Fraga Estévez, and everyone who has spoken tonight."
"Although not in agreement on all aspects, the Commission and Parliament are on the same wavelength as regards moving towards adopting decisions based on tariff assessments and broad consultations."
"I would underline to the last speaker, Mr Nicholson, that the debate tonight fully reflects the way the Commission wanted to involve Parliament before entering the legislative phase of what needs to be done on eco-labelling."
"Obviously, when it comes to that legislative phase, the involvement of Parliament will be a top priority prior to finalisation of the whole process relating to the eco-labelling scheme."
"Let me refer to some specific points that were raised during the debate."
"Most of the existing schemes are in effect relatively consistent and are not misleading."
"The Commission’s preferred option for establishing minimum criteria for eco-labelling schemes will, however, bring order to the system, where necessary, and increase consumer confidence."
"We will also be ensuring better quality products and providing for transparency and the traceability of products on the market."
"On the point raised by various speakers on the preference for a single eco-labelling scheme, it is still early to take a definitive and final decision."
"The Commission has, however, indicated its preferred option and I should underline that the Economic and Social Committee, the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Agriculture, and most industry and stakeholders’ representatives support that option."
"However, although a preference for Option 3 the Commission’s preferred option which is to say the setting of minimum criteria, seems to be emerging, no agreement has yet been reached between Member States at Council level."
"That is why I underline the fact that it is still too early to take a firm and definitive stand on how to proceed."
"However, this debate has certainly helped to better inform us on Parliament’s position and on that of its various Members."
"On the issue of the harvesting of fisheries resources in a sustainable way, I wish to refer to the Commission’s communication, which underlines that the aim of the policy on eco-labelling for fish and fisheries products is based on the concept of sustainable fishing."
"The communications spells out that eco-labelling schemes, if based on clearly-defined criteria and appropriate indicators, can assist in both monitoring the progress made on sustainability in fishing and in raising public awareness on sustainability issues."
"It goes on to make reference to sustainable exploitation with regard to Article 3(e) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002."
"Regarding the other points raised, I agree with the comments on the importance of independent accreditation and certification."
"Guarantees in this area are provided by ISO standards and procedures."
"However, the Commission has no direct competence to enforce those norms."
"I also agree with the comments made to the effect that eco-labelling needs to be clear and clearly understandable so that it is easily understood by consumers."
"Moreover, eco-labels offer the possibility of helping to combat IUU fishing and of promoting proof with regard to sustainable fishing practices."
"By virtue of the whole exercise undertaken, we will be increasing awareness among the general public."
"FAO criteria will be taken into account when it comes to laying the basis of eco-labelling schemes."
"Moreover, the schemes must not be cumbersome to SMEs, or so complex that they cannot be effectively implemented by stakeholders."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the recommendation by Diana Wallis, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law (COM(2005)0639 7591/2006 C6-0138/2006 2005/0251(AVC)) (A6-0250/2006), and"
"- the oral question by Giuseppe Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission on the involvement of the European Parliament in the work of the Hague Conference following the accession of the Community (O-0076/2006 B6-0324/2006)."
"."
"Mr President, we all know that Europe’s citizens are on the move."
"We have overtly encouraged this within our own borders through the principle of free movement."
"However, our citizens are also mobile throughout the world and they can end up in all sorts of improbable situations and scrapes that involve them dealing with civil law in the courts."
"Such is the nature of modern life."
"So far as it is feasible we want to be able to offer them some sort of certainty at these moments of personal crisis."
"For more than 100 years, The Hague Conference on Private International Law has worked tirelessly and with an ever-growing number of countries across the globe to put together numerous international conventions on civil law subjects: sale of goods, testamentary dispositions, child abduction, maintenance obligations and road-traffic accidents."
"They have striven to provide a coherent legal framework in an increasingly mobile world."
"When I was a practising lawyer, I often had recourse to Hague conventions to assist clients caught up in troubles with a cross-border dimension."
"Those clients had reasons to be thankful for the existence of this rather unknown organisation."
"Over the last years as a parliamentarian, I have had the privilege, on behalf of this House, to attend many of The Hague meetings, to get to know the people behind this apparently rather technical and distant exercise, to see the officials and national experts at their work, drafting and negotiating very complex and technical agreements to assist our citizens."
"It is difficult work, taking account of an ever-increasing number of legal traditions and cultural values."
"Whilst it may seem to be technical work, there are very big political choices underlying many of these apparently dry legal issues."
"This work should increasingly see the light of day and I hope that our involvement will assist that process."
"Up until now, the Community has been represented by all its individual Member States and, from my limited observations, that also brings a richness and strength to the work of the conference because of the diversity of our own legal traditions and our own comparative legal experience."
"However, it is also clear that, given the new Community competence post-Amsterdam, there is every reason why the Community should operate as a Community within the conference."
"In every practical sense it already does this through joint coordination meetings and, in any event, the conference works by consensus."
"Therefore, I have absolutely no problem in recommending to colleagues that this House should give its assent to the accession of the Community to The Hague Conference."
"It is a good thing, a positive and timely development."
"However, there is a caveat; it is contained at the end of the explanatory statement to my report and set out in more detail in our chairman’s motion for a resolution."
"In passing this competence to the Community, Parliament is in some measure possibly detracting from its own hard-won legislative powers."
"I say ‘possibly detracting’, because tonight we look to the Commissioner for reassurance that Parliament will continue to be fully involved in the future work when new conventions are negotiated and new or old ones ratified by the Community."
"We have to find new working methods that fully respect Parliament’s position as co-legislator with the Council."
"Much as I have enjoyed over the last years attending Hague Conference meetings as a sort of ad hoc representative of this House, we now need something much more formal and transparent that reflects the new role of our institutions in this process."
"I hinted earlier that the conventions negotiated at The Hague deserve much more attention."
"They deserve that attention because they not only achieve positive outcomes for our citizens but also, increasingly, involve making political choices and balancing interests."
"This is work that cries out for more parliamentary involvement and I know that this is something The Hague Conference would also welcome."
"There have been initial discussions about some kind of parliamentary forum. This is something we should pursue."
"However, this should not be seen as in any way excusing the need for this House to be fully involved in the Community’s legislative process in relation to the work of the Conference."
"This would be by way of an additional activity that is within our powers to undertake."
"I hope colleagues will agree that we should be initiators in this regard, perhaps hosting a first meeting."
"."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank Mrs Wallis for her report and Mr Gargani for the question he submitted this evening."
"The two topics are obviously linked, and I can confirm that I also very much welcome the recommendation contained within Mrs Wallis’s report, that the European Parliament consent to the accession of the Community to the Hague Conference."
"I also agree with what is said in Mrs Wallis’s introduction on the importance of the Hague Conference and of the work done over the past few years."
"It is quite clear, however, that acceding to the Hague Conference will enable the Community to obtain a status that effectively corresponds to its new role as a leading player on the international stage, thus as an actor that needs to play a practical and formal part in the activities of the Hague Conference."
"Acceding may mean more coherence – I could say more consistency – between the rules existing within the Community, within the European Union, and the international instruments in preparation."
"This need for more coherence justifies and warrants the Community’s formal accession to the Hague Conference."
"As all Members are aware, once the European Parliament has given its consent, the Community can formally accede to the Hague Conference as soon as two-thirds of the States signatory to the Conference have endorsed the amendments to the statute."
"I feel in a position to say to you that this particularly large majority will be reached by the end of this year, thus fairly soon."
"Some Member States have still not voiced their opinion, but I am confident that consent will be given by December of this year."
"Both Mrs Wallis and Mr Gargani highlight the problem of what Parliament’s role will be once the Community has formally acceded to the Hague Conference."
"I can tell you that I am personally and institutionally committed to ensuring that there is full cooperation with Parliament, including after the Community’s accession to the Hague Conference."
"We all know that the framework agreement concerning relations between the Commission and the European Parliament has been amended recently: the agreement clearly permits the involvement, including at a formal level, of Parliament in the negotiation of international agreements in areas of Community competence, and this certainly comes under Community competence."
"I can assure Mrs Wallis and all Members both that Parliament will be kept fully and constantly informed about the negotiating activities and that it will be involved in the delegations, in the negotiating activities."
"As Mrs Wallis is well aware, I fully agree on this aspect; as far as the delegations are concerned, it is certainly possible to imagine MEPs being included in the formal delegation."
"Finally, I can confirm this possibility straight away and, when the Community has formally acceded to the Hague Conference, it will become a reality."
"Mr President, Commissioner, fellow Members, the accession of the Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law is certainly a good thing."
"The Community will thus be able to take an active part in defining the Conference’s priorities and ensure that these fit in well with the Commission’s work programme."
"There should, however, be no delay in providing for support measures so that the civil judicial area is not weakened but retains its familiar characteristics: enhanced political solidarity within the framework of a community of values, the principle of the mutual recognition of legal decisions and the construction of an integrated internal market."
"The support measures might include definition by the Council and Parliament of the mandate in matters relating to codecision, production of a legal and economic impact study at the beginning of negotiations and systematic reflection on the appropriateness of inserting disconnection clauses into the draft conventions."
"Like our rapporteur, whom I congratulate, I consider it necessary for Parliament to be consulted when it comes to the draft conventions and to defining the priorities of the Conference’s work programme."
"Moreover, the principle must not be that the Community adhere systematically to all the existing conventions."
"Such adherence to existing conventions needs to be subject to case-by-case examinations by the Council and the European Parliament."
"Mr President, after Commissioner Frattini’s speech, I have the impression that we have achieved the objective that we had set ourselves with this exercise, despite it being so late."
"In short, the Commissioner has told us that this possibility for Parliament to participate in the procedure for adopting agreements within the Hague Conference is laid down in the institutional framework agreement and that the European Parliament could therefore formally take part in these negotiations."
"In particular, he has indicated that it is possible for Members of the European Parliament to be included in the formal delegation."
"I believe that we must begin by acknowledging the generosity of the Commissioner’s words, since there is no legal obligation."
"Furthermore, I would like to express my agreement with what previous speakers have said, that judicial cooperation in civil matters is now a European Union competence, pursuant to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and that, furthermore, we have the Hague Programme for implementing that cooperation."
"This field is not therefore peripheral to the very essence of the European Union, but rather it is central to it. That means that the three institutions will have to work on this issue, and cooperation is therefore highly appropriate."
"In the motion for a resolution presented by Mr Gargani, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, there is another very interesting proposal, and that is that it is not just a matter of the European Parliament cooperating with the Commission in the negotiations at the Hague Conference, but also of setting up a kind of parliamentary forum – a job that this Parliament could do – which would bring us together with members of national parliaments."
"European Union law in the private field is still largely national law and therefore the creation of that parliamentary forum would enable us to harmonise positions."
"The great problem with private international law, as we all know, and with private law in general, is that it involves national laws that come from differing traditions."
"At a time when we are thinking about harmonising, codifying and unifying private law, however, the creation of that parliamentary forum, perhaps with this specific aim for now, would be a good way to begin to send out the message that the European institutions are not disconnected from national legal traditions."
"Those of us who have worked in this field have seen the enormous difficulties hindering any progress in the field of private law, given the differences between national traditions, but this proposal, which is aimed more at Parliament than at the Commission, would be very positive, because it would enable us to harmonise positions with the national parliaments and take those harmonised positions to the Conference, through our participation in it."
"Mr President, what we are debating today is truly a sign of the European Union’s maturity."
"Not so many years ago, when I met with other people teaching private international law in different universities, mixing up private international law or private law with European Union law was a heresy, because the European Union simply dealt, at most, with fishing, international trade and competition, but did not really deal with private law issues."
"Today, the European Union is very much involved in private law, because today, although we still have much to do, the European Union deals with the private consequences – private law – of European citizenship, its direct impact on people’s private domain and the consequences of freedom of establishment and movement on private law for persons and companies."
"All of that is what led this field to be introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam, allowing a situation to evolve that has given the European Union – the European Community, to be precise – these competences, which have made it possible to draw up a large amount of legislation or to turn instruments into European legislation that were not previously part of it, though they did to a certain extent fall within the Community sphere, such as the Brussels Convention and others."
"Within this context, therefore, the accession of the European Union – the Community, strictly speaking – to the Hague Conference is a very important step and, I would insist, demonstrates the maturity of the European Union; it demonstrates that we still have a long way to go, including, amongst other things, in how these rules should be drawn up: third pillar, first pillar, etc."
"This is not the time to discuss it, but it is something that will improve the quality of our legislation and will undoubtedly enable the European Union to bring its own priorities to the Hague Conference."
"Despite the fact it is midnight and there are very few people in the Chamber, this is therefore a true indication and measure of the European Union’s maturity in areas that affect the citizens very directly."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, regarding the motion for a Council decision on the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference on Private International Law, I should like to point out that this is an absolutely essential step, as the Community would acquire under the Amsterdam Treaty the authority to adopt measures for judicial cooperation in civil cases with a cross-border dimension, where such measures are conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"Many of the steps that the Community has adopted, or is preparing to adopt, by means of that authority coincide with the activities of the Hague Conference."
"Given that the adoption of the above-mentioned internal instruments has led to a transfer of external authority from the Member States to the Community in the areas regulated by these instruments, it is essential for the Community to become a full member of the Hague Conference."
"I believe that the continual strengthening legal certainty for our citizens is also undoubtedly an issue here."
"–Mr President, since the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty, the competences of the European Union have included measures concerning judicial cooperation in cross-border civil matters necessary for the proper operation of the internal market."
"It is a fact that, to date, a series of legal instruments has been adopted in this area, with others in the pipeline."
"Full membership of the Hague Conference on International Private Law will also give the EU negotiating powers in the Hague Convention in areas within its competence."
"This will make it easier to harmonise EU regulations with subsequent international instruments, whilst the Community will become subject to the rights and duties arising from such conventions."
"Furthermore, acquiring full membership constitutes an important step towards deeper European integration, by placing the EU in a new international role in the field of judicial collaboration in civil matters."
"I am pleased to note that amendments have been made to the Statutes of the Conference to allow the Community, which is to be accepted as a full member very soon, to join."
"I would like to stress that I myself was pleased to hear Commissioner Frattini’s words, because from the perspective of the European Parliament, which has played an active role in the Community legislative process, and in particular from the perspective of the Legal Commission, which is responsible for the issue of private law, we must pay special attention to the procedural frameworks that define the methods and the rules for future cooperation of Parliament in matters pertaining to the Hague Conference, and for consultation on convention projects."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"."
"Mr President, as you know, the European Court has stated that the Council and the Commission decision on the transfer of PNR data to the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection serves the purpose of protection of public security and concerns public activities in the area of criminal law."
"Therefore, these activities are excluded from the scope of the European Data Protection Directive and Article 95 of the European Treaty, even when the data being processed was originally for the supply of commercial services."
"The situation in general concerning legal bases underlines the need for a single system of legal bases for justice, liberty and security issues."
"This is what I call the ‘Communitarisation’ of the so-called Third Pillar; therefore, I called upon the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs to ensure a clear legal framework for justice, freedom and security by favouring the use of the so-called clause, Article 42."
"I know that the European Parliament shares the Commission’s point of view on this very important matter, which I will raise again during the informal Council in Tampere in a few days’ time."
"I believe that this new agreement under negotiation with the United States should have the same content and include the same level of safeguards regarding legal certainty for air carriers, respect for human rights, notably the right to privacy, and the purposes for which the PNR data may be used."
"In addition, it could integrate the current undertakings, as requested in the draft recommendation attached to the annulled Commission decision, and which the United States currently implements."
"As you know, these undertakings provide for rules and procedures, which effectively restrict the use of PNR data by the United States authorities."
"In order not to endanger public security, all efforts should be made to ensure that this agreement replaces the current one at the time when it expires, by 30 September at the latest."
"The Commission is doing its utmost to start negotiations with the United States as soon as possible."
"In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 24 of the EU Treaty, negotiations are led by the Council Presidency, assisted by the Commission."
"The negotiations should start tomorrow in Brussels."
"A draft text has been transmitted to the United States authorities by the Presidency, which, as I said, is leading the negotiations."
"I am aware of your request to the Presidency to make the text of the draft agreement available to you."
"I am personally in favour and I can assure you that for its part the Commission intends to fulfil its obligations under the Framework Agreement between our two institutions and therefore I will keep Parliament informed throughout the negotiations."
"It is indeed my intention to report to Parliament regularly on this issue and, as you probably know, I shall be participating in a meeting of the LIBE Committee next week, on 12 September."
"Finally, I want to recall that, should no new agreement be in place on 1 October, air carriers flying from Europe to the United States risk legal complaints from citizens based on divergent national legislation on the transfer of PNR data to the United States."
"For that reason, it is extremely important to ensure legal certainty through an agreement concluded at European level as of 1 October, whilst continuing to ensure a high level of security and at the same time privacy protection for our citizens."
"."
"Mr President, today we are discussing the PNR Agreement with the United States."
"However, we are all fully aware of the fact that this issue can only be debated in a wider context, particularly in the light of the information received last night to the effect that President Bush has finally admitted that secret CIA detention camps actually exist."
"We should look at this issue in the wider context of the methods used to combat terrorism – the methods that we in Europe want to use in the fight against terrorism and the methods that are used by our friend and ally, the United States."
"The case of the CIA detention camps and rendition flights and the case of the PNR Agreement demonstrate very clearly the urgent need for Europe to speak with a single voice."
"We urgently need a single European policy in this area."
"I welcome what Commissioner Frattini has said, because in my view a common EU policy is not one designed by a handful of ministers that meet behind closed doors, in informal meetings."
"An EU policy is one made following a proper democratic procedure that involves Parliamentary scrutiny, i.e. in codecision with Parliament."
"You therefore have my wholehearted support for the proposal on the bridging clause."
"I hope that the governments too will now realise how urgent that is."
"With regard to the PNR issue itself, we should distinguish three phases."
"One is the short-term renegotiation of the current agreement, which is very urgent and needs to be concluded by the end of the month."
"I have heard rumours which seem to indicate that the US is in no great hurry to conclude the Agreement and might actually ultimately prefer bilateral agreements."
"It is therefore very important that all European countries and the EU institutions close ranks and adopt a united stance."
"I very much welcome the much more forthcoming attitude adopted by the Council and Commission this week."
"That is the best way forward."
"Were there to be no agreement it would be absolutely catastrophic for the European Union and for the protection of our citizens’ personal data."
"With regard to this agreement, we all seem to agree that the substance of the agreement should preferably be left untouched."
"We would have preferred to improve the agreement, but the US would like to move in another direction."
"I therefore feel that the best we can achieve at the moment is to have the same agreement but on a new legal basis."
"During the negotiations, however, you should insist that the undertakings made in the current agreement be implemented without delay, because assessments have shown that even if there is an agreement it is not being fully and correctly implemented."
"I would notably point to: the switch from the ‘pull’ to the ‘push’ system, which is long overdue; information to passengers, which is key but which is apparently still not happening; and purpose limitation – which is a more difficult issue, but an absolutely crucial one."
"I hope you can see to it that the undertakings are integrated into the agreement rather than being a sort of appendix that is not legally binding."
"With regard to the medium and long term – i.e. the post-2007 review – we very much hope that by then the clause will have been adopted, that Parliament will have secured codecision and that everything will be dealt with as part of a proper democratic procedure."
"At that point, Parliament will insist on proportionality, which is to say that there should be data-sharing, because we all want a safer world and to fight the scourge of terrorism, but that this should be proportional."
"We should not share more data than is strictly needed to achieve our purpose."
"It goes without saying that there should be adequate protection of personal data and procedural safeguards."
"That is quite clear."
"One of the proposals in the report, which fortunately received the support of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, is that we start a parliamentary transatlantic dialogue."
"I feel that this rift with the US needs to be healed."
"We must fight terrorism together."
"It cannot be that while we call the Americans ‘cowboys’ they call us ‘cowards’, and we are deeply divided."
"At the same time, there are proposals circulating on a European PNR policy."
"I am rather unhappy that we only learned about this through the media."
"We have heard that this idea was presented at an informal meeting in London a couple of weeks ago."
"That is not the way forward."
"If there is to be such a policy then we would prefer that it were presented here in Parliament."
"Finally, I should like to make a very urgent appeal to the Council to adopt proper arrangements for data protection under the Third Pillar, along the lines set out by our rapporteur, Mrs Roure."
". – Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, we are four-square behind the objective of preventing and combating terrorism, given that this threat has already been visited on some of our Member States and hangs over all of us at all times."
"We want to cooperate with other countries in the fight against terrorism, not least the United States of America."
"One of our citizens’ greatest concerns at the moment is their security and the more united the Union is in this regard the more effective the response will be."
"It is therefore preferable to have one agreement between the Union and the United States of America than 25 bilateral agreements."
"This will put the Union in a stronger position as regards not only the prevention of, and fight against, terrorism, but also the protection of fundamental rights."
"We must ensure that there is no legal vacuum at European level after 1 October 2006 as regards the transfer of passenger data."
"Mr Frattini took the right option, in light of the decision taken by the Court of Justice, to condemn the existing agreement, and at the same time to open negotiations on a new agreement with the United States."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has lent its firm backing to the Commission’s request to the Council to grant it a mandate to reopen negotiations."
"We know that this is a short-term agreement to fill in the gap between the obsolete agreement and a new long-term agreement, which is something that can and must be considered at the earliest opportunity."
"As regards the future negotiations. I should like to underline the example of the agreements with Australia and Canada, which we find acceptable in terms of proportionality, which sets appropriate limits as regards scope, time, and amount of data, and which is subject to monitoring by a judicial authority."
"I therefore support the idea of starting dialogue before the year is out between the EU and the USA, Canada and Australia with a view to jointly preparing the 2007 review and to setting up a global standard for forwarding passenger name records."
"I should also like to welcome the desire expressed by Mr Frattini to maintain close cooperation with Parliament."
"I hope that this desire is translated into practical action and is not restricted to rhetoric, and that the Council follows suit."
". – Mr President, on behalf of my group, I should, of course, like to begin by giving my full support to the report by my fellow Member, Mrs in't Veld."
"We want a two-stage strategy: the conclusion of an interim agreement by 30 September, in order to guarantee continuity and not to cause any inconvenience to Europeans who travel to the United States, and the negotiation of a new, better-founded agreement, during the review, which is initially planned for 2007."
"Two stages are therefore required."
"However, the agreement to be concluded before the end of the month must not be hastily negotiated."
"Mr Frattini is proposing that we keep the same text and just change the legal basis, as denounced by the Court."
"We can accept that, but only on two conditions."
"Firstly, the European Parliament must be fully informed of the debates under way with the Americans and must provide a political input."
"What is more, the national parliaments must also be kept informed."
"Secondly, we must be certain that all of the undertakings will actually be complied with and implemented by the US authorities."
"I am specifically referring to the possibility of shifting from the PULL system to the PUSH system, as provided for in Undertaking 13, and of establishing judicial review procedures in the event of misuse, as provided for in the agreements concluded with Australia and Canada."
"In the longer term, the new 2007 agreement must offer European nationals the same level of protection of their private lives as that guaranteed in Europe, and that is indeed a minimum requirement."
"Finally, during the informal meeting in London, Mr Frattini made several practical proposals concerning a European PNR and a biometric positive profiling system, to be used on a voluntary basis."
"I should like to know what exactly is the status of this meeting, in which important proposals were discussed without Parliament’s having been informed of them."
"As regards a possible European PNR, it is quite clear that we will be unable to accept any proposals that allow Community legislation and national laws on the protection of Europeans’ personal data to be circumvented."
"Nor will we be able to accept a procedure that bypasses the role and the democratic function of the national parliaments in this sector."
"Furthermore, I would point out that the Commission proposals on these issues cannot be accepted without the framework decision on the protection of data under the third pillar being adopted."
"My fellow Member, Mrs in't Veld, pointed this out, and this is an aspect that we will not lose sight of."
"."
"Mr President, it is not clear that there is any current use for PNR data in the US for the purposes for which the original agreement was signed – i.e. by the Customs and Border Protection Service – because CAPS II and the Secure Flight programme are dead."
"In his article ten days ago, the US Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff complained of being handcuffed and prevented from using all available resources."
"He wants to analyse PNR records in conjunction with current intelligence, to identify high-risk travellers who are ‘unnamed threats’, and to share the information routinely with other homeland security sections, such as immigration, as well as the FBI and, indeed, ‘our allies in London’."
"So we do not need a European PNR system: we will get it by the back door."
"The Chertoff vision is of data-mining and profiling on the basis of past and assumed future behaviour and stereotypes of potential terrorists."
"This takes us well beyond the simple checking of people against watch lists, for which APIS data – i.e. name, date of birth, nationality and passport number – is quite sufficient."
"We have not begun to tackle the risks of this, so we need a very good explanation of what PNR data is being used for in the United States and what profiling techniques are being used."
"We need strict and legally-binding purpose- and access-limitation provisions."
"Similar concerns arise in the context of the EU plans for European PNR and so-called ‘positive profiling’."
"Under the 2004 EU APIS Directive, governments gave themselves the power to use the personal data for law-enforcement purposes ‘in accordance with their national law and subject to the data protection provisions under Directive 95/46/EC’."
"Surely the Court judgment on the US PNR agreement has shown that Directive 95/46/EC cannot be the legal basis for data used for security purposes?"
"Therefore we need the third-pillar measure."
"Has the Commission thought about this?"
"I agree with Commissioner Frattini and Mrs in ‘t Veld on the need for a coherent EU policy."
"If you look at this PNR topic, the SWIFT scandal or CIA rendition, you see a pattern of a disunited Europe: Member States running round like headless chickens, subject to divide and rule by the United States."
"We are not even a reliable partner: we are not even ratifying the agreements like Europol protocols, which would allow cooperation with the FBI."
"We are ineffective, dysfunctional and we are letting our citizens down."
"We must stop this incoherence and achieve a clear and assertive EU competence, but that policy must be determined to safeguard our privacy."
"Can we trust the Commission on that?"
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the vast majority of us in this House are not opposed to the strengthening of security where that is necessary, nor are they hostile to the United States or to reasonable cooperation with them in those areas in which we and they have cooperated in the past and will need to do so in the future too."
"The attacks on major European cities teach us – as they have done before – that the European Union and the United States need to collaborate, not least in security matters, but – and I am sure that this is the fundamental criticism that most in this House would make – what is required of the agreement on the forwarding of passengers’ personal details as part of the war on terror is that it should be rational and coherent."
"What has been put before this House can certainly not be described in those terms."
"Members from various groups have already spoken to address the fundamental problems that there are with it, the first of which is the use to which the data is to be put, and second the legal basis by reference to which the data is to be forwarded."
"My group is not alone in having fundamental doubts about both of these."
"The data should be used solely for the purpose of combating terrorism, and not with any other ends in view, and, in the final analysis, it is highly problematic in legal terms that citizens of the European Union should not be on an equal footing with citizens of the United States; it is not acceptable that our citizens should enjoy fewer rights than do their American counterparts."
"What is needed is an even-handed and consistent agreement that guarantees the protection of data and deliberately restricts its use to the combating of terror and terrorism."
"Political ends must not be treated as superior to fundamental rights."
"That which underpins the rights enjoyed by all the citizens of this European Union of ours is something inalienable, and it is with grave concern that we see them being slowly eroded."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, talks are beginning tomorrow and the paradoxical thing is that we are not even aware of the basis for them."
"The European Parliament is excluded from these talks about a problem that involves all of Europe’s citizens."
"This is the first paradox in the affair."
"My group strongly endorses what Mrs in’t Veld is proposing, particularly the need to change to a ‘push’ system for an agreement in the short term, and the need to avoid the direct transfer of data to the judicial authorities for an agreement in the medium term."
"I understand the need to use the agreement rejected by the Court as a basis, partly because the United States is demanding even more from Europe."
"We need, however, to consider the absurdity of certain proposals contained in the agreement rejected by the Court."
"I am thinking of the 34 data items that have to be transferred to the United States, when we know perfectly well that most of these items are useless: the US authorities themselves say that they have only been using seven or eight of them."
"Then we ought also to consider the need to establish real, legally binding protection for passenger data, because it is a duty of the institutions to safeguard European citizens’ personal data."
"Systematically keeping a check on people in the name of the fight against terrorism is an authoritarian distortion of the rule of law and, paradoxically, by doing so we are helping to achieve precisely what the terrorists want."
"Systematically keeping a check on people is an outcome of the same authoritarian attitude as the CIA’s secret prisons, which President Bush at last decided to announce to the world yesterday rather than continue to hide the evidence."
"Let us hope that the countries of Europe will also stop trying to outdo the US."
"We must avoid taking the same stance on this subject and being more extremist than the US in keeping a check on people in the name of this phoney war on terrorism."
"."
"Mr President, this report states that the EU-US agreement in this sphere is going to become ‘the standard, both for European legislation and globally’."
"Well, what a reference standard to have!"
"It is already an embarrassment."
"The European Court of Justice has annulled the original agreement, and yet the replacement agreement only differs in its legal basis."
"This Parliament challenged the original agreement between the US and the EU because it believed that the legal basis was wrong and disagreed with the substance."
"However, despite this Parliament appearing to win the case in the European Court of Justice, nothing substantial has changed."
"The legal basis will be altered, but since the European Court of Justice did not comment on the substance, in real terms nothing has changed except, of course, the fact that the European Court of Justice will not have competence over the new agreement."
"It is clear that the Council is going to continue with this agreement in its original form, just changing the legal basis but still ignoring Parliament in the process."
"So why is this Parliament again indulging in pointless activity by writing, debating and voting on this report?"
"It will be ignored by the Council."
"In-fighting within the European institutions brought about the premature termination of the original agreement."
"This whole process illustrates the chaotic nature of the European Union."
"This indicates clearly once again why the United Kingdom would be so much better served by organising such international agreements and arrangements on a bilateral basis."
"Mr President, it is of course touching, and also right and proper that there should be – as this debate makes evident – concerns about Europeans’ civil liberties, and so I want to avail myself of this forum in order to say that I do not see much defence of fundamental civil liberties when, for example, in my home country of Belgium, the state’s security services blatantly bug the telephones of democratically elected members of parliament belonging to my party, which is what they did recently with the telephone of Filip De Winter, who heads our group in the Flemish parliament."
"It is lamentable that, when the civil liberties and the privacy of elected parliamentarians, no less, in Brussels, in the heart of the European Union, are violated, I hear nothing said by those Members of this House who are jumping at the chance to rap the knuckles of the ‘Great Satan’ in Washington, so let us not act like wronged maidens."
"Yes, of course, the rights of Europeans and of travellers must be safeguarded as far as is possible, but those who, in the aftermath of this summer’s foiled terrorist outrages, still doubt the usefulness of much tighter monitoring in international air travel are, in fact, being almost criminally naive."
"Regrettably, that is the price that has to be paid for greater security and for greater freedom."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have this ruling from the ECJ, our first priority is to avoid the vacuum that results from the absence of a treaty, for the consequences of this would be negative not only for the airlines but also for their passengers, in that it might even result in planes being banned from landing, and will, in any case, mean longer waiting times for passengers flying to the USA, since they will now have to supply the information at the airport."
"It is for that reason that we support – and I personally do – Commissioner Frattini's intervention in these negotiations, which should involve an amended legal basis in accordance with the ECJ’s ruling, but with the substance of the former agreement, covering precisely those things we proposed then and those that have been added."
"For the benefit of all those who have not read the agreement, let me say that it includes the reduction of the data units to 34, the restriction on the use to which they are put, the requirement that passengers be informed, the requirement that the data be forwarded to only one department, namely the Department of Homeland Security, the right of review, and also the right to lodge complaints and appeals, not to mention the requirement that the European Union be notified where terrorist involvement is suspected – in short, it brings us greater security, and that, above all, is something we should make use of."
"That, I think, is why it is now necessary that Commissioner Frattini be supported, be encouraged to embark on these negotiations, in which he should of course seek a resolution of those matters where our demands have not yet been completely met – that much is clear, but what is fundamental is that we must not end up without any treaty: fundamental, that is, in the interests of our citizens’ security, of those who travel by air, and of the airlines."
"– Mr President, the issue of the transfer of the personal data of European citizens via the PNR is an issue which, as is only natural, has greatly preoccupied Parliament."
"Taking account of the seriousness with which the questions of anti-terrorism and fundamental rights must be addressed, can anyone tell us exactly what this informal meeting was of certain ministers of the Member States in London in the middle of the summer, which was even attended by the European Commission, a meeting during which, it would appear, serious new anti-terrorism measures were proposed?"
"With what jurisdiction was it held?"
"Who convened this meeting?"
"Who authorised the eager participants to then issue a press release, 'allegedly' with the new European measures needed?"
"Secondly, as regards the PNR agreement itself, please tell us what it contains, Mr Vice-President, as you expressly promised. Are there any material changes and, more importantly, will the USA's voluntary commitments become binding?"
"You said here, ‘they could become binding’, you did not say, ‘they will become binding’."
"The United States have given the acute impression over the last few days that they preclude negotiation, that they are threatening not to sign a bilateral agreement and, instead, to conclude even worse bilateral agreements on the PNR with the Member States."
"In other words, they are blackmailing us."
"Why do you tolerate this blackmail from a country which admitted a short while ago that it had secret prisons all over the world, in infringement of every concept of international law?"
"Finally, could you please tell us, Mr Vice-President, the story of the European PNR which, it would appear, you discussed in London?"
"What does it mean?"
"Why is it necessary?"
"Why is it proportionate?"
"Will it be an effective measure when the United States, even today, refuses to tell us if use of the PNR with America was necessary or effective?"
"How would it have prevented the British or Danish citizens now being accused of being presumptive bombers?"
"How would it have prevented September 11 or the attacks in London or Madrid?"
"The European Parliament therefore needs information immediately."
"No one here denies that an anti-terrorist policy and cooperation are needed."
"But the law is clear: in a democracy, measures must be necessary, effective and proportionate."
"The national parliaments and the European Parliament must have their say."
"Mr President, I believe that the Council – which is not present, even though the Vice-President is here to represent the Commission – will eventually be aware that this House, all of whose groups have joined together to speak with one voice, certainly does – albeit to varying degrees – see the need for negotiations between us and the United States, as equals, on arrangements relating to data protection, and indeed demands that such negotiations should take place."
"That should give the other institutions something to think about."
"The ruling by the European Court of Justice has not got us much further."
"While it does tell us that we chose the wrong legal basis, it does not tell us how we could have made a better job of it, although that, indeed, is not what the Court is there to do; it is for us to take care how we go about doing things."
"I would like to say something about the things we need to do in order to put this into practice."
"I think we are going to end up in a whole load of difficulties if we carry on as we are doing."
"For a start, and quite apart from the fact that we would rather do this at the European level, rather than having the nation states doing it each off their own bat, I would like to express my doubt as to whether we really do have the legal power to do it."
"I have to say, quite honestly, that I am not sure about this."
"Even if we do, the question arises of whether we can do it within the time allowed for implementation."
"If we in fact do opt for either the third pillar or a combination of second and third pillar as a means of moving this process on, we will meet with problems of implementation, in most Member States at any rate. We will have problems with their constitutions;"
"I can say that in the case of Germany, and I am sure that most of the Member States will find further obstacles in terms of their constitutional law when it comes to implementing this agreement, and so it is in the individual Member States that the necessary conditions must be put in place first of all."
"There will also be problems relating to the laws on the protection of data, since the European Union – with the exception of the first pillar – has no really effective means of data protection, which means that it is the Member States who will have to prepare the ground where data protection and the legislative process are concerned."
"What I fear, then, is that the entry into force will be delayed for a bit by quite a few cases brought either before the European Court of Human Rights or the ECJ itself – provided that that is a legal possibility, which will depend on the legal position – or before the national constitutional courts, and so we should, leaving considerations of substance to one side for the moment, apply the greatest of care when dealing with the formal aspects in order to save ourselves further embarrassment of the kind that we cannot afford on the international stage, and certainly not in relation to this issue."
"By way of conclusion, one has to consider the economic damage that would ensue if the United States were to threaten to prevent our airlines from landing there if we did not sign this agreement, and I would also like to ask why nobody within the European Union has ventured to remind our trans-Atlantic partners of this."
"Mr President, Mr Vice-President, it needs to be said loud and clear that this House was right to appeal against the agreement on the personal data of flight passengers; the European Court of Justice has already ruled that the legal basis on which it reposed was false, and it is only regrettable that it has not therefore had anything to say about its substance."
"I might add that I think that the directive on data retention might well end up suffering the same fate."
"What is meant – or required – to happen now, following the judges’ ruling, is the conclusion, in a very short space of time, of a new agreement absolving all twenty-five Member States of the need to conclude bilateral agreements with the USA on an individual basis, which would certainly not be in the interests of a high – and above all else uniform – level of protection for the European public."
"It will not, of course, be possible, in so short a time, to hammer out a whole new agreement, but there are things that have to be done if we are to have, as intended, a short-term agreement for one year."
"I believe, then, that the EU must make it its priority to insist on the USA at last doing what it has repeatedly undertaken to do and allow its engagements to be incorporated into the body of the treaty."
"After all, the practice adopted over the past two years has shown that the Americans do not take these engagements particularly seriously and, indeed, simply disregard them."
"That is particularly the case when it comes to the principle that data be used only for a specific purpose, and it is very much in the interests of European citizens that their personal data should not be allowed to be passed on indiscriminately as the American customs and immigration authorities think fit."
"– Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, it is unfortunate that the European Court of Justice did not return a ruling on the merits of the question put to it by the European Parliament, thereby putting us in this complicated situation."
"We are now being called upon to find a solution under pressure of time, because if no solution is found by 30 September, then more than 100 000 European passengers a week are in danger of being unable to travel to the United States."
"I understand that recent events in London have heightened interest, in Member States, about data transfers."
"However, I should like to emphasise that our common objective, to safeguard public security, is self-evident."
"However, the method which we apply in order to achieve it will also define the product of our societies and will illustrate the level and maturity of our civilisation."
"An effort must be made to ensure that the information which may be requested is limited to what is absolutely necessary, with sensitive personal data clearly excluded."
"However, in all cases, on such a serious issue, there must be close cooperation between the institutions, with the active – I repeat – participation of the European Parliament, especially the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, at all levels of negotiation."
"We accept Mr Frattini's position that he will keep us informed, although that is not enough."
"The European Parliament cannot be called on every time to back decisions which have already been taken."
"The European Parliament has an obligation to take an active part in all these sensitive issues."
"With these comments, I think that we shall vote for the opinion expressed in my honourable friend's report."
"Mr President, I fully endorse the approach of our rapporteur, Mrs in ‘t Veld."
"It is only normal that we, as Members of the European Parliament, seek the protection of our citizens’ rights as we fight against terrorism."
"These two things do not exclude each other; on the contrary, they are complementary."
"But I also endorse our other criticisms."
"Of course, we need full parliamentary involvement and a free, open and transparent debate."
"If we cannot even honour the principles of democracy when we decide on the fundamental rights of our citizens, then when can we?"
"But let us face it, even though all these things are, as we say in Holland, ‘completely open doors that do not need to be kicked in’, the PNR case is becoming a bit of a farce."
"It somehow seems incredibly difficult to solve the problems and make sure that the rights of our citizens are adequately protected."
"Why is this?"
"Is it Mr Frattini’s fault?"
"Is it due to the Council?"
"After PNR, Swift, the CIA scandal and various other recent problems, I believe that it is highly unlikely that the current United States Government can be persuaded to be sensitive to our very simple and logical demands."
"Maybe we, as a parliament, should change our tactics."
"Maybe we should take up the issue directly with the United States Congress – I have much more faith in our democratic counterparts on the other side of the pond."
"I hope for a joint session of the European Parliament and the United States Congress, as I am sure that American parliamentarians are more subject to reason than the Bush Government."
"– Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I am rather pessimistic about the outcome of this agreement."
"I support what has been said, particularly by the rapporteur, Mrs in ’t Veld, but the problem is that we – the European Union and the European Commission – have given up our negotiating power: that is why we should feel pessimistic."
"We gave up our negotiating power four years ago, when for a year and a half passenger data were being transferred to the United States completely illegally."
"An agreement was reached, which later proved to be unlawful and in fact served merely to acknowledge the illegality and remedy just a tiny part of it."
"We should actually have enormous negotiating power, but it is a question of deciding whether, as Europe, we want our law to be observed on our own territory, which is a principle of the rule of law."
"On the strength of that, we can then negotiate with the United States."
"If, instead, we give in, the United States will clearly be in a position to say, ‘Well, if no agreement is reached within a month, we shall do as we like.’"
"The small detail is that, if we are determined, they cannot do as they like."
"The reasoning of people who say, ‘What is at risk here is that US airlines will be prevented from flying’ is completely false from a legal point of view: our privacy laws do not protect according to an airline’s nationality, but according to the country where the personal data are gathered."
"Data gathered for commercial purposes cannot be systematically used for security purposes either in the United States or even in Europe, not even if we wanted our data to be used in that way."
"Therefore, if we begin to enforce our law, we shall succeed in having the negotiating power to conclude an agreement with the United States."
"An agreement of this kind means that only data relevant to security should be transmitted, and not absolutely irrelevant data as happens today."
"– Mr President, the debate on the protection of personal data reminds us every time of the theatre of the absurd."
"Why?"
"The decision was cancelled by the European Court of Justice and the report and the Commission are basically proposing the same agreement, exactly the same as the cancelled agreement."
"Secondly, the provision of details of the SWIFT transactions of millions of citizens is denounced while, at the same time, in plenary at the European Parliament, a report is being voted on which legalises this provision."
"Thirdly, the existence of secret prisons is denounced by those who were members of the governments and signed agreements with the United States of America and who then come here to the European Parliament and protest."
"Fourthly, the protection of personal data and democratic rights is discussed while, at the same time, Parliament is approving the setting up of a mammoth electronic database with biometric data known as the Schengen II system, and so forth."
"To conclude, the more you talk about protecting individual rights and individual freedoms, the more the European Union massacres them."
"It is a mockery of the people."
"The so-called 'anti-terrorism campaign' has one objective: to terrorise the people and subjugate them, but we believe that it will not ultimately succeed in doing so."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the fight against terrorism has been stepped up."
"After what has happened, this has of course been necessary, but we must engage successfully in that fight without undermining fundamental democratic ideas and values."
"It is important to have rigorous security procedures, but to overstep the line and forgo the balance between combating terrorism and respecting fundamental rights would benefit none of us in the long run."
"Following the decision by the European Court of Justice in May to cancel the Passenger Name Record agreement, we are now to have a new agreement with the same content. Unfortunately, there will be no input from Parliament, meaning that citizens will be unable to influence issues concerning the way in which they are kept track of and their behaviour systematically monitored."
"The freedoms of the individual should be protected better in the new agreement."
"Under the PUSH system, American authorities should, I would emphasise, make requests on a case-by-case basis."
"The legal protection afforded Europeans is inferior to that enjoyed by Americans."
"I would therefore call on Mr Frattini to make political innovation his goal in the necessary cross-border dialogue."
"Otherwise, we are unlikely ever to make any progress on this matter."
"The EU and the United States are able to reduce the gap between their respective positions."
"This has already been shown by the discussion between the parliamentary groups – or interparliamentary dialogue - and by the discussion between our delegation for relations with the United States and the Americans’ corresponding delegation."
"This dialogue should progressively contribute to an increase in quality, including where content is concerned."
"It is important for Parliament to participate in this process."
"In conclusion, I wish to congratulate Mrs in't Veld on her clear and unambiguous message."
"She has said what had to be said."
"I really do support her call to the Member States to stick together and not to conclude bilateral agreements."
"Europe must speak with one voice."
"Mr President, it has been an interesting debate and I should just like perhaps to add a note of realism."
"We must remember that we are not talking about travel within the EU: we are talking about travel to the United States."
"We are talking about travel through US air space."
"I believe an agreement is essential if we want to protect the fundamental rights of the EU."
"But if we are to have this agreement we have to be willing to negotiate, we have to move."
"We have to recognise that in the absence of any agreement, the Americans will do quite legally what they have done in other instances: they will say to every passenger travelling to the United States of America, ‘we wish you to sign a data waiver, i.e. that your data can be transferred to the United States’."
"Let me tell colleagues now that if that happens, any notion of EU-wide data protection is absolutely and fundamentally lost."
"Furthermore, let me say that America is not the problem."
"An attack upon the United States, an attack in Germany, an attack in Denmark, an attack in Madrid, an attack in the United Kingdom, or attempted attacks, are attacks upon every single one of us because we have common values."
"The United States wants to make the world a safer place."
"We need to work with the United States to make that a reality."
"America is not the problem: terrorism and extremism are the problem."
"My colleague Mr Coelho cited some brilliant examples of negotiations and agreements currently in place."
"We should look at those agreements, we should emulate them and we should give our citizens their fundamental rights and their fundamental freedoms."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, the issue of the onward transmission of flight passengers’ personal details is one of the most tricky that we in the European Union have to face up to, for how do we protect people from terrorist violence without jeopardising their fundamental rights or their private lives?"
"What that means in this specific case is that if the EU concludes an agreement on the forwarding of air travellers’ personal details, any such agreement must include adequate protection for those details as an essential component."
"The agreement we reached did not do this, and it appears to me that the new version does not do so either."
"That information has to be exchanged as part of the fight against crime and terrorism is not, of course, a matter of doubt, but there need to be binding legal provisions governing who may have access to the data, where they may do so, and in what manner."
"That is why this agreement with the USA needs to be completely renegotiated over the coming year."
"Something else that is plain to see is that if the forwarding of passengers’ personal details really is intended to result in better protection against terrorist attacks, this measure cannot be restricted to flights to the United States, Canada or Australia."
"An international agreement will be needed to improve air transport safety worldwide and, in so doing, regulate the protection of data; this is where the European Union can be a front runner."
"Only in this way can we secure freedom to travel as an outstanding characteristic of our society without imposing needless restrictions on it."
"I will conclude with another observation for the Council’s benefit."
"Following the Council’s, and the Commission’s, embarrassing performances before our Committee on Monday, I think it highly lamentable that the Council should not be present today, for it is under its presidency that these things are meant to be negotiated."
"For this, the Council is in disgrace."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to all those who have made important contributions to this debate, but first there is a matter to which I should like to draw everyone’s attention, with all the frankness that this Parliament deserves."
"In some speeches I heard a plainly mistaken interpretation of the Court of Justice ruling, which in fact made the agreement an issue."
"I heard some Members refer to that ruling as if it were a victory."
"That ruling rejected the agreement: someone said exactly that."
"Ladies and gentlemen, that ruling was a major setback for Community interests; it was a major setback for this Parliament and for the European Commission."
"That ruling established that the matter is not a Community matter; it is not a matter that can be negotiated by the Commission, so much so that the negotiations are being conducted by the Presidency; it is not a matter to which the privacy directive applies, Mr Cappato – it does not apply, whether we like it or not; yet we have to abide by the ruling even though it was a setback for us all."
"To be quite frank, we cannot be grateful for a ruling that rejected the agreement."
"That ruling, as Mr Alvaro said, was a backward step for Community interests."
"That is our starting point and we move on from there."
"Clearly, when we are talking about having to reach an agreement in a hurry, by 30 September, and then negotiating another agreement with the United States by 2007, we need to take the realistic, accurate, pragmatic view expounded just now by Mr Cashman."
"The real problem is that, if this agreement does not come about, millions of European citizens will accept lower guarantees of protection for their personal data in order to continue flying to the United States."
"They will be forced to do so in individual declarations, and Europe will have lost any power to protect them to a suitable degree."
"The real problem is this: each of us who has tried to do his or her duty cannot even think of challenging the United States."
"There is an interpretation handed down by the Court;"
"I personally do not like its interpretation, but it is my duty to abide by it and to enforce it."
"I must also say quite frankly that, if an agreement is reached, the protection of our citizens’ individual rights will at least not be left just to the discretion of a particular airline: bilateral negotiations between the United States and the individual airlines will reduce protection levels, and certainly not raise them."
"That is the realistic view that we must accept as a starting point."
"The second consideration – again, I agree with Mr Cashman and Mr Coelho – is that our problem is certainly due not to the United States but to the terrorists."
"The terrorist threat is real: what happened this summer in London did not constitute a half-secret or semi-informal meeting of ministers of internal affairs with the European Commission."
"We were informed about what could happen in the United Kingdom – I shall say this later in my information for Parliament – and we were concerned to realise that there was a clear and current threat."
"Obviously, having seen a major operation by the police and security services in Denmark only a few days ago, we are sure that the danger and threat are real and are hanging over the European Union’s territory."
"What do we need?"
"We need more cooperation among ourselves, among the European Union Member States; we need more cooperation among the Union’s institutions."
"That is why I said in my introduction that Parliament will be kept informed, politically informed, even though institutionally and legally it cannot take part in the decision because of the ‘legal basis’ (and I use inverted commas on purpose)."
"In any case, Parliament will be kept politically informed by the European Commission."
"We also need stronger cooperation with the United States."
"At this juncture we must cooperate more, not less, but on a clearly equal footing of course."
"The European Union proudly insists on this principle. I also agree with Mrs Roure in particular, who mentioned the national parliaments."
"You see, ladies and gentlemen, if we succeed in concluding the agreement – the talks are taking place in two parts and we start tomorrow; I cannot say whether an agreement will be reached, but I hope it will – we shall in any case need it to enter into force straight away, even while we wait for certain ratification procedures, which in some countries will take time, as Mr Alvaro pointed out."
"Since we shall invoke a rule in the treaties that provides for the agreement to enter into force straight away – otherwise it would be totally pointless – it is right that the national parliaments be kept informed from now on, in the same way as we shall be keeping the European Parliament informed, since many of them will be called upon to act once the immediate transitional implementation of the agreement has already begun."
"It is also a question of cooperation and, as you know, the European Commission agrees with that in principle."
"The third and last consideration is: what points need to be worked on in the next few days, say, if not in the coming weeks?"
"The first point is to persuade the Council – we shall make a start during next month’s Council – to approve the framework decision on personal data protection."
"This is a commitment that I have made and one that Parliament supported."
"I am making a further appeal to the Council for certain countries to tone down their reservations when the framework decision issue is discussed again at the next Council of Ministers in the coming weeks, so that a document can finally be put forward that really shows the European Union’s determination to guarantee the protection of people’s personal data."
"The second goal to achieve within a very short time is the implementation of what was termed the ‘push’ system by the rapporteur, to whom I am grateful."
"I can supply some detailed information about this."
"Some companies providing technical services for the major European airlines have already presented the technical solutions available for implementing the ‘push’ system."
"Some of them – I can mention just a few: British Airways, Air France, Iberia, Lufthansa, Alitalia and KLM, nearly all of them, in fact – have submitted concrete proposals to the relevant offices of the US Administration."
"Under the agreements that we had reached with the United States, the ‘push’ system could start operating without any need for changes within just a few weeks."
"Technically, there is already a proposal on the table and, in some cases, it has also been formalised."
"This is recent information that I have been given, showing how things are moving precisely in the direction that we all want."
"The other point is positive profiling."
"Mrs Roure has asked for general information about the London meeting: I shall be pleased to provide it to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs next week, when I shall go into much more detail."
"Positive profiling is an initiative that was not started today or yesterday, but rather a few months ago."
"It is an initiative aimed at identifying accelerated border control procedures at airports."
"There are two elements: firstly, as it is reserved just for international flights, it does not concern data exchange for European internal flights, where we would have insurmountable problems with freedom of movement, the Schengen area, etc."
"It is just for passengers who, on a voluntary, individual basis, agree to supply their data, particularly biometric data, and in exchange they benefit from using an automatic identification channel, which will evidently take less time at passport control."
"This is on an individual and voluntary basis, using biometric data."
"Why are we considering such a system?"
"To avoid what has been said about ‘negative profiling’, which is profiling on an ethnic or religious basis."
"Clearly, we could not accept any system of that kind, whereas we can imagine – since the Council has called for it – that each of us may agree to supply our biometric data to a database that guarantees privacy, in exchange for faster departure procedures."
"Think about frequent fliers."
"This is a system that we are examining, and we expect to table a proposal within a few months, perhaps by the end of the year."
"To conclude, I shall be pleased to inform the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs about what was said in London regarding procedures to enhance methods for detecting explosives, particularly liquid explosives, as well as on Internet use, positive profiling and everything else."
"– The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"– The next item is the report (A6-0260/2006) by Mr Sifunakis, on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education, on the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions (2006/2050(INI)."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is an important day for me personally and, at the same time, for my colleagues and for the Committee on Culture and Education because, following an entire project lasting about one year, I have the pleasure today of presenting to plenary my report on the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions."
"For centuries, with simple materials and means, people living in the countryside and islands of Europe, obeying the basic rules of the human scale and the mildness of the natural environment, have managed to create a man-made heritage of huge aesthetic value."
"This humble heritage, the protection and promotion of which is not only a cultural obligation but also a development need, has in many countries of Europe, at the responsibility of the governments, been altered considerably as a result of social and technological developments, unbridled economic exploitation and overdevelopment, which has, on the one hand, altered the place and destroyed – especially on the small scale of the islands – the wonderful balance between the natural and man-made environment and, on the other hand, destroyed highly-productive farmland."
"The purpose of my report is to formulate specific proposals for the protection, promotion and long-term management of this rich heritage in rural and island regions in Europe, for the benefit of the quality of life of all European citizens."
"My proposals contained in the report are directed at the European Union, the Member States, local and regional authorities and European citizens, who are called upon to take specific measures to maintain and promote it."
"Due to limited time, I shall comment on just a few of them:"
"First of all, the Union needs to acquire a comprehensive cultural heritage strategy."
"This will be achieved provided that the European Commission, when preparing its legislative proposals, examines in detail the repercussions of the proposals on culture, on the cultural heritage and, most importantly, on the popular architectural heritage which artisans have created by hand over the centuries."
"In this way, action beneficial to the heritage will be integrated into every Union policy."
"Given that Community programmes in the culture sector do not offer adequate funding, additional funds to maintain the heritage must be found, together with other Community resources: within the framework of the common agricultural policy, in the Structural Funds and in the LEADER, URBAN and INTERREG Community initiatives, which are to be incorporated in the next financial period into the new political cohesion and CAP financing instruments."
"Similarly, in using the Community funds, the Member States should encourage sustainable, alternative tourism, which can help to protect and promote the architectural heritage of communities, most of which have retained their physiognomy."
"The 'Culture' programme, with its limited budget, has also given considerable support to cultural heritage projects, but has, nonetheless, excluded restoration projects."
"However, there are other actions which could be financed under the new 'Culture 2007' programme."
"In particular, within the framework of multiannual cooperation projects under the programme, a network could be created of important architectural communities in various Member States with a population of up to 1 000 inhabitants."
"These communities will carry out activities of a cultural nature depending on the traditions of each area, in order to strengthen cooperation between important architectural and cultural communities in Europe and give them the facility to develop their local characteristics, habits, customs and traditions."
"Over and above that, however, the European Commission is also called upon to create a new European institution for important small traditional communities, along the lines of that instituting the cultural capitals, whereby one or two interesting communities would be selected each year, in which restoration and renovation interventions would be carried out and cultural events would be held throughout the year."
"Taking the development of architecturally important communities in Europe as our criterion, we also propose that a new category of award be created within the framework of the 'European Union Cultural Heritage Prize' for the best overall restoration of a traditional community."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the man-made environment of Europe, which consists of sub-sets of various architectural forms and eras, is changing considerably due to unbridled overdevelopment and the existence of incompatible structures which are out of tune with the particular historical and architectural characteristics of their locality."
"Consequently, the Member States must provide incentives for the whole or partial demolition of such buildings; at the same time, projects which demonstrably destroy and alter important elements of the cultural heritage must not be supported from Community funds."
"Finally, the report also proposes the introduction in the European Union of a 'European Cultural Heritage Year', the purpose of which will be to raise the awareness of European citizens about the importance of the cultural heritage, irrespective of its European, national or local dimension."
"To close, I should like in particular to thank the secretariat of the Committee on Culture, the experts who worked with me and, of course, my colleagues in the Committee on Culture."
"."
"Mr President, I wish to begin by expressing my gratitude and that of my colleague, Mr Figel', to the rapporteur and the Committee on Culture and Education for their constructive efforts in producing this excellent report."
"This report highlights concerns over the importance attached to cultural heritage."
"They are concerns which the Commission fully shares."
"Much remains to be done in this area."
"However, the Commission’s involvement has already been demonstrated both through the present Culture 2000 Programme and through other European programmes and financial instruments."
"Several points raised in the report have already been taken into account by the Commission."
"However, it is a very helpful report, which gives us the opportunity to stress once more the need to use all the existing possibilities to protect natural and architectural heritage."
"Within the framework of the Treaty, the Commission encourages Member States to use all the opportunities offered by European financial instruments – the structural funds, for example – for investment in cultural heritage projects."
"Such investments are clearly important means for the creation of new employment opportunities and for economic growth."
"They therefore contribute to regional development and regeneration."
"In this respect, the European Commission, and the services of my colleague Mr Figel' in particular, are monitoring all European programmes and ensuring that the financial instruments incorporate cultural aspects into their objectives."
"As a result, over the last few years, we have witnessed a marked improvement."
"I am very pleased at this development and could give you examples of Member States, such as Greece or Portugal, that have grasped the opportunities offered by Community support frameworks and have introduced operational programmes for cultural heritage."
"The Commission also encourages cooperation between Member States in the field of culture and cultural heritage through the Culture 2000 Programme."
"In the near future, these efforts will continue through the newly proposed Culture Programme 2007-2013."
"Thanks to the sound cooperation between the three institutions – and I should like to take this opportunity to thank, again on behalf of Mr Figel', the rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura – this new programme for 2007-2013 will hopefully be adopted before the end of the year."
"In this context, partnerships such as those proposed in the report could be considered for funding in the near future."
"As the report also recognises, the European Commission is very active in its efforts to increase awareness of the importance of cultural heritage through actions such as the European Prize for Cultural Heritage and the joint action undertaken with the Council of Europe on European Heritage Days."
"In the future, we could consider ways of enlarging the scope and having the European Parliament’s concerns better reflected in these actions."
"In conclusion, I would stress that this report is being discussed at precisely the right time."
"We are at a juncture when our new culture programme is about to be adopted, when the Commission is reflecting on its actions for the coming years and when many points are up for discussion."
"This report will certainly be of major interest in that context."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, if the importance of cultural heritage in Europe’s rural and island regions is to be recognised, we must go beyond the mere statements of principle on which politicians are so often keen, and urgently adopt a complete range of measures aimed at protecting, restoring and promoting it."
"In addition to the cultural interests at stake, it must be highlighted that there is a human, social and economic interest agenda involved in taking these ideas seriously."
"The Sifunakis report does the right thing by proposing a range of political priorities in order to reach those goals."
"For example, a systematic survey and study of this heritage and the recognition of its variety and versatility, the creation of a legislative framework to guarantee its protection, incorporating incentives for the conservation of traditional buildings, financial assistance, the continuation of traditional activities such as farming and arts and crafts, the conservation of traditional professions and local know-how, the restoration of natural habitats and architecture, the training of craftsmen, the adoption of new methods and techniques, the promotion of initiatives as part of the framework of Community programmes aimed at creating a European heritage inventory, and, lastly, the promotion of all the tangible and intangible elements that make up this heritage."
"The document before us is an extremely broad tapestry, and covers many more points than I have mentioned."
"Defending the heritage of rural and island areas in this way is also a means of reversing the trend towards the abandonment of many of the places concerned and of creating focal points for attracting jobs and generating wealth and sustainable development."
"The authorities in my country have emphasised that the policy of the heritage of the rural world should be based on three main axes: sustainable balance between the population and the surrounding area; integrated action, meaning genuine cooperation between the various levels of authority and the local populations; and constant dialogue with local people, interested parties who actually know their own needs."
"Some of the points mentioned have already been proposed by the Commission for the period 2007 to 2013 and it is hoped that a well-balanced policy on rural and island heritage can help to reverse current negative trends."
"The Krakow Charter of 2000 promotes principles that are entirely applicable in this area based on the plurality of values and the diversity of interests of heritage; for example, historic cities and settlements represent, within their context, a vital part of our universal heritage and should be viewed as a whole, with the structures, spaces and human factors normally present in the process of continuing evolution and change."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, that the maintenance and protection of Europe’s cultural heritage is of major importance and also constitutes a major task is not a matter for doubt, and it is not irrelevant that there are various agreements, such as for example those of UNESCO and the Council of Europe, that record these efforts and highlight the positive developments achieved."
"Even so, when discussing the protection of our cultural heritage, which focuses primarily on preserving the cultural achievements of the past, what should be borne in mind is that culture is a dynamic and diverse process, so, while cultural policy has to be concerned with the maintenance and conservation of our cultural heritage, it must also take responsibility for the creation of cultural networks for contemporary culture and artistic trends that serve as a basis for the cultural heritage of the future."
"It is very important that people’s awareness of the cultural treasures of their own country and of Europe be fostered, and a European Cultural Heritage Year will certainly be able to highlight a number of them and make them more aware of their importance."
"More use can and should be made of the resources that the European Union makes available – in the shape of the Structural Fund, URBAN, LEADER, INTERREG and so on – in the service of cultural heritage, but responsibility for this lies with the Member States, and it is they that need to be made aware of the fact that investments in cultural heritage have beneficial effects on the quality of life in the regions and, of course, on tourism."
"It is, then, with the interests of these in mind that we need to get to work."
"What I do not agree with is the way we are drawing very heavily on the budgets for Culture 2000, or its successor, Culture 2007, for the sum of EUR 400 million, spread over 27 countries and a period of seven years, does not provide sufficient scope for contemporary art alongside structural investment."
"What we should be using these resources for, though, is the raising of awareness through seminars and the award of research contracts, through clarifying the degree to which experience and information are being exchanged, and how matters stand in the other countries, as well as planning projects on the protection of the regions."
"That is what this programme can – and should – do."
"We are urged to think of our cultural heritage as an indivisible whole, and that we can do, but it must, in future, go hand in hand with that which is contemporary."
". – Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, will begin by saying that I see it as fundamental that European cultural policy means not only protecting our cultural heritage and emphasising our cultural diversity, but, of course, also promoting – and in a pro-active manner too – the cause of contemporary art, and that the strength of European cultural policy must inevitably lie in considering all these things as a whole."
"I do nevertheless regard this report as important, in that it attempts to raise awareness of the diversity of European culture and of Europe’s cultural heritage."
"Anyone who has had the opportunity to travel through Europe, whether to islands such as Madeira, the Canaries, Cyprus or Malta, or to visit rural areas in Tuscany, Scotland, Latvia, Finland, Poland or Provence, knows the beauty and diversity of this European cultural heritage and how readily people can be persuaded to take a stand in its defence."
"That is why the defence of this cultural treasure is a matter of political obligation – and I am talking here not only about the making of policy at European level, with its various programmes, but about the national level too."
"I also think it very important that we should, in working for the cultural diversity of Europe, consider more than just the 2007 culture programme and understand this as a real horizontal task and as a network policy including also agricultural policy and structural policy, that we should make use of the various programmes such as URBAN, LEADER, and INTERREG, since it has to be made clear that this is not only an important task in terms of cultural policy, it also has to do with preparing people to do jobs – as restaurateurs, for example – and with new developments in rural areas."
"It is, then, in the best sense, a truly multifaceted policy for the various European programmes."
"–Mr President, Mr Sifunakis’ report is highly significant, as it draws attention to the need to deal with the basis of national culture, that is with traditional culture that still lives on, particularly in rural and island communities."
"To date, the main thrust of the efforts made by the European Union, including this House and the European Commission has been towards establishing a universal European culture – a culture for all."
"As yet nobody has succeeded in implementing this doctrine and nobody will, because cultures arises from the collection of values developed by people coming together to form national groups."
"Culture binds a nation together, but also serves to distinguish it from other nations through its beauty, richness, cultural individuality and traditions that bind a people together and which are often known as its heritage."
"We in the European Union must therefore foster linguistic diversity, because language is the basis of culture, and also popular culture, which is the basis of national culture."
"In addition, we must protect the cultural monuments and spiritual values that are disappearing, including folklore, handicrafts and trades which are dying out as civilisation and technology advance and mass production takes over."
"Preserving the richness of individual cultures along with the beauty of the landscape and human beings’ natural environment, provides an opportunity for the intellectual development of people and a better awareness of the world around us."
"It is an opportunity for understanding, mutual respect and natural integration through values, rather than through the clout of the dominant economic and cultural power."
"."
"Mr President, I have not met many people who are not in favour of the protection of natural, architectural or cultural heritage."
"Indeed, much of my constituency, the East of England, fits the bill as a rural area."
"That is, of course, as long as some of the misguided, unsustainable development plans from Mr John Prescott, our Deputy Prime Minister, can be halted."
"Great Britain is an island with its own extensive natural and architectural heritage."
"However, although at face value this report has noble intentions, it serves to threaten Britain’s heritage."
"The proposals in the report have the specific aim of subsuming Britain’s distinct and diverse culture into the federalist fairytale creation of a common European culture."
"Sadly, many MEPs see culture purely as a tool for promoting European integration and pursuing a delusional project called ‘a United States of Europe’."
"Why can people here not understand that there is so such thing as a common European culture, no common history and no common heritage, just as there is no common architecture or common language?"
"Europe is a continent formed of unique nation-states with very different histories and heritage."
"That is what makes Europe so very interesting and attractive."
"The only way to achieve this report’s declared ambition of convincing Europe’s citizens that they share the same culture would be through lies."
"That is what frightens me."
"Today’s political elite seems to have no qualms about such deception."
"We have seen successive British governments seemingly deliberately and successfully keeping the British public in the dark about ‘project Europe’."
"What must be recognised is that the European Union’s integration agenda is one of the greatest threats to the heritage of every country in Europe that we have seen for decades."
"Sadly, reports such as these cannot see their own great contradiction."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Sifunakis’s report can certainly be endorsed for its intentions, although in my view what it states in its first paragraph about European identity needs changing to acknowledge the fact that the people of Europe clearly share the same cultural mosaic already."
"If anything, they do not understand some of the confusing mechanisms of European Union interventions, which are all too often intended just to regulate and to standardise."
"Our cultural, natural and architectural heritage could perhaps be more appropriately spoken of as architecture, landscape, and historical and landscape assets, terms that together better describe the integration that can be sought in the synergy between the natural landscape and the human landscape."
"Even so, it certainly plays a vital part in spreading social, economic and environmental welfare, especially in those areas of our Europe where not just the landscape but also the socioeconomic and demographic fabric is vulnerable."
"I should also have liked a more precise clarification of the concept of small traditional communities: the term ‘traditional’ is too vague and might lead to a lack of differentiation in the way that resources and commitments are used."
"Rural communities are not just part of our collective memory; they are the vital cradle of our values and the fount of social relations that are often considerably more balanced than those of urban communities, as well as being absolutely essential for safeguarding our culture and environment."
"This cultural heritage is not only threatened, as the rapporteur warns us, but in a great many places in Europe its functional survival is in danger."
"In addition to measures for preserving and safeguarding landscape and cultures, the Union – together with the Member States – should draw up suitable policies to prevent rural depopulation, especially in mountainous regions."
"Otherwise, we risk having to put money into restoring abandoned architectural assemblages, painting old houses that will remain uninhabited, and mending cobbled streets that will no longer be trodden."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, first I should like to thank my compatriot Nikos Sifunakis on his excellent work."
"Commissioner, cultural heritage is an important element in the identity and historical development of the peoples of Europe."
"Consequently, protecting and maintaining it is particularly important to the education of the new generation and respect for the European identity while, irrespective of its European dimension, its local dimension is a fundamental value for European citizens."
"We all know that the spotlights are turned towards the big cities where the most well-known monuments are to be found."
"Nonetheless, it is a fact that the European countryside, which accounts for 90% of European territory, is being damaged by desertion and economic stagnation."
"Special attention must therefore be given to protecting and promoting the natural and architectural cultural heritage of island and other rural regions of Europe, given that these areas retain a great many of their characteristics unchanged."
"With respect for the traditional rural space and striking a balance between the populace and the environment, all the factors which come to play in the culture sector must ensure that the cultural heritage of Europe is maintained and developed and strengthen awareness-raising among citizens as to its importance."
"The restoration and maintenance of forgotten monuments in the outer regions of the Member States could also contribute towards the development of rural tourism and, by extension, to boosting the population in the countryside."
"Finally, recognising and maintaining the common cultural heritage are an important bequest to future generations."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Sifunakis, on his work, which stresses the specific nature and importance of European natural, cultural and artistic heritage, which generates many benefits, social and cultural as well as environmental and economic."
"Rapid urban growth, social and technological progress, modern methods of farming and economic and urban development present rural and island communities, which, as has been pointed out here, make up the majority of the territory of the enlarged European Union, with important challenges."
"At a time, therefore, when, on the one hand, the abandonment of the countryside, depopulation and economic crisis, and, on the other, fires and the proliferation of natural disasters demonstrate the urgent need for agricultural professionals who can work on and look after our environment and ensure the sustainability and the future of our territory and our countryside, this report is very timely, because it stresses the need to implement an effective policy based essentially on a sustainable balance between the population and the environment and on an integrated approach to traditional agricultural areas, particularly rural communities."
"Drawing up a legislative framework for preserving cultural heritage, the granting of the funding required for its restoration, the training of nature conservation professionals and support for craftspeople and providers of traditional materials are all proposals along the right lines."
"In this regard, I would like to stress that promoting international meetings for describing and exchanging experiences and good practices in the field of countryside conservation and the protection of heritage in the European Union would be a very positive element of this policy at Community level."
"– Mr President, firstly I would like to welcome this excellent report and thank the rapporteur for his work."
"Preserving the natural environment is one of the main goals of the European Union."
"Our present and future task is to also establish the goal of preserving Europe’s architectural and cultural heritage, and that is especially important for small islands."
"It is really important to preserve natural assets, but in small ecosystems, the environment, human settlements and cultural heritage are fully interconnected."
"I come from Ibiza, an island that is suffering the effects of the construction of two disproportionately large highways."
"Because of these works, several important elements of cultural heritage have been destroyed."
"Archaeological sites and traditional homes have been destroyed to enable these highways to be built."
"This situation has been repeatedly condemned by civil society organisations and I myself have denounced it before the European Commission and in this very Chamber."
"If this Parliament and the European institutions as a whole take into account the proposals contained in Mr Sifunakis’ report, this kind of damage could be avoided and small islands, rural sites and cultural heritage could be properly preserved."
"That is our main goal now."
"– Mr President, I would like to express my support and gratitude for Mr Sifunakis’ report and endorse all the words of commendation uttered today regarding this document."
"Through the report, the European Parliament has expressed its concern for the architectural heritage of rural Europe."
"This is an important legacy, but unfortunately it is frequently unappreciated and forgotten."
"Today we are living in a rapidly-changing world."
"Rural areas that had changed little over the centuries, have undergone a drastic transformation in recent decades."
"Farming methods and implements have been transformed, the nature of farm work has changed radically, and rural architecture has also changed."
"Until the1960s, the buildings in rural areas of Poland were mainly wooden."
"Then came a period of rapid redevelopment."
"The new houses may have been more comfortable, but they were not always more attractive than the old ones."
"Traditional rural architecture disappeared quickly, and very little of it remains today, which means there is all the more reason for us to make every effort to ensure this heritage is effectively preserved."
"Mr Sifunakis’ report emphasises the importance of these matters and indicates specific ways of supporting activities to preserve valuable European rural architecture."
"It is a step in the right direction and comes just in time, while there is still something left to preserve for future generations."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is no secret that we are living in a time of headlong economic and social change, which leaves our minds increasingly in search of stability, security and guidance."
"One place in which we can find such security is in our intellectual, cultural and architectural heritage, and increased popular interest in this heritage, and increased awareness of it and respect for it, testify to that."
"It is that respect that should lead us to prevent any recurrence of the sort of destruction – deliberate destruction – of this intellectual, cultural and architectural heritage that was seen during the inferno of two world wars in the course of the twentieth century, and such as was aimed for and planned in Eastern Europe under ‘really existing Socialism’, Stalinism and Communism, and is, lamentably, practised at the present time by the brutal modernism supported by the political Left."
"I also believe that Europe’s historical and cultural heritage, in particular that of rural areas, must not be considered solely in economic terms, nor should it serve only the interests of tourism."
"I believe that it is advisable to extend such projects as the ‘European Capital of Culture’ to rural areas."
"I regard Sibiu, formerly known as Hermannstadt, in Transylvania, about which there was an exhibition of photographs in this House yesterday, as an example of the degree to which the European Union can promote and support our cultural heritage."
"The preservation of the architectural cultural heritage in rural and island regions also represents the preservation of European cultural diversity and the roots of individual nations."
"By destroying this heritage, a nation severs its ancestral ties and tears up its roots."
"Attempts to achieve ever greater inter–connectedness mean that areas of new growth in European cities are becoming increasingly alike."
"This is why it is extremely important for each nation to preserve those characteristics which give it its distinct identity."
"Certainly, the most genuine cultural and natural heritage is to be found in rural regions."
"It needs maintenance; otherwise it becomes dilapidated and falls into disrepair."
"This is our greatest challenge because the restoration of listed buildings and rural core areas is a very expensive and time–consuming business."
"At the same time, however, the living conditions in these buildings are less than suitable for modern circumstances, which is why many owners see cultural heritage as a burden rather than a source of joy and pride."
"Similarly, our old crafts are disappearing because they cannot provide a source of income."
"If we view cultural and natural heritage solely through the lens of money and profit, then all it brings us is financial loss."
"We need to continuously seek a balance between conservation and further development."
"I agree with the proposal for the Year of European Cultural Heritage as it will raise awareness amongst our citizens of the importance of cultural heritage."
"But I also support the proposal for us to earmark funding from the structural funds for the preservation of natural and cultural heritage in smaller villages, because by doing so we will rekindle the interest of owners and local communities in restoration."
"They will then also see the opportunities for development and new jobs."
"Pearls are small and hidden."
"Small communities, too, deserve an opportunity to receive incentives and funding."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur, Mr Sifunakis, on his wonderful report."
"Thanks to that report, we are able to hold an extremely interesting debate, because once again it emphasises something that I and many people here present consider to be absolutely crucial in the Union, particularly over recent years: at last, we are becoming aware of the impact on island regions of their island characteristics."
"I therefore welcome today’s report’s special reference to the protection and promotion of the natural, architectural and cultural heritage of Europe’s island regions."
"In this regard, the fact that the rapporteur comes from the Island of Crete, cradle of Minoan civilisation, Europe’s oldest civilisation, and that I come from the Balearic Islands, the location of the Naveta des Tudons, also considered to be Europe’s oldest example of building, from around 1 500 B.C., makes us both particularly sensitive to the need to encourage the European Union to adopt measures to protect and revive Europe’s cultural heritage."
"To this end, the Government of the Balearic Islands is working on drawing up and implementing policies of sustainable development based on the convergence of the objectives of sustainability and competitiveness of tourism activities and, in particular, on safeguarding and improving natural, architectural and cultural heritage."
"That is the direction we must take, which would involve a civil society sensitive to the particular fragility of the island regions and with a high degree of environmental awareness."
"This is a good point from which, as the report advocates, to begin immediately to share and exchange experiences in this important field of the protection of European heritage, a subject of huge importance since it does not only involve human beings, but is also an important element of the historic development and identity of the regions of Europe."
"– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, with the Maastricht Treaty the European Union became the Union of the peoples and endowed itself with its own cultural identity while respecting regional and local differences."
"These differences, in contrast to the ever-growing globalisation of culture, form the real underlying wealth of our common heritage. The cradle of this heritage lies in our island and rural areas, with their traditions, their architecture, their local crafts and the beauty of their natural and human landscapes."
"It is therefore a priority to protect this vast heritage and to prepare a plan for local development aimed at implementing and encouraging the enhancement of culture and environmental resources, to make them a tool for growth in our currently struggling economy."
"That means first of all improving overall conditions in the countryside, including not only restoring and preserving architecture from both a monumental and a landscape point of view, but also taking into consideration the people who live in and share the reality of small rural villages."
"That means combating the rural exodus; providing incentives for youth training; rescuing local crafts and traditional farming practices; giving a boost to old trades and new professionalism, including by funding the development and use of new technologies; and ensuring that the landscape is maintained, not only by preserving green areas but, above all, by using local tree and plant species so as not to change the culture of the place."
"The people who live in these areas must be provided with all the means necessary to be able to carry on their traditions in their towns, villages or islands."
"The programmes designed for these purposes must be strengthened and enhanced."
"The EU’s global cultural heritage strategy needs to become a real cross-cutting element in other policies, just as environmental sustainability is, and all policies need to be integrated together in this respect."
"I am convinced that a balanced, rational, consistent, coordinated and, above all, more effective use of resources, including at a financial level, will enable us to overcome this two-pronged challenge."
"Safeguarding the local and regional cultural heritage requires us to promote balanced socioeconomic development in the rural world."
". Mr President, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking all those who have made an important contribution to this debate, in the form of ideas and of truly interesting suggestions, and I fully intend to inform Mr Figel' about them."
"I should like to go back over just two points: that of the funding of the Culture 2000 project and that of the proposal, put forward specifically by the rapporteur, to make 2009 the European Cultural Heritage Year."
"With regard to the first point, as you know far better than I do, the Culture 2000 project, which had a budget of EUR 167 million, is now due to be allocated EUR 400 million."
"The budget has thus been substantially increased thanks to the contribution and the political support of the European Parliament."
"As regards the second issue concerning the European year, the Commission is taking the proposal made very seriously, and we will assess it in the context of our objectives and priority plans for the next few years."
"This proposal deserves to be carefully analysed."
"I also wish to take advantage of this opportunity to point out to you that my colleague, Mr Figel', recently made an important proposal aimed at making 2008 the Year of Intercultural Dialogue, a proposal that the Commission has adopted."
"I hope that the opinion to be issued by Parliament will be along the same lines."
"That being said, as I stated, I shall inform Mr Figel' of the outcome of this debate, in a spirit of constructive cooperation between the Commission and Parliament."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"Almost 90% of the enlarged EU is made up of agricultural land, which includes national parks with precious fauna and flora, and also historical remains that belong to Europe’s cultural heritage."
"This notwithstanding, many political solutions for rural areas fail to consider their specific features and real needs adequately."
"For example, the countryside accounts for 85% of Slovakia’s territory and is home to 48% of the population."
"However, young people are tending to leave the countryside, rural population density has dwindled, our cultural heritage is threatened and high unemployment is a major concern."
"I consider this report very topical, as it analyses the current situation and seeks to identify solutions that would support the rural areas and islands of Europe."
"It also addresses the future of small traditional communities with populations of less than 1 000."
"It focuses on aid for micro-enterprises, young farmers, traditional handicrafts and trades, local customs and traditions, which will help assure job creation and a better and more attractive life in the countryside."
"Cultural heritage needs greater attention and, especially, more funding."
"The EU should introduce a comprehensive approach to sustaining cultural heritage, ensuring that provisions on aid are included in all policies."
"I welcome the ‘European Heritage Days’ initiative and the exchange of experience in this field through international conferences."
"In discussing this report, the EP has confirmed that it takes seriously the sustainable development of Europe’s rural areas."
"As Malta and Gozo are the smallest nation in the European Union it is only natural that one refers to their architecture and cultural heritage in a holistic way."
"With the little available resources and an enormous architectural and cultural heritage it is impossible to preserve same using only our resources."
"This is why we have to look to the EU to come to our aid."
"Few know that the earliest free standing buildings in the world have been found in Malta."
"Notwithstanding, they need immediate attention."
"Perhaps the most impressive temple complex Ggantija in Gozo is in dire need of immediate professional attention."
"Valletta, one of the most beautiful cultural capitals in Europe, is still in a disastrous state."
"Fifty years have passed since the end of World War II yet the capital is still war-scarred – in particular the ruins of the once magnificent Opera House."
"I appeal to the German and Italian governments to make a gesture of goodwill by rebuilding the Opera House which was destroyed through aerial bombings thus enhancing Valletta architecturally and contributing to its cultural heritage."
"– The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, I would like to propose the following oral amendment: ‘Calls upon the Chinese authorities to reveal the whereabouts of human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and to release him unless he is to be charged with a recognised criminal offence; similarly calls for the release of Chen Guangcheng, who has helped citizens in their attempts to sue their local authorities for carrying out forced abortions and sterilisations, and of Bu Dongwei, who has been assigned to two and a half years of “Re-education through Labour” (RTL) and who is detained at an undisclosed location; therefore urges the authorities to ensure that all human rights defenders can carry out peaceful and legitimate activities without fear of arbitrary arrest, torture or ill-treatment and that they be given access to proper legal representation in the event of arrest;’."
"Mr President, we too would have been happy to endorse this important report on China, but, as it does not accept the ‘one China – two systems’ concept, we cannot vote to approve it."
"Since, however, it does voice many justified concerns about human rights, we will not be voting against it, but will abstain from voting."
"Mr President, in order to nip a potential myth in the bud, let me say that this House, by a large majority, adopted Amendment 33, which would appear to make reference to that concept, so your justification, Mr Swoboda, is wrong, and you ought to vote for the report."
"We are not going to re-open the debate and we shall proceed with the vote."
"Mrs Muscardini, in relation to which article of the Rules of Procedure do you wish to take the floor?"
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Rules of Procedure say that explanations of vote shall take place after voting and not before."
"If we must change the Rules of Procedure, I am all for it, but the rule should apply to all the groups and not just to some of them."
"I shall take due note of that, Mrs Muscardini."
"Mr President, before we proceed to vote, I should like to make a point on the basis of Rule 150(6) and to couple it with a question to Mr Poettering."
"The point I would like to make is that Mr Hatzidakis tabled an amendment – Amendment 5 – in which, as is generally agreed, it mentions the need for us to send a delegation to the areas particularly affected."
"We are now talking only about the particularly badly affected regions in Spain, although there were fires in Portugal, Greece, France and other countries too."
"The question arises of whether this is a mistake, for if it is, we ought to do as we have suggested and delete reference to Spain, so that it then reads ‘Delegation to the areas particularly affected’, or, alternatively, one ought to add to Spain ‘Portugal, Greece, France’."
"This is on the assumption that there is no underlying political motive, although that possibility cannot be entirely excluded."
"I would ask, though, that we should not use the plight of the victims in Greece, Portugal and other countries as an occasion for playing party politics, and so either we delete the reference to Spain or we include all those countries that were hit by fires."
"I would be grateful if the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats could clarify this before we move to the vote."
"Mr President, Mr Schulz, I was naturally not here on Monday when the European Commission spoke."
"In his statement, Commissioner Dimas said that the only country in which the European civil protection mechanism was applied this summer was Spain."
"That makes sense, because 50% of the fires this summer have unfortunately taken place in my country."
"Now, Mr Schulz will know that on 6 October in the European Parliament we will hold a public hearing, proposed by our friend the ex-Commissioner Mr Barnier, precisely on the European civil protection corps."
"Since we want that delegation to travel before 6 October, therefore, it is physically impossible to visit all of the countries that he has mentioned."
"I propose that the visit to Spain before 6 October go ahead as planned and, if his group wants us to visit other countries after 6 October, he has my assurance that I will vote in favour of that."
"I have other requests to speak, but I do not wish to re-open the debate."
"That being said, if I have understood matters correctly, when the time comes, Mr Schulz will table an oral amendment. The Assembly will thus be able to give its verdict, and each Member will be able to express his or her opinion by voting."
"Mr President, we had surmised that things would turn out to be the way that Mr Galeote – in his most enlightening statement – has said they were, and so I ask that, following the words ‘in Spain’, the words ‘in Portugal, Greece, France and in the other countries particularly affected’ be added."
"– Mr President, I should like to propose a change to the second part of paragraph 19 with the following verbal amendment:"
"‘implementing multiannual projects to promote well-preserved traditional communities, with a population of, say, less than 1000;’"
"– That concludes voting time."
". – By acceding to the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the remit of which is to work towards ‘the progressive unification’ of the rules of international private law, Parliament is, for once, taking a realistic step towards the harmonisation of the rules of law specific to each Member State."
"There are in fact two ways in which to achieve legislative harmonisation."
"The first, which is advocated by the fanatical Euro-federalists, consists in taking a binding approach to standardising the substantive rules of law of each of the 25 Member States; while the second, which fulfilled both the basic requirement for legal certainty and legal effectiveness, consists in standardising only the conflict-of-laws rules and rules of jurisdiction, that is to say, it consists in determining both the competent court and the national law applicable to a legal relationship."
"The Member States therefore keep their own legal rules, systems and traditions, but, as a result, the uncertainty that may arise from the application and the confrontation of national laws in different regions of the Union is greatly reduced."
"That is why we are in favour of the report and of the accession of the European Community to the Hague Conference."
"– Mr President, I have voted in favour of Mr Belder’s report, and would like to congratulate him on the work he has done."
"The attitude of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is in fact an argument in itself in favour of voting to adopt this report, since they criticised what they saw as the excessive attention given in it to the human rights situation in China."
"Be that as it may, the fact is that the situation in that country has certainly not improved over recent years, not even since the events that took place on Tienanmen Square, and it is clear to us that governments, businesses, and other bodies in the European Union are all too willing simply to do business with a Communist regime in China, without, however, any obligation to improve the human rights situation."
"We think it good that the European Parliament should be endeavouring to do more with regard to human rights in China."
"What, for us, are missing from the report, however, are the references to bilateral efforts and to trade that should be central to it."
"Because China is the EU’s second largest trading partner, efficient contacts are important."
". – Mr Belder’s report is meant to be exhaustive in covering the range of violations committed by the People’s Republic of China, both in terms of its international trade commitments at the WTO (dumping in all its guises, counterfeiting and piracy, obstacles faced by China’s trade partners in accessing its market, etc) and of human rights."
"On this last point, the litany is very long: concentration camps (the Laogai camps), forced labour, the trafficking in organs of executed prisoners, religious persecution - particularly of the Catholic minority - Tibetan martyrs, and so on."
"What is surprising is that the Belder report manages to lament these situations without ever mentioning the fact that China is a Communist country, a Marxist dictatorship, which lays claim to having had, in political terms, the most murderous ideology of the 20th century."
"Even more surprising – but is it really surprising in this House? – is that the report does not conclude with a call for sanctions, nor even with a condemnation, but with the need for a free, competitive and transparent market in China!"
"There is no doubt that, within the Europe that you have in store for us, money will always be more important than people."
"For the European Union, China is a very important trading partner."
"The EU and China have had a close trading relationship over the last decade."
"The report should be seen as a step towards improving social and environmental conditions in China."
"The June List believes that demands for improvements in these areas are a condition of long and sustainable trade cooperation."
"I am thus voting in favour of the report as a whole."
". Unsurprisingly, the majority in Parliament has adopted a resolution on EU-China relations, which, in its many paragraphs, barely contains any reference to bilateral relations, opting instead for a policy on China of blatant interference."
"Among the many points worthy of comment, I should just like to highlight Parliament’s support for relegating EU-China relations to a position of secondary importance behind the framework of the ‘American initiative of starting a strategic dialogue with Europe on China’s rise – a central new element in the policy of the ‘new’ world towards the ‘old’’, encouraging ‘the European Union and its Member States to develop, together with the USA, a strategic consensus for dealing with China’."
"Furthermore, it ‘is concerned about the development of inequality and unfair distribution of wealth, mass unemployment and uncontrolled urbanisation, the rising crime rate and corruption and not least the environmental problems of China’. These concerns reveal the hypocrisy on the part of people who, let us be honest, have no moral right to register those concerns; take, for example, the brutal anti-social onslaught led by the EU and the appalling social decay in the Member States."
"Hence our vote against."
". The issue of relations with China is one on which, at the very least, questions must be asked to those overseeing the external policy of the EU Member States."
"On the one hand, this is a totalitarian State that shows no respect for human rights, nor the slightest concern for humanitarian issues, the environment, integrated development, promoting freedom or respect for the minimum values of the human race."
"It is also undeniably a significant economy that is growing all the time."
"Evidence also suggests that economic progress – to which the strengthening of EU-China relations has contributed – has produced the desired effect of the development of an urban middle class, which will hopefully, over the course of time, provide a boost for democracy."
"Meanwhile, and this was a point that we proposed, the experience of Macau and Hong Kong, which the EU has followed closely, proves that it is possible to establish a better system than the one in place in mainland China."
"Lastly, a word of regret for the attitude of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which attempted to remove the report, in anticipation of a result that would not suit their interests."
"This is poor form."
". I oppose China’s one child policy and other human rights abuses."
"I do not support a one-China policy!"
"We have today voted in favour of the report on launching a debate on a Community approach towards eco-labelling schemes for fisheries products."
"We are in favour of the EU establishing common minimum rules for the eco-labelling of fisheries products and in favour of their complying with current international standards."
"In direct contrast to the report, we think it good, however, for there to be various private labels and for all eco-labelling of fisheries products to be done by private actors."
"Nor do we share the rapporteur’s conviction that the common fisheries policy makes for the most environmentally friendly fishing."
"On the contrary, we are convinced that the common fisheries policy accounts in large part for overfishing and environmental problems."
"Measures designed to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing are to be welcomed."
"However, I question the need for the EU to introduce centrally an eco-labelling scheme for fisheries products."
"The launch of a common EU eco-labelling scheme is in danger of creating superfluous bureaucracy and may limit the opportunities of companies, fisheries organisations and the Member States to produce their own eco-labelling schemes."
"I am thus voting against this report."
". As the debate has shown, the creation of eco-labelling for fisheries products raises important issues."
"The rapporteur says that one kind of criterion could be based on objective factors such as scientific analysis, arising from the implementation of Community standards aimed at ensuring that all fisheries in the EU Member States are sustainable."
"That being said, the introduction of other kinds of criteria such as more selective production methods, which would lead to the implementation of an criterion. This would run counter to the principle that the effects on resources should be analysed on the basis of the decision on technical measures, and not afterwards."
"There is also the introduction of criteria relating to food safety, which would raise the issue of the danger of fisheries products caught in the wild not being fit for human consumption."
"In which case labelling is not the issue. Such fisheries products must not under any circumstances be captured, let alone put on sale."
"This is what happens when it is believed that there is some form of marine pollution leading to a ban on fishing."
"We therefore stand by what we said in our intervention."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should just like to point out that, while I supported the resolution on Lebanon, I have all too often heard people in this Chamber, including the High Representative, Mr Solana, use the terms ‘European Union’ and ‘European Union Member States’ as synonyms and say that the European Union is playing and has played an important role in the Lebanon crisis and also in sending UNIFIL troops."
"That is not the case: some Member States, some countries are playing a role."
"The European Union has unfortunately given up using even those modest, feeble foreign policy tools that it could have used."
"The role that the European Union might play would be to offer the prospect of membership to countries on the other side of the Mediterranean: Turkey, Israel and also other democracies beyond the Mediterranean."
"The Member States’ policy on Israel and Palestine is, instead, a losing one."
"– Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, notwithstanding my complete approval of UNIFIL 2, I must express my reservations about the actual mobilisation of the countries of Europe: apart from Italy, France and Spain, they will confine themselves to providing a more or less symbolic contribution."
"Europe’s appeals so far have been feeble; the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Mr Solana, called for a strong response from all the countries of the Union, but his words have faded away in the air over Brussels."
"Even if I wanted to gloss over the veiled pro-Palestinian slant that pervades the European institutions and which sometimes seems to slide into anti-Semitism, I should in any case have to stress yet again how incapable Europe is: through trying to be politically correct as usual, it has been unwilling to adopt a clear, precise position."
"I wonder, however, how one can talk of equidistance."
"– For 34 days, the world watched a military operation by a super-equipped army which, thanks to the ministrations of the USA and the super-modern rockets which it sent right up to the end – flattened and invaded south Lebanon, killing hundreds of civilians, displacing a third of the population and putting the economy of the country back twenty years."
"Israel is guilty of a great many war crimes, as confirmed by the reports of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch."
"The arrest of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah was the pretext to apply a prepared plan."
"As Cypriots, we have our own particular experience of military intervention and reject the philosophy of sitting on the fence underpinning Parliament's motion for a resolution and any possibility of equating the victims with the perpetrators."
"We support the embargo on consignments of military equipment to Israel, in order to interrupt the operation of this military machine and send the message that the international community disagrees with the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian and neighbouring peoples."
"We call for the creation in our region, including Israel, of a nuclear-free zone."
"We need to condemn the policy of Israel towards Palestine outright and to decide to return immediately to the negotiating table with a view to quickly finding a final solution."
". It is appalling that Parliament has opted to take the view suggested by this report, namely putting Israel and Palestine – that is, the aggressor and the victim – on an equal footing, when what is required is clear condemnation of both the war crimes committed by Israel in Lebanon, and the attacks and the State terrorism that Israel continues to perpetrate in the Palestinian occupied territories, including Gaza."
"This is a bad start."
"At a particularly complex and dangerous time, what the EU should be doing is, at least, to demand that Israel comply with the UN decisions as regards its occupation of the Palestinian territories, the immediate cessation of Israel’s operation of the occupied Palestinian territories, the immediate lifting of the Gaza blockade, that is to say, by reopening the border with Egypt and allowing the free movement of persons and goods, the return of the Golan Heights to Syria and the Shebaa Farms to Lebanon, the immediate release of elected Palestinian ministers and members of parliament, the opening of negotiations for the exchange of prisoners, the end of settlements, and, lastly, that Israel resume the return of Palestinian tax and customs revenue."
"Lasting peace in the Middle East is dependent on respect for the rights of the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese people to their own sovereignty."
". In this debate on the situation in the Middle East, I want to remind Members that on 31 May 2005, Parliament voted through a resolution entitled ‘The Assyrian community and the situation in Iraqi prisons’."
"I am afraid to have to report that the situation of Christians in Iraq, and the Assyrians in particular, continues to deteriorate."
"We have just learnt that Dr Donny George, Director of the Iraq Museum and one of the most high-profile Assyrians within the country, has fled to Syria with his family."
"The outgoing United Kingdom ambassador, William Patey, has indicated that Iraq is already in an undeclared civil war."
"What is to be done?"
"We must get fully behind church leaders and the Save the Assyrians campaign, which I support and which supports me, in the campaign they are taking to northern Iraq later this month."
"We in Europe and the United Nations need to press for this indigenous Iraqi community, like the Kurds, Sunnis and Shia, to have their own administration area within a united Iraq, as mentioned in the Iraqi constitution."
"Otherwise, the prospect is that the Middle East Christian community which, at one time, was 20% of the population, will be driven out completely."
".In my speech of 6 September in plenary, I appealed for a balanced assessment of the situation before, during and after the Israeli-Lebanese conflict, of its consequences for the populations concerned and of the future of that region."
"The joint motion for a resolution does not seem to me to respond to this concern for balance in view, among other things, of recitals A and B, and of paragraphs 17, 20 and 25."
"I therefore voted against this resolution."
"The June List deeply regrets the current situation in Lebanon."
"In a war, it is always the defenceless and the innocent who have to pay the highest price."
"The conflict in Lebanon is a text-book example of the way in which violence begets violence, and we strongly repudiate all forms of violence perpetrated by both sides."
"The report as a whole contains many sound proposals and ideas, but we believe that the UN should be the body with the highest authority in this area."
"The report also touches on a sensitive foreign policy issue about which the Member States’ governments disagree."
"We believe that it is up to the government of each Member State to adopt a position on this issue."
"We believe that the issue as a whole is one for the UN and not for the EU."
"The June List is therefore abstaining from voting."
". Among other aspects worthy of criticism, by seeking to confuse the aggressor, Israel, and its crimes, with its victims, the Palestinian and Lebanese people and their legitimate resistance fight faced with aggression and occupation, Parliament has, once again, disgracefully, washed its hands of Israel’s responsibility for its crimes."
"It also conflates UN Security Council Resolutions 1701 and 1559, emphasising that ‘the ultimate objective should be the disarmament of all militias, including Hezbollah’, and yet pays mere lip-service to Resolutions 242, 338, 426 and 520."
"Nevertheless, given the overwhelming evidence of the serious developments in the Middle East, in the face of Israel's brutal aggression towards the Palestinian and Lebanese people and in particular, given the resolute, determined resistance of the people of these countries, Parliament recognises what has long been needed: ‘a fair and lasting solution to the Israeli Palestinian conflict is imperative for peace and security to be reinstated throughout the region, a 'global, sustainable and viable solution’ for the region based on ‘pertinent UN Security Council resolutions’."
". I welcome the European Parliament’s resolution on the Middle East."
"Progress towards a lasting peace in the Middle East will only be made when the mutual coexistence of an Israeli and Palestinian State, both with secure and recognised borders, is respected and endorsed by the international community."
"In light of this, I call on the EU to do everything possible to secure that conclusion."
"Whilst the conflict persisted in Lebanon, international attention was ignoring the 250 air strikes, 1000 artillery shells, and more than 200 killings inflicted on the people of Gaza as well as, at the most recent count, around 300 Palestinian child prisoners being held captive in Israeli jails."
"I believe that there is no military solution to this crisis and that the EU should call on Israel to desist from offensive military action in the region and immediately release the Palestinian child prisoners arrested by the Israeli army."
". The humanitarian catastrophe witnessed in Lebanon, with hundreds of deaths and injuries on both sides, damage to vital infrastructure and hundreds of thousands of people displaced has not ended with the ceasefire."
"It is clear that a just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is essential to the peace and stability of the entire region."
"Strong and positive leadership is required to bring the Middle East peace process back to the top of the international political agenda."
"The European Union can have a role tin providing some of this leadership, including through rethinking its approach on aid to Palestine and its relations with Hamas."
". We are giving our opinion today on a motion for a resolution on the crisis in the Middle East, demonstrating that, unlike the European Council, Parliament is reacting properly to the situation."
"I am voting in favour because this resolution includes certain elements that are crucial to strengthening the fragile truce between the Israeli Army and the Hezbollah militia."
"As the text indicates, only political dialogue can resolve this conflict, never military action."
"Despite that, certain questions remain on the table, such as, for example, Israel’s impunity following the conflict."
"The EU should be brave and head the call for Israel to share in the costs of repairing the devastation caused by their bombing of infrastructures and civilian targets."
"Particularly because the continuing occupation of, and aggression against, Palestine must not be forgotten, it is essential that there should be an International Conference on resolving the Middle East crisis. Such a conference would seek sanction measures against the State of Israel and its return to respect for international law and would clarify the Road Map aimed at resolving the conflict."
"– The Greek Communist Party voted against the unacceptable joint motion signed by delegates from all the political parties."
"It identifies with the ΕU stand which approved the 'new Middle East' NATO/USA plan, the consequence of which was the war against Lebanon, which it calls a 'conflict', thereby acquitting Israel."
"Attempting to present the ΕU as impartial, it puts victims and perpetrators on an equal footing, implicating the resistance of the peoples against the imperialist policy of Israel and the USA."
"It approves Resolution 1701, welcomes the despatch of European occupying forces and pushes for the disarmament of grassroots forces which heroically resisted the unfair, aggressive war."
"In this way it consents to the implementation of the imperialist plans."
"It ascribes responsibility to the Palestinians without condemning their genocide by Israel."
"It does not refer to the recognition of the Palestinian government or to the release of thousands of Lebanese and Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons."
"It welcomes the occupying presence of the ΕU in the Middle East, which does not guarantee peace for the benefit of the peoples, but will fuel an escalation in the situation in a bid to implement the ΝΑΤΟ plan to control the area."
"The political forces which signed bear huge responsibility towards the people and the grassroots forces and organisations which have been fighting for a great many years with rivers of blood."
"In this fight, the Greek Communist Party expresses its solidarity, calling on the peoples to step up the fight against Euro-American imperialism."
". The agreement to send troops to the Lebanon betrays ignorance of the rules of engagement."
"Although this House’s expression of support for the summoning of a peace conference for the Middle East is to be seen in a positive light, it is regrettable that its Members' vote in favour of sending troops to the Lebanon was on the basis of a mandate lacking in any clarity; they received no briefing or other information on UNIFIL’s rules of engagement, which are still secret."
"This House’s resolution speaks in terms of welcoming a ‘strong mandate’ for the force to be sent to the Lebanon; it does not explicitly exclude the possibility of the disarming of Hezbollah being a task for UNIFIL soldiers, and hence also for soldiers from EU Member States."
"It is recklessly perverse to advocate military action of this kind, and the effect of it is to give the green light to European troops being used to wage war in the Lebanon."
"It is shameful that the war in the Lebanon is described in the European Parliament resolution as nothing more than an ‘overreaction’ on the part of Israel to attacks by Hezbollah, and this can be regarded as nothing other than cynical in view of the many civilian victims in the Lebanon."
"There are evidently those who can never get enough of them, for, in the resolution, it is claimed that ‘the presence of a multinational force in Lebanon could be taken as an exemplary model to be followed in the negotiation process for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict’."
"On the contrary, what is needed is a political solution rather than the sending of more and more troops."
". Sometimes the only thing to talk about is peace."
"This is not the time for recrimination, confrontation or settling old scores."
"Peace in the Middle East can only be built between peoples, countries and States that are free and democratic, responsible for their own acts and capable of administering their own territory."
"Democracy, freedom and development are the best antidote to ideologies under which some unfortunate people become hostages to terrorism and extremism."
"It is also necessary at this time to talk about security, without which peace cannot be established."
"Consequently, sending a significant military force with operational capacity to southern Lebanon is a solution that could change the course of events and that could help prevent a repetition of the attacks and the wars."
"We are aware of the risks, however."
"Not everyone has the best intentions at heart, and not all regimes are inclined towards a conciliatory stance."
"This will not stand in the way of peace, but will simply stop people from being naïve."
". I endorse the compromise text on the Middle East."
"There is no military solution to the problems of that region."
"Not only the gross and deliberately indiscriminate use of force by Israel, in the shape of the bombardment of civilian targets, the use of illegal weapons, the large-scale destruction of civilian infrastructure and the serious damage done to the coastline, but also the indiscriminate rocket attacks mounted by Hisbollah, are deserving of our condemnation."
"The Member States must prevent a renewed arms race in the region by strictly applying the EU code of conduct on weapons exports to all weapons supplied to it."
"Now that the USA’s policy in the area has proved a failure, it is vital that a new regional peace conference – a ‘Madrid II’ – be held in order to find a comprehensive, sustainable and attainable solution based on the right of the State of Israel to live within secure and recognised borders and on the right of the Palestinians to a viable state of their own, based on the occupied territories, with a great deal of attention given to security and disarmament."
"The EU must revive dialogue with Syria and involve that country in the efforts towards peace, by signing the joint association agreement as a major step towards addressing human rights there in a more effective way."
"– For 34 days, the world watched a military operation by a super-equipped army which, thanks to the ministrations of the USA and the super-modern rockets which it sent right up to the end – flattened and invaded south Lebanon, killing hundreds of civilians, displacing a third of the population and putting the economy of the country back twenty years."
"Israel is guilty of a great many war crimes, as confirmed by the reports of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch."
"The arrest of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah was the pretext to apply a prepared plan."
"As Cypriots, we have our own particular experience of military intervention and reject the philosophy of sitting on the fence underpinning Parliament's motion for a resolution and any possibility of equating the victims with the perpetrators."
"We support the embargo on consignments of military equipment to Israel, in order to interrupt the operation of this military machine and send the message that the international community disagrees with the genocide being perpetrated against the Palestinian and neighbouring peoples."
"We call for the creation in our region, including Israel, of a nuclear-free zone."
"We need to condemn the policy of Israel towards Palestine outright and to decide to return immediately to the negotiating table with a view to quickly finding a final solution."
"– I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by six political groups on forest fires and floods."
"Firstly, I am pleased that, as well as fires, floods have been added to the initial text."
"Essentially, it is clear that, over time, the increasing scale of natural disasters and other disturbances affecting territories and populations sometimes overwhelm certain Member States' capacity to respond, and the European Union’s help is required."
"The fact is that the European Union does not seem to have enough involvement in the response to these crises, and I regret that the resolution does not clearly and more firmly support the idea of creating a European civil protection force."
"This would not mean recruiting officials responsible for civil protection, but having chief personnel at European level with the power to coordinate certain civil protection forces within the Union’s territory, and this, at the request of a Member State unable to tackle a specific situation."
"We have today voted against the joint resolution on forest fires."
"We regret the large number of extensive forest fires and floods that have hit Europe."
"We believe that, in certain cases, the EU should provide financial aid to affected countries and regions when extreme natural disasters occur."
"Such aid must not, however, give rise to a situation in which forest fires lead to financial benefit."
"We do not, however, believe that the fires and floods that recur each year in the same regions justify either common instruments for combating these events or common funding for compensating those affected."
"We believe, on the contrary, that the most important work on combating these fires and their causes should be done locally and nationally and also be initiated and funded at those levels."
". British Conservatives sympathise with the victims of the summer forest fires."
"However, this resolution does not sufficiently address the fact that most of these fires seem to have been deliberately started by arsonists."
"Even the Spanish Government’s own Environment Minister suggested that some of the fires could have been started by forestry workers angry at not being drafted over the summer by the regional firefighting brigades."
"It is imperative that individual Member States take more preventive action to stop these deliberate acts from re-occurring."
"For this reason, British Conservatives will not be supporting the joint motion."
". We voted in favour of the report, but we are disappointed at the rejection of our proposal to call on the Commission to offer extraordinary Community financial assistance to Portugal, with a view to supporting recovery of the forest areas burnt in the Peneda-Gerês and Serras d’Aire e Candeeiros National Parks, on account of their incalculable ecological, landscape and economic interest."
"We welcome, however, the fact that Parliament has once again called on the Commission to apply the European Solidarity Fund flexibly in order to facilitate its application in cases such as the tragedies arising from forest fire disasters. Forest fires do not only bring about huge losses, they also affect people’s way of life, especially in the less wealthy areas that have to confront the adverse effects on infrastructure, on economic potential, on jobs, on the natural and cultural heritage, on the environment and on tourism, which have a knock-on effect on economic and social cohesion."
"We also welcome the emphasis on the need for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and Forest Focus to channel their efforts into preventing forest fires in southern countries."
"The June List welcomes international solidarity when a country is hit by forest fires or floods."
"We regret, however, that the EU institutions are trying to use tragic events of this kind to strengthen the EU’s influence over various policy areas."
"It is mainly the responsibility of the Member States to take measures to reduce the likelihood of, for example, fires breaking out."
"Resources can be coordinated and joint action taken outside the context of EU cooperation."
"I am thus voting against this resolution."
". – Unfortunately, Mr President, the motion only contains a limited reference to the possibility of not reforesting privately-owned areas which qualify as forested areas."
"The reclassification of forests resulting in changed land uses, the legalisation of major infringements are, for Greece at least, the basic cause of the outbreaks of fire which are due in large part to arson."
"These crimes are aided and abetted by policies of commercialisation, privatisation and exploitation of forested land for other activities, thereby sacrificing these important lungs of life at the altar of profit and seriously downgrading the environment."
"In Greece, they are even proposing amending the relevant article of the Constitution protecting forests, or at least what is left of them, especially around large towns and developed tourist and residential areas, so that there are no obstacles to the implementation of this anti-grassroots, anti-environmental policy."
"These criminal policies are being helped by inadequate resources and a lack of personnel, emphasising the political responsibilities of the EU and the governments and the inhumane and anti-environmental consequences of the policies they apply."
"There is a serious and immediate need for compensation for the victims."
"However, there is an even more serious need for a different policy."
". We have just come back from our holidays."
"Normally we would be feeling refreshed and raring to go."
"This year, however, we have returned impoverished, following the fires that have devastated forests, attacked houses and taken away human lives."
"We are tired of excuses and are feeling decidedly disillusioned."
"This scenario of drought, hot summers and fires has been repeated, without fail, in recent years."
"It is not enough for us to settle for an accurate calculation of when crises will strike."
"Much more can and must be done."
"The Member States are responsible for emergency management on their territory, and they must be held to account when they do not do everything in their power to prevent such disasters."
"I therefore condemn my government’s failure to carry out brushwood clearance, for which it is responsible in the Peneda-Gerês National Park."
"This failure is incomprehensible."
"This failure was incendiary."
"I must express my sadness at the loss of human life in various fires in my country and other European countries."
"If we needed reasons to be more effective, the actions undertaken in our countries and the Union’s aid measures are intertwined with the loss of human life."
"We must be resolute in the fight against the fires, in the fight against the destruction of property and our forests, and in preserving the future."
". Mr President, I have reluctantly supported this resolution though do so having voted against the idea within it that a full blown delegation of the Parliament be sent to view fire damage in various places."
"I do not see that this is proportionate to the issues and that the funds likely to be used in this venture would be better used elsewhere."
". It is a tragedy that this failed over agriculture when it is less than 5% of the GDP for the European Union and the United States and yet so vital for developing countries."
"While India has made the offer to end farm subsidies by 2013, the US seems hell-bent on increasing agricultural subsidies."
"We can only hope sanity returns to these negotiations so important and so vital for so many!"
". What comes through from the statements made by UNICE and Mr Mandelson is that those who stand to lose out the most from the suspension of WTO negotiations are the least developed countries."
"The statements gloss over the content of the Doha Agenda, which seeks to promote the liberalisation of goods and services, the central idea being that development is promoted by means of the free trade of any obstacle to the large multinationals and that there is a contradiction between multilateral and regional bilateral trade agreements."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"The WTO is at the beck and call of the large multinationals, providing them with expanding markets, boosting their profits, giving them access to raw materials and paving the way for further exploitation of the capitalist periphery."
"With the current restriction on market expansion and the increasing strength of the emerging powers, central rivalries intensify and it becomes more difficult blindly to accept the periphery."
"Furthermore, resistance has grown to the destructive policies of the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO and to the multinationals’ all-consuming domination."
"Hence the pressure at the negotiating table for the periphery to accept the Agenda, as happened with the Uruguay Round, which took eight years to conclude."
"We therefore voted against."
". I hope this resolution on the suspension of the Doha Round will send a clear signal to the negotiating parties of this Parliament's ongoing commitment to multilateralism as a driver of global development."
"It is true that countries do not come to the table as equals in international trade."
"This means we need to honour our Doha commitments to ‘less-than-full reciprocity’ in NAMA, to special and differential treatment and Aid for Trade for the poorest countries."
"It means especially that we cannot continue to allow agriculture, accountable for only 2% of our economy, to remain the stumbling block of these talks."
"I hope that this period of stocktaking at the WTO will enable parties to reflect not only on how that organisation must change, but also on the merits of that organisation – a unique body in international law."
"Bilateralism – with its unequal terms – is a poor substitute for developing countries who will be forced to accept less favourable terms on market access and intellectual property rights."
"I voted for a renewed commitment to this WTO round, as an ambitious trade round but also as the development round it was originally intended to be."
". – At the Geneva summit in June 2006, Europe showed itself to be flexible until it submitted at the WTO trade negotiations."
"After having accepted, on 18 December 2005 in Hong Kong, our relinquishing our agricultural export refunds, from 2013 onwards, Mr Mandelson, our Commissioner and chief negotiator, made the magnificent gesture in Geneva of allowing an international agreement to be reached: the reduction of as much as 50% of the customs protection of our agricultural market."
"Yet, Brazil, which has forthcoming presidential elections, and the United States, which has forthcoming Congressional elections, have not taken the slightest risk: for the United States to reduce its internal aid, and for Brazil to open its industrial market."
"The negotiations will end up being resumed, but we already know that the Commission has yielded with regard to export subsidies and to the protection of our agriculture and our viticulture against the social dumping of third countries, in which multinationals manufacture goods without there being any labour law or social legislation."
"The solution for 2007 and for breaking the deadlock is to have the imagination to invent flexible, refundable and discountable customs duties, that is to say, deductible customs duties."
". Anyone who believes that trade is one of the driving forces behind economic development, and, no less importantly, bringing people from different countries together, must be bitterly disappointed at the July decision to suspend the Doha Round negotiations indefinitely."
"The fact that negotiations have reached an impasse is terrible news."
"The issue at hand is not one of promoting the total, immediate opening up of all borders or immediately stopping all State aid."
"In economics, utopias tend to be dangerous and rash behaviour expensive."
"It is completely desirable, however, for world trade to open up and thus to allow the maximum amount of trade between the north and the south, between countries of the south, and between the most and least developed countries."
"This must be done in a fair and balanced way, and in such a way as to benefit the most competitive producers, the most hard-working exporters and, that no less important but oft-forgotten player, the consumer."
"The EU must be equal to the task of moving forward, reaching a satisfactory agreement among its Member States and playing a leading role at the WTO."
"A world with freer trade is a freer world."
". Mr President, trade issues must be dealt with globally, where at all possible, and it is worth the effort of continuing if we presently cannot find agreement."
"The alternative is a morass of unequal bilateral deals which will in the main disadvantage the developing world, we are already seeing this trend worsening."
"Agreement will evidently take more time, though in the short term there are other weapons in our armoury."
"The ""Aid for Trade"" agenda provides a useful means of working towards effective development and I would like to see it progress, while of course hoping that the Commission will continue to press for substantive progress in the WTO itself."
". – The French press has on several occasions over the last few months published reports on the damage that the counterfeiting of products and brands causes to the economy."
"This is the proof that this phenomenon, together with globalisation, is reaching very worrying proportions, of which the public authorities and the citizens are becoming increasingly aware."
"It is therefore estimated that 100 000 jobs have been lost in Europe as a result of the manufacture and placing on the market of counterfeit products."
"Over and above the protection of intellectual property, however, there may also be tragic consequences where health is concerned. Such is the case with regard to the counterfeiting of medicines and vaccines, which endangers the lives of millions of people, particularly in developing countries, and above all in Africa."
"Consumer protection is an important duty of the European Union."
"The Union must therefore harmonise and enhance its legislation aimed at fighting this scourge, which is reaching worrying proportions."
"It must also help to enhance legislation in third countries."
"It was therefore with great interest that I voted in favour of the resolution on the counterfeiting of medicines."
". I had no problems in supporting this resolution."
"The counterfeiting of medicines is the most serious and most amoral form of counterfeiting given that it endangers the health of millions of consumers."
"This problem is particularly prevalent in developing countries where medicines without essential active ingredients are circulating (in some countries as high as 50% of the medicines available) and are being used to treat fatal conditions such as HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria."
"There is no reason why counterfeiting of medicines and their distribution within or across borders should not constitute a criminal offence in international law."
"I and my colleagues would like to see greater coordination of national and transnational bodies involved in the fight against piracy."
"I also support the EU taking a leading role in strengthening the regulatory and quality-control capacity for medicinal products and medical equipment placed on the market in resource-poor countries."
"I would call on the authorities and pharmaceutical companies to continue to guarantee the origin and quality of medicines available, recognising the utmost importance of fighting this dangerous form of piracy."
"– Mr President, a rather contradictory approach can be observed today in this House."
"On the one hand, we have a report, by Mrs Wallis, which proposes that we join the Hague Conference in order to unify the conflict-of-laws rules, and that seems an excellent approach to me."
"On the other hand, we have this tendency to want to unify the substantive rule of European contract law."
"I believe that the first approach is the right one, while the second approach is far more questionable."
"As regards European contract law, it seems to me that it should simply be decided, for example, that the applicable law shall be the one chosen by the parties and, if they have not chosen an applicable law, that the applicable law shall be the one established in the place in which the contract was concluded and, finally, if the contract was concluded between parties located in different places, that the law applicable to the contract shall be the one established in the place in which the contract is enforced."
"The wording of this very simple rule simply needs to meet the legitimate need for legal certainty without necessarily having to unify in a rather arbitrary and authoritarian way the national law of each of the Member States."
". Air carriers that operate passenger flights to the USA supply US security agencies with personal data contained in Passenger Name Records (PNR), at the request of the authorities, on the pretext of the so-called 'war on terror'."
"Included in these data are 34 categories of information, for example: hotel and travel bookings, telephone numbers, email addresses, private and work addresses, favourite foods, numbers of credit cards, and many others."
"Parliament has ruled that this agreement between the EU and the USA is illegal."
"It criticised the lack of legal clarity and its excessiveness as regards safeguarding the citizens’ rights, freedoms and guarantees and personal data protection enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The Court of Justice backed Parliament’s view as regards the legal basis, overturning the Council’s decision, with effect from 1 October 2006."
"This is another unacceptable situation that must end, as it undermines rights, freedoms and guarantees, and forms part of the current trend towards securitarianism."
"It also means that the USA’s sovereignty takes precedence over that of the individual Member States, given that according to the agreement, current and future legislation of the United States in this field would be applicable."
". An agreement between the EU and the USA on the use of passenger name records is urgently required, in light of the impending legal vacuum from 1 October 2006."
"We must ensure, therefore, that we are clear about the principles we bring to the negotiating table."
"The protection of our citizens’ fundamental rights is without question the backbone of any negotiation in this area."
"Yet we cannot ignore that the world is a terrifying place in which the prevention and fight against terrorism is an increasingly important value and objective."
"Whilst globalisation has opened up new worlds and new trade and enabled the citizens to explore new territories, it has also enabled new monsters to show their claws."
"Terrorism and organised crime being examples of this."
"There are measures that must be taken quickly, based on clear, precise principles, to protect our citizens from any attack on their lives, their property and their fundamental rights."
"I am therefore in no doubt that these are the same principles that will guide our partners at the negotiating table and that the agreement will be negotiated with a view to protecting our citizens."
". – I should like to pay tribute to the outstanding work of my colleague, Mr Sifunakis, regarding the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions."
"As the elected representative of a rural region in which the natural heritage is protected, the architectural heritage is ancient and the cultural heritage is rich, I appreciate the importance of this report."
"I also believe that the multifaceted character and strong identity of the heritage of our rural and island regions is what sets them apart and makes them rich."
"I fully endorse the report’s recommendations in relation to the measures aimed at suitably protecting, rehabilitating and promoting small traditional communities."
"The necessary resources must be harnessed both from the Structural Funds and from the appropriations earmarked for the environment and the national allocations."
"All European initiatives such as the ‘European Union Cultural Heritage Prize’ and the ‘European Heritage Days’ must be encouraged and made more widely known in order to promote the diversity and richness of Europe’s heritage, as a factor of social cohesion."
"Furthermore, I believe that more importance should be attached to preserving and passing on the regional languages, dialects and patois of our rural and island regions, as these are also part of our heritage."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sifunakis on the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions, because I believe that cultural heritage should be strengthened and incorporated fully into the EU’s policies and financial resources, through the use, for example, of the Structural Funds."
"Given that rural areas cover some 90% of the territory of enlarged Europe and constitute a precious reservoir of natural life and cultural capital, it is vital that we invest more in the development of local economies, so as to reverse the trend of dwindling rural populations, encourage and support ‘alternative, sustainable tourism’, and safeguard local know-how and traditional professions."
". I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sifunakis (Socialist Group in the European Parliament, Greece) on the protection of the European natural, architectural and cultural heritage in rural and island regions, because I believe that the historical and cultural heritage of rural island regions should make a substantial contribution towards enhancing the social and economic development of these regions."
"I also believe that the positive aspect of this report lies in the promotion of the concept of sustainable development, capable of striking a vital balance between local communities and the environment, and in the integrated attitude that it proposes for traditional farming areas."
"As regards the civic participation of civil society, I feel it is important to highlight the emphasis that Mr Sifunakis places on the need to involve local people in preparing and implementing policies, some of which are in the report, as follows: a systematic study of the cultural heritage and the creation of a legal framework for its protection; funding to restore local monuments and traditional farming methods; comprehensive restoration of traditional habitats and traditional forms of architecture; and know-how and traditional professions passed down through the generations."
"Accordingly, my vote in favour is based on its quality. I therefore wish to congratulate Mr Sifunakis."
". Although the report contains some contradictions and one or two points to which we do not subscribe, we voted for the final resolution, because we feel it is important to support the protection and preservation of cultural heritage via the Structural Funds and the existing Community initiatives such as LEADER +, URBAN II and INTERREG III, which are set to be integrated into the new financial instruments of the CAP in the next budgetary period (2007-2013)."
"We also welcome the idea of calling on the Commission to adopt measures to facilitate greater accessibility and to encourage small companies, traditional crafts and trades and local traditions and customs, by a large-scale campaign to promote villages and communities within the Member States, so as to contribute decisively to developing the local economy and to containing the rural exodus."
"The Commission and the Member States are also called upon to cooperate with the Council of Europe with a view to further promoting traditional communities and the architectural heritage in rural and island areas as part of the 'European Cultural Heritage Days' initiative so as to make the European public more aware of the value of local and regional cultural identities."
"The June List believes that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is the Member States, regions and local authorities that can and must protect natural, architectural and cultural heritage."
"We decidedly reject the artificial creation of a common EU cultural heritage at EU level."
"The idea of creating a legal framework at EU level for protecting cultural heritage in rural regions is unrealistic."
"This is something that must be done at Member State level."
"As always, the European Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education has embarked on flights of fancy in its report."
"Paragraph 21 of the draft report proposes systematic action in favour of small, traditional communities along the lines of the cultural capitals system."
"This would add new costs to the EU’s budget."
"Paragraph 24 of the draft report proposes efforts to establish a European Cultural Heritage Year."
"The European Parliament often proposes dedicating particular years to one topic or another. To arrange all of these, however, would in practice be impossible."
"I am voting against the report as a whole."
". I wish to congratulate Mr Sifunakis on his important and timely report on the protection of the European natural and architectural heritage in Europe’s rural and island regions, to which I lend my backing."
"I especially welcome reference to the need for the EU to take joint measures to protect the heritage, which includes both the architectural and natural heritage of the regions, marked by people’s way of life over the course of time."
"The conservation of the numerous elements of cultural heritage provides a foundation for further social and economic development and thereby enhances environmental protection, employment opportunities and European integration, and helps to prevent abandonment and dwindling populations."
"– The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on Sri Lanka.(1)"
"."
"Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to speak this afternoon, but regret the need to do so because it seems not very long ago that this Parliament adopted a resolution on the situation in Sri Lanka."
"Since then, we have seen a return to, or a continuation of, the destruction, the deaths, the displacement of people, and indeed the recurrence of bloodshed in a way that all of us in this House would have hoped would have ceased by now."
"I am sure that every one of us in this Chamber wants an end to the bloodshed and that we want a peaceful settlement in Sri Lanka."
"We may disagree about the path we should take, but we are united on that goal as this resolution makes clear."
"As our resolution says, the fact that there is no peace settlement is due to intransigents on both sides who trample on the aspirations of the majority and who are so concerned with their own role, their own future, their own vision of Sri Lanka that they are unwilling to let forces wanting peace work to that end."
"The European Union now has to find its own way forward."
"For some of us, placing the LTTE on the terrorist list has led to a totally predictable reaction and the SLMM is no longer able to operate at full force or as effectively as we would want."
"Nevertheless, we still have to move forward."
"We have to look for the resumption of peace negotiations."
"We have to participate in those as fully as we are able and with all the contacts that we have in order to find a way forward, so that we can get on with distributing the tsunami aid properly and look to a peaceful future for all."
"Mr President, this is not the first time we have addressed this issue, and we are aware that Sri Lanka has frequently been the subject of debate in the House."
"We have already referred to historical matters, and I have certainly spoken recently on the difficulties related to our need to take a stand on the situation of the parties to the conflict."
"On the one hand there is the continuing harm befalling all those who are victims of these conflicts, while on the other hand we cannot forget that specific past circumstances are affecting the present."
"We cannot automatically assume that these people are simply unfortunate and cursed by blind fate."
"It is necessary to accept a particular definition as to who in Sri Lanka – and I hesitate to resort to such controversial terms, but here goes – is the original host there, and who is the guest who has become too big for his boots, and whose activity is detrimental to the host."
"I do not wish to name individuals or refer to any particular side or party, but I would like point out that the present situation cannot be judged without a specific analysis and judgment of earlier events and without some basis for dividing people into aggressors and victims."
"After all, you cannot just simply label every victim as innocent and anyone who is on top as guilty at that particular moment."
"Of course, we as an international organisation should obviously ensure first and foremost that the sufferings of ordinary people stop as soon as possible, but we cannot do so without taking account of the historical context, and of a certain understanding of who are the goodies and who are the baddies."
"It seems to me this House needs to take considerably more action than it has hitherto."
"."
"Mr President, after decades of warfare and intensive mediation on the part of the Norwegians, successive Sri Lankan Governments have declared their willingness to work towards an agreement with the rebel Tamil Tigers, with the possibility of a confederation preventing the central government from intervening in the democratic administration of the autonomous north-east around Jaffna."
"This good intention has, unfortunately, become the subject of political disputes within the Sinhalese population, some of whom believe that the Tamil rebels should be made to content themselves with less, and the divided state of the majority population undermines the minority’s faith in the possibility of a peaceful resolution."
"For as long as the Tamil minority cannot rely on political agreement among the Sinhalese majority or on its earlier promises, we cannot expect it to sit patiently and wait for something to be offered to it."
"In the meantime, both parties have gone back to violence."
"Europe must be consistent in not taking either side, instead doing everything possible to foster peace and conciliation."
"Although the rebel organisation LTTE is not banned within Sri Lanka, it has, since May 2006, been on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations, and this is something to be regretted in that it makes negotiations more difficult and encourages the perpetuation of violence."
"Putting an organisation on the list of terrorist organisations is an indication that it is not one to be negotiated with and that every effort is to be made to stamp it out."
"We have known for many years that it will not be possible to wipe the LTTE out or exclude them, even if we wanted to do so."
"That is why talks have been going on with them for so many years."
"We need them if there is to be reconciliation and peace."
"That is why we must do everything in our power to bring an end to the despair that has driven them to again resort to violence."
"."
"Mr President, I should like to condemn strongly the recent spate of violence in Sri Lanka."
"At the weekend government patrol boats engaged Tamil Tiger rebels in the northern seas."
"This marks yet another outbreak of violence between government forces and the rebel movement but, as we know, violence is not the way to resolve complex and sensitive conflicts."
"Ever since the Tamil Tigers were classified as terrorists by the Council, the situation in Sri Lanka has worsened."
"The labelling of this group has undoubtedly driven that movement further away from the negotiating table."
"My approach as chairwoman of Parliament's Delegation for relations with the countries of South Asia and the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation is that both parties should be brought together and both held equally responsible for the recent violence."
"Neither side can be immune from blame, and both must accept responsibility."
"The Sri Lankan Government has failed to adopt a measured approach to the rebel threat."
"It must be careful not to adopt the terrorist approaches currently associated with the rebel movement it so violently pursues."
"The targeting of schools and hospitals in northern Sri Lanka is not the action of a responsible, democratic and peace-seeking government."
"As we all know from other terrorist flashpoints in the world, the root causes of any conflict need to be analysed closely."
"We need to deal with the causes of the conflict."
"The heavy-handed approach adopted by the government does not help address these root causes."
"Let us not forget that many people have lost their lives, including 17 EU nationals working as aid monitors."
"No longer can we tolerate violence against innocent people, aid agencies, NGOs and monitors in the region."
"It is time for good sense and negotiation to prevail in Sri Lanka."
"."
"Mr President, Sri Lanka is a beautiful country, located at a key economic crossroads, with an enterprising and industrious people."
"What a terrible shame that the hopes and ambitions of a generation of Sri Lankans have been blighted by terrorism."
"Sri Lanka has made progress in recent years; how much more could have been achieved in terms of rapid economic and social development if there had been stability and security?"
"I do not want to underestimate the strength of feeling among many Tamil citizens, in particular, that they were not getting a fair deal, but we can be certain that terrorism has not improved their opportunities one iota."
"The Tamil-speaking population is very mixed."
"Of a population of four million, one quarter or so are so-called hill Tamils, who have never been associated with the LTTE, while a further quarter are Muslims, who certainly find little attraction in the LTTE."
"Most of the Tamil peoples of Sri Lanka live in the centre and south of the island, outside areas that have been under LTTE control."
"Those living in those areas have little opportunity to express their true feelings about the terrorist masters who dominate their lives."
"I have no doubt that over the years there have been abuses of Tamils and that on occasion security forces have acted with insufficient regard for ordinary Tamil people in the areas of conflict."
"I therefore congratulate the Sri Lankan Government on the commitment it has made to investigate atrocities and serious human rights violations and to bring the perpetrators to justice."
"Of course, the greatest human rights violators are the terrorists."
"Successive Sri Lankan Governments have sought to improve the situation of the Tamils and have offered various devolutionary proposals that would give the Tamil population considerable autonomy, while preserving the unity of the country."
"Each of those proposals has been rejected by that same intransigent leadership at the LTTE."
"In our resolution today, we are calling upon all parties to the conflict and troubles in Sri Lanka to pull back from the brink."
"We are calling for an immediate, comprehensive and verifiable end to hostilities, respect for human rights, unhindered access throughout the country for humanitarian workers, and for the Government and opposition in Sri Lanka to come forward with a bold gesture of reconciliation, including constitutional revision, as a matter of urgency."
"Meanwhile, the Council, Commission and Member States must redouble their efforts to help bring a stable and just peace to Sri Lanka and restore security and prosperity, and that includes bearing down hard on the agents of terrorism."
"."
"Mr President, the end to the violence seems to be further away than ever."
"One of the reasons for this was the failure to have a second round of the Geneva peace talks, with the LTTE pulling out."
"Hopes of further talks have been damaged by the Council proscribing the LTTE as a terrorist organisation on 29 May 2006."
"I am personally pleased that an amendment has been tabled to that effect and I am sorry that it is not in the resolution."
"The banning of the LTTE only leads to further isolation."
"They are not permitted to travel, so another Geneva conference is impossible."
"We should be realistic here."
"However much we condemn the terrorist acts by the LTTE – and we do – the government is certainly not blameless."
"We just have to look at the 17 French aid workers who were killed on 4 August 2006."
"Evidence points to the government security forces being responsible – we do not know as yet."
"This incident and all the others perpetrated by the LTTE and the government need further investigation by an independent human rights expert."
"What I find so reprehensible is that neither the government security forces nor the Tamil Tigers do enough to protect civilians."
"Persistent uncertainty about what has actually occurred and who is responsible for alleged war crimes and other violations of international law is fuelling fear and panic among the civilian population."
"We must have a strong, effective monitoring operation, but it must have the support of the government, the LTTE, the United Nations and its members."
"Mr President, the cease-fire that has been in place in Sri Lanka since 2002 has been broken on repeated occasions; in mid-June, sixty people were killed in the worst attack so far, for which the government declared the LTTE responsible."
"Workers from the French organisation ‘Action against hunger’ dealing with the damage caused by the tsunami were murdered at the beginning of August, and over 100 people were injured, and 61 killed, in the middle of that month – all of them children and young people – in a massacre suspected to have been carried out by the state's security forces."
"This year, 2006, reminds me of 2001, when we were with the SARC delegation in Jaffna and saw the results of the civil war, in the shape of ruined villages, scorched earth, and tens of thousands of bewildered and desperate refugees."
"In our dialogues with government and opposition, human rights activists, Buddhists and Muslims, we have always put the case for the peace initiative mounted by the Norwegians, who, this year too, tried – and failed – to act as mediators."
"It is not acceptable that the fact should be glossed over."
"It is the LTTE that bears responsibility for the bomb attacks on civilians, for the month-long blockades of drinking water plant and for its own refusal to stop recruiting children as soldiers."
"There is, however, good news to report."
"Two Tamil parties have decided to join the coalition government."
"The President is willing to allow violations of human rights by the army and police to be investigated, and many people in positions of political responsibility are coming to realise that the Tamil population must be enabled to stop perceiving themselves as second-class citizens."
"It is to be hoped that there will be more good news of this kind, and less of the horror stories that we heard previously, for that is what Sri Lanka, as one of the oldest democracies in Asia, deserves."
"."
"Mr President, this item on the agenda, as we know, is about debates on breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The situation in Sri Lanka at the moment is tragic, and there have indeed been many breaches of human rights."
"This motion refers to the work of the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission."
"That independent body has blamed the LTTE for the attack on 15 June and, as Mrs Lynne has said, it has blamed the Sri Lankan Government for the murder of the 17 aid workers in Muttur at the beginning of August."
"This shows the seriousness of the situation."
"Regrettably though, some people involved in the debate – not just the one this afternoon, but also others – are trying to assign all the blame to one side or the other."
"We have to accept that in any conflict situation there is grave fault on both sides, and that the military responses have in many cases been disproportionate."
"What started out as a little local dispute over water supply has cost hundreds of lives, displaced thousands of people and brought the country to the brink of civil war."
"All sides – the LTTE, Colonel Karuna and the Sri Lankan Government – must realise that there can be no military solution and that peace negotiations without preconditions are the only way forward."
"It is in this spirit that Amendment 5 seeks to keep the negotiations open."
"Everyone accepts that the LTTE is a player, and yet the EU has effectively washed its hands of negotiations through its proscriptions."
"Let me make something clear."
"Just because I am saying this, and because Mrs Lynne said something similar, as did Mrs Lambert and Mr Meijer, that does not make us terrorists or apologists for terrorism, which we condemn."
"It just means that we need to keep negotiations open."
"Equally, we need to do everything we can, as mirrored in Amendment 4, to help the ordinary people of Sri Lanka, who have suffered for so long and need a peaceful solution."
"."
"Mr President, tragically the incidents of bloodshed in Sri Lanka continue to occur and the responsibility lies with both Government and Tamil forces."
"Evidence from the SLMM shows that: Government forces have killed 17 aid workers; the LTTE have bombed a bus, killing 64 civilians; and the Sri Lankan Air Force has bombed a campsite in the north, killing 51 young people."
"Whilst in the short term there is an urgent need for an independent commission to investigate the recent disappearances, abductions and extra-judicial executions, in the long term we must repeat the call made by this House in the last resolution for a wide-ranging human rights agreement between the parties involved in the civil war and its facilitation by an effective independent international monitoring mission."
"The lessons learned from the weaknesses of the SLMM demonstrate that for human rights to be a fundamental building block of a just and enduring resolution of the conflict, that body must have real enforcement mechanisms and unhindered access to both Government- and LTTE-controlled areas."
"Let us hope that a political solution that would be acceptable to Sri Lanka’s minority communities will soon be found and that lasting peace and prosperity will replace violence and poverty."
"Mr President, the Sinhalese and the Tamils have lived together in Sri Lanka – also known as Ceylon – for over two thousand years."
"Before the rise of Rome, before the Caesars, before the birth of Christ, there were Sinhalese kingdoms in Sri Lanka, along with colonies of Tamil kingdoms in southern India, and that is what makes it all the more tragic that, in the twenty-first century in which we are living, the situation there should be so explosive, although it has to be said that we Europeans, in colonial days, made our own contribution to making matters worse through our settlement policy, through the interests of the plantation owners, and much else."
"Today, the most vital thing is that we should help to bring matters to a peaceful resolution, and that will be possible only if a distinction is drawn between the terrorists and what actually matters."
"The terrorists do not want a solution, any more than do the extremists and the people in positions of power, since they derive their power from the ethnic conflict, which is, in itself, perfectly capable of being resolved."
"I would like to use the opportunity afforded by our sitting under an Italian president to say that one tremendous model for this is what has been achieved by the Italians and the people of the South Tyrol working together, which has turned out to be beneficial to both sides."
"Such a model of autonomy benefits not only the minority, but also the majority."
"It is, I believe, high time that we start working towards a similar model of autonomy for Sri Lanka, where the situation is so dangerous, and it is for that reason that I welcome this very even-handed resolution, while of course supporting our group's amendment to it."
"I do, however, think it regrettable that we are, to some extent, giving ourselves over to inter-group ideological warfare instead of this House coming together to present a united front in dealing with this thorny political issue, which would enable us to carry a great deal more weight in our dealings with the participants in the civil war in Sri Lanka."
"Mr President, in recent weeks violent clashes have again taken place in Sri Lanka between Tamil guerrillas and government forces."
"Over 800 people have died as a result of these brutal acts of violence this year alone."
"The weak judicial system in Sri Lanka has not reacted to widespread cases of human rights violations, the murder of representatives of humanitarian organisations and the recruitment of child soldiers."
"Both parties – the government in Colombo and the Tamil Tigers – accuse each other of being responsible for breaking the agreement."
"There is a risk of civil war breaking out as a result of the ever-intensifying clashes."
"Representatives of the UN peacekeeping mission were forced to withdraw from the country on the first of September because the Tamil Tigers were unable to guarantee security."
"The fact that the burgeoning conflict is hampering economic development by preventing aid from reaching the tsunami victims is particularly worrying."
"Particular support must therefore be given implementation of the UN humanitarian aid plan to supplement the funding already earmarked."
"In the face of this spreading conflict, the international community must appeal to both sides to lay down their arms and start negotiations towards a settlement."
"Attacks which take their toll on innocent civilians on a daily basis can no longer be tolerated."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as a member of our parliament’s delegation of Southern Asian countries, the loss of what has already been achieved in Sri Lanka is an ominous experience for me."
"The act of terror perpetrated by the Tamil Tigers on 15 June is very regrettable, as is the shooting of aid workers in Muturi by government forces."
"In order to be trustworthy partners, the parties must be able to prevent such incidents."
"Respect for human rights and putting the wellbeing of the population above all else is the only way out of this impasse."
"The re-establishment of the ceasefire is now the most urgent task, but merely freezing the conflict is not a solution."
"As the head of parliament’s Moldova delegation, I sense that every day."
"The frozen conflict there – I refer to the illegal Transnistrian regime – has made Moldova the poorest country in Europe."
"Despite the setbacks, the European Union must not lose sight of its long-term objectives."
"Adding the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) to the list of terror organisations was technically correct, but was the wrong step in practical terms."
"As a result, the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) lost most of its capability."
"The European Union must do all in its power to ensure that talks in Sri Lanka are conducted using words, not bullets."
"This is in our power – it must be."
"."
"The European Commission is deeply concerned at the growing violence which is seriously unravelling the ceasefire agreement and peace process in Sri Lanka."
"The intensification of hostilities between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan army that has taken place over the last months is a matter of great concern."
"A full-scale war has to be avoided at all costs and parties must recommit to respecting the ceasefire agreement."
"The Commission has repeatedly called on both parties to make the utmost effort to prevent a further escalation of violence and loss of life."
"The Commission and the co-chairs of the Tokyo Donor Conference on Sri Lanka have stated many times that violence is not the way to resolve the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka."
"The suffering inflicted on innocent civilians is intolerable."
"The European Commission is very concerned about the deteriorating human rights situation there."
"We share the concerns expressed in the draft resolution in relation to the recent violations and we are concerned about the climate of impunity and non-respect of human rights by both sides."
"The Commission has been particularly shocked by the atrocious killing of 17 aid workers from the NGO 'Action Contre la Faim' and has urged the authorities in Sri Lanka to investigate these killings immediately and thoroughly and to give assurances that they will do everything possible to ensure a safe humanitarian space in the country."
"The recent call by President Rajapakse for an international independent commission – which we support – is a positive step which will have to be followed up by concrete action."
"We continue to follow the situation in Sri Lanka very closely and welcome the interest shown by Parliament in this draft resolution with a view to encouraging both parties to ensure full respect for human rights."
"These new developments are important for the European Union in its role as a co-chair of the Tokyo Donor Conference."
"A co-chairs' meeting will take place in Brussels on 12 September and the European Commission will take an active part in ensuring that a strong message is put across to both parties, urging them to commit to a peaceful negotiated resolution of the conflict and full respect for human rights."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"– The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on North Korean asylum seekers, in particular in Thailand.(1)"
"."
"Mr President, over some 60 years of isolation, North Korea has developed a model of government and a lifestyle that is unlike virtually any other you will come across on this earth."
"It is also apparent that it thinks more about rocketry and atom bombs than about the production of sufficient food."
"Those people who have come to find such living conditions intolerable are in a trap, for the border with South Korea is still permanently closed off."
"Its neighbour, China, offers them no more of a solution, since it sends all refugees back, no doubt to face severe punishment for their deviancy; of those who are sent back, nothing more is heard."
"That is why an alternative must be made available to those who want to escape."
"At present, they end up in poor countries such as Vietnam and Cambodia, but increasingly, too, in Thailand, which is much more prosperous and should be able to comfortably accommodate small numbers of people on a temporary basis."
"Although their refugee status is recognised by the United Nations agency for refugees, the Thai Government, regrettably, regards them primarily as having crossed the Thai border illegally, the consequence being that, after all the misery they have already endured, they end up with a 30-day prison sentence plus a fine that is considerable in relation to their circumstances."
"What Thailand must do instead is to accommodate them properly and allow those who so wish passage through to South Korea or to any other country willing to welcome them."
"We hope that Thailand will apply the standards that have generally been customary in Europe, at present, it has to be said, applied with little consistency, but nonetheless traditional."
"If Thailand wants to be a democracy – which, it has to be said, entails quite a few difficulties – then this is how it ought to treat these refugees."
". – Mr President, even before 1989, both Mr Deß and I were campaigners together against the Iron Curtain and against the division of Germany and Europe."
"At that time, many thought we were pursuing an illusion, just as they believe today that the idea of Korean reunification is illusory."
"That does indeed seem to be the case when a firmly entrenched dictatorship – and one, moreover, with nuclear weapons at its disposal – is engaged in the brutal oppression of its people, but we will not desist from speaking up for a free and reunited Korea."
"Until such time as that comes to pass, however, we must offer protection to the people who are being persecuted there."
"This, I believe, is where Thailand should hold fast to its own great tradition, which it first demonstrated decades ago in its handling of millions of Cambodians."
"People keep losing sight of the fact that most Cambodians were able to survive the Khmer Rouge terror simply because Thailand – albeit with European help, but it was Thailand's doing – afforded them aid and protection, and if it was possible to do that for millions of Cambodians, it also ought to be possible to do the same thing for a few thousand North Koreans persecuted by Communism."
"It is with this in mind that my group endorses this resolution."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that there are still two Communist dictatorships in existence."
"By their very nature, Communist regimes can be nothing other than dictatorships."
"I refer to Cuba and North Korea."
"The world must do everything in its power to eliminate both of these Communist regimes."
"Today we are discussing the plight of refugees from North Korea."
"They are not economic migrants."
"We are perfectly well aware that countries often wish to protect themselves against economic migrants."
"The return of economic migrants, however painful, just means returning them to their unfortunate economic situation."
"Returning political refugees, however, exposes them to the worst possible danger."
"Consequently, the first thing the international community ought to do is to prevent even a single refugee from being returned to North Korea."
"The fate that awaits them there is so cruel that it defies the imagination."
"That should be the foremost aim of all of our activities."
". – This is one of the worst dictatorships in the world, one that threatens the whole world with its nuclear programme, and that has managed to turn the country into one huge concentration camp."
"Against this backdrop, I fervently hope, along with Mr Posselt, and the rest of us, of course, that the border will cease to exist and that North Korea will cease to exist in its current form, yet we cannot wait for that to happen before offering the highest expression of our solidarity with the refugees from North Korea."
"We therefore urge the Thai authorities to show a minimum of justice, humanity and dignity, not to criminalise the victims of a brutal dictatorship and to offer all the help they can. We also call on the European institutions to cooperate in these efforts to help the North Korean refugees."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this in fact concerns a very serious episode, which is a sign of an extremely far-reaching situation, as my fellow Members have already pointed out and as the text of the resolution makes clear."
"All that remains, therefore, is for me to ask the Commissioner, Vice-President Frattini, for a way, a chance, to raise the issue, in particular at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit."
"The problem concerns North Korea, Thailand too of course, obviously ourselves as the European Union, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees."
"I have the impression – I do not know what the Commissioner thinks – that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees tends all too often to be afraid of adopting positions regarding that part of the world, and elsewhere, that might prove to be – how can I put it? – political, as in the case of the minorities in Vietnam, for instance."
"In addition, there are many other cases in which the UN seems hesitant to guarantee or provide assurances that refugee status will be effectively respected, because it is afraid that that might be taken badly by governments or regimes in the area."
"The European Union can play an important role in this matter to encourage the international institutions and the UN in particular, so as to guarantee, grant and allow refugee status where the conditions for it exist."
"Obviously, in the case of North Korea, I agree with what my fellow Members said earlier: this migration is clearly not merely economic, but the result or product of one of the worst and most violent dictatorships still remaining on the face of the planet."
"."
"Mr President, North Korea has rapidly come to be symbol of an anachronistic, backward-looking communist state."
"The sharp deterioration in standards of living that has ensued and the unbearable repression of its people by the increasingly brutal totalitarian regime have in recent years caused tens of thousands of North Koreans to flee their home country in search of a kinder destiny."
"Thailand, in particular, has become a major transit destination for North Korean refugees."
"Sadly, we have recently seen unacceptable treatment of North Korean asylum seekers by the Thai authorities, with arrests, heavy fines, imprisonment and repatriation."
"Such conduct runs contrary to the otherwise much-envied Thai tradition of hospitality and violates Thailand’s obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees."
"We call upon the Government of Thailand to show proper respect for the rights of North Korean asylum seekers and to collaborate fully with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees."
"In addition, we call upon the Council and Commission to monitor closely the situation of North Korean refugees."
". – Mr President, North Korea has one of the world’s most repressive regimes."
"This prison state is, as far as we can tell, run in the worst Stalinist tradition, with starvation, terror and indoctrination."
"We read of horrors of the past regimes of Pol Pot and Stalin and it haunts me to think that the same situation exists in North Korea today."
"Understandably, people risk their lives to escape."
"If thousands have escaped, how many more thousands have died trying?"
"Most people in North Korea qualify for the UN status of ‘persons of special concern’."
"If they manage to escape they must be given help and given the protection they need."
"Thailand experienced the world’s solidarity only recently after the tsunami."
"It must show that same solidarity by not harassing North Koreans who struggle to its borders, but Thailand must be helped to bear this burden by others."
"The EU and European nations must be willing to give shelter and resources, too."
"Might I remind this House that after the Second World War we from the countries of Western Europe allowed Polish soldiers from German prisoner-of-war camps to be returned and fed to Stalin, who consumed them instantly, or slowly in Siberian gulags."
"In the dire situation of North Korea, we are being given an opportunity to make amends for the terrible wrong done to Poland’s prisoners."
"In helping the North Korean asylum seekers, by keeping them from being returned to North Korea for imprisonment, forced labour or liquidation, we will be paying an old debt and making the right decision."
"– Mr President, this is not the first time we have dealt with the issue of North Korea, and unfortunately I have to say with regret that in recent years little has changed for the better in that country."
"Human rights continue to be violated on a large scale."
"Today we are debating the issue of refugees, who are forced by hunger and repression in their own country to take the most difficult decision in a person’s life, which is to flee their homeland, often risking their lives."
"Thailand in particular is becoming a transit centre for many of them, but the authorities there, who have good relations with Korea, wish to apply the law on illegal immigrants to these people, and indeed do so."
"I appeal to the government of Thailand, which is known for its hospitality, not to return these refugees to their homeland, thereby exposing them and their families to incommensurable persecution, but to send them to another country."
"Do not allow these people to fall prey to the regime."
"."
"Mr President, you know very well the sad story of the many North Koreans seeking asylum, and the latest case is now in Thailand."
"The Commission deeply regrets that these refugees were not treated in accordance with international humanitarian law and urges the Thai authorities to respect the principle of non-refoulement, as they usually do, and to ensure safe passage to a third country where the refugees can be resettled."
"We hope that ongoing discussions between Thailand, the South Korean authorities and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees will result in the transfer of these persons to South Korea or another third country in the coming days."
"In this context, I would also like to highlight that the situation of the H’mong refugees from Laos living in Thailand is of great concern."
"For North Koreans, asylum-seeking is the symptom and not the cause of an issue which is quite well known, namely, the undemocratic regime in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, with widespread poverty, the collapse of the economy and human rights concerns."
"The European Union has an engagement policy with North Korea involving humanitarian aid, some EUR 345 million of European assistance since 1995, and people-to-people contacts and director-level Troika contacts, including on human rights."
"A Human Rights resolution was adopted by the United Nations in November 2005."
"This dealt, among other things, with the return of North Korean nationals to their country."
"The resolution angered the North Koreans, who suspended the humanitarian aid, which was only resumed a few months ago."
"The European Union will continue with its support for the six-party talks and with its engagement policy in an attempt to obtain practical improvements and treat the cause of the problem."
"I can assure you, on behalf of my colleague Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, that the Commission will also continue to follow events involving the refugees in Thailand closely, in the context – as Mr Cappato has just said – of EU-Asia dialogue."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"– The next item is the debate on five motions for resolutions on Zimbabwe.(1)"
". – Ladies and gentlemen, Zimbabwe is the former Southern Rhodesia."
"The regime in power in the country is regarded throughout Europe as a hard-line dictatorship."
"After the handover of power to the current rulers, farmers were quickly driven out of the old farms, and the country is constantly teetering on the brink of famine."
"The Mugabe Government therefore invited the white descendents of the colonialists back onto the land and returned the farms to them, and the situation improved rapidly."
"Today people are once again gradually being driven out, and even killed, although the government has not even begun training farm workers how to farm in a rational way."
"Similarly, there is no support for cooperatives or for buying adequate equipment."
"These are the main problems facing the economy."
"The motion for a resolution addresses the political problems and contains a number of unsatisfactory and somewhat debatable proposals."
"I strongly object to the ridiculous challenge issued to South Africa to boycott Zimbabwe at the FIFA World Cup."
"Perhaps this is not intended to be taken seriously?"
"I also fail to understand why, in supporting point D, the authors say that the main political opposition unfortunately split in October 2005 into two factions."
"If this observation lays the blame for something at Mugabe’s door, I do not understand the substance of the accusation."
"If we really wish to make fools of ourselves, we can call on the local shamans to dry up the rivers and make the Victoria falls disappear."
"I should like to make one further remark, about point 5."
"In some EU Member States, the turnout for elections has also been extremely low."
"Do we not acknowledge the legitimacy of the elected representatives, Members of Parliament, senators and some of our fellow MEPs?"
"I must say that I am genuinely shocked by this point in the resolution."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left will abstain from voting on the adoption of the resolution."
"I shall conclude with a question for the Commissioner."
"Commissioner, how do we support the South African Government, which we are calling on to improve the treatment of refugees from Zimbabwe?"
"."
"Mr President, for over six years, Parliament has consistently called for robust action to effect change for the better in Zimbabwe, but we continue to witness the desperate plight of millions of ordinary Zimbabwean people."
"They suffer on a daily basis from intense political oppression, a collapsed economy and shortages of vital food, water and medical supplies."
"The United Nations World Food Programme expects to dispense aid to almost four million malnourished people this year – over one third of the population."
"HIV/Aids has had a devastating effect on the country, with one in five adults being HIV positive and over one million children orphaned through the loss of their parents from Aids."
"Unemployment afflicts 70% of the population."
"Zimbabwe’s political and economic fortunes are at their lowest point in its 26-year history as an independent nation."
"Action taken by the international community has been at best lukewarm and lacked the commitment necessary to have a real impact on the situation in Zimbabwe."
"South Africa should be at the forefront of international efforts to pressure the Mugabe regime into making democratic concessions, but I am afraid quiet diplomacy by President Mbeke has achieved nothing tangible."
"Through its provision of electricity, maize and credit, South Africa could exert enormous leverage on the Mugabe regime."
"It has not done so."
"Now we see a resurgence of Chinese interest in many parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe."
"The Chinese Government seems to have no inhibitions about bolstering tyrannical regimes and supplying them with weapons of oppression in exchange for access to natural resources."
"I see little evidence of diplomatic effort by the EU or by the governments of Member States to close down those international sources of support that keep Mugabe in power."
"The EU has been less than robust in strictly implementing its own sanctions regime."
"No wonder Mugabe takes none of this seriously."
"If the international community is serious about tackling the appalling conditions in Zimbabwe, then the United Nations Security Council should urgently investigate the situation in that country."
"Unless we give greater priority to Zimbabwe, the Mugabe regime will stagger on until the point where Zimbabwe fails completely, unable to revive itself without immense international assistance."
"Action now by the international community could help avert this situation."
"."
"Mr President, this is not the first time that we have debated a resolution on Zimbabwe, but I have to admit that there have been those we have discussed, the content of which has been better than this."
"Not least in our cooperation with the ACP states, the lack of democracy and the massive violations of human rights in Zimbabwe, along with the grave economic crisis and the food shortages, unemployment and hyperinflation that go hand in hand with it, have frequently occasioned criticism and debate."
"When one considers all the problems of a country that was once known as the ‘breadbasket of Africa’, one cannot do other than speak of the many courageous people who, in an atmosphere of heavy-handed oppression, are bold enough to keep on denouncing the abuses that go on."
"In adopting resolutions, our aim should be to stiffen the sinews of these very people who are fighting for freedom, democracy and development."
"The impression I get from some parts of today’s resolution is that it will not do that, and I see it as simply wrong-headed to make reference, in a resolution on a matter of urgent importance, to a World Cup that is to be held in 2010."
"With effect from 13 September – which really does make this a matter of urgency – widespread, indeed nationwide, demonstrations are to be held, organised by the trade unions and other organisations, to draw attention to the mounting misery of the people and demand minimum wages above poverty level and social responsibility on the part of the government."
"President Mugabe has already made it known that every one of these demonstrations will be suppressed."
"It is important that we should ensure that these peaceful protests, which highlight the dreadful conditions under which the country’s people live, should be allowed to take place without harassment on the part of the police, and I would point out to the Commissioner that we should give some thought to how we, bearing in mind the structures existing in the region, might manage to send observers to guarantee the right to freely express opinions and to demonstrate."
"Mr President, Zimbabwe is an example of how the ugly side of decolonisation can prevail."
"As the previous speaker just said, there was a time when Southern Rhodesia or today’s Zimbabwe was the bread-basket of a large part of Africa."
"Today it is not even in a position to feed its own people."
"We have seen these negative sides of decolonisation in many countries, particularly African countries, where the transfer of power into the hands of irresponsible and evil political forces has resulted in the most unfortunate consequences for states that were supposed to rejoice in their freedom from colonial power."
"Instead, their own inhabitants have been condemned to perdition."
"The present proposal by the Zimbabwean leader to return farms to their former owners clearly comes too late, and fails to inspire the slightest confidence."
"I believe that we should devote all our efforts to providing humanitarian and educational aid, because I really cannot see any other way out of the situation or any other possible course of action."
"."
"Mr President, the political crisis and human rights situation in Zimbabwe is still a serious and alarming issue."
"To this we must add the deterioration in living conditions and the growing poverty."
"I would like to focus in particular, however, on a specific aspect which is also being raised and which furthermore is a topical issue that we often discuss during these urgent debates: freedom of expression."
"Just yesterday we were talking about China and lamenting the current high degree of governmental control of the media, in particular the Internet."
"It appears that Zimbabwe has taken its inspiration from the Chinese formula in drawing up its own law on the blocking of communications, and that is happening within the context of a legislative system that is already highly restrictive in terms of freedoms."
"China is a great inspiration in this regard, since, as Human Rights Watch stated in a recent report, the Chinese system of control, known as the ‘Great Firewall’, is the most advanced system of this kind in the world."
"According to the Zimbabwean law, the army, the intelligence services, the police and even the office of the President will be able to control and intercept electronic mail, listen to telephone conversations and censor the Internet, all without the need for a legal mandate."
"This would affect the relationship between doctors and their patients, for example, between lawyers and their clients and between journalists and their sources, and it would undoubtedly pose a huge risk to privacy, to NGOs and to people working to promote human rights."
"For all of these reasons, I believe that it is our duty to call for the withdrawal of that law."
"I would like, however, to make it very clear that my concern in this regard does not relate solely to Zimbabwe, nor exclusively to China."
"We must see this concern as a universal one and we must be alert, both with regard to the countries I have mentioned and, for example, with regard to the United States and the European Union itself."
"Respect for freedom of expression and the right to privacy must be fundamental elements of any modern society."
"Today we are talking about Zimbabwe but, I would emphasise, this is an issue that we must not consider solely in relation to that country."
"."
"Mr President, a grave and long-standing humanitarian, political and economic crisis sadly continues to torment this former British colony, with no sign or hope of an early improvement forthcoming."
"The inefficient and corrupt governing regime led by Robert Mugabe continues to oppress the people, and harassment of political opponents, trade union activists, farmers, human rights organisations, journalists and the judiciary is still widespread."
"We call upon the Government of Zimbabwe to start demonstrating the necessary respect of international conventions and human rights and to guarantee the independence of the judiciary."
"Furthermore, we are of the opinion that an important step towards saving the country from an even worse future is for Mr Mugabe finally to relinquish power as soon as possible."
"Such an action, facilitated by the opening of positive transitional negotiations between Zanu-PF, MDC parties and other opposition movements will, we feel, bring about the much-needed revival of the society, politics and economy of Zimbabwe and bring peace and prosperity to its people in their traumatic transition from British colonisation to independence and freedom."
". – Mr President, one thing that has remained constant in this House throughout all the years that I have been a Member of it has been the debates on Zimbabwe and its constantly worsening social, economic and political conditions."
"Appeals to Mugabe have proved no more effective than calling on his country’s neighbours – South Africa in particular – to commit themselves more to doing something about it, and the action we in the EU have taken has not made much of an impact on those it was meant to affect."
"How do things stand?"
"According to estimates, some two million people have fled to neighbouring countries, and most are living in them illegally."
"The so-called ‘Operation Restore Order’ alone had the effect of – in the truest sense of the word – uprooting 700 000 people; four million people do not have enough to eat; unemployment stands at 70%, and the inflation rate is the highest in the world."
"One effect of the forced resettlements is that the fight against AIDS is being made more difficult, with 3 200 people a week dying of it."
"There is now as much legislation on the control and oppression of the people as there was before independence."
"What can we do?"
"We can see to it that the international agencies operating on the ground on behalf of the UN give aid directly to the people wherever possible; we can ensure that the Red Cross can continue its work with the minimum of interference."
"What I want – and I say this to the Commission in particular – is for us also to give aid under the Budget heading of the European initiative for democracy and human rights to Zimbabwean civil society, to the many courageous people there, be it in the trade unions, in the human rights organisations, in the churches or in the independent media."
"Let us ask the Chinese with whom in Zimbabwe they want to have long-term dealings – with the government or with the people? – and let us take every opportunity to tell our South African partners in dialogue that they, through their failure to act, are neither making things easier for themselves nor doing the people of Zimbabwe any kind of service."
"–Mr President, in recent years we have witnessed the deterioration of the political, social and health situation in Zimbabwe."
"Mr Mugabe’s political dictatorship has gone hand in hand with social disaster in Zimbabwe. The Muramba-tsvina operation has left some 700 000 individuals homeless."
"About four million people in Zimbabwe are currently threatened by starvation and increasing numbers are being affected by AIDS."
"The result is a situation where over 3 000 people are dying every week in that country."
"Recent moves by Mr Mugabe’s regime to try and control the Red Cross are a particular cause for concern."
"At this juncture, the House should focus on the activities of trade unions in Zimbabwe, and in particular on the protests that the trade unions will be holding in the coming weeks."
"The trade unions in Zimbabwe deserve our particular support."
"."
"Mr President, the dreadful self-inflicted situation in Zimbabwe needs no reiteration in this House."
"It shows the limits of our power."
"To cut off aid would hit only the most vulnerable and yet that is the only real leverage we have in this House over the Zimbabwe regime."
"Can we find other means?"
"With regard to that I would refer to paragraph 8 of the motion for resolution, suggesting excluding Zimbabwe from the 2010 World Cup."
"I would suggest, unlike my colleagues, that it is a good idea."
"I would be grateful to hear the Commission’s views on that."
"We saw this week the fraternity and friendship that emanates from international football."
"My team – Scotland – was in Lithuania recently and I have no doubt a number of friendships were made."
"However, participation is a privilege, not a right."
"Exclusion from the 2010 World Cup would underline international disgust with Mr Mugabe’s regime without hurting the people of Zimbabwe, and yet it would be noticed throughout that football-mad country."
"It strikes me as a positive and useful idea."
"I would be grateful to hear the Commissioner’s view on it."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the harrowing state of human rights in Zimbabwe has been, as we all are aware, for some time an issue of pressing concern and this is not the first time that it has been on this House’s agenda."
"For how many years now has the Marxist dictator Mugabe been carrying on with his racist policies against his country’s white farmers?"
"He is getting away with a policy of ethnic cleansing, the principal victims of which are the overwhelming majority of Zimbabwe’s black population."
"Zimbabwe was, after all, an agricultural country at one stage, and one that was among the few south of the Sahara capable of exporting its agricultural produce."
"Mugabe, in his madness, has reduced his people to a state of misery."
"Agriculture is collapsing and famine is becoming widespread."
"It is high time for effective action to be taken against him."
"In the same way as was Liberia’s Charles Taylor, Mugabe must be treated by the international community as one who has committed crimes against humanity and must be called to account for them."
"Africa is another place where policy must not be carried on with double standards."
"Mr President, it appears that, as time goes by, the European Union is becoming more and more ineffectual where certain dictatorships are concerned."
"It is a great pity that a wonderful country like Zimbabwe has been allowed to deteriorate into its current state while, except for the few measures we have taken to combat the dictatorship of Mr Mugabe, we look on."
"We talk about what is happening and perhaps restrict the travel arrangements of the perpetrators and their immediate families, and then think we are doing something to help those who are feeling the brunt: not only the whites but also a sizeable faction of native black Zimbabweans."
"It is about time we stood up and really started to act rather than just talk."
"Mr President, our Austrian colleague is right in saying this is not the first time we are discussing Zimbabwe in this House."
"It has become something of a never-ending story, and in many respects Zimbabwe is a world record-beater with 70% unemployment, the highest rate of inflation in the world, 3 200 deaths from AIDS each week, and the lowest voter turnout in the world, namely 15%."
"Four million people in that country are threatened with starvation."
"The situation is a challenge for the whole world, including the European Union."
"I hope that this time we will go beyond mere words, and I agree with what Mr Rueda, our Spanish colleague, said recently about not applying double standards."
"By all means refer to Zimbabwe, but go further than that because fundamental human rights are also being violated in other countries and we have to constantly avoid such double standards."
"It is a good thing that the House is debating this issue again, but let us hope it is for the last time."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Commission is following events in Zimbabwe very closely and we are increasingly concerned at the deterioration of the political situation and, above all, the economic and social situation, which affects the people: civilians, citizens."
"Based on the situation that we see today, since the Zimbabwe Government has taken no suitable measures – no measures at all – to seriously address the democratic crisis, the protection of rights and the tragic economic crisis, any possible easing or lifting of the measures adopted by the EU in relation to Zimbabwe is out of the question."
"In other words, we will not discuss it at all."
"The European Union is not changing its attitude towards Zimbabwe, and its firm stance has recently been reasserted by my colleague Louis Michel in his contacts with the government authorities in Zimbabwe."
"He emphasised that the Commission remains absolutely committed to playing an active role in trying to break the stalemate."
"At the same time, we cannot waive any of the conditions that we have imposed, especially the resumption of democratic rules for the citizens’ daily lives."
"What was said confirms our concerns."
"I listened carefully and with great interest to the idea of excluding Zimbabwe from the football World Cup in 2010."
"You all know that a similar decision is being adopted by FIFA but, having said that, I personally think it is an idea worth taking seriously and discussing with the Member States and the International Federation."
"I cannot say today whether the outcome will be what certain Members here are hoping, but I can say that I shall inform my fellow Commissioners Louis Michel and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner of this idea: the matter deserves to be taken very seriously."
"There is certainly another aspect: as I said earlier, Europe hopes that Zimbabwe will return to a path of restoring the conditions for democratic life and economic progress."
"We are of course ready to point out certain routes to follow, in the context of the priorities of the 10th European Development Fund programme, for instance, within which there are specific possibilities, but we must not fail at this point to impose a very clear condition on Zimbabwe: unless it seriously embarks on the road to democracy, we cannot alter our firm stance."
"At the same time, the Commission is maintaining a very close dialogue with Zimbabwe’s neighbours, particularly the members of the Southern African Development Community and the South African Government."
"I agree with what I have heard: we shall be increasingly active in calling on these neighbouring countries to do even more."
"We support the United Nations initiatives and, in my view, it is very important for respected African Heads of State or Government to put pressure on the Zimbabwe Government to improve the political and humanitarian situation at last and to pave the way for national reconciliation."
"In the meantime, we are worried about the people."
"Obviously, while our attitude towards the Zimbabwe Government is one of absolute firmness, we need to worry about providing direct assistance to the people, who are not to blame for a regime that deprives them of their freedom and also of their livelihoods."
"I can confirm that Louis Michel intends to continue supporting and also funding projects concerning socio-economic sectors, medical assistance and the role of organisations on the ground."
"I would point out that the role of the Red Cross must certainly be facilitated and encouraged, as must projects promoting governance, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"In our opinion, direct assistance to the people of Zimbabwe needs to continue in all these areas."
"– The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place immediately."
"– The next item is voting time."
"Mr President, I would like to move a substitute wording, namely:"
"To replace ‘commission to inquire into recent killings, disappearances and abductions’ by the correct wording ‘independent group of eminent persons as observers of investigations into abductions, disappearances and extrajudicial killings’."
"I believe that is the correct technical term that should be used at this point."
"– I believe that the text expresses it wrongly when it says: ‘delete two times the words ’."
"This is actually no more than an editorial amendment."
"Mr President, I should like to change the last phrase of our amendment to read as follows: 'Consideration can be given to lifting proscription if there is an effective cease-fire, an end to terrorism and resumption of serious negotiations on a constructive basis.'"
"That would replace the last phrase that appears in the amendment at the moment."
"Mr President, this is a technical amendment."
"I am advised that the final part of Amendment 5, which refers to the fact that ‘… Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner shares this concern’ would read better as ‘… this is a view shared by many international bodies’."
"– Mr President, it has just come to my notice that, although the Chairman of the Executive Council of the African Union – in other words, the executive or governmental side – is listed among those to whom the resolution on Zimbabwe is addressed, we have omitted to include the Pan-African Parliament among them."
"Since we are currently seeking to establish contact with them, I would like to move an oral amendment to the effect that the Pan-African Parliament be added to the list."
"– That concludes voting time."
"– I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 7 September 2006."
"The final version of the draft agenda for the current part-session, as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of Thursday 21 September 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed."
"The following proposed amendments to that agenda have been submitted:"
"The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has asked for the addition of a Commission statement on the implementation of food safety legislation (meat in poor condition)."
"Mr Cohn-Bendit has the floor in order to explain this request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Mr President, we have taken on board one idea from among your proposed reforms, that being that this House should be more up-to-date, and should not wait to discuss certain events as late as four years after they happen."
"One of them is summed up in Germany by the term ‘old meat’, referring to the fact that meat no longer fit for consumption was found in various German regions and now in other countries too, and we would very much like to hear, from both the Commission and the Council, what is actually being done to check that the same thing is not going on all over Europe."
"This appears to be something that becomes so widespread so fast that the authorities responsible for dealing with it cannot even begin to get to the bottom of it."
"Secondly, we have to deal with the very disturbing fact that genetically modified rice has been found all over Europe, even though it is prohibited."
"We would like to hear from the Commission what it is doing about this, too, and not have to wait a few months before being able to debate what it is going to do in three or four years’ time."
"We want to know what is being done right now to deal with these two disgraceful occurrences, and that is why we have tabled a written question and want a statement from the Commission and the Council that we can discuss – here in this House, during this part-session here in Strasbourg."
"Mr President, we share Mr Cohn-Bendit’s concern about what I understand is called It is a serious issue."
"It occurred in Bavaria; there was clearly a breach of the regulations in Germany, and we clearly need to hear from Germany what has been done."
"The reason it becomes a European issue is because a little bit of that crossed the border into Austria and Switzerland."
"That is something that should be looked at."
"I suggest we look at it in the Environment Committee and then take the matter further from there, rather than taking up time in the plenary during what is an exceptionally busy week here in Strasbourg."
"The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament have requested that the debate following the Commission statement on the ASEM Summit end without a vote on a resolution."
"Mr Swoboda has the floor in order to explain this request by the PPE-DE and PSE Groups."
"."
"Mr President, as we know, the ASEM meeting has already taken place, and the fact that it was preceded by a meeting of parliamentarians means that they have already had a chance to say what they think about this process."
"All that is needed now is for us to be informed about the results, so there is little point in drafting an additional resolution, and I move that we refrain from doing so."
"Mr President, I do not always agree with Mr Swoboda, but, on this occasion, he has got it right, and so we should agree to what he suggests."
"Mr President, I oppose this proposal for two reasons."
"Firstly, why would we not say something about ASEM?"
"For the first time in years, there has been a successful ASEM Summit."
"We used to complain about things going wrong but, finally, we have done something well."
"Let us speak out about the improvement in economic ties with Asia."
"It is an important issue and it gives us the opportunity to discuss the promotion of democracy and speak out against the continued use of capital punishment in Asian countries."
"There is another reason."
"This is our only opportunity this week to speak out about the military coup in Thailand."
"That event should be on all our minds."
"A military coup is the wrong way to get rid of even such an unsavoury character as Prime Minister Thaksin: it is not the way to go about it, and this Parliament cannot remain silent."
"We have to speak out on this issue, whether it is you as President, the Conference of Presidents or, preferably, this House as a whole."
"I therefore oppose having the debate without a resolution."
"The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"I shall remind you that I shall give priority to those Members who have not spoken during the last two sittings."
"With regard to the long-term solution of the border issue between Croatia and Slovenia, I welcome the latest news from Brussels to the effect that Mr Solana, the EU High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and Commissioner Rehn will intervene to help resolve outstanding border disputes between the two countries."
"My view is that the European framework will make possible an easier and more efficient resolution because of the participation of the two countries in the European integration process."
"Slovenia supports the integration of our neighbour Croatia into the European Union, but, at the same time, the people of Slovenia expect the Government of Croatia, as well as its citizens, to adhere more closely to the agreements entered into by the two countries."
"It is unacceptable that Croatia should be building bridges and roads in a region where the international border has not yet been settled with finality, without such arrangements being subject to a prior agreement between the countries."
"Likewise, it is unacceptable that Croatia should encroach on land owned by Slovene nationals without obtaining any permission whatsoever from the owners."
"Mr President, the EU Presidency’s Health in all Policies conference took place a week ago."
"Its main theme was that public health can be promoted through political decision-making in all areas of life, and not just in the health sector."
"This is all the more true given that it is hard for national economies to postpone addressing health problems until they involve diseases for which they need to start finding cures."
"This week, we are voting on reports on improving the ambient air quality."
"This is just the sort of preventive health work that needs to be undertaken in all policy areas."
"Our decisions in matters of transport, trade and industry policy, the environment, social planning and social policy always have an impact on public health."
"It is always best to invest in areas where health hazards can be averted."
"The European Union has a mandate under the Treaty to work towards this objective in all policy areas."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this Saturday Toomas Hendrik Ilves, a member of our faction and Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, was elected President of the Republic of Estonia by the electoral body."
"According to public opinion, Ilves was the overwhelming favourite of the Estonian population in the contest with the sitting president, but nevertheless the elections were close, due to the regulations of the electoral body."
"Both the media and the Estonian people feared that political manipulation, and not the popular will, would prevail."
"On Saturday, thousands of Estonians, myself included, gathered in the centre of the capital, Tallinn."
"Just as we did during the period of the restoration of Estonian independence at the end of the 1980s, we used music to express our support for Toomas Ilves as the representative of democracy."
"I am very glad to be able to congratulate both Estonia and Europe."
"The electoral body’s decision corresponded to the expectations of the democratic majority of our society, and after the Estonian presidential elections that took place on 23 September, I can confirm that European democracy is alive and well in Estonia."
"I would also like to wish my good colleague and friend Toomas Ilves luck in his new position and in promoting more of Europe in Estonia and more Estonian ideas here."
"Mr President, it is only right that this community of states should set itself the lofty goal of having the same environmental legislation and standards right across Europe, but are we seeking to achieve it by offloading our problems on Africa or Asia wherever possible?"
"There are media reports of how a Dutch firm’s inappropriate disposal of toxic mud off the Ivory Coast has put lives at risk, and that I regard as a scandal."
"The Netherlands has been an EU Member State for many years, and I wonder whether it knew this stuff was being exported, whether approval for this was given, and, if it was, then subject to what conditions?"
"What action has been taken as a consequence of this?"
"Have the victims been compensated and long-term damage prevented?"
"Mr President, exactly two weeks ago I had the opportunity of visiting South Ossetia as part of a European Parliament delegation."
"It appears that in this troubled area of the South Caucasus there are at least 10 confrontations every day involving the use of firearms."
"The peace-keeping forces deployed there by Russia were supposed to guarantee peace for the local people and indeed for the whole of that area of the South Caucasus."
"According to the information provided to us by the Finnish head of the OSCE detachment, Major Lehtonen, the Russian peace-keeping forces are not, however, taking any steps to identify the underlying causes of these confrontations and if necessary pursue the individuals who are provoking them."
"I would therefore like to draw the attention of this House to the fact that it is unacceptable to allow such an important part of our continent to remain under the sole control of a single military peace-keeping force."
"We should strive to ensure that in future the European Union has greater influence over how the situation in South Ossetia is controlled."
"() Speaking before the European Parliament, I would also like to voice my criticism concerning the announcement that the deadline for new Member States to join the Schengen area has been put back to 2009."
"At a time when technological advances occur at break-neck speed, the general public has reacted with surprise and great disappointment to the European Commission’s statement that the delay is due to technical problems related to the development and deployment of the SIS II database."
"The Schengen Treaty is a visible and tangible embodiment of the freedom of movement of persons and goods across the entire European Union; unfortunately, we are only paying lip service to this freedom."
"Therefore, I regard as unfair a situation where citizens of new EU Member States will have to wait beyond the end of the 2007 in order to travel without border checks."
"I call on the European Commission to consider any and all options that would enable the original deadline to be met or, alternatively, pending the deployment of the new system, to allow the new Member States to be temporarily linked to the current system, SIS I plus."
"Positive steps taken by the European Commission to meet the original deadline would help to strengthen the public’s faith in the European project as a whole."
"– I wish to speak on a similar matter."
"As has already been mentioned, some disturbing news has emerged from the Commission in recent days."
"A spokesperson for the Internal Affairs Commissioner has suggested that, for a number of technical and legal reasons, the second phase of the Schengen System is not ready."
"This is a system that should be, or should have been, launched in the autumn of next year."
"This is disturbing news for the whole of Europe, and also for the new Member States, which have invested a great deal of effort and money in order to be ready for next autumn."
"I should therefore like to call on the Commission to inform this House as to the technical and legal difficulties that have arisen, and who is responsible for this situation, because the preparations have thus far gone according to plan."
"Once I know what the problem is, I should also like to know who is responsible for the situation."
"– ) Mr President, I should like to relate an event that happened on 7 September."
"Last week I was in Romania in connection with an attack by police and hooded commandos against members of the local Roma community in Reghin (Szászrégen), which is in the district of Apalina."
"Thirty-seven people were shot and injured by plastic bullets."
"The county chief of police reported that only six people were injured in the incident, and that they suffered wounds that would heal within eight days."
"I personally witnessed that these statements were false."
"I met a man who had been hit by seventeen bullets, five of which had been successfully removed within eight days, while the other twelve are, to this date, embedded in him."
"Since January, this has been the fourth such highly worrisome incident in Romania."
"I bring this fact to the attention of Parliament, because, on 26 September we will have the last country report on the table."
"I should like to call upon Commissioner Olli Rehn to do everything possible in order to change the situation."
"Mr President, last week a tape was leaked, on which the Hungarian Prime Minister said: ‘We lied to the people for 18 months – in the morning, in the evening and at night, about the economy, and we lied to win the elections.’"
"It was followed by street demonstrations with tens of thousands of people all over Hungary calling for him to resign."
"The PPE-DE Group also called upon the Prime Minister to resign."
"However, European socialist and liberal parties backed their discredited friend."
"Dear colleagues, that was a shame!"
"Fortunately several socialists took an opposite stand, also demanding his resignation, among them Ségolène Royal."
"Here I call on our socialist and liberal colleagues to change their position."
"Systematic lying to citizens cannot be the European way in politics."
"I hope we all agree on that."
"The leaked tape included a reference by the Minister for Finance saying that the European Commissioner, Mr Almunia, helped his socialist comrades in Budapest to delay the issuance of the real data."
"I call on the Commissioner to make clear his responsibility in the matter."
"I also call for the resignation of the anti-democratic Prime Minister of Hungary."
"I express our solidarity with the demonstrators all over Hungary."
"I am wearing a white shirt to express my solidarity with and protest against lies and violence."
"– Mr President, in some European Union countries we are witnessing new forms of right-wing extremism that are of great concern to all democrats."
"Ideological fanaticism, intolerance and hatred are not new, but what is new is that they are finding shelter within broad-based, moderate parties."
"So long as the far right has remained outside our parliaments or has been poorly represented, we have been able to fight it, but now it is more difficult."
"It affects both parties in power and opposition parties."
"We are seeing the re-emergence of forms of racism, xenophobia, machismo and homophobia, which suggests that the democratic gains made by the European Union are in retreat."
"Rather than talk about other countries, I shall refer just to my own, where the situation is not as serious as it is elsewhere."
"The main opposition party in Spain has been unable to accept its defeat in the 2004 election and has embarked on a dangerous journey towards extremism. Manipulative and mendacious, it is attacking not just the Government but, more seriously, the institutions of the rule of law, as well as the courts and the state security agencies and forces."
"Mr President, the partition of Ireland has been a complete and abject failure, socially, economically and politically."
"The European Union, it is said, is based on peace, reconciliation and the removal of borders."
"In order to further the stated objective, the EU has a responsibility to assist in the development of an all-Ireland economy as a step towards Irish reunification."
"My party, Sinn Féin, is launching a comprehensive document entitled ‘EU support for Irish reunification’, outlining the practical measures we believe the Union can take to help bring about Irish unity."
"Over the coming weeks and months, Sinn Féin will be promoting this policy throughout Ireland and across the EU, beginning with the conference at the European Parliament in Brussels on 18 October."
"Mr President, the separatist formation of Transnistria recently conducted a self-styled referendum to approve the idea of of this part of Moldova into the Russian Federation."
"Described as a bandit land, Transnistria continues to be a dangerous hub of arms smuggling and black-marketeering."
"It is also known as a living Soviet museum, with the continued cult of Lenin and Stalin."
"All this is possible because of the continued presence there of Russian troops in gross violation of Moscow’s ten-year-old commitment to pull them out."
"Sadly, this is but one example of Russia’s attempts to retain its military presence beyond its borders."
"I call on the Commission not to limit itself to expressions of concern but to make the evacuation of Russian troops and Moscow’s respect for the integrity of neighbouring states a credibility test for the new PCA."
"Mr President, Mr Szájer has called on the Socialist Group in this House to take a position on what has been going on in Budapest and on the statements made by the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Gyurcsány."
"It is for each and every member of the Hungarian Parliament and of this House to decide for himself or herself whether or not Mr Gyurcsány did the right thing."
"Speaking personally, I prefer politicians who summon up the courage to utter unpopular truths to those who want to carry on papering over things that need to be brought out into the open, so I think one can think what one will about Mr Gyurcsány, but it nevertheless has to be said that he had the courage to say things that others – including you, Mr Szájer – evidently do not want to say."
"You can wear a white shirt if you like; it looks good on you, too, but perhaps you should also tell us whether you are a friend of those who burned a European flag in front of the Hungarian Parliament building."
"If you are, then this House is not the place for you."
"– Mr President, this September sees the 250th anniversary of the Douro wine region in Portugal, Europe's first wine region to be created and regulated."
"This anniversary is particularly relevant at a time when the Commission is preparing further reform of the common organisation of the market in wine, with a view to gradually dismantling it."
"Wine production in the United States, South Africa and wherever else must not be called port wine."
"It is appalling to destroy a regulation that has been in existence for 250 years."
"The quality of port wine is the result of all of the know-how accumulated by the people of the Douro, who, with the aid of a particular climate and sunshine, have, over the course of 250 years on the banks of the River Douro, where this ancient regulated wine region is located, built up a rich heritage that has been recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we therefore ask for your help to preserve and promote this important cultural heritage of winemaking."
"Mr President, I too would like to refer to the environmental disaster that took place on the night of 19 to 20 August of this year, when a Greek vessel chartered by Dutch nationals discharged 400 tons of refinery waste."
"As a result, 11 areas of the region concerned have been polluted, hundreds of thousands of people are in hospital and 7 have died."
"According to the UN, no firm registered in Europe should export toxic material to Africa, yet this does often happen."
"The incident in question is particularly dramatic, and utterly scandalous, as it took place in a densely-populated area."
"The European Parliament donates a great deal of money to Africa."
"We send it billions of euro, on top of which we now have to provide humanitarian aid."
"Every human being has the right to clean water and clean air, and that is why more immigrants will be arriving."
"I must set the record straight concerning the rumours and misrepresentations circulated here on 5 September by Hungarian MEPs as part of an anti-Slovak campaign."
"They alleged that a woman had been mugged in Slovakia for speaking Hungarian while making a phone call."
"However, an inquiry has concluded that no such thing happened."
"The allegations about derogatory slogans being chanted at sports events were also built on shaky ground, as the slogan ‘Death to Hungarians’ had been put up as a provocation by an individual of ethnic Hungarian origin."
"The accusations about losses sustained by 800 000 Roma were not true either, and the number quoted was overstated tenfold."
"I resolutely deny the allegations that the government of the Slovak Republic supports the suppression of ethnic minority rights, as the facts show the very opposite."
"To put it bluntly, this is a typical case of setting a thief to catch a thief."
"Sadly, the anti-Czechoslovak exhibition staged in Brussels by Hungarian MEPs also misrepresented the facts."
"This is a shame."
"Mr President, in its Europe 2006 report the Federal Government of Switzerland published a cost-benefit analysis of possible membership of the European Union."
"It examined three alternatives: to continue the current set of bilateral sector-specific arrangements, to join the European Economic Area, or to become a full member of the EU."
"The Swiss calculated that full EU membership would cost between six and nine times as much as the current system of bilateral trading arrangements."
"They decided that the resulting loss of sovereignty and freedom of action and the negative economic effects would far outweigh any supposed benefits."
"The report concludes that Switzerland’s interests are best served by staying out of the EU and continuing with its existing sector-specific trading arrangements."
"It is good to know that there is still at least one European government that understands the meaning of the words ‘in the national interest’, even if it is not the British Government."
"I had intended to talk about Schengen but my colleagues have already raised this matter."
"I should, however, like to comment on the question of just who it is that has shown courage in the crisis in Hungary."
"The Hungarian Prime Minister did not personally address the public about the extent of the lies, but he has admitted that he discussed the issue within his most immediate circles."
"It is the person who blew the whistle on the problem that showed courage, and I think that we, as Members of the European Parliament, have to be very clear about that."
"– Mr President, I believe that the European Parliament should urgently call on the Commission and the Council to readjust our immigration policy in the light of the humanitarian disaster that is being caused by the arrival of immigrants from Africa."
"The problem must not be simplified or trivialised, as it was by the German representative last week at the Council of Interior Ministers, when he had the audacity to say that Spain was not going to sink because of 20 000 or 25 000 men arriving in the Canaries."
"That is not the problem."
"The issue must not be simplified or trivialised; it has to be examined in depth."
"The European Union must react by readjusting this immigration policy and dealing with the underlying problem, which is the lack of active cooperation in order to create jobs and stability within Africa, on the continent of Africa."
"The example of Switzerland, although it is not part of the European Union, cannot help us, either."
"It is not a matter of jeopardising asylum applications; it is not a matter of being like Switzerland and making things much easier for financial transactions or bank deposits than for people."
"That is not the right path, either."
"I believe the right path is for the European Union to adopt a clear, humanitarian stance and to provide a humanitarian and ‘civilising’ solution to this extremely serious problem of immigration."
"– Mr President, our petitions to the European Parliament often concern charges, complaints of procedural shortcomings in services, political protests and referrals to topical matters."
"Allow me today to refer to a unique act of humanity and sensitivity: I refer to a decision by the renowned Catalonian football team of Barcelona which, from this year for the first time, is sporting the UNICEF emblem on its shirts instead of an official commercial sponsor, thereby losing several million euros."
"With the consent of Barcelona's shareholders and the United Nations, UNICEF and its work will be promoted by the Spanish club for five years, with all the money collected over that period used for humanitarian aid for suffering nations, mainly in Africa."
"Sport is not therefore just a spectacle, entertainment worth billions of euros; it is at the same time also something which fights racism, hooliganism and xenophobia and develops actions of sensitivity and humanitarian aid."
"As demonstrated in practice, sport accompanied by other social or cultural action can unite people, just as we are doing today in the European Parliament."
"Mr President, I am charged with handing over to you about 100 000 protests by Poles from Poland and across the world."
"We are all outraged by the shameful European Parliament resolution vilifying Poland, the Polish people and the much-loved Catholic radio station with millions of listeners, and making allegations of anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism against us."
"The resolution was intended to tarnish my country’s honour, and is already being used for that purpose."
"Attempts have been made to exert pressure on the European Union to interfere in Poland’s internal affairs."
"Parliament’s response to these protests will serve as an indicator of the value it places on democracy and tolerance."
"It will also reveal whether truth can prevail in this House, or if Parliament will simply become a breeding ground for lies."
"We shall appeal against this resolution at the European Court of Justice."
"Three hundred and one Members voted in favour of the resolution, yet we are unaware of any facts that would substantiate the claims it makes."
"I believe those who supported the resolution base their views on Poland and its people on information drawn from the liberal media, which are hostile to our cause."
"The Members concerned have never listened to , nonetheless they voted in favour of a document bearing no relation to truth or reality."
"These signatures therefore constitute a protest."
"Mr President, it is unfortunate that Mr Schulz is no longer here, but you can tell him that he has been misinformed."
"For a start, as Mr Peterle has already said, Mr Gyurcsány does not have the courage to stand up in the Hungarian Parliament and admit to the public that he lied day and night for a period of years."
"Secondly, no European flags have been burned in Hungary, and I call on Mr Tabajdi of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament to confirm that."
"Here, in this European Parliament, we should tell the truth and nothing but the truth."
"Mr President, when you were in Poland you expressed regret at the lack of contact between the institutions of Europe and its citizens."
"You now have a unique opportunity to remedy the situation."
"We are today handing over to you the votes of some 100 000 people, concerned about the activities of this House."
"The signatories include Solidarity members, private individuals, organisations, local authorities and academic institutions."
"Some of them are from outside Europe."
"They are all anxious about how Europe is developing and await your response."
"They expect the European Parliament to apologise for the unfair and unfounded attack on Poland and the Catholic radio station in the resolution adopted on 15 June."
"This document brought Parliament into disrepute."
"The future of Europe cannot be built on a foundation of lies."
"The history of the Polish nation and state is a model of coexistence with other nations and religions. is an example of mankind’s commitment to truth."
"It teaches us mutual love and respect."
"It is a radio station which is concerned with human affairs and brings us closer to God."
"It provides the kind of spiritual guidance that Europe so badly needs."
"() At the previous session, certain Members described Slovakia as a country of extremism and intolerance, which persecutes citizens from the Hungarian ethnic minority."
"They were referring to an alleged vicious assault and described Slovakia’s government as one that promotes the suppression of ethnic minority rights."
"Those words were reckless and not based on facts."
"A police inquiry has demonstrated that the incidents so broadly publicised by the media and politicians either had not happened at all or had not been driven by nationalistic or ethnic sentiment."
"The Slovak Government has reiterated and demonstrated that it will not tolerate manifestations of xenophobia, racism and intolerance, and is prepared to take all necessary steps to prevent any such actions."
"I would like to call on everyone to use their words thoughtfully."
"Misrepresentations and misunderstanding may cause unnecessary tensions, and I trust this is something that no one wants."
"People living in Slovakia’s ethnically mixed regions are often confused and do not understand what kind of tensions politicians and the media are talking about."
"Mr President, according to information provided by the human rights and democracy centre in Hong Kong, 200 people are still imprisoned in China because they took part in the demonstration in the Square of Heavenly Peace in 1989, seventeen years ago."
"Those young people who demonstrated entirely peacefully at the time are now prematurely aged, ground down as a result of the terrible conditions prevailing in Chinese prisons."
"I refer of course to those who survived."
"We should recall that the Chinese regime applied the death penalty to many of the protesters."
"It is estimated that 15 000 people were sentenced at the time."
"Every now and then we call this fact to mind, but on the whole we tend to ignore it."
"I hope my words today will raise awareness of it once again."
"We cannot bring back those who laid down their lives for the right to express their opinions, but we can do something for the 200 who are still languishing in Chinese jails."
"We must not be indifferent to their plight."
"They are pinning their hopes on us because they have nobody else to turn to."
"Mr President, the assumption is that donations to organisations working for the public good will help the needy."
"Unfortunately, Community VAT legislation currently in place in Poland is actually serving as an effective deterrent to potential donors."
"There has been a steady decline in the number of donors since the act on VAT was amended to bring Polish legislation into line with Community provisions."
"In the past, a taxpayer who made goods over to the needy free of charge had to calculate the tax due on their actual value."
"Now, however, he or she has to calculate the tax due on the purchase price."
"As a result, someone who makes a gift of a computer that is several years old has to pay the same amount of tax as if it were new, even though donated goods are worth much less when they are passed on than the price on the original invoice for their purchase."
"Indeed, it is often the case that the market price one could get for these goods is less than the tax that has to be paid when they are gifted."
"The decision to tax gifts runs counter to the very notion of helping the needy."
"Often absurd situations arise, when people prefer to throw out food or items that are still usable rather than give them to the needy, because it is cheaper and safer to do so, and saves trouble with the Inland Revenue."
"If this repressive legislation is not amended and the state continues to penalise donors for their generosity, we shall witness growing indifference towards the most needy."
"Mr President, I want to highlight what happened last week during the visit of the Agriculture Commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, to the constituency I represent in the European Parliament."
"I was not aware that the Commissioner was there on Thursday, but I heard of her visit Friday morning on local radio."
"Immediately I contacted the Commission Office in Dublin asking for some information about her itinerary."
"I thought that a bit of joined-up thinking and working at European level would be beneficial, naive as I was."
"The Commission Office in Dublin said that it could give me no information."
"After five phone calls to the Commissioner’s own office, I was told on Friday afternoon that even though this was a public visit, the information was private and unavailable."
"I had to wait until Saturday to read details of her visit in a national newspaper."
"So what was private on Friday was public on Saturday."
"I was astounded."
"I could not believe that the public itinerary of a European Commissioner on a visit to Ireland could be classified as private."
"Is that what Plan D is about?"
"Is that dialogue?"
"Is this the same Commission that encourages us to inform citizens about the proposed Constitution?"
"Finally, as a first-time MEP, maybe I have it wrong."
"Maybe that is how the EU does its business."
"If it is, it is no wonder that citizens say no."
"If it is not, I would ask you to use your good offices to find out why a Commissioner has effectively cut the lines of communication with individual MEPs."
"Mr President, one of the many gifts the British Empire gave to the world was the global abolition of slavery."
"It has come to my notice, via my constituents in Yorkshire, that the practice continues in Cyprus, the people of which country never cease to lecture us on the foibles of the Turks when it comes to human rights."
"It is called indentured labour."
"Philippine and Singhalese female domestic staff are treated appallingly: their passports are basically confiscated by their employers."
"I have given full details of the matter in a parliamentary question."
"Indentured labour by any other term is a form of slavery."
"It exists in the European Union and it is disgraceful."
"Let us please hear less humbug from the Cypriot representatives and let us see them put their own house in order."
"Enough of this indentured labour!"
"It is a disgrace!"
"Mr President, Hungary, like the other 24 Member States of Europe, is a democracy."
"Pursuant to the rule of law, we changed our Government after the parliamentary elections in April."
"On 1 October, we will have municipal elections in which we will elect the mayors in the municipalities."
"Therefore, those who have demonstrated on the streets against the Government and in favour of a change of government are working against the Hungarian constitution and against the rule of law."
"We are closer today to knowing who these people are who are playing with fire in this way."
"Once again, Hungary should abide by the rule of law and follow democratic rules."
"Mr President, I feel bound to raise an issue that ought not to be a concern for the European Union in the 21st century."
"I refer to the worrying surge of neo-Nazism and fascism in Germany."
"This represents a threat to Poland and the Czech Republic."
"Future relationships within the European Community are also under threat."
"The results of elections in the German states of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania were declared a few days ago."
"The German National Democratic Party gained over 7% of the vote."
"This means that the NDP will be represented in yet another state."
"Members of this group have expressed alarming views."
"They dispute the Polish-German border, and call for the creation of a IVth Reich."
"They consider Hitler to have been a prodigy, and Hess a pure idealist."
"They deny the Holocaust and spread Nazi-inspired prejudices about foreigners."
"How can it be possible for parties of this ilk to operate legally in Member States of the Union like Germany, spreading hatred, xenophobia, racism and anti-Semitism?"
"Last year the NPD received a subsidy of more than EUR 1 million from the state coffers."
"That is scandalous."
"The Union must introduce a clear ban on the activities of such groupings."
"I appeal to Members of this House to move a joint resolution condemning the German political system in which there is still scope for neo-Nazism."
"I apologise to all those Members who have been unable to take the floor, but we have considerably overrun the time allocated to this item."
"Mr President, I would just like to make one comment."
"What the Members present are saying is of course all very interesting, and the banners they have brought with them are very eye-catching, but I have made five unsuccessful attempts already at getting permission to speak."
"Perhaps it might be worth considering the possibility of giving other Members the floor in the right order."
"I am sorry that I cannot give everybody the floor."
"Please accept my apologies."
"I have taken good note of your request."
"You will be the first to speak in the next sitting."
"There are other Members who have systematically spoken in the last two sittings and I have already warned them that I am trying to give priority to those who have not spoken in the previous sittings."
"Mr President, if a Member makes a vicious attack on a colleague’s country, then I think a representative of that country should be given the opportunity to answer back."
"I am referring to the attack by a British colleague on the Cyprus Government."
"I would like to remind him that Britain maintains its colonisation of my country, Cyprus, to this day."
"Thank you. You too will have a chance to present your views on this during the next sitting."
"I have taken note that you have not been able to do so today."
"Thank you, everyone, and please accept my apologies."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"– the report (A6–0234/2006) by Mr Krahmer, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (COM(2005)0447 – C6–0356/2005 – 2005/0183/(COD)); and"
"– the report (A6–0235/2006) by Mrs Corbey, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the thematic strategy on air pollution (2006/2060 (INI))."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking the two rapporteurs, Mrs Corbey, the rapporteur on the thematic strategy on air pollution, and Mr Krahmer, the rapporteur on the proposal for a directive on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, and congratulating them on their exceptional and diligent work."
"I should also like to extend my especial thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for its efforts so far."
"Air pollution is and will remain one of the most important public health problems."
"As a result of air pollution, life expectancy in the European Union today has fallen by 8.5 months."
"The quality of life of hundreds of thousands of people is reduced every day and the natural environment is in danger, despite the significant reductions in emissions achieved over recent years."
"We need to step up our efforts."
"The strategy we propose defines the steps we need to make in this direction."
"It lays down new, unprecedented targets for health and the environment."
"The measures on small suspended particles will bring about a reduction in forecasts of premature deaths from approximately 350 000 today to 160 000 in 2020."
"That will be the outcome of the combined application of the strategy and other measures already agreed."
"As far as the natural environment is concerned, we expect the size of ecosystems at risk of acidification to fall by over 50% and the size of ecosystems at risk due to the presence of excessive nitrogen levels to fall by over 30%."
"These are ambitious targets, the achievement of which will bring exponential environmental benefits."
"The strategy will of course have to be applied effectively."
"The Commission has promised to propose measures at European Union level to improve ambient air."
"This will also address the problem of cross-border pollution."
"The strategy on air describes some of the related Community measures."
"The Commission has already tabled a proposal to reduce emissions from passenger cars and vans, often referred to as the Euro V proposal, and the Committee on the Environment recently approved its draft report."
"A Euro VI proposal is expected for cars and vans."
"Other Euro VI proposals will also be tabled for lorries and buses and the directive on national upper emission limits will also be reviewed, setting new emission limits for the Member States."
"Other measures for small-scale combustion and farming will follow when the time is right."
"All these measures are currently being prepared and will of course be evaluated in detail in accordance with the principles of better lawmaking."
"One of the main elements of the strategy is the proposed review of current legislation on ambient air quality."
"The proposal maintains the current limit values for air quality."
"The official statistics of the World Health Organisation clearly confirm that these limit values are needed."
"The proposal introduces for the first time binding limits for small thin particles known as PM2.5, in other words particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 millionths of a metre."
"Scientists unanimously maintain that these particles have serious repercussions on public health."
"Maximum permissible concentration limits are proposed for entry into force in 2010."
"The proposal will, at the same time, require the Member States to start monitoring these thin particles carefully in all European countries."
"Measures will also be taken with a view to reducing the average levels of exposure to micro particles of the population."
"Approval of these measures must not be delayed."
"The repercussions on health are extremely serious and the data are incontrovertible."
"In the United States, PM2.5 targets have applied since 1995."
"The statistics included in the study on the repercussions of this proposal prove that the approach we propose of reducing exposure to micro particles will benefit more people at a lower cost that the lower PM2.5 limit proposed by Parliament."
"The Commission proposal also gives the Member States greater flexibility as far as their compliance with current limit values for air quality is concerned."
"Uncontrolled emissions from natural sources are not included in the figures."
"A longer deadline will also be granted in cases where the Member States face acute compliance problems."
"These extensions must be as short as possible, in order to protect the health of our fellow citizens and not penalise the Member States which have made serious and credible efforts to comply."
"I shall comment very briefly on some of the basic amendments proposed by Parliament: as regards the possibility of extending deadlines, the Commission proposes an additional five years from the date on which the limit values enter into force, in other words no later than the end of 2009, in conjunction with the facility to exclude emissions from natural sources."
"With these arrangements, the Member States will clearly be in a position to comply with the directive."
"The Committee on the Environment has proposed two five-year periods from the date on which the new directive enters into force."
"Under this proposal, compliance will be delayed to 2018 for limit values already agreed in 1999."
"This cannot be accepted."
"The new amendment tabled before this plenary, Amendment 81, is a move in the right direction, but again cannot be accepted because, if we accept four plus two years from the entry into force of the new directive, this will delay compliance until 2013 for the limit values for PM10 already agreed in 1999."
"In other words, the Member States already recognised these limits back in 1999."
"Under the decision by the Council and Parliament on the Sixth Environment Action Programme, the Commission asked experts from the World Health Organisation to advise if the limit values which currently apply for air quality need to be changed."
"They replied that they did not."
"The Commission cannot, therefore, accept any watering down of the daily limit value for PM10."
"Amendments 46 and 81 increase the number of days on which this value may be exceeded from 35 to 55."
"If these amendments were to be accepted, then according to the statistics for 2004, there would no longer be any need for measures to combat air pollution in cities such as Vienna, Frankfurt, Bonn, Stuttgart and others."
"The basic question is: how can we best serve the health of our citizens?"
"By watering down the daily limit value or by taking measures to combat the problem of pollution?"
"The amendment watering down the limit values likewise cannot be accepted, unless it is preceded by new Community measures to reduce pollution."
"It conflicts with the right of initiative of the institutions."
"It is also impracticable, because it is impossible to predict the results of measures which have not yet been proposed and, in this case, would undermine the right of the citizens to clean air."
"I think I must stop here."
". – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the European People’s Party and Socialist Groups, Mrs Weisgerber and Mrs Corbey, for their cooperation, but I also want to thank the Commission and both the Austrian and Finnish Presidencies of the Council for their openness and willingness to engage in dialogue."
"That there is not always complete agreement about everything, whether within this House or between one institution and another, should become the norm in European democracy, for what really matters is that we, although we approach it from different angles and with different priorities, should have one single end in mind, that being that air quality in Europe should be improved."
"That many respiratory diseases and the consequences resulting from them are attributable to high levels of air pollution, particularly in densely-populated areas and conurbations in the EU, is not disputed."
"Polluted air takes no account of borders, and so improving the quality of our ambient air remains a major challenge."
"The problem of air pollution can only be solved in the long term and in a European framework, particularly by stepping up cross-border measures."
"In order for the ambitious goals to be achieved, further instruments will be needed in the Community in future: clean air in the Member States can only be achieved if the directives which are in force are transposed consistently and if new EU legislative proposals concentrate on restricting emissions at the point where polluters cause them."
"While there is justifiable concern about the state of ambient air in Europe, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that air quality in Europe has, over the past decades, been improved as a result of stringent legal regulation and technical advances."
"Prior to the July vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and looking forward to the vote we are about to take in this plenary, all three of the main groups in this House negotiated a package of compromise amendments, which can be summed up as aiming for, on the one hand, ambitious limit and target values, with, on the other, greater flexibility and consideration of the difficulties that individual Member States face with the transposition of the current directive."
"Let me briefly sketch out the essential points."
"I will start with PM10. There is a large degree of consensus in this House about the lack of ambition inherent in allowing the 40 microgram annual average value for PM10 to remain unchanged after 2010."
"This value is already adhered to in most European cities."
"The Commission had already announced a more stringent annual average value for PM10 with effect from 2010, but, as this present proposal makes no reference to it, the three big groups propose that the threshold value for PM10 be reduced to 33 micrograms with effect from 2010."
"I have to say, Commissioner, that I find it remarkable, in view of the criticism that these compromises attract, that you continually neglect to make this very point."
"Where the PM10 annual limit values are concerned, there is a marked downward turn."
"I would like to point out that this is not an example of the dilution of limit values that has attracted such strong criticism from the environmental organisations."
"The daily limit value for PM10, according to which 50 micrograms may be exceeded on at most 35 days in the year, has come in for forthright criticism from many Members, but the fact is that there is no correlation between the current daily and annual threshold values, and, moreover, the figure of 35 days is arbitrary."
"Nobody in this House would doubt the importance of carrying out daily measurements and informing at-risk groups of increased concentrations of pollutants."
"On the other hand, no credible scientist has as yet claimed that the daily limit value is more relevant to health policy than the annual one."
"The problems cities have with compliance with the daily limit value are no secret, and we abandon municipalities to a sort of organised helplessness."
"It has now been demonstrated that compliance with daily limit values is completely unrelated to any clean air measures, but rather largely dependent on chance meteorological phenomena."
"The Committee on the Environment and the three main groups in this House endorse the compromise proposal according to which the cities and municipalities affected would, in tandem with a reduction in the annual limit value of approximately 20%, be allowed – albeit only subject to certain conditions – rather more flexibility and permitted to comply with a limit value on a maximum of 55 rather than 35 days."
"There may be those who will have their doubts about the correlation between the daily and annual limit values proposed by this House, but nobody can claim with any seriousness that we are thereby being any less ambitious than the Commission and the Council."
"Let me now turn to PM2.5, the smallest particles, which are, according to all the experts, the source of the greatest hazards to health."
"However, the data obtained in Europe on PM2.5 are as yet uncertain, and most Member States have had insufficient experience with measurements of it."
"We therefore propose a two-stage regulation for PM2.5, with, in the first instance, a target value from 2010 onwards, and, with effect from 2005, a limit value around 20 micrograms; this too, is more ambitious than what the Council and the Commission are proposing."
"A majority in this House agrees that the 25 microgram annual average value as proposed by the Commission is lacking in ambition and that we should therefore reduce it."
"In its proposal, the Commission opted for an overall reduction of 20% for PM2.5 without undertaking any further impact assessment relating to the practical actions and costs resulting from it for each individual Member State."
"Like my fellow members of the committee, I am persuaded that a graduated model, with Member States being treated differently and greater account taken of previous achievements, is in any case preferable to aiming for a reduction across the board."
"Let me just say something about Article 20. I could understand the Commission’s and outside bodies' criticisms of the 5+5 rule – which aims to institute a time delay in order to enable the limit values to be reached."
"We have put together a new package called ‘4+2’, which represents a move towards the position taken by the Commission, which, as we know, is proposing a five-year period."
"I would like to reiterate air quality in Europe will be achieved only in the long term and only by means of actions targeting the problem at source, that is, the causes of pollution."
"I look to the Commission in expectation of the proposals that it has announced for reducing pollution at its source."
"Thank you very much, Mr Krahmer."
"You do, however, present me with a slight problem."
"Your speech was very interesting – I believe that Parliament as a whole can testify to that – but you have exceeded your two minutes and ten seconds of speaking time."
"Let me make it quite clear that I will be unable to extend the same generosity towards all of the Members here."
"I apologise in advance for this and I hope that each Member will try to keep to his or her speaking time."
"You were the first parliamentary speaker of the sitting, so we shall just treat this as an act of kindness on the part of the presidency."
"."
"Mr President, whilst I assume this generous gesture applies to the second speaker from the floor today, I shall attempt to keep it brief."
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to start with a brief word of thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for this topic, Mr Krahmer, Mrs Weisgerber and Mr Wijkman, along with all other shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to this positive outcome."
"Air quality is a major health problem and when, more than six months ago, I started to look into it in depth, I was shocked by just how great it turned out to be."
"Europeans die some nine months prematurely on account of air quality, and 350 000 people die ten years prematurely."
"Millions of people suffer from asthma and related disorders."
"Bad air quality does not affect everyone in the same way."
"People who live in large cities, along motorways, children and the elderly are the worst affected."
"In addition, air pollution, and the acid rain that results from it, represent a major environmental problem in large swathes of Europe, particularly in Scandinavia."
"It is for that reason, Commissioner, that we expect firm policy to curb air pollution and that is why we are disappointed with the proposals you have put forward."
"Mr Krahmer’s report, and my own, are above all an indictment of the attitude of indifference where air pollution is concerned."
"We demand, in fact, three political changes."
"First of all stricter standards; secondly, that more attention be given to implementation; and, thirdly, action to address the problem of air pollution at source."
"Turning to the standards first, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calls, in both reports, for a more ambitious approach, and that is something that is desperately needed."
"In the thematic strategy, the level of ambition opted for lies between A, B and C and the Maximum Technically Feasible Reduction scenario."
"All impact assessment studies indicate that even the maximum scenario is still cost-effective and that the ideal scenario lies between B and C. Nevertheless, the Commission, incidentally without any further explanation, has chosen level of ambition A+, which, in terms of public health, is an incomprehensible choice."
"A higher level of ambition is possible, as the United States has proven, and is also very cost-effective, as is evident from all studies that underpin it."
"Whilst the proposals that are tabled in my report may be a few billions more expensive, they yield definite health gains."
"They are also a definite incentive for innovation."
"In the directive, the Commission proposes a new form for the finer particles, PM2.5."
"The finest particles are most harmful to health and the standard is also more precise, because the smallest particles contain fewer natural sources such as sea salt and desert sand."
"PM2.5 is therefore a better measure, although the way in which the Commission has fleshed it out is very disappointing."
"Parliament has demanded a target and limit value of 20 µg/m3 for PM2.5."
"This is considerably better than the 25 µg which the Commission and Council back, but still worse than the 15 µg in the United States and the 10 µg recommended by the World Health Organisation."
"I am, in fact, very interested to see how the Commission will integrate the level of ambition selected for the strategy by Parliament in future legislation and in the National Emission Ceilings (NEC) Directive."
"Would you be in a position to say anything on this matter, Commissioner?"
"Will you now follow Parliament’s example and opt for a level of ambition that lies between B and C?"
"Better standards are needed, as I said before, but that is only one of the three pillars."
"Our second pillar is attention for implementation."
"To date, efforts on the part of the Member States have not been altogether convincing."
"Only four Member States are in full compliance with the limit values as specified in the present directive."
"It is up to the Commission to ensure that these are observed, and that is also necessary, because air pollution is a cross-border problem."
"Since half of the Netherlands’ air pollution is imported from abroad, it cannot possibly make the air cleaner on its own, and it must be able to rely on the Belgian, British and German Governments making every effort to tackle air pollution."
"Conversely, the Netherlands exports an awful lot of pollution, and that is why the Scandinavian countries, Germany and Belgium must be able to count on the Netherlands pulling out all the stops to make the air cleaner."
"So far, the Commission has not reacted very convincingly to Member States that exceed the standards."
"By introducing new provisions in the directive, the Committee on the Environment is hoping to galvanise the Commission into taking a more active role."
"Member States will be under a clear obligation to make efforts."
"Some countries need more time to achieve the limit values than others."
"I can go along with that, as long as they make the effort, and no exceptions without efforts."
"Only adequate efforts warrant exceptions."
"Exceptions are not, as the Commission proposal suggests, a premium for ‘doing nothing’, and Amendment 66 bears this out."
"The third pillar is an ambitious source policy."
"Without source policy, without policy to make cars, freight traffic, shipping and industry cleaner, it is extremely difficult for the Member States, and certainly for the densely populated Member States, to make the air cleaner."
"That is why air quality can be improved only by bringing traffic and industry to a standstill."
"Those are Draconian and, at the same time, not very effective measures."
"It will be the lower authorities, rather than anyone else, that will be asked to foot the bill, and that, of course, is unacceptable."
"Serious source policy has a positive impact on air, the environment and public health, but ultimately also cuts down on energy and benefits the climate on account of reduced CO2 emissions."
"It is also conducive to innovation: cleaner and more economical cars, for example, sell better."
"That is why the Committee on the Environment wishes to include in the directive Article 30A, which demands source policy by 2010."
"That is why the strategy proposes an interinstitutional agreement in which source policy can be enshrined."
"Moreover, Member States must, if there is no source policy, be able to take their own source measures outside of the market."
"Air pollution is a serious problem, but the good news is that it can be resolved, provided we are willing to display the political will."
"The Committee on the Environment has, in my view, laid down a firm basis with these three pillars."
"In the new compromise, we have also given teeth to matters as they stand and improved them, and I am once again indebted to everyone who has made a contribution, particularly Mr Krahmer, Mrs Weisgerber and Mr Wijkman."
"With stricter standards, more attention for implementation and source policy, we have made a few major policy changes."
"This approach stands for a new Europe, close to the people, with a view to implementing legislation by national and local governments, with innovation in mind."
"."
"Mr President, the constructive negotiations with the rapporteurs have brought about a sustainable compromise."
"If we are to achieve our main goal, that of effective and lasting improvement in air quality, it is vital that we establish limit values, but they, on their own, cannot improve the quality of the air; that can be done only through effective action to deal with emissions, such as the Euro 5 emissions standard that has already been proposed and which makes soot particle filters mandatory for new vehicles."
"It is primarily from the Commission that we demand further measures, in the shape, for example, of rules on residential combustion sources, Euro 6 for HGVs and Europe-wide limit values for ships’ engines."
"Generally speaking, we want to get away from actions that grab headlines but are no more than short-term and temporary, in favour of long-term measures that, by addressing the problem at its source, protect health more effectively."
"That is why our annual limit values, at 33 milligrams per square metre, are more ambitious than the Commission’s, and why we want more flexibility at the local level when it comes to daily limit values, which have been demonstrated to be largely subject to meteorological influences, since it is a proven fact that it is long-term exposure that is the most dangerous, and that is what we have to focus on."
"By reducing the annual limit values for particulates we seek to create incentives for long-term and sustainable projects such as environmental zones or the introduction of soot filters."
"More rigorous annual limit values and the effective reduction of long-term pollution brings people more benefits than closing a road for twenty-four hours."
"At national and local level, too, everything proportionate and necessary must be done to improve air quality, and we are creating the right incentives for that as well."
"Local authorities will have their deadlines extended to a maximum of six years only if they can produce action programmes that show that they have, within the bounds of proportionality, taken every step in their power to improve air quality; moreover, this concession will not be granted to all of them, but only to those that demonstrably have to contend with particularly unfavourable meteorological conditions brought on, among other things, by being located in basins."
"These clear messages are precisely what this compromise is about, and it thereby constitutes an even-handed and effective way of giving public health the protection it needs."
"."
"Mr President, I agree with the rapporteur that this directive will not bring us any closer to the objective of good ambient air quality."
"It is a good thing that fine particles, the fine PM2.5 particles in fact, are included in the directive, and that binding limit values are to be set for them."
"The limit value proposed by the Commission and supported by the Council is 20 micrograms, as has been mentioned more than once here."
"It has also been mentioned that Parliament is calling for a more stringent value."
"This is all very well, but if we compare this proposal to the needs which, for example, the World Health Organisation has proposed and which would get us to a situation where we would no longer be causing harm to human health or having an adverse effect on nature’s levels of tolerance, this limit value is just too high."
"The WHO is proposing 10 micrograms, and, as has been said here, in the United States of America and Canada they have already achieved a value of 15."
"Air pollution is one of the main environmental problems in Europe, and people are exposed to it."
"Here someone mentioned a figure of 360 000-400 000 premature deaths a year."
"Whatever the figure is, it is very large."
"The limit value that is set can have a genuine impact on the number of human lives that can be saved."
"If this recommendation by the WHO were to come into force, the figure would be several tens of thousands."
"With the limit values now being proposed, we would reach a figure of just a few thousand lives."
"Parliament, however, is calling for more stringent limit values for these smaller particles, which I endorse."
