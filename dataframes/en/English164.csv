"We know that there are a great number of directives and legislative projects in preparation in this area, and we believe it is high time that some of them were implemented as rapidly as possible."
"They certainly include the sector of distance working, but, equally certainly, they also include questions of consumer protection, questions of security in payment transactions, copyright and many more."
"A third central requirement to be met by the future legal order for the information society is that it should take greater account of the convergence of the information and communications technology media, which will result in the future mediamatic society, to guarantee an integrated policy for all media and services, and - this is particularly to be regarded as an appeal to the Member States - the further discussion of a centralized European telecommunications authority."
"Mr President, the period in which we are now living is often described as a 'crisis period' , but it is, rather, a time of radical change in society."
"This decade, in contrast to previous decades, is undergoing a process not of evolution but of revolution; everything is speeding up, intensified by the effects of technological progress and resulting in globalization of the economy, with market forces predominating, while the position of people in the West, comfortably settled with their ageing technology, is becoming increasingly precarious."
"Capital, information and goods travel at the speed of a computer signal; we have entered the information society and its impact on daily life is growing, bringing with it benefits but certainly also numerous drawbacks, if we are not careful."
"The rapporteur, Mr Van Velzen, has done his job well, and I congratulate him all the more warmly because I share his point of view."
"It is true that, for the public, employment, work and training are not the only values on which the information society in the European Union should be founded."
"Unfortunately, although the Green Paper proposes also to deepen the political, social and civil dialogue, it does not really take account of the everyday lives of ordinary people and the disruption to their way of life which will result from the information society, thus creating new forms of isolation and, probably, a two-speed society as a consequence of disparities between generations, social strata and geographical areas."
"The Green Paper lacks a human and personal dimension."
"The Union's declared aim of supporting the job transformation process does not take sufficient account of the additional danger of job relocation to third countries as a result of teleworking facilitated by the new information technologies."
"Retraining is the main focus of the planned measures to overcome workers' lack of skills."
"There is therefore a danger of a gulf appearing between the generations."
"Not just the vocational aspects but also the social aspects of redeployment should be considered."
"The question should also be raised of the cost to the family budget of using the new information technologies: licence fees, subscriptions, purchases of software, CD roms, diskettes or cassettes."
"The problem in fact is that there are disparities between people's purchasing power within the European Union and a consequent danger of creating a two-speed Europe."
"From the cultural point of view, the Green Paper does not consider the increasing use of the new technologies in national libraries, museums or photo libraries, and therefore fails to do justice to their beneficial effects on knowledge."
"Furthermore, though I have no desire to question the universal use of English in the computer world, this practice could impoverish that language, and if it becomes the common language of too many people it could diminish the use of the languages of the smaller countries."
"Finally, caution is required: the information society must not set up barriers between the generations, between those who have the information tools and those who cannot acquire them."
"Moreover, we should not underestimate the intellectual danger inherent in assimilating this information"
"In a word, I should like to call the attention of the Commission and the Council to the need to educate the various users who will be living in a society that their parents will not have been entirely successful in decoding."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Wim van Velzen, as I know what application and discipline he has brought to his work and the serious approach he has taken to the drafting of this helpful report."
"In the face of the challenges and social consequences wrought by the 'information society' it would be a good thing if the European Union were to plan ahead in order to set up a joint legislative framework suitable for regulating some of these consequences already mentioned: telework, privacy, linguistic differences, the effect on health, on schools, on teaching, the protection needed for users as such and as consumers, etc."
"No-one can say at this stage precisely where the information society will take us because it is a future which is still taking shape, a future which is developing and which is constantly at the experimental stage."
"But we must indeed move forward in order to avoid the most negative of the possible consequences: precarious nature of new jobs, greater inequality, new monopolies, uncontrolled networks, risk of cultural uniformity, more financial speculation, etc."
"We must at the same time accentuate the positive aspects which the information society will bring, because we have before us a predictable new model for economic growth and as such it should have a positive effect on employment."
"As a new model for economic growth it will have risks, different risks, some of which we know and others at which we can now only guess."
"The spread of information society technologies will change the structures of production, demand and employment."
"Although the technologies of this information society are creating new products and new services, they will produce substantial social changes, but in the medium and perhaps in the short term, new job opportunities might appear and we must be able to seize them."
"Our objective should be to ensure that the information society does not accentuate the differences between our regions, but rather acts as an instrument for cohesion; it should not swamp more people in the duality of our societies, but should favour social integration; it should not merely encourage financial speculation, but should encourage productive investment; it should not create new uncontrollable monopolies but should help to develop diversity and pluralism."
"This is one of those debates we shall come back to; it began because, as I said, the information society is at the development stage and is bound up with many aspects of our lives - amongst other things with a matter so fundamental as employment."
"Mr President, I think that this an important report and one which, given the continuing bias towards technology and economics in the Commission's thinking, is particularly apposite. I say that as a former rapporteur for the committee."
"The great importance of information technology for Europe is fully acknowledged and stems from the strongly rising share of the sector in the European economy and from its function as a catalyst for other industries in Europe."
"That, also, is a fact. It should be borne in mind, however, that in the information society people must eventually learn to work with the ICTs."
"At present most people in Europe are still not equipped to make good use of the ICTs."
"Given that situation, the call by Mr Van Velzen and Mr Pex for coordination is quite justified."
"I feel that in the future the Commission, in its interaction with the Council, and the European Parliament must do much more to coordinate the various policy areas."
"If Europe is to win through in the field of the information and communication technologies it is essential that action be taken to that end."
"We must be prepared also to use our structural funds and action programmes for, among other things, new pricing methodologies and new eventualities."
"Currently, the stipulated regions are suffering neglect because the structural funds are, above all, badly focused."
"But in the future the result will be not only regional neglect."
"There will also be neglect of groups. I call for that to be borne in mind in future policy."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Van Velzen, as well as the draftsmen for the other committees, for having presented a report which is constructive and certainly of great interest, despite being somewhat critical in places."
"Your analysis and conclusions, Mr Van Velzen, show that the drafting process took a considerable period of time and required a detailed knowledge of the social aspects of the information society."
"The Commission's Green Paper, launched at a European colloquium in Dublin at the end of September 1996, generated a debate throughout Europe on the many aspects of the information society, as also identified by the High Level Group and the Information Society Forum."
"A clear consensus on the need for further action has emerged from a wide range of institutions, organizations and individuals: national governments, EU institutions, committees, trade unions, businesses, professional associations, health boards and, in particular, both national and European voluntary bodies."
"This consensus is centred on the need to do more in a series of key sectors to create a greater awareness of the aspects of the information society: to encourage the development of an approach to learning at all levels of the information society; to boost employment and stimulate job creation; to modernize the institutions related to working life and legislative activity; to develop human resources and overcome the skills gap; to promote social cohesion through empowerment and social integration; and to build on Europe's cultural diversity in creating a European route to the information society."
"Reaction to the Green Paper did also reveal concern in some areas, however: the compatibility between flexible work organization and job security; the balance between what one might call the winners and losers on the employment front; the relocation of production to all corners of the earth; regional imbalances in terms of access, availability and adaptation; the risk that equality of opportunity may not be guaranteed for all; and sustainable development for all sectors of employment, work, life and democracy."
"The Commission is currently preparing a follow-up communication entitled 'Prioritizing the human dimension: the next steps' ."
"I can assure the House that this communication will be compatible with and complement the other actions undertaken by the Commission in this sector."
"On the detailed questions which have been raised, I would merely point out that the Commission is preparing a new communication on vocational training and the information society, which is to address itself to many aspects of lifelong learning."
"This communication will complete the Commission's action plan 'Towards a European education initiative: learning in the information society' ."
"Mention has also been made of teleworking: the Commission will not be presenting a proposal on this topic as such before the end of the year, as requested, since the aspects relating to teleworking are to be tackled in a Green Paper on work organization to be published by the Commission within a matter of weeks."
"The purpose of this Green Paper is to stimulate a debate, in the context of the social dialogue, on work organization as it affects teleworking."
"As regards one final question of detail - on improving consumer protection - I would say that, to my knowledge, the Directorate-General responsible for consumer policy is in the process of drawing up a communication on ways of enhancing consumer protection."
"I should like to end by congratulating the rapporteur once again on his excellent work: it is a most useful contribution to the communication which the Commission will be presenting very shortly to the House."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Lifelong learning"
"The next item is the report (A4-0056/97) by Mrs Waddington, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's White Paper on Education and Training - Teaching and Learning - Towards the Learning Society (COM(95)0590 - C4-0597/95)."
"Mr President, the Commission should be congratulated for initiating a debate on the need to create a learning society in the European Union."
"The White Paper provides an analysis of the challenges we face in the global economy where new technologies are radically changing the nature of work and requiring a workforce that is highly-skilled, flexible and qualified."
"However, the challenges we face in Europe are even greater and we must plan to create a learning society which recognizes the modern and difficult problems and provides opportunities for all our citizens to contribute to economic and social progress."
"If these challenges are not met, the alternative is economic and social decline."
"In my report attention is given to three additional challenges: firstly, the ageing of the population of Europe; secondly, the danger of the growth in social exclusion, and, thirdly, the relatively low and, in some cases, declining level of public expenditure on education and training."
"Analysis of these three factors suggests that more emphasis should be given to lifelong learning rather than simply concentrating on initial education and training, that the problem of educational underachievement and the need for particular groups currently marginalized to gain skills and qualifications must have a higher priority, and that a larger range of actors, including the social partners, must have a role, with Member States and the European Union, in examining the means of creating, sustaining and resourcing the learning society."
"I will give a few examples."
"Our workforce is ageing: in ten years' time 80 % of the technology we use today will be outdated but 80 % of the workforce will be working on the basis of knowledge at least ten years old."
"School failure is increasing: the OECD suggests that 15-20 % of European students leave school with no useful qualifications and the decline in demand for unskilled workers is resulting in a growth in long-term unemployment for those without marketable skills and flexibility."
"Yet only 7 % of the unemployed are undergoing training, and this proportion is actually decreasing."
"The percentage of total public expenditure on education and training has declined in 11 out of the 15 Member States in the last 10 years."
"Both the USA and Japan spend more than we do."
"The benefits of education and training have been well documented."
"Empirical evidence points to a positive correlation between education and employment, higher earnings, productivity, economic growth, equality and quality of life, greater social cohesion, improved health, reduced crime and enhanced environmental awareness."
"This evidence, documented during the 1996 European Year of Lifelong Learning, and the results of the very wide consultations carried out on the White Paper, strongly suggest the need for further action."
"The motion for a resolution includes a number of concrete proposals in addition to those proposed by the Commission, in particular concerning lifelong learning, combating social exclusion and the development of partnerships for resourcing a learning society."
"We are asking for the budgetary authority to increase funding and the Commission to undertake research and pilot programmes and to mainstream education and training in Community programmes."
"Action is certainly needed and we are inviting the Commission to review its current plan for action and prepare a more comprehensive and detailed proposal and to reconsult this Parliament on its revised plan."
"This report, with its critical evaluation of the issues and its suggestions for improvement, will be a positive contribution to the creation of a European learning society."
"The significance of education and training, both for work and for democratic life, requires this European Union to take fundamental steps to invest in the future of all our people, young and old, and to ensure that all our programmes and all our resources are devoted towards creating a society in which all individuals have the opportunity to learn to skill and to reskill at all ages."
"I look forward to the view of the Commission on our proposals."
"I very much hope that this Parliament will universally support these proposals and that we will shortly see concrete action proposals coming forward and be able to see, within the lifetime of this Parliament, clear and actual benefits from the work undertaken."
"Mr President, if education is society's main way to develop the individual's physical, intellectual and moral potentials, training is the organization, provision and acquisition of the necessary qualifications, mainly for professional life."
"Consequently, education and training assist the better development of the abilities of individual people and their participation in society."
"Nowadays, in many of the European Union's Member States, the educational systems are not well enough prepared to meet the challenges of international competition, technological change, company requirements, and the working world, so as to provide a workforce with a high level of specialization."
"Bearing in mind the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission accepts that the Member States have primary responsibility and has proposed activities that they should undertake and measures for the support of those activities at Community level."
"Our opinion is that education and training should be viewed from a more cohesive standpoint, and should aim to promote and encourage original thinking and to offer a sufficiency of qualitatively trained human resources, especially in the areas of research and technology."
"To promote such a dimension in education and training, it is essential to have more effective coordination of national and Community action in research, technological development and education, and greater cooperation between programmes for innovative initiatives, research activity and industry."
"Mr President, I now want to mention a number of factors which I consider important:"
"As for Objective 1, in other words encouragement of the acquisition of new knowledge, we consider that the creation of a centre for information resources and mobility for students, researchers and academic staff should aim to promote interdisciplinary approaches in new sectors."
"The Commission should also include in the recognition of key skills, research ability in sectors at the cutting edge of technology."
"The production and use of educational IT multimedia appropriately adapted for the education systems in the Member States and for their respective cultural and linguistic particulars, should also be supported."
"As for Objective 2, namely the development of closer links between the academic and industrial worlds, we call for the creation of communication channels between the two."
"In the context of the SOCRATES and LEONARDO programmes, we also call on the Commission to ensure that the mobility of students, researchers and academic staff between universities, research centres and companies will include periods of recognized research and training activity in branches related to industry, and to support and develop information and consultancy service networks."
"We call on the Commission, in cooperation with CEDEFOP, to promote the creation of networks for the exchange of information and the monitoring of experience in successful methods of lifelong professional training."
"As for Objective 3, the fight against social exclusion, we believe that the use of networks and multimedia in the field of education and training reinforces the effort to ensure equal access."
"Finally, Mr President, so far as equal material investment is concerned, we call on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to look into methods of providing tax incentives for companies and individuals which invest and participate in lifelong professional training."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the response to the White Paper has been for the most part positive."
"Especially at this time of unemployment in Europe, especially among the young, the education debate has taken on a particularly serious significance."
"Sue Waddington's report, on which I offer my sincere congratulations and my thanks for the pleasure of working with her, is particularly valuable because it takes account of the EU's latest studies of education policy, which indicate that even in the EU countries the standard of education leaves something to be desired, that public expenditure on education is falling, and that although better training does increase individual educational opportunities it is still far from being a guarantee of a job."
"The conclusions of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media concentrate on three points in particular."
"The first is finance."
"Susan Waddington also touches on this point in her report, when she says that the cost neutrality referred to in the White Paper must on no account be allowed to set a trend, because the SOCRATES and LEONARDO programmes are already underfunded, and that additional financial resources should imperatively be made available."
"Secondly, the committee calls upon the Commission to rethink its present action plan and to include other aspects, beginning with lifelong learning and extending to measures to combat social marginalization."
"This certainly does not relate only to the school of the second chance, but especially to basic and further training programmes, integration models, active learning, consideration for the disadvantaged, the role of teachers, and educational and vocational advisory services."
"All of this must be included, as must the learning of foreign languages."
"Our committee has given particular attention to this, and requests that not only the EU languages should be included."
"Education and training cannot be left to the efforts of the individual but are a function of government."
"The State takes the primary responsibility for them."
"This is the only way of avoiding a split in European society between the informed and the ignorant."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for an excellent report."
"Education is increasingly important, not least from an employment point of view."
"If Europe is to compete on the world market in the future, it is imperative that our workforce is well-educated."
"I believe that the competitiveness of Europe lies in advanced technologies and the accompanying well-educated workforce."
"As mentioned by the rapporteur, a basic education is not enough."
"In view of the rapid changes and advances in technology, we must adopt the concept of lifelong learning."
"In addition, education plays an important role from a class point of view."
"Class differences used to depend on the amount of property or money owned."
"Today and in the future class differences will depend much more on whether you possess knowledge or not."
"Hence the importance of education being offered to everyone and not just a few."
"Currently it is often the case that people with a higher education background also benefit more from education during the latter part of their lives."
"We must create a society where everyone is able to enjoy a good education."
"Naturally prospects vary, but the objective of education is that it should be tailored to individual needs."
"I say yes to a second chance, but not in a segregated system."
"It is the mainstream education system which must give a second chance to those who need it."
"I would also like to strike a blow for the integration of pupils who are disadvantaged."
"They should be able to participate to the greatest possible extent in mainstream education."
"Finally, as regards positive discrimination, we have at present a number of vocational education programmes, some largely attended by men, some largely by women."
"Positive discrimination should be possible so as to achieve a more equitable balance between the sexes."
"Mr President, I should like to turn the spotlight briefly on flexibility."
"We all know that the working world has changed completely in recent years."
"We can assume that most of those who are now going out to work for the first time will have to retrain three, four or five times."
"In other words, flexibility is an absolute must, and lifelong learning - constant relearning - is a necessity."
"Only those who really do offer that flexibility and are willing to learn more and relearn will have really good prospects of staying in work."
"What politicians can contribute here is assistance to enable the individual to achieve this flexibility."
"I believe that the European Union has done a good job here with the range of educational and mobility programmes it offers, such as LEONARDO or SOCRATES or all the programmes to be implemented in connection with the Structural Funds, such as LEADER or YOUTH START or NEW and so on."
"All this is important as a way of giving the individual in the job market a real chance to absorb education and experience genuine mobility."
"I believe these programmes are also needed because that same mobility helps to transfer innovations between the many small and medium-sized enterprises."
"But the big problems that exist when it comes to implementing all this lie in the fact that there are major obstacles in, for example, the mutual recognition of diplomas awarded as a result of training in the various Member States."
"Problems also arise with user information, and with the wide variety of national rules."
"It is unclear, for example, what counts as paid holiday and what counts as working time, or what allowance is made for training."
"What we need, therefore, is a package of measures from the Commission to ensure that all these barriers are pulled down as quickly as possible so that these programmes can help us to pursue an active employment market policy in the interests of those concerned."
"Mr President, globalization of the economy, liberalization of the labour market and the information society, assuming, in our view, that its consequences are properly handled, are making lifelong learning a central concern for us."
"Employees must be afforded regular opportunities for education and young people in training must learn how to handle new computer techniques as early as possible."
"Entirely new forms of education and teacher training need to be devised."
"The information society, which we have rightly debated, will, I believe, force the European Union to claim a steadily bigger role for itself in this field."
"Exchanging information is no longer enough."
"We must also embark on the coordination of national policy."
"The European Union has a key part to play in attuning the differing education systems of the various Member States to the situation in order that Europe can be properly equipped for the world market."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for the impetus that she has provided in that direction."
"Mr President, I heartily congratulate Mrs Waddington on her report, since as a result of the additions and the adoption of many of the amendments presented in the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment by various Groups, the Commission's White Paper has been vastly improved."
"This report places the accent on the Commission's giving priority to the subject of education within its agenda and considers that matters such as social exclusion and sexual equality will be greatly improved as a result of education and lifelong learning."
"The economic development which might be achieved as a result of education and training is qualitative and not quantitative and it is therefore necessary to regard this development as better not greater."
"Educational changes on their own cannot bring about socio-economic changes but inequalities will disappear to a large extent with education and training, since they make it easier for people to obtain better jobs and thus promote greater equality."
"We ourselves would ask the Commission to consider the matter of education and training within the framework of an overall project for social change linked to training of the workforce and to the other social and economic projects within this great scheme to build Europe - which is on everyone's agenda."
"Mr President, as in every sector - and especially that of the economy - we shall have a multispeed Europe in the social sector too."
"I would congratulate the rapporteur on the hard work and commitment which have gone into her comprehensive report, and I share her view that the purpose of education and training is mainly to secure growth which creates jobs, to guarantee social benefits and to combat exclusion."
"In my opinion, these aims can only be achieved if the Member States are encouraged to act independently, so that strategies and projects are coordinated by their own local and regional governments."
"Like individual countries, Europe will become great if it can promote culture and employment for its citizens and teach its young people to become adults."
"Teachers have a major role to play in this process, and that is why they should be obliged to familiarize themselves with the culture, language and traditions of the places where they teach: they should return to the classroom and be examined once a year as to their suitability for teaching, by panels set up by the local and regional authorities."
"What is more, Parliament should set an example to the young people of Europe by reorganizing itself on the lines of a truly federal Europe, in which local and regional bodies have more powers, including the right to group together and negotiate agreements with regions in other Member States."
"This would be a further incentive for the young citizens of Europe: a cultural commitment combined with stronglyheld democratic convictions would stimulate the building of a real Europe of peoples and citizens."
"Mr President, I am grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Waddington, as she has managed in her report to link the specific problems of various types of workers and social groups with the broader, more general issue of the need for new training systems."
"This may well be the most useful contribution that the Commission has to look at."
"Tension will inevitably be created whenever real life becomes enmeshed with projects, but the outcome of such tension is extremely beneficial."
"The White Paper on the learning society makes one point which I believe is worth stressing: it accepts the challenge presented by change, and maintains that change and flexibility can be guided and moulded to suit the interests of mankind only if the question of training takes centre stage."
"Training is the only way of achieving a form of flexibility which is positive for mankind."
"The White Paper tackles this issue both in terms of culture in general - and it is interesting that, alongside technical know-how, not only is a reappraisal and deepening awareness of the humanities taking shape, but creativeness and experimentation are also undergoing a revival - and in terms of preparation for a working life in which there will be an increasing overlap between technical skills and social attitudes, theoretical knowledge and integration in the workplace."
"All of this, however, requires that training should take place within a network. A single institution will be inadequate: cooperation will be needed between different institutions, schools, training centres, associations and families."
"One question which attracted the attention of the Social Affairs Committee was that of a second chance to attend school."
"We are aware of the need, but also the dangers."
"Success depends on a thorough overhaul of a rigid, threatening system - flexible pathways between training systems, schools and businesses could indeed create new opportunities."
"We also agree on the objectives."
"In general terms, these objectives make a good deal of sense, at least with a view to provoking change: from a new relationship between schools and businesses to language proficiency, to training which is viewed as a major investment."
"This White Paper has been criticized for not dealing adequately with social and human development."
"I do not share this criticism, because it seems to me that social and human development is not only encouraged, but regarded as a precious personal asset in preparing for work - why else would the White Paper devote such attention to the proposed European Voluntary Service?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too wish to applaud the Commission's initiative in publishing the White Paper on education and training. I also commend the rapporteur on her excellent work, which has helped to improve the White Paper."
"I should like to deal with two aspects: the first is the very close link identified by the rapporteur between training and one of the challenges faced by our society, namely the globalization of the economy."
"On the one hand, the process of globalization is radically changing patterns of employment and creating problems of adapting to new social and economic conditions, but on the other, it can also offer major opportunities if it is accompanied by substantial investment in training."
"I am referring here to training for young people to broaden their skills base, training in the sense of learning foreign languages and as a means of bringing schools and businesses closer together, but also training as a way of giving adults the ability to adapt to change."
"In short, training - as long as it is expanded and upgraded - is the key to regarding the current changes and innovation as an opportunity."
"For this reason, I endorse the rapporteur's comments and her appeal to the budgetary authority for more funding to be made available not only in the individual Member States, but also at European level for basic training, lifelong learning and research."
"My second point concerns women."
"It is true that the education of girls and women has increased significantly in recent years, but some sectors still remain heavily dominated by men; positive action is therefore required to encourage girls and women to take up education and training, particularly in scientific and technical subjects."
"Mr President, many surveys have shown, and we do not need to debate it, that education and training contribute decisively towards the fight against unemployment, increasing employment and boosting the competitiveness of the economy."
"It follows, I think, that what we should aim to do is combine general education with the cultivation of professional skills, so as to create an educational system whose aim will be to teach those in education how to learn, both now and in the future."
"With that in mind, in the context of this report I would like to dwell on a number of points."
"First, we must not forget that the instrument available to us as the European Union for the exercise of policy is the European Social Fund."
"Here, there is much that we can do to improve effectiveness, first of all, and secondly transparency, so far as the activities - of the ESF, I repeat - are concerned."
"Secondly, we should focus our efforts on dealing with the consequences of the information society which is on our threshold. It must not be an eclectic society, but one that involves everyone."
"Thirdly, we should place particular emphasis on foreign languages, all the more so since we are involved in the single European market."
"Fourthly, we should increase the resources earmarked for the LEONARDO and SOCRATES programmes, which are ones that create European added value in the sector we are considering."
"Fifthly, I want to mention CEDEFOP, the Centre for the Development of Professional Training."
"I consider that demands and developments in the sector of professional training demonstrate the need for the Centre to exist, but at the same time they stress the need to support and of course to mobilize the Centre, which by the way, has its headquarters in my own country, Greece."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the various committees, and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Waddington, and the draftsmen, Mrs Hawlicek and Mr Trakatellis."
"The Commission's intention in publishing its White Paper was to contribute to the debate on the future of our society, especially as regards the role of education and training in the face of current social change, with particular attention being given to ways of halting the tragedy of unemployment."
"Clearly, this debate is very closely bound up with Europe's chosen model of society."
"It is a matter of offering European citizens common values and objectives, in particular the development of lifelong education and training."
"Ever since the publication of the White Paper, the concept of the learning society has occupied a pivotal role in our thinking."
"The opinion of the Committee on Culture, presented by Mrs Hawlicek, highlights this aspect and takes up a number of proposals made in the White Paper: raising the general level of culture, and encouraging creativity and critical awareness, as well as language proficiency."
"Basically, the three main factors of change identified in the White Paper - globalization, the information society and the scientific and technological revolution - have not been called into question; they are becoming more and more widely accepted as a basis for discussing educational matters."
"That was not the case until recently."
"However, both Parliament's report and a number of other responses have emphasized that these three factors are too limited, and that two others in particular should be examined, the impact of which was somewhat underestimated in the White Paper. The first is demographic change."
"Parliament's report, like that of the European Trade Union Confederation, draws attention to this point."
"The transformation in the age pyramid of the working population in Europe has too often been overlooked."
"In particular, it has become clear that such changes are contributing to the considerable increase in the training needs of adult workers, and that the debate should not be restricted to young people."
"It should be pointed out here that the Commission will very soon be submitting to the Council and Parliament the first European report on access to continuing training in the Union, which follows on from the Council's recommendation on this subject in 1993, along with the guidelines to be followed in this key area of vocational training policy in the Community."
"The other point which has given rise to some reservations and even criticism concerns the role of the main players and protagonists, above all the social partners."
"The various representatives of the world of work have a crucial role to play here, and Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mr Lindqvist have proposed making additions on these lines."
"Parliament's report also criticizes the lack of analysis of Member States' education systems in the White Paper, as Mr Menrad in particular pointed out."
"In this respect, it should not be forgotten that the purpose of the White Paper was to generate a far-reaching debate on social change, and not merely on education systems. Moreover, the Commission's work programme provides for the drawing-up of a substantial number of documents on education systems, with key data on education and, for the first time, vocational training, a report on continuing training, and interim reports on Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci."
"A clear response should be given to two concerns which Parliament's draft report considers crucial and which were raised during the debates in both the Committee on Culture and the Social Affairs Committee: these relate to the question of funding."
"Parliament's report sets great store by the need to bring funding into line with the objectives of the White Paper and the creation of the learning society."
"It should be borne in mind that the White Paper proposed a series of experiments which we have carried out under the existing Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci action programmes, within the budgets already earmarked for those programmes; additional resources have been made available through the Structural Funds for second-chance schooling in particular."
"The Commission is now working on a proposal for a decision on the funding of the Socrates programme for the next two years, and we count on Parliament's support."
"What does the Commission intend to do thereafter?"
"Before the summer, it intends to submit to the Council and Parliament a communication setting out the results of the various debates which have taken place at local, national and Community level in the various Community institutions, within economic and social bodies and with experts."
"The report will take account in particular of the suggestions which emerged from the thematic conferences organized by the Commission on the five objectives of the White Paper, and of the lessons which can be learned from the implementation of the objectives themselves."
"This communication will not be limited to drawing general conclusions, but will explain - objective by objective - the difficulties which have been encountered and the lessons learned."
"The timetable laid down by the Council decisions establishing the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes is helpful in this respect."
"The Commission is to submit an interim evaluation report for each programme in 1997 and, during the first half of 1998, its proposals for the continuation of these programmes beyond their expiry in 1999."
"In the evaluation report on the achievement of the White Paper's objectives, the Commission will set out guidelines for a more broadly-based implementation of these objectives."
"This report and the interim evaluation reports will enable both the Council and Parliament to hold initial policy debates in late 1997 or early 1998."
"In this way, the proposals for revising the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, to be put to the Commission towards the end of the first half of 1998, will be able to draw on these policy debates."
"Here we share the House's wish to see a special initiative to promote an apprenticeship scheme, without at this stage defining the instrument to be used."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Operation of aeroplanes"
"The next item is the report (A4-0063/97) by Mr van der Waal, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a Council Directive (COM(96)0413 - C4-0541/96-96/0209(SYN)) amending Directive 92/14/EEC on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the amendment to Directive 92/14 represents part of our efforts to achieve greater compatibility between air transport and environmental protection."
"It seems logical that, when environmental factors are taken into account, technical feasibility, and the economic consequences too, must result in exemptions, but care is needed to ensure that these exemption arrangements are not abused."
"The Group of the European People's Party therefore welcomes the Commission's proposal and all the rapporteur's proposed amendments, partly because they clarify terms such as 'air carrier' and 'operating licence' , which previously led to misunderstandings."
"We also agree with the deletion of the aeroplanes from Saudi Arabia."
"Quite apart from the fact that, for the purposes of the Directive, the exemptions are not supposed to result in everincreasing numbers, the way the exemption should be looked at in this case is that the term 'developing nation' is difficult to reconcile with these privately owned aircraft."
"The Group of the European People's Party also welcomes the fact that the terms 'leasing' and 'subleasing' are explained in more explicit terms, so that more can be done to prevent them."
"The procedure is simplified by the introduction of a committee, though we consider it important that this refers only to deletions and that further additions to the exemption arrangements should still be a matter for consultation with the Council and Parliament."
"The Group of the European People's Party will therefore vote for this report and all the amendments, and hopes that the Commission and Council will accept the amendments because in our view they all conform to the spirit of the Directive - a healthy compromise between environmental protection, or noise abatement in this instance, technological feasibility and economic consequences for genuine developing nations."
"Mr President, please allow me to address the following hard question directly to Professor Monti who is responsible for the internal market and related stipulations."
"The established airlines of the Community which carry passengers out of the Community are being placed at a disadvantage at the airports of the Union, which have stringent environmental protection and noise pollution requirements, on account of two aspects imposed by the Commission."
"Firstly, access from third countries, from so-called developing countries: I refer you back to what both of the previous speakers have said."
"Secondly, the admission of new entrants to the airports can only come at the expense of the established companies because you are opening up the market without retaining the slots reserved for the long-standing companies which have spent a great deal of money adapting their aeroplanes and engaged in substantial investment."
"Then along comes a new entrant with a Chapter 2 aeroplane who has adapted nothing and who must, according to you, get access to the restricted noise space."
"Is that what you consider to be a common market with a level playing field?"
"I would like an answer from you personally."
"Mr President, the report under consideration deals with various ways of reducing aircraft noise."
"The proposal made by the Commission is beneficial in many ways, but it is important that it is supplemented by the additional proposals and amendments made by the Committee on Transport and Tourism. These, for example, give Member States the right to impose further restrictions on access for the noisiest types of aircraft and even to go one stage further and actually ban such aircraft which do not fulfil the criteria as set out in the annex."
"I assume that the Commission does not object to dealing with the problem in this way."
"I believe it to be vital that the work on reducing aircraft noise is something which is continuously pursued."
"It is especially important that a substantially greater level of investment in research and development is made in this area."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I speak in this debate principally to mention a problem at a regional airport which is a perfect example of the problems that can arise in connection with this matter."
"For a number of years now Ostend has been a haven for Chapter 2 aeroplanes flying in from, among other places, Egypt, Nigeria and Zaire, and for the noisy old aeroplanes of companies such as Africa International."
"I have shown the exemptions list of Annex I of Directive 92/14, and also the revised Annex in the new Commission proposal, to people living in the airport neighbourhood who have joined together to fight against sleepless nights and to make a stand for normal residential comforts."
"They tell me that a great many more Chapter 2 aeroplanes are flying into Ostend from developing countries than the respective annexes allow."
"Commissioner, there is surely something wrong with the implementation of these rules."
"Although the competence lies with the Member States, I hope that the Commission can and will rap the fingers of those countries which are disregarding the rules."
"Mr President, I should like to say that the Group of the Party of European Socialists does of course support Mr van der Waal's proposals."
"I believe that problems of this kind should always be viewed from the standpoint of the common good - the defence of local communities and of the public interest."
"And, sometimes, there is a contradiction between the economic interest, the opportunity for every citizen really to be able to use this mode of transport, and the interests of the population living near the airports."
"Contradictions of this kind have to be overcome with the aid of suitable democratic legislation."
"Mention was made just now of the problem of Ostend airport."
"The saga of Zaventem airport would take hours to recount."
"On several occasions, the population have filed complaints about noise nuisance, especially sleep disturbance caused by night flights."
"Several judgments have been given, but not always along the lines for which the locals hoped."
"There is a problem here with the application of the legislation by the Belgian Government, and another problem with the evaluation of nuisance and the disturbance it creates for the population."
"I will end with a question to the Commissioner: how can it happen that the idea of an exemption for private aircraft can be defended in this House?"
"I believe this is a real problem for several airports, especially Brussels."
"I cannot understand this approach."
"Other airlines and other aircraft have to respect various limits."
"It is surely not right that, on the pretext of additional economic benefits, some companies are governed by different rules."
"In conclusion, people at Zaventem, and at Brussels more generally, are expecting solutions to these problems and we hope that the Commission will listen to what we have to say."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the House for including this item on noisy aeroplanes on the agenda for this part-session, and by congratulating the Committee on Transport and Tourism and its rapporteur, Mr van der Waal, for drawing up the report in such a short period of time."
"I am well aware that the European Parliament is very concerned about the problem of aeroplane noise emissions."
"In this context, it is justified for certain questions to be raised about the content of the Commission's proposal to amend an existing directive on the gradual withdrawal of the noisiest types of aeroplane."
"It might indeed appear contradictory to find in this amending directive on the limitation of the operation of noisy aeroplanes an increase in the number of aeroplanes belonging to developing countries which receive an exemption."
"There is, however, a logical explanation."
"When Council Directive 92/14/EEC on the gradual withdrawal of the noisiest aeroplanes - the so-called Chapter 2 aeroplanes - was adopted, it was felt that account should be taken of the difficult economic circumstances of air carriers established in developing countries."
"The directive therefore laid down the conditions under which aeroplanes entered in the registers of developing countries and operated by air carriers in those countries may be exempted from the provisions governing withdrawal from service, until the final deadline of 31 March 2002."
"At the same time, the annex to the directive listed the individual aeroplanes in developing countries which qualified for this exemption."
"However, certain aeroplanes in those countries had not been notified to the Commission by the time Directive 92/14/EEC was adopted, and are thus not included in the annex."
"The main purpose of the Commission's current proposal is therefore to update the list of aeroplanes in the annex to the directive, so as to avoid any legal uncertainty regarding the situation of aeroplanes from developing countries."
"However, with a view to ensuring a uniform and more rigorous interpretation of the existing directive within the Community, the Commission also decided to introduce a number of definitions and changes of wording."
"Application of the amended provisions should lead to a stricter approach to requests from air carriers for exemptions, and thereby improve the effectiveness of Directive 92/14/EEC in terms of reducing noise emissions around airports."
"Finally, the Commission deemed it appropriate to allow Member States to concentrate the operation of the noisiest types of aeroplane at the airport least sensitive to noise emissions of those belonging to a given airport system."
"This provision will not detract from the balanced approach pursued in Directive 92/14/EEC, which takes due account of technical, economic and environmental considerations."
"Mr Wijsenbeek was kind enough to ask me a question specifically related to the competences of the Internal Market Commissioner rather than the ones I am representing here this evening."
"In response to his question I would say that the additions to the list are aircraft which were already operating."
"So they are not new entrants but were not included in the original directive because they had not been notified."
"These new additions have now satisfied all the criteria laid down in the directive."
"Their addition is therefore merely a technical change."
"(IT) In considering the amendments adopted by the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I think it is important to stand by the balanced approach to which I referred a moment ago."
"As far as aeroplanes from developing countries are concerned, it is essential to make the text as rigorous as possible, in order to avoid any abuse of the exemptions for aeroplanes currently operated by air carriers established in certain developing countries."
"I am therefore pleased to tell the House that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 3 and 7, since they tighten up the conditions under which an exemption remains valid."
"However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 6, since they would conflict with the balanced approach of the directive; nor Nos 4 and 8, since these would oblige the Commission to propose a further amending directive in order to include in the annex a limited number of aeroplanes operated by developing countries which could enjoy an exemption in the year 2000; nor Nos 5 and 9, since Saudi Arabia is included in the official international list of developing countries, and its aeroplanes listed in the annex comply with the criteria laid down in Article 3 of the directive as amended by this proposal."
"The amendments which we can accept will enable the Commission to tighten up the provisions relating to developing countries, whilst at the same time preserving the overall balance."
"I would once again express my thanks to Mr van der Waal and the Committee on Transport, and would apologize to you, Mr President, if the complexity of the subject has caused me to go beyond my allotted speaking time."
"Mr President, I have listened carefully to the Commissioner but I have not heard a reply to the rapporteur's question about whether airports, casu quo the Member States, have the scope and the right to keep Chapter 2 aeroplanes out if they are finding it difficult to stay within the noise norms."
"That, of course, is the question that is always being put to us by our constituents, by the citizens."
"If the Commissioner cannot answer the question here and now can we expect a written answer?"
"Mr Cornelissen, that is not exactly a point of order. It is a question which the Commissioner will be able to answer, but perhaps not at this particular moment."
"Mr President, I believe that I can answer by referring to the approach known as global harmonization."
"Three amendments, Nos 1, 2 and 6, seek to allow the Member States to impose limitations on the operation of Chapter 2 aeroplanes in individual airports."
"Members may not be aware that such restrictions are subject to the procedure and conditions laid down by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 on market access."
"Since the purpose of Directive 92/14/EEC is global harmonization, taking account of the technical, economic and environmental impact, the Member States are not allowed to impose more restrictive measures, for example a total ban on the operation of a Chapter 2 aeroplane before it is 25 years old."
"However, without prejudice to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 on market access, if serious environmental problems arise, Member States may impose operating restrictions - not a total ban on operation, but operating restrictions - such as a night curfew for Chapter 2 aeroplanes, provided that these do not result in a total ban on the operation of such aeroplanes."
"What is more, Member States may levy higher landing fees for noisier aeroplanes."
"Thank you, Mr Monti."
"Closing of the session"
"I declare closed the 1996-1997 session of the European Parliament and announce that, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, Parliament will meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday 11 March 1997."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.20 p.m.)"
"Opening of annual session"
"I declare the 1997-1998 session of the European Parliament open."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I would like to point out that I was present yesterday. I am not on the attendance register."
"I probably forgot to sign in but I took part in the roll-call vote, which you can check."
"Mr President, Mr Pasty is not on the attendence list for the same reason that that my name and the names of at least fifty people are not on the list today."
"I have discovered that I appear under a different name: Mayera Ortega."
"But that applies to most Members."
"For example my good friend Mr Falconer appears as Falconero; my colleague from our party Mr Dührkop Dührkop is down as Donnerp Dührkop."
"The President of Parliament has come out half intact as Gil-Roblee instead of Gil-Robles."
"Mrs Bennasar Tous is down as Bazinrsar Tous and Mr Cohn-Bendit is down as CoatesBendit."
"I have the impression, Mr President, that some wicked virus crept into the attendance list yesterday."
"Mr President, I am now called 'Marcet s' ."
"Mr President, it is simply that I do not find my name anywhere, despite the fact that I signed in."
"You had better check the lists as well, please."
"Mr President, this business is even more bizarre."
"I have just seen in Wilfried Martens' Minutes, i.e., in the Dutch edition, that my name is listed, although spelt rather oddly, but it is listed."
"Let me state quite explicitly that I was not present yesterday, did not put my name down on any list and am not claiming the daily allowance!"
"Mr President, just to say that unlike Mr Poettering I am not listed, yet I am absolutely sure I signed in and took part in the debate."
"Mr President, my name was not misspelt, for the simple reason that it does not appear in the Minutes even though I was not in two places at once and was sure I was there yesterday."
"Mr President, I was present too but am not on the list."
"Mr President, in my case, Mrs Guigou and Mrs Guinebertière have been cloned, so she should come first and I second!"
"Mr President, my name is listed too."
"Perhaps someone thought it is Theatos in Greek."
"I am actually called Theato, but I was not present either."
"Could you please have my name deleted."
"Mr President, I was not only present, but am sure that I signed and I am not on the attendence list either."
"Mr President, I have a proposal to make."
"In view of this complete mess, it would be best if we declared for the first time that all the Members were present."
"That would settle the matter."
"Mr President, let me start with the good news: my name is on the attendance list."
"But it is also mentioned in Item 14, in the debate on the information society, whereas in fact the speaker was my colleague Wim van Velzen."
"Perhaps this could be amended."
"Mr President, I am not mentioned in the list of those present, but I am listed among those who took part in the nominal vote."
"Yesterday's voting list is correct and the names have been corrected."
"The matter could therefore easily be rectified by using the voting list."
"Mr President, I was present."
"I signed in and I voted in a roll-call vote but my name is not there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I note the problem, which is one that affects many Members."
"We will prepare a revised version of yesterday's attendance list, to deal with all the problems that have arisen."
"This, of course, is the first time the new computer program has been used. We will see how it turns out once it has settled."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Decision on urgency"
"I have to tell this House that the Committee has decided to vote against this urgent procedure, that is it does not accept the urgency requested by the Council because it does not find that reasons put forward by the Council to be well founded."
"(Parliament rejected the request for urgent procedure)"
"Mr President, the Committee is in favour of the urgent procedure and already reported yesterday that the subject could be debated in the plenary session."
"(Parliament approved the request for urgent procedure)"
"Cloning animals and human beings"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Commission on cloning animals and human beings."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the new developments as a result of the experiments in cloning which have been carried out in Scotland raise a range of new questions of law and ethics, which have to be considered with great care and attention."
"This is the first scientific success of its kind in the world for it is the first time an adult mammal has been cloned successfully."
"It is a major leap ahead in the field of basic science and our understanding of living beings."
"It opens up real prospects in the medical and agricultural fields."
"Yet this new technique also gives rise to a great many questions and anxieties, as shown by the mobilization of the press and the number of letters sent to the Commission."
"You were keen to include this subject in today's agenda and I welcome that initiative."
"This is a most important event and the European Union must on no account disregard its effects."
"As you know, the Commission reacted immediately and consulted the Advisory Group on Ethics and Biotechnology, an independent Commission body."
"That Group is due to submit its opinion in May."
"We do indeed need to consider in depth the ethical implications of cloning in general, in the light of the recent experiments."
"The Advisory Group has decided to organize a round table on the subject."
"It will include Members of the European Parliament and the Commission's services, senior researchers and the parties concerned."
"The Commission is actively encouraging the Advisory Group in this project, which ensures dialogue and transparency."
"Furthermore, the Commission services have been instructed to examine the possible implications for Community policies and consider what action it is in our power to take."
"It should be pointed out that these experiments raise an entirely new set of problems, in relation to the transfer of genetic information from an adult mammal into a receptor cell which is an unfertilized ovocyte - which had been thought totally impossible until now."
"Following this surprise result, we need to give ourselves the time to consider how far existing legislation at both national and Community level covers this kind of practice and whether there are any legal loopholes."
"It is important at this point to distinguish clearly between cloning animals and the potential cloning of human beings."
"For obvious ethical reasons there is at present a consensus within the international scientific community on banning research into human cloning."
"In this context, the Commission's Fourth Framework Programme specifically excludes this kind of research, following a resolution tabled by the European Parliament in 1993."
"Some Member States have also specifically banned it."
"The question is whether we need a strict moratorium at international level, in forums such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe."
"Turning to animal cloning, we need consider the ethical implications in greater depth, especially in relation to respect for the principles of animal welfare and biodiversity and, of course, the possible risks of extending this technique to human beings."
"At the same time we should not underestimate the potential benefits of this discovery for human health."
"It is clear that in the light of all the on-going discussions and, in particular, the opinion to be delivered by the Advisory Group, the Commission will adopt a clearly-defined position and take the appropriate measures within its powers."
"It is evident at this stage that the proposed Fifth Framework Programme of Research and Technological Development will take account of today's debate and ban any research that does not respect ethical principles."
"For the time being, it is important for us to allow room for an analysis of the possible repercussions of this discovery."
"In that context I believe we must emphasize the need for structured dialogue based on entirely reliable and objective information, leaving aside the legitimate feelings this event has inspired."
"I think that is of capital importance in a field such as this, which has profound philosophical implications and touches on everyone's most deeply-held beliefs."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ' Dolly' would no doubt have been a good subject for a Robert Louis Stevenson, H. G. Wells or Aldous Huxley novel and our colleagues in the Green Group have cleverly reminded us of that with the sense of drama typical of them today."
"The subject of cloning is fuelling the irrational speculations that tend to find their way into and sometimes cloud our debates whenever we address questions of bioethics."
"As responsible politicians it is our duty to keep a cool head, to look at and evaluate the scientific risk, without which no progress is possible for mankind, while initially upholding a few basic principles and elementary precautionary measures - no doubt there will be other reactions later."
"My group is in favour of affirming clearly that all human cloning must be banned."
"In fact I note that we go even further in the Rothley report where we propose banning the patenting of any intervention relating to reproductive genetic cells, which goes beyond cloning as such."
"So we support the Commission line in this regard."
"We clearly affirm the principles of the dignity and integrity of the human body and must reaffirm them here this week."
"We believe that the Advisory Group on bioethics, to whose work Mrs Cresson just referred and to which I pay tribute, needs to be transformed into a genuine European Union committee on ethics in order to give the politicians a clearer choice, without however taking their place."
"This is no trifling matter, for our diversity of our traditions and cultures becomes manifest when we come up against bioethical questions; yet this is a necessary progress."
"Mrs Cresson raised the question of a moratorium, although this does not apply to interventions with the human body where we have to impose an immediate ban."
"Perhaps one solution could be to impose an initial, limited moratorium on animal research."
"Finally, we believe we need transparent and effective information to guarantee that the debate remains calm, to avoid any panic reactions or deadlocks that could prejudice the future of mankind."
"Mr President, I appreciated Mrs Cresson's speech and I agree with Mr Cot."
"This really is a very delicate matter, and a clear distinction needs to be made between cloning human beings and cloning animals and plants generally."
"Obviously cloning presents problems in this latter area too, but they are different problems."
"I believe cloning of human beings should be totally banned and that is nothing new, because it was already the position of the European Parliament on 22 November 1993, and indeed in 1989, and it is already the law in some of our States."
"Here it is also right to recall that every committee of inquiry set up by the governments and parliaments of our countries - the Warnock Committee, the Benda Committee, the Santosuosso Committee, the Palacio Committee - has recommended a ban on cloning of human beings, for obvious reasons."
"The human species must be protected against the risk of damage to principle of equality - cloning could put those with political or economic power in a position to manipulate the human species to discriminate against individuals. But above all, as regards human beings, the person must be protected from risk, as an essential nucleus of freedom and individuality."
"As Mr Rothley pointed out in his 1989 report, freedom is also dependent on the fact that a known and definite future is impossible."
"It may seem a mysterious concept, but that is freedom too!"
"I believe respect for human beings demands a clear 'no' ."
"I believe Parliament must uphold this 'no' , and I believe the Commission must be supported in this aim."
"The Commission says we should go even further; well, let me go even further and repeat what the European Parliament already called for in a decision addressed to the Council of Europe last September: ' no' to cloning, but 'no' to experiments on human embryos too, because that is where cloning begins!"
"We must say 'no' , for the sake of human dignity, respect for the species and the principle of equality."
"I would be delighted if we said 'no' unanimously."
"There are problems of protecting biological diversity and safeguarding the environment in the animal and plant worlds too."
"To the extent that research is directed not to scoops for the newspapers, but to improvements in the human condition - thinking of all the research on medication - it cannot be stopped."
"We must not be against science."
"Instead we must be more cautious and demand strict and, above all, enforceable rules, because the fundamental problem in this area is enforcement."
"For all these reasons, I hope Parliament will immediately incorporate my remarks, which are in line with Mr Cot's, into a document and that the Commission will also promote an international agreement so that the human being is inviolable not only in Europe, but throughout the world, and that any manipulation of nature is done in the service of the human being."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a clone is a collection of cells all born from the same parent cell; their genetic stock is totally identical and gives them the same appearance."
"In the case of plants, reproduction by cloning is a natural process."
"In the case of animals and humans, the real twin, known as a 'homozygote' , which is the result of the splitting of a single egg, represents a natural clone."
"There is nothing disturbing or shocking about all that."
"However, are we allowed to manufacture artificially human clones by fusing the genetic stocks of two parent cells in order to reproduce identical individuals, given that individuals are by definition different one from the other since every human being is unique?"
"Why does our Western society feel so strongly about this?"
"A team of researchers in Scotland has just managed to produce a cloned sheep from the single somatic cell of an adult, parent sheep, i.e., without any sexual reproduction."
"The possibility of producing an individual that is entirely identical to its precedent, without any fusion of the parental gametes, is an assault on biodiversity, on the hazard of birth, which makes each of us a unique being."
"It is becoming possible to apply it to human beings, which opens the door to all sorts of aberrations."
"Yet we must not diabolize a technique that can bring progress if used on animals for the preparation of vaccines and medicines that are useful if not vital to human beings."
"In the United States, despite the proposals of the political leaders, some scientists are reluctant to advise a moratorium."
"One such is Professor Harold Varmus, Nobel Prize winner and director of the NIH."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is in the nature of scientists always to doubt, but the politician who is aware of the vagaries of human behaviour must, in his capacity of legislator, attempt to evaluate them more closely."
"Here in Europe we must consult the bodies responsible for bioethics, the Council of Europe, Unesco, the United Nations, and proclaim that we must ban all cloning of human beings, whether directly from the nuclei of embryo cells or indirectly by whatever method of asexual reproduction, using ovocytes from which the nucleus is removed as vectors and the nuclei of somatic cells as the basis of the genetic patrimony."
"So we must forbid any financing of this kind of research on human beings."
"That means we must set up the necessary monitoring system so that we can apply dissuasive and even penal measures, which could even include economic sanctions."
"These would be imposed on any states linked to the European Union that embark on this road, which is a minefield of risks and traps."
"Mr President, ever since the cloning of an innocent little animal has been so widely publicized in the media, we have plunged into the most breathtaking simplifications, as shown, incidentally, by the fact that some of our colleagues rigged themselves out in extremely misplaced and even grotesque masks a few minutes ago."
"People are referring to the monstrous experiments carried out fifty years ago without pointing out that it is not warped scientists who produce totalitarian regimes but quite the reverse."
"A democratic state has the means to protect society from abuses in every area and to ensure respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual, in biotechnology as in other research fields."
"In our view, research on living beings is a source of progress."
"Tomorrow we will have eradicated genetic diseases such as mucoviscidosis and phenylketonuria."
"Tomorrow, transplants of animal organs - a field in which cloning can in fact prove useful - will enable us to make up for the shortage of human organ donors."
"Given the rapid progress of this kind of research, it is important for the state to define the limits of and monitor rather than block this research; it must monitor the effects of this research on health and monitor respect for the integrity of the human being."
"At national level, scientific and medical ethical committees would act as guarantees in every research centre."
"At international level, as has been said, a number of conventions, from the 1946 Nuremberg Code to the 1996 European Convention on Bioethics, have already banned any useless genetic manipulation that conflicts with our concept of the human being, such as cloning, implanting a human embryo in the uterus of a different species or vice versa, and so forth."
"All we need do is to introduce systematic bans, within limits, under an international convention or under agreements with other countries such as the United States or Japan, where genetic research is very advanced."
"Ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of the third millennium let us not give way to the irrational fears of the first millennium in face of research which can have its dark side but which can also promise a future to men and women afflicted by disease."
"Man's greatness resides in his constant desire to know the world around him and to know himself."
"Mr President, the cloning of Dolly the sheep has opened a Pandora's Box."
"What can in practice be done with mammals will soon be done to humans."
"It seems that the nightmare of human beings as a stock of spare parts and a reserve of children stored in the cold box is becoming a reality."
"In cloning mammals we are taking the first step into Huxley's Brave New World."
"To clone people would be horrific, a violation of human dignity, an attack on the individuality and integrity of man."
"Man would be degraded into an object, into biological material."
"This breach of ethics must be prevented."
"But ethics cannot just begin with our own species. Cloning animals is also reprehensible."
"It degrades animals into mass products, living conveyor belts."
"Live animals are regarded as mass-produced goods, as machines, which will give a boost to the intensive stock-farming that is so cruel to animals."
"Today we are all talking about ethics and the risk of breeding humans."
"But the individual and unique quality of life does not just begin with humans."
"Dolly and other animals are also living beings."
"We agree on calling for a ban on cloning humans."
"But how do we as the European Parliament stand on the cloning of animals?"
"We must ban that too."
"We must not simply become accustomed to the plague and warn against cholera."
"The cloning of mammals already represents a shift of ethical boundaries."
"The cloning of animals and humans must be taboo."
"This insidious ethical breach is a step into a future that fills us with horror."
"In 1993, following Jerry Hall's experiments in cloning human embryos, the European Parliament called unanimously for a ban on cloning."
"Yet nothing happened."
"The statement by the Commissioner and the position of the EU Commission are pitiful."
"It has refrained from taking comprehensive political measures."
"Today the Commissioner merely said that it was considering taking action."
"EU money continues to flow directly or indirectly into ethically dubious projects."
"Although cloning infringes a basic ethical consensus in our society, the EU Commission delegates the question of cloning animals to the Biotechnology Advisory Group."
"What a demonstration of political impoverishment and eyewash!"
"The advisory group has even been instructed by the Commission to ensure that gene technology gains acceptance."
"Society must set ethical limits for science and not the reverse."
"Shifting the ethical discussion to committees that have no democratic legitimacy is merely at attempt to tranquillize the public."
"We must not remain silent on the matter of the economic basis for this either."
"To ban cloning while at the same time permitting cloning and cloned living beings is absurd!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to you to discuss this matter a little more calmly and to try to differentiate between what we agree on, namely to ban human cloning, and what we perhaps do not yet agree on, namely our position on other cloning in nature."
"When I listened to the Commissioner a moment ago, I was rather taken aback to hear her refer to a surprise result."
"For if we were honest, we would admit that of course we realised long ago that we would be facing this situation one day."
"This is a clear sign that there is no dialogue between the political and the research level."
"But we must have one in future."
"Our task, your task, Mrs Cresson, and ours as the European Parliament is to discuss this matter with the researchers: what do we want, what is the purpose of research, what is the ethical responsibility of research in our society?"
"And that is just what we are discussing today."
"That is why I am convinced that we need to have a world-wide moratorium on the cloning of animals, and that does not mean I am convinced that there will be no more cloning of animals."
"Nature does it by itself."
"Nature reproduces itself asexually and clones itself without our intervention."
"I am also convinced that in individual cases cloning can be ethically valuable and very important for people; but we must define the limits of the usefulness of experiments."
"We must clearly define where they could be useful to humans."
"To what extent are they morally and ethically acceptable to society?"
"It is our task to establish that."
"A round table between the Commission and the European Parliament is not sufficient."
"What we need is a world-wide round table at government level."
"That is why I would ask you, Mrs Cresson, to urge the governments of North America, Canada, the United States and Japan to send responsible representatives who would then also have the authority to issue directives and take decisions."
"We must be able to state clearly what our views are, what moral responsibility we must assume and where we draw the limits."
"And then laws will have to be decided."
"We will then have to pass laws that apply throughout the world."
"At present it is not a question of saying what we lack in the Union but of saying where our ethical limits are in the world."
"I ask you, Mrs Cresson, to assume your responsibility in relation to this question for the European Union, together with North America and Japan and the rest of the world."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, modern biotechnology offers us great opportunities."
"This afternoon we will be discussing the Trakatellis report on the use of micro-organisms for producing medicines and other substances."
"I am in favour of being very liberal about this because we have to support the undertakings in making advances here."
"But now comes the big 'but' . When it is a question of applying this to human beings, of manipulating human beings, I think we cannot be strict enough."
"Mrs Cresson referred to a consensus against human cloning."
"This consensus still seems to exist."
"But unless we are very careful, it will very quickly be eroded and I have already heard some disturbing statements made."
"Just as in the case of seed manipulation, people will argue that surely exceptions can be made in many individual cases, so that in the end we will no longer be able to avoid an ethical breach."
"And let me openly ask this: why should a society have the power to stop cloning once and for all if it is not in a position to stop parents in Europe from aborting their child if it is a girl and they wanted a boy?"
"This is intolerable and shows that we have already gone too far in many areas."
"That is why I agree with those speakers who say that we must act very quickly and very strictly now, using every available means at European level and at UNESCO level."
"What we are discussing now is not progress for human dignity but a threat to human dignity, so we have to take very strong action."
"A final comment on the Advisory Group on Biotechnology and Ethics."
"It has been said here that it should deal with the question."
"If my information is correct - and this is my last question - the situation is that this advisory group will only be working until June and that it has a whole lot of other jobs to do too."
"Then it is to stop for six months, after which it will be set up again."
"I do not think we can allow ourselves that at this stage."
"The group has to continue working and if it is to have a new membership, perhaps this can be done at the same time."
"But then Parliament should also be involved in the appointment of its new membership."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the subject is not a new one, and has not suddenly descended from the skies like a thunderbolt."
"We have known about it for 15 years."
"At that time certain restrictions were imposed, but they have not proved sufficient to halt this uncontrolled advance."
"This raises a number of questions:"
"Who has been financing this research?"
"Governments, or the private sector?"
"Who monitored the research protocols, especially those funded by governments, so that today we can say with certainty that those experiments were carried out only with animals?"
"Nobody has so far been able convincingly to disprove information that such experiments have also been carried out with human beings."
"Neither has anybody so far disproved what we all read the other day in one of the United Kingdom's major newspapers, that there is a four-year old child in Belgium who is the product of cloning."
"And we, ladies and gentlemen, are still sitting here and talking at the theoretical level."
"Very well, the Committee will be formed, and I favour its formation. However, Madam Commissioner, I have not heard what sanctions we as the European Parliament will be imposing in the event that researchers exceed the permitted limits and the experiments are extended to human beings."
"Will those penalties be theoretical?"
"Will they only be penal?"
"Or should there be huge financial penalties, especially when the experiments are funded by governments?"
"I very much fear that the same thing may happen as in the case of BSE."
"We will debate, debate, debate, and when the tragic outcome of experiments in human beings appear before us, then like the foolish virgins in the Bible, we will shed tears over the ruins that we ourselves, through our own incapabilities, will have created."
"Mr President, a clear 'no' to human cloning is emerging from the debate; but I believe that an unequivocal 'no' to cloning of animals is needed too, because where there is cloning of animals, there is almost bound to be cloning of human beings as well, and we really ought to be wondering today how we ever came to be talking about cloning."
"Here we must stress the link with the development of genetic engineering and the links with the patenting of transgenic animals."
"The consequence will be series production of living beings outside the laws of nature, and instead of animals being bred by natural reproduction they will be produced non-sexually, like plant cuttings."
"The laws of nature are clearly being overthrown, just as they were with BSE."
"The purpose of such techniques is not scientific knowledge, but industrial production of a commercial product, for example, animal organs to be used as spare parts for human beings."
"But human beings and animals are not machines whose organs can be automatically replaced by organs adapted from other animals."
"As regards scientific knowledge, we have already known a great deal about cloning for fifty years, so the technique is well known; but it does not mean everything that is possible has to be done."
"That mistake has already been made by applying knowledge of the nuclear structure of matter to make the atomic bomb."
"Freedom of research cannot be confused with the free will that led man to use that deadly bomb, that led to Chernobyl incident and BSE."
"How many more incidents have to happen?"
"Experiments in cloning may have succeeded in establishing a new frontier in bio-genetic research, but they have opened up the problem of the limits that should or should not be set on experimental scientific research."
"In fact, while cloning represents an important scientific achievement, in a society where there are great needs to be met by scarce resources, it is ethically necessary to study, classify and regulate such experiments."
"So in our view a high-ranking scientific committee should be set up to study the ethical and legal implications and the possible scenarios opened up by genetic cloning."
"We should also support the conclusions of the European Council's resolution of 16 March 1989, as well as the results of the first Convention on Bio-ethics, approved in December 1996, which banned both human and animal cloning, and we should work to impose limits on the scientific process that respect ethical values and serve to shield the human being from possible manipulation by science."
"Mr President, there is no limit on the curiosity of scientists."
"There is nothing they do not want to know but there has to be a limit put by society on that curiosity."
"Fifty years ago or more there was no limit and we know what the results were of allowing scientists to discover anything they wanted to."
"There is consensus this morning amongst us from fifteen different countries that there has to be a limit on the cloning of human beings until we have thought about it."
"There has to be control on animal cloning."
"I come from the country where this experiment took place."
"In the United Kingdom there are limits, there is legislation and there is a regulatory body but the average citizen of the United Kingdom was not aware that this sort of work was being carried on."
"The average citizen must be aware of what work is being carried on when we get near to the frontiers of what is acceptable and in some cases beyond those frontiers."
"The European Union exists partly so that we can work together and give value and share our experiences."
"Therefore I am delighted that when we look at the fifth framework programme, as we looked at the fourth, we from all those fifteen countries say: ' That is enough."
"You may be curious but you are not going to work on that subject.' The consensus this morning amongst most groups shows that the Commissioner is quite right to take further the regulatory body that she has in mind and she has seen that there is a wish to have that strengthened."
"I can assure you that the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy will be looking very carefully at the ethical dimensions of the fifth framework programme."
"Mr President, I am glad I can speak in this debate."
"I suspect that, including the Commissioner, I am the only person taking part in the debate this morning, who has actually been to the Roslin Research Institute."
"I went there in November with Mr Martin, Vice-President of Parliament."
"I must say that one of the things wrong with this debate is that nobody has paid tribute to the talented research team at Roslin which has conducted these experiments."
"It is time somebody did so."
"It is also time that some people read Brave New World by Aldous Huxley."
"The point of this book is that it is the brainwashing that matters, not the cloning so I wish people who refer to it would read the book."
"The technology is important."
"It brings benefits: it brings problems."
"There is no question about that."
"There are implications for science and implications for medicine and we would be well advised to recognize that there are ethical problems in using the technology."
"There are ethical problems in not using the technology as well."
"Both sides of the argument need to be examined."
"I am aware that under the Commission presidency of Jacques Delors the Biotechnology Advisory Group was set up."
"I took part in discussions leading to it being set up and I am pleased that Mr Delors at the time took that brave new initiative."
"But the problem with this Group is that it does not have a high enough profile."
"Most people in this Parliament do not know of its existence."
"They do not know who are members, how people become members, what its agenda is and how that agenda is set and they have not seen its reports."
"If we are going to take this whole question of ethics seriously, we need to give the Biotechnology Advisory Group a much higher profile."
"We need to know all these things."
"We need to know who the members are."
"We need to know how they are appointed."
"We need to read their reports and we need to give them the responsibility not just of investigating the ethical problems but also of making recommendations for the future conduct of this kind of science."
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt and others made reference to the fact that there are international implications."
"Of course there are."
"We cannot assume that because we have something under control in the European Union it is universally under control."
"It is not."
"Therefore, when Mrs Roth-Behrendt suggested that Commissioner Cresson should have responsibility for promoting discussions among the Americans and Japanese and so on, she is absolutely right."
"How quickly that can be done is another matter but I have no doubt whatsoever that we need a global solution to what is a global problem even if it has all arisen from a nine-month old sheep that is living in the equivalent of a sheep's Hilton Hotel at the moment."
"I should like to assure Mrs Breyer that there is no cruelty involved in Dolly."
"She is a very happy sheep and probably rather happier than are Members in this Assembly."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to you very carefully."
"Firstly, everyone agrees on the need to ban human cloning, which is hardly surprising."
"We must reaffirm this and make quite sure this ban is not overturned."
"So we must take very strict measures to ensure that."
"Let me immediately reassure those who asked the question."
"The European Union certainly did not finance the cloning of Dolly the sheep."
"This was financed at local level."
"Furthermore, in relation to the rather risky comparisons made with mad cow disease, let me remind you that BSE is not s much a scientific but more of a commercial and financial problem."
"Nor is it a research problem; rather, the problem lies in the lack of strict veterinary controls and the laxity of some of these controls."
"This is not at all a research problem."
"A number of you spoke of the Advisory Committee on Ethics and Biotechnology."
"That committee exists, it has been set up, it is extremely active and has done some very thorough work."
"That said, I do admit that this work should be more accessible."
"I quite agree that the ethical committee's work needs to be publicized more widely and that the Members of the European Parliament should have wider access to it."
"Furthermore, as I said in my opening statement, I agree that MEPs should take their due place at the round table side by side with the ethical committee and high-level scientists, to ensure that this is a democratic debate."
"There are indeed scientific issues on the one hand and issues of democracy on the other."
"What was said a moment ago is quite right: the aberrations we have witnessed during certain periods of our history, and which we are of course right to fear for the future, are due to an absence of democracy."
"Science is obviously an issue, not just science however, but also the social and political system in which science evolves."
"That is why this social and political system has to be extremely careful about scientific advances and why scientific advances must be publicized in such a way as to ensure that they can be monitored and if necessary anticipated by imposing bans such as the ban on cloning human beings."
"That is how to prevent and stop any prejudicial philosophical and ethical excesses."
"Before drafting any international agreement, which would indeed be entirely desirable, I think it is important for us to reach agreement at European level."
"Quite apart from the question of cloning, I find that the ethical principles in the field of biotechnology are not the same in the various Member States."
"I have always regretted the fact that we do not have an ethical committee in every Member State, as I have often said to the Council of Research Ministers."
"Some of the major European Union countries do not have an ethical committee, probably because they have not managed to define certain basic principles."
"If every Member State, like France for example, had an ethical committee that brought together scientists, philosophers, specialists in biotechnology, jurists, magistrates, humanists, in short a committee of this kind chaired by someone with an unblemished reputation, that would be a good step forward."
"I am not suggesting that all our states would then agree on everything, but I am saying that we should agree on a platform and that would be a big step forward."
"We would then be in a much stronger position to discuss these matters with the Americans and the Japanese and to establish principles."
"After all, we must not be blinkered: for instance, if we ban certain scientific practices in Europe, then European researchers, especially those working for major laboratories, will go and do their research in the United States."
"So it is entirely in our interest - and you are quite right here - to reach agreement with our major international competitors."
"But if we are to do so we must first reach agreement among ourselves."
"Today, however, there is every indication that aside from extreme cases such as human cloning, on which everyone agrees, we have not yet quite managed to do so."
"I would therefore hope that such national ethical committees will he be set up very rapidly and that you, who relay what has been said here to your own Member States, will plead the cause of these national ethical committees at home too."
"That would give the ethical committee set up by the Commission, under President Santer, far more influence."
"It would also give far more influence to an ethical committee that is chaired by a person of unblemished reputation, Mrs Nöelle Lenoir, who also works for the Council of Europe and who has a very wide following, even outside Europe."
"So we must underpin this structure, improve its image, not just in Europe but internationally."
"That is one measure to be taken by each of our Member States."
"Thank you for your extremely useful contributions to this debate."
"Once again, I am entirely in favour of the European Parliament taking part in the activities that will commence in the next few weeks."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure ."
"The votes on those motions will be taken on Wednesday at 12 noon."
"Closing of the Renault plant in Belgium"
"The next item is the debate on the statement by the Commission on the closure of the Renault plant in Belgium."
"Mr President, the announcement by Renault to close its plant in Vilvoorde has caused shock and consternation."
"This is a reaction that I fully understand."
"The loss of 3, 100 jobs is a disaster for the workers concerned, for their families and for Vilvoorde itself."
"The decision by Renault has also provoked outrage because of its abruptness and its apparent lack of concern for the rights of the employees."
"Renault management, in a manner which I can only describe as irresponsible, did not comply with its obligations as regards information and consultation of workers' representatives prior to its decision."
"In this respect the provisions of the European Works Council Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive have been completely ignored."
"There are many calls for new European legislation."
"I understand this."
"But we must also appreciate the present situation is fully covered by the two existing directives."
"The relevant national measures contain machinery to ensure their enforcement."
"However, there has to be a serious question mark over whether the scale of sanctions envisaged under national law is sufficient to act as a real deterrent against non-compliance."
"In this regard it is useful to recall that in 1992 the Member States rejected the Commission's proposals for tougher sanctions on noncompliance by companies with the worker consultation and information procedures."
"I believe that we have now reached the situation where we need to complement the existing Community rules with more general rules to make information and consultation compulsory on a permanent basis for all relevant aspects of the management of companies at national level."
"In this context, the issue of adequate sanctions for non-respect will be a crucial one."
"I will propose to the Commission that we proceed in the coming weeks with the first-stage consultation of the social partners at European level on this issue."
"I sincerely hope that we are able, through this action, to strengthen the protection of workers."
"I know that the European Parliament has been asking for such rules for quite a long time, and in your recent report on the Commission Communication of 14 November 1995 on worker information and consultation you again supported this idea."
"So I can count on you to help to obtain this objective."
"But the most important lesson to be drawn from the situation concerns the credibility of the European process."
"The Vilvoorde case shows that we still have some way to go to strike the right balance between corporate and economic needs on the one hand and the social requirements of workers and society as a whole on the other."
"Getting that balance right is crucial to ensuring popular acceptance of the integration process."
"This is why I believe that the incorporation of the social protocol in the Treaty is vital in this respect: to ensure that social legislation applies and is implemented across the territory of the Union as a whole."
"Without this the internal market will not function."
"This case raises other issues too: questions regarding the need for tighter monitoring of state aids, closer coordination of fiscal and social charges."
"These are very sensitive issues."
"The Commission will examine them attentively to see what can be done."
"It is ironic, however, in this respect, that Renault was one of the first companies to conclude in 1993 a voluntary agreement with workers' representatives in anticipation of the implementation of the European Works Council Directive."
"I believe that Renault's conduct in this matter may do much to poison the position and hinder the hitherto non-legislative approach to implementation of the European Works Council Directive."
"We all know that companies are called upon to make hard commercial decisions, but if industry loses its ability to make those decisions as transparent as possible and fails even to attempt to explain the reasons to the workforce, or to seek to negotiate alternatives to closures, then the very core of our social consensus is under attack."
"Such an attitude would be reprehensible enough within one country, but when the issues are transnational in nature, then the need for openness and consultation is even greater."
"The threatened closure of the Vilvoorde plant is a huge blow to the workers and their families."
"I can only hope that out of this tragedy might come a renewed awareness of the need for adequate social measures to accompany the internal market and a renewed determination to implement those measures in an effective way."
"If this is so then all will not have been in vain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Renault, which for a long time was nationalized and which served as a social show-piece, was recently privatized. Most of its capital is owned by private investors and it now faces competition from world markets and has to adapt its industrial plant, which is too widely dispersed and diversified in Europe."
"Hoover and JVC in fact did the same recently."
"We must look at the decision to close the Vilvorde site in this context, not as an isolated measure or a sanction but quite certainly as a strategic industrial decision that will enable Renault to cope with the fact that European automobile market has declined more than expected from the Commission's forecasts - based on the fact that in 1996 less than three million vehicles were sold - and, in the long term, to protect the jobs of 140 000 Renault employees who would have suffered the consequences if this decision had not been taken."
"In the eyes of public opinion, it is indeed difficult to see why a French undertaking should decide to close down one of its sites outside its own country; but this decision, for which the Renault management is entirely responsible, was certainly encouraged by a relative and comparative analysis of the production costs."
"That is why this decision, which disturbs us so much, must induce all those who are responsible for the future of Europe to realise the need to create a European social area."
"It was indeed in that spirit that Jacques Chirac submitted a memorandum to our European partners more than a year ago concerning the adoption of a European social model."
"The creation of a European social model and a European social area is as important as social dialogue."
"Pending that, the heads of undertakings must, however, apply the instruments at their disposal properly; for in this situation of merciless competition they cannot, for economic reasons, not observe the rules of the game in relation to human beings."
"Unless they do so, revocation action will have to be taken in the absence of agreement or dialogue."
"At the same time, in the framework of the intergovernmental conference, it is important for the social protocol to be incorporated in the treaty."
"Mr President, the brutal and unilateral decision taken by the management of Renault to close its subsidiary in Vilvorde profoundly shocked European public opinion."
"This attitude, which reflects the most savage form of capitalism and which I cannot accept, has thrown 3 100 workers and their families on the streets."
"Yet Renault was one of the first companies in Europe to conclude voluntary agreements on worker information and consultation, as the Commissioner pointed out."
"So why did it infringe the directive setting up European works councils and the one of collective redundancies?"
"Do the laws of the market in themselves justify the shameful dismissal of skilled workers, the victims of globalization and pitiless competition?"
"I am a liberal, but I cannot tolerate the law of the jungle."
"I have always been in favour of an economy in the service of man and not vice versa."
"Today the people of Europe no longer understand and, in particular, will no longer tolerate unjustified closures of companies and the lack of solidarity between the Member States of the Union."
"Europe cannot progress unless the governments that make it up demonstrate a genuine social and collective conscience."
"This crisis, one among many, one too many, will, we hope, be the long-awaited spark that will fire the creation of a social Europe."
"The solidarity of the Renault workers, be they Belgian, French or Spanish, will have set a good example to everybody."
"It is up to us, and above all to our heads of government, to do their utmost to incorporate the social protocol and the provisions on promoting employment in the coming treaty."
"I believe in Europe, in union among our peoples, in our human resources, which constitute our wealth."
"Let us not sacrifice them on the altar of pure profit."
"Mr President, I have little time so I will confine myself to a few comments."
"First, regarding the Renault decision, clearly the method is unacceptable."
"An undertaking or a company cannot decide the social and economic collapse of a region without any kind of consultation or redevelopment programme."
"Renault did not respect the two directives, on collective redundancies and on works councils."
"What do we conclude from that?"
"Of course the Commission has no way of enforcing respect for these directives."
"There is no provision for sanctions."
"However, it could ask Renault to review its decision and, if it does not, to refuse it and other firms that pursue the same practice access to a whole range of potential benefits."
"I am thinking of access to Community programmes, to R&D programmes and to any structural fund assistance."
"Turning to the structural funds, my first comment is that it is unacceptable for undertakings to apply a specific method that consists of aggregating the advantages offered by the use of the structural funds or the cohesion fund and delocalizing in relation to this cohesion fund and these structural funds."
"In short, it is unacceptable to play on social disparities."
"Of course, this calls for action by the European Union at the current intergovernmental conference."
"My second comment is that it is essential to encourage an extensive economy and to discourage an intensive economy, just as we are against intensive farming."
"Let me point out in this regard that the OECD is currently considering a multilateral agreement on investment, which promises us lots of new Renault cases."
"I think we must be extremely careful here."
"Mr President, the announcement of the closure of the Renault plant in Vilvorde has aroused very strong feelings."
"3 100 workers will lose their jobs, a modern factory that cost 8.5 billion in investment will be put up for auction: this is an intolerable waste."
"Yet the same day Renault shares soared by 13 % on the Paris stock market."
"What kind of symbol of French and European policy is it to give precedence to finance and show contempt for people, sacrificing employment and industrial plant to dividends?"
"Lives destroyed, prospects gone: the financiers could not care less, provided they earn money!"
"Redundancies, more redundancies, to reduce the cost of labour and become more competitive: that is the sole recipe of the European single market and single currency."
"It is not just inhumane, it is also an economic disaster."
"The share of wages and salaries in a Renault car fell from 23 % to 12 % between 1980 and 1995."
"Over the same period, Renault's market shares fell by one third, both in France and in Europe."
"Since 1986, Renault has made profits of 40 billion. What did it do with them?"
"But the workers, the people, will not necessarily go on accepting being sacrificed for much longer."
"There are signs of increasing protest, reaction and solidarity."
"The first European strike on 7 March made that very clear."
"This morning, a rally in Boulogne-Billancourt will reflect this and there will be a number of other actions."
"Let me pay tribute here to the determination and courage of the Vilvorde workers and to the combative spirit they have shown, as also to their French colleagues, who have also been affected by dismissals and who have, by their action, defeated the management's attempt to create divisiveness in order to impose its plan."
"Our group demands the withdrawal in its entirety of the Schweitzer plan and the opening of negotiations with the trade unions."
"The Renault management must be made to choose other options."
"For instance, we must object to the 2.6 million in financial levies in order to improve purchasing power, reduce working hours without any fall in wages and finally give a say to the workers by giving them new rights."
"Through our proposals, our actions, our solidarity with the Renault workers, we want to do all we can to help build a Europe that is genuinely social and democratic, unlike the Europe of today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten days ago more than 3000 workers fell victim to capitalist terrorism."
"What else can we call Renault's decision to close its plant at Vilvoorde?"
"Even specialists in the car-making sector have been absolutely stunned by the developments, since Renault Vilvoorde was regarded as a model plant."
"It was modern and productive, and its workforce had been extremely cooperative, accepting greater accountability, more flexibility, longer working hours and above all lower wages."
"It all goes to show just how scandalous this decision is, and Vilvoorde has become the latest in a long line of plant closures."
"In 1986, we had a debate here in Parliament about the tyre manufacturer Michelin, which had made its workers collectively redundant on the last day before the summer holidays."
"That must never be allowed to happen again."
"Ten years further on, pitifully few of the promised social improvements have actually been made."
"What good is Europe for the millions of unemployed if it does not recognize the right to work as a basic human right?"
"What good is the Union if it cannot even ensure that its own legislation is properly enforced?"
"The planned closure of Renault Vilvoorde actually contravenes two directives, the 1984 directive on works councils and the 1975 directive on collective redundancies, as well as Belgium's implementing legislation."
"The second of these two directives was tightened up after what happened at Michelin, but by no means enough, since it simply introduced sanctions for anyone failing to comply with the European legislation."
"In 1991, Parliament adopted a text which would have made collective redundancies by multinationals invalid if they did not follow the provisions of the directive, but once again the Council of Ministers refused to follow our lead."
"So now the multinationals have carte blanche , but the fact is that even the European multinationals could not care less about the Council, the Commission or the European Parliament."
"For them, the only voice they need to listen to is that of their shareholders."
"Nobody else."
"And who holds a 48 % share in Renault? The French State."
"That is why I propose that the French Government should use its position of power to force Renault to hold an extraordinary general meeting as soon as possible, with only one item on the agenda: the reversal of the decision to close Renault Vilvoorde."
"The French Government claims that it is serious about Europe, so it should use its share ownership to force Renault to obey the European directives."
"The Renault decision has proved that the unanimity rule in the Council needs to be abolished."
"The Amsterdam summit must change things so that decisions with social implications are taken by a qualified majority, if the Treaty is finally to be taken seriously."
"Today, social Europe is an empty vessel."
"Over the last 21 years, only three European directives have been introduced on works councils."
"Two of them are involved in this issue today, and both have been flouted."
"Seven other directives have been held up in the Council for years."
"The Commission too needs to do more than just keep an official record of how directives are transposed, and the motion for a resolution which I have tabled on behalf of my group puts forward a number of practical proposals in this respect."
"Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow marks Europe's fortieth anniversary."
"We have now had ten days to consider Renault Vilvoorde's problems, ten days in which we have seen just how little progress has been made in those 40 years."
"Mr President, let me say at the outset that it is always a tragedy when a workplace closes or moves to another country, not least for the employees."
"In this particular case, the closure of the Renault plant at Vilvoorde in Belgium, the EU Commission has shown an enormous amount of interest."
"One might wish that such interest were always shown when a workplace closes or moves, and perhaps especially when the reason for the closure has something to do with money from the EU Structural Funds."
"I would like to inform Parliament of a concrete case in Denmark."
"It concerns the American-owned Boston Scientific Corporation at Stenløse, where 258 employees will be put out onto the street at the end of 1997, because the firm is moving to Ireland with support from the EU Structural Funds."
"It is quite unreasonable and does not constitute a proper use of EU funds."
"Money from the Structural Funds should not be used to switch unemployment from one Member State to another."
"That is surely a distortion of competition."
"Mr President, there is more to this whole question of who is responsible for thousands of Flemish workers at Vilvoorde being made redundant without even the slightest attempt at consultation."
"It is all too easy just to point the finger at the Renault management, but in fact the European Commission and the Belgian Government must also take their share of the blame."
"Firstly the Commission, whose indignation at the closure of the Renault plant had a very hollow ring, in my opinion."
"It is the Commission which is always saying that the car industry needs to be moved to cheaper countries such as Spain or Portugal in order to put up stronger competition against non-European producers."
"It is the Commission which grants billions in subsidies for these relocations."
"And it is the Commission more than anyone else which turns a blind eye to unfair competition from third countries."
"So if it is true that Renault is to transfer a large proportion of its production to Turkey and Brazil, we should now be asking ourselves what measures the Commission intends to take to prevent many other companies from doing the same in future, leaving Europe an industrial graveyard."
"Do not think that I am in favour of out-and-out protectionism."
"I am simply saying that there is absolutely no point in making European firms, which pay their workers relatively high wages and are subject to all kinds of rules and regulations, compete with countries where social legislation, environmental regulations and so forth are virtually non-existent."
"This is not free trade, it is suicide."
"Blame must also, and above all, be laid on the shoulders of the Belgian Government under Jean-Luc Dehaene, which has allowed our wage costs to become some of the highest in the world, which for years has scorned our demands for more firms to have their financial and economic base in Flanders, and which has sold out practically the entire Belgian economy to exclusively foreign and French interest groups."
"It is also the Belgian Government which has meekly accepted the Walloon socialists' demands and has prevented the Flemish economy from bringing its wage costs down."
"We are now counting the cost of this policy."
"The fact that Dehaene knew about the closure days in advance and chose to make monkeys out of the Vilvoorde workforce shows just what sort of a man he is."
"It is as well to know these things about someone whose ambition it is to become a member of the European Commission."
"Finally, I have to say that the manner in which Renault is carrying out this closure is also absolutely scandalous."
"We know Mr Schweitzer to be a typical example of the French socialist apparatchiks ."
"So this is the human face of socialism!"
"Mr President, unlike Mr Vanhecke, who has just given us a laughable account of who he thinks is to blame for all this, I should like to thank the Commission for its severe condemnation of the sudden closure of Renault Vilvoorde, and for its commitment regarding the measures which it has just announced."
"Commissioner, I hope that you will act on what you have said, and that Renault Vilvoorde and the international solidarity we are currently seeing will give new impetus to progress on social Europe."
"I agree with you that Europe's credibility is at stake here more than ever, because how are we to explain to people that the Commission can intervene to prevent firms from receiving government aid, but not to prevent closures where even the most basic rules of worker consultation have been flouted?"
"That is why I am particularly pleased that you are proposing to tighten up the directive, and I hope that you will press on with this as quickly as possible."
"I would urge you not to leave it up to the Member States to decide on the sanctions to be introduced, but to establish them at European level, because everyone knows that if you leave it up to the Member States, it will simply lead to more competition in terms of attracting investment."
"I would also urge the Commission to establish instruments which it can itself use in future to intervene in cases where legislation is as blatantly flouted as it has been with Renault Vilvoorde."
"I also expect the Commission to use all its political and legislative powers to enforce the existing directives, to force the management to reverse its decision and to seek alternative solutions such as shorter working hours, which have already been proposed."
"I hope that all the government leaders and politicians who are now so indignant about the Renault Vilvoorde closure will refuse to accept a revised version of the Treaty which does not focus on employment and social policy, and will force the negotiators to arrive at a new agreement."
"Mr President, let me say one thing at the outset."
"While we all deplore the absence of a social Europe, it is worth pointing out that, apart from the statement by Mrs Green, this debate has so far been entirely binational."
"I think that is a pity and shows that within this Chamber there is still a lack of European spirit."
"Speakers were right to criticize the attitude of Renault, which decided to close the Vilvorde plant for no clearly explained economic reason, without any prior consultation with the organizations representing the workers and with no flanking social and reconversion plan for the workers who will be left high and dry."
"This has been said and the Commissioner has shed tears, sincere ones I believe, about the fact that Renault has infringed or ignored the spirit if not the letter of the European directives."
"Yet I think it is perhaps a sign of a certain collective hypocrisy to suggest that the problem would have been resolved if the announcement had been made under better conditions, if there had been consultation, if there had been respect for the procedures set out in the European directives."
"I think anyone who believes that the problem created by Renault's brutal decision could have been resolved simply by adopting a more severe approach, however welcome that might be, and imposing certain social rules is making a big mistake."
"This business obviously reflects a lack of solidarity, the lack of a social Europe, but there is also a fundamental economic problem, namely that at present the automobile industry is faced with a 30 % surplus capacity, with a 7 % annual increase in productivity and a 1 % rise in demand."
"In other words, unless we take measures, we will automatically create a rise in unemployment of 6 % a year."
"That is the economic reality facing us."
"What approach should we take?"
"We should certainly not take state capitalism measures and make the tax-payer pay for the loss of productivity; on the other hand we should certainly pursue a concerted policy of boosting demand and take support, reconversion and flanking measures, making more use of the structural funds, as was done for the mining and shipbuilding industries."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, do not confine yourselves to deploring the lack of solidarity or social correctness."
"What is needed here is economic action."
"You cannot escape the need to take serious economic action in this sector."
"Mr President, Renault's sudden decision to close its Belgian plant at Vilvoorde is seen by many people as a double failure: the failure of Europe and the failure of the liberal market economy."
"But I see it as neither of these things."
"If a major European employer and producer inflicts the consequences of its company strategy on the community as it has done here, then that community is entitled to examine the company strategy and question whether it is sound."
"Until two years ago, Renault was a state-owned company and the French State is still a 47 or 48 % shareholder."
"So if Renault represents the failure of any form of capitalism, it is state capitalism."
"But there is more to it than that."
"A liberal market economy is not a licence to be short-sighted."
"We have known about the problems of Europe's car industry in general, and that of France in particular, for years now, and I cannot help thinking that the Renault management, having spent far too long carping and complaining, has now tried to find a way out by suddenly closing one of its plants outside France, one of the most productive in its group."
"In doing so, it is not only flouting two European directives, it has also dealt a severe blow to people's faith in European solidarity."
"It is doing Europe a very bad service, and that is a most regrettable state of affairs."
"Mr President, we had the opportunity to hear the workers in question last week and we are amazed that they are so surprised at the decision of a company which shows a total lack of respect for their work, their effort and their future - and for the future of the region in which the company is located."
"We are amazed, let me repeat, that they should be so surprised."
"We agree with what Mr Santer said about the lack of credibility of the European institutions when a question such as this arises; it is correct."
"We spend months and months here discussing certain directives on the protection of workers' rights and when the moment of truth comes no effective sanction can be taken to see that they are respected."
"In a letter sent to the Group chairmen, the management bases its decision on competitiveness and I think we should start to reflect about where this zealous pursuit of competitiveness of European industries and of world industries in general is taking us."
"We shall never be able to compete with the starvation wages and union rights of the countries of the third world and Eastern Europe."
"This is therefore a race we cannot win."
"The Renault factory has in the past six years increased its productivity by 200 000 units and has cut its workforce by 7 000."
"Now it seems that is not enough; greater productivity must be sought; greater competitiveness."
"It seems to us that the European Union should manage to get sanctions imposed against companies which do not comply with Community law and the Commission and the Parliament would be well advised to demand the revocation of a decision which so clearly runs counter to Community law."
"We do not think this will be the last case; strong measures need to be taken requiring negotiation with the workers, as called for in the European Works Council Directive and the Collective Redundancies Directive."
"Mr President, Vilvorde is a textbook case."
"This is indeed the end result of the ultra-liberal policy that a majority of EU governments support and that many of the Commission's services also pursue."
"It is no use raising the alarm after the house has burnt down."
"There is no use crying over the ruins or criticizing the brutality of certain announcements of plant closures, involving mass redundancies."
"We must draw all the necessary lessons from the Renault affair if we are to avoid this kind of economic and social disaster."
"It is time, indeed, to be firm and, above all, to show imagination and also to condemn the hypocrisy of certain management circles."
"There is much talk of a social Europe, but which Europe are we talking about?"
"A social Europe is not a Europe of unemployment, of insecurity, of exclusion, in which established rights are trampled underfoot, in which millions of citizens suffer poverty."
"A social Europe must be one where everybody has the right to work, to a job, to continuous training, to a rise in their standard of living and to social protection."
"No doubt such progressive objectives would upset the customs and habits of certain management circles and politicians, imprisoned in an economic and monetary system that encourages the profit race and tends to crush the individual."
"We must react immediately if we do not want to risk the despair of the people of Europe."
"I think it is now vital to consider how to distribute social powers between the states and the European Union, but also to consider how to formulate a European industrial strategy."
"It is imperative for the social protocol, which should be incorporated in the Union treaty in 1997, to include a specific article on the arbitrary closure of industrial plant."
"First it should be clearly established that the workers must be consulted, via their representative organizations, at least three months before any final decision is taken on restructuring."
"Moreover, it seems clear to me that any plant with a recognized technological potential and workers who have been adequately trained cannot be closed overnight."
"It is scandalous for an undertaking to receive Community and national aid without giving anything in return, for example a commitment to remain on a site for at least ten years."
"If it did not respect this commitment, the multinational would receive no more aid from the European Union."
"Finally, Mr President, the closure of Vilvorde is not just a one-off case. The workers have every reason to oppose it and my group supports them in their fight."
"Mr President, the sudden announcement of the closure of the Renault plant at Vilvoorde in Belgium, where 3100 people are to lose their jobs, is a tragedy, particularly since - contrary to the European directive - the workers have not in any way been consulted."
"Given that Renault is a multinational, some sort of action is obviously expected from the European Union, and it is understandable that Commissioner Van Miert should launch an inquiry into Spain's plans to provide government aid for the Renault plant there, and that Commissioner Flynn should review the rules on the consultation of workers."
"But could the Union be doing more?"
"It has been suggested that Renault, as a French firm, was always far more likely to close a plant in Belgium than one in France."
"Be that as it may, it is absolutely clear that workers must be given the same protection, no matter which Member State they are in."
"Any closures must be accompanied by a carefully considered social programme, and that is what is lacking here."
"However, do we not also have to accept that a multinational firm which is forced to make cutbacks for economic reasons is perfectly entitled, in the single market, to concentrate production wherever costs are lowest?"
"Mr President, the ominous decision by the French government, of which Mr Schweitzer is merely the executor, to put not just 3 000 but 6 000 Belgian workers out of a job confirms France's resolve to join the United Kingdom and Germany in the club of nations that expect only advantages from Europe, without accepting the constraints involved in elementary solidarity between our nations."
"This is not a new situation."
"The workers in my country, Belgium, have frequently been the victims of intraCommunity delocalization over the past 15 years."
"The first salvos were fired by the English when the United Kingdom repatriated British Leyland's motor vehicle assembly line, which had previously been sited in Wallonia."
"To cite only the automobile industry, let me remind you of the successive closures of the Tudor battery production units, then of the Champion sparking-plug producers and the serious threats looming over the Volkswagen factory workers in Forest."
"This situation gives rise to several comments."
"Firstly, the intransigent attitude of the Renault bosses should give some food for thought to a few francophile politicians who dream of attaching Wallonia to France."
"Secondly, I am thinking of the inevitable retaliatory measures the consumers will spontaneously take by boycotting all products made in France which, in the final analysis, are far from irreplaceable."
"Finally, I think the time has come for Belgium to claim back from France the three billion new French francs stolen from Belgian savers in 1994, when the French public company AGF took over the Belgian insurance company Assubel."
"Three billion French francs is more than enough to secure the jobs of the Renault workers in Vilvorde, and also of the Clabeck workers in Les Forges."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that is what could and should have been avoided if Europe had taken the necessary solidarity measures for the workers of Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today Vilvorde has become a kind of symbol, and a revealing one."
"If we look closely at the situation, we will have to examine the responsibilities of all concerned."
"What was the strategy adopted by a state that held 48 % of the shares, i.e., more than the blocking minority?"
"Certainly it was not a posteriori disapproval."
"Is the French government, by its inaction, trying by any chance to ruin the mixed economy?"
"In face of the on-going industrial revolution, in face of the trend towards international capitalism, has Europe given itself the means of countering this by maintaining its social system?"
"Europe has created a framework that encourages competition and deregulation, translated by the development of surplus production capacity; it has established a competition policy that encourages alliances outside Europe and makes it difficult to form genuine alliances between Europeans, as a result of which employment is becoming the main variable of adjustment."
"The social horrors that are the end result of competition, of run-away capitalism, render meaningless the Commission's assurances that the primary and automatic means of protecting jobs is acceptance of maximum flexibility."
"The closure of the Vilvorde plant demonstrates, if indeed demonstration is necessary, the risks of social dumping."
"One reason this unit was closed was that labour costs there were 25 % to 30 % higher than in other sites."
"Tomorrow, if we do not act, other dramas will open our eyes to the risks of fiscal dumping, of environmental dumping, right inside the European Union."
"The Europeans will turn against Europe unless it formulates a genuine industrial policy that is in their service, provides public financing of research that matches up to the requirements, opens a social dialogue worthy of that name."
"How could we not agree with Jean-Luc Dehaene who said that 'in the social sector, coordination at European level is the only possible response to the individual strategies of the multinationals' ?"
"Yes, we must indeed incorporate the social protocol in the treaty and abolish the unanimity rule in areas where it still applies in the social area."
"Some representatives of the right are now advocating a social Europe."
"I feel like saying: ' I dare you!' ."
"Go on then, persuade your governments to adopt a real chapter on employment at the intergovernmental conference."
"But I do see a glimmer of hope in this affair."
"For years we have been lamenting the absence of a union movement able to face up to undertakings pursuing a multinational strategy."
"As history teaches us, social dialogue and regulation are rarely granted."
"They are obtained by struggle, by the play of forces."
"If there are incipient signs of dialogue, all the better!"
"I hope it will become obligatory when the euro forces our Member State governments to adopt a coordinated European economic policy."
"Once again, what we are suffering from is not a lack of Europe, but a Europe that is too liberal, that is too commercial, too intent on free trade."
"We are suffering from the absence in Europe of an industrial strategy in the service of Europeans, from the lack of regulation and solidarity, the lack of a political and social Europe."
"Mr President, I should like to cool the tempo of the debate a little, that is release a little steam to reduce the pressure."
"We are debating a key bi-national question."
"I do not want to introduce another country to produce a tri-national debate, but simply to put things into context."
"The closure of the Renault factory is of course very sad."
"It is a decision by the management of Renault and we express our solidarity with the Vilvoorde workers."
"But what we must not do is to link this closure with the fact that the Renault company is wanting to expand production in Spain."
"That is not solidarity, since Spain too is European union country which any company can move to provided it complies with the laws in force."
"I think that in this case Renault is trying to comply with the laws in force and will make use of the economic, social or fiscal options permitted under those laws."
"I do not understand how the two subjects are being mixed together here and I am sorry that I had to speak because I think these are two totally separate subjects: the Vilvoorde closure is one thing and the expansion in Spain is another."
"What the European Union needs to do - and here we are trying to build it and we have not been engaged for many years on the project and things cannot be achieved all at once - is to have social and fiscal legislation on all matters which is homogenous throughout all countries."
"That would prevent factories in the European Union from moving from one country to another, since similar costs would be incurred."
"Neither would the multinationals then be so inclined to move from one European Union country to another, as has happened in Spain, or to third countries."
"There is just one more question - would this debate have taken place had not Vilvoorde been the Commissioner's home town?"
"Mr President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress once again in this debate that the basic problem is that the Renault management has broken a number of national, European and international regulations."
"The issue is not whether Renault was right to close its plant at Vilvoorde on economic grounds, although I wholly agree with the severe criticism which has been levelled against the Renault management."
"But I do not agree with those who are taking advantage of the situation to launch an attack on Europe or to target the free market economy."
"I would point out to my Belgian colleagues that the Catholic-socialist coalition, which always presents itself as the stalwart defender of a social Europe, actually opposed the Commission when it proposed to tighten up European legislation on this subject."
"On the other hand, the approach adopted by Volkswagen in Germany shows that it is possible to deal with such cases properly even without stricter legislation."
"More jobs are soon going to have to disappear, not just at Renault in France but in the European car industry as a whole, since overcapacity is currently running at 20 to 30 %."
"The most important issue in this whole debate is the need to create an industry-friendly climate in Europe with lower labour costs and greater work flexibility if we are to arm ourselves against worldwide competition."
"Mr President, first of all the loss of 3, 000 jobs at Vilvoorde is an absolute tragedy for the workers and their families, and a tragedy for Belgium, the country which is experiencing this social tragedy and justifiably feels its commitment to Europe has been betrayed."
"A tragedy, but sadly nothing new: the whole of the 'eighties and these early years of the 'nineties have been littered with such tragedies."
"Even today similar tragedies are taking place in other European countries: at Sorces de Clébecq 2, 000 steel workers, 1, 000 of them Italian, are threatened with redundancy, the German miners are likewise threatened, Philips on the outskirts of Milan has just announced the closure of the factory which will be transferred to Poland, where the Danzig shipyards are closing."
"Tragedies, but nothing new."
"What is new is the struggle of the workers, European unemployment, the meeting today in Biancourt, the development of an initiative."
"This is a Europe being born, but unfortunately it is also a denunciation of a political and economic Europe which is not there and which is guilty by its absence."
"This Europe needs to be discussed in depth."
"There are political reasons for the current episode."
"Europe does not have a social policy, it only has Maastricht monetarism."
"So Europe is suffering from social dumping from the outside and the consequences of its deflationary policy on the inside."
"There is no industrial policy, there is no policy to reduce working hours, there is no policy of public control over the multinationals."
"Commissioner Flynn, you spoke of dismay at the closure of Vilvoorde;"
"I speak of dismay at your communication."
"The powerlessness this Parliament and the Commission are demonstrating in this case is utterly indecent: either Europe succeeds in recovering a sense of itself, or else events like this condemn not Renault alone, but the inability of this Parliament and Europe to respond to the problems of the workers and the unemployed."
"Mr President, in a few decades time, when historians and students of our times try to unravel their mysteries, the word Renault will be a key."
"Through Renault, they will find out that there was a time when labour was made more flexible and precarious, when social rights were reduced, when modernisation took place, and when workers thought they were going to have a fair share of modernisation and all they got was unemployment and social exclusion."
"Through Renault, they will understand also how it was that in the beginning of 1997 a multi-national company in the automobile industry shut down units and threw thousands of workers on to the dole queues just because they were having difficulties - and at the same time their shares rose significantly in value on the Paris stock exchange."
"Through Renault, they will even have an illustration that just as European construction between equal Member States was taking place, some of them were more equal than others."
"Because what happened in Setubal, in Portugal, only merited a pious resolution with no consequences whereas what happened in Belgium aroused strong reactions of solidarity, demonstrations, strikes and even the Commissioner did not hide his Belgian origins."
"This should not necessarily be denounced but it should be remembered, given that other situations and postures meant that a European Commissioner was obliged to give up the defence of national interests, in the case of the Portuguese."
"I will be strange for those historians and students of the time in which we live that on the same day as this debate, in the same European Parliament, another debate on the restructuring of the automobile industry - based on a report by a very high-up member of the PSE - did not focus on social problems or even refer to them."
"Whoever has the job of writing today's history will find some very strange and incomprehensible matters."
"I hope that the position of the European Parliament on this issue is going to be comprehensible for them, in terms of its social content and its consequences for the future."
"Mr President, it is difficult to understand the attitude of the management of Renault in announcing from one day to the next the closure of a production plant in a European country; but it is not right to involve other countries in this problem and to point to Spain in this context; let us not confuse the issues."
"This closure is not bound up with the opening of new factories in Spain and this decision by Renault does not appear to be linked to new production centres in other European countries."
"The only people responsible - and they must be answerable - are the Renault bosses."
"No-one else is responsible."
"This calls in question not only the scant nature of social Europe, but the very idea of Europe."
"If such things take place in a Europe we would like to regard as a joint Europe and we do not worry about them, then there is something seriously wrong with the very edifice of Europe."
"Intangible concepts such as the market heartlessly and mercilessly dictate plant relocation or closure and concentration."
"If the market, capital and immediate profitability are not neutral, then neither should be the defence of jobs and union rights."
"Renault should not only respect Community legislation, but it should also bow to European public opinion."
"Unfortunately it is not the first factory to be closing and we must be aware that industrial strategies do sometimes entail these sad consequences."
"But here we are faced with a surprise decision with no respect for the minimum rules of the game required without consultation and without negotiation."
"If we simply stand by and watch these problems we shall be guilty of ineffective resignation."
"It is not a problem of thousands of Flemish workers."
"I should prefer to call it a problem of thousands of European workers, and we express our solidarity with them."
"Dialogue between both sides of industry is the best instrument for settling labour relations."
"This is a specific case in which such dialogue should be used to channel a very serious problem."
"Renault must accept that industrial and labour relations do have their purpose."
"Talks between the management of Renault and the workers' representatives should find possible solutions to this problem which is on a European scale and there must be solutions if such dialogue is possible."
"I have received one motion for a resolution, under Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure ."
"Mr President, I wish to thank all those who have contributed to the debate this morning."
"It has been a worthwhile debate and it is only right and proper that the House should deal with the matter, for at least two good reasons."
"Firstly, there is the right we have to show the depth of our feeling concerning the decision taken by Renault on this closure."
"It is also right that we show solidarity with those people threatened with the loss of their jobs, and with their families, who are going to suffer distress."
"Both Parliament and the Commission have put employment right at the top of their political agendas."
"It is extremely difficult to accept the laying-off of good, well-trained, professional workers at what was and is understood still to be an industrially and economically efficient plant."
"This plant had the most flexible workforce one could contemplate in this sector and it is very difficult to understand the decision to close it down."
"Secondly, this particular closure raises a number of important issues of European Community policy."
"There can be no questioning the right, or indeed the necessity, to make commercial decisions affecting investment, location, operation and even closure of industrial plants in these increasingly competitive times."
"That is always clearly understood."
"But rights and powers, of course, bring matching responsibilities."
"The question here is very well stated by Mrs Kestelijn-Sierens when she says that Renault have broken the rules."
"They have broken the rules and it is for others to pursue this matter under the national implementation legislation."
"That is what is contemplated and that is the way it should be addressed."
"The internal market provides an arena without internal frontiers - the biggest of its kind in the world - where business can prosper, where capital and goods move freely, and where competitiveness and industry is encouraged."
"But no business can prosper without the goodwill and the commitment of its workforce, and those that purport to be multinational companies cannot renationalize whenever it suits them."
"It was very clearly stated in the communication on this particular industry some while ago that social dialogue is an important aspect in dealing with the structural arrangements that would be necessary for its development."
"You cannot disregard that, as has happened on this occasion."
"That is the message that should be sent."
"I would say that there is good point in condemning the action by Renault."
"It was wrong, and it is unacceptable to deal in such a cavalier fashion with the rights of workers as they are enshrined in law."
"And it is for those who consider these rights infringed to take up the case in their jurisdiction where necessary."
"That is why the social and economic dimensions are always cited as two sides of the same coin."
"In my opening statement I set out the situation of existing legislation in regard to the laying-off of workers in situations such as Renault in Vilvoorde."
"I pointed out the weaknesses in the matter of sanctions and I have indicated my intentions with regard to filling these gaps and the strengthening of Community measures on information and consultation of workers."
"I would say to Mrs Van Lancker: the law is there and should be implemented; and before seeking new legislation as an immediate and quite understandable reaction to such situations, we must always remember to test the existing legislation."
"If it is found wanting, then there is a good case for seeking its amendment."
"But I would sincerely suggest that the existing legislation is strong and should be pursued; and, if and when any aspect of it is discovered to be in need of amendment or extension, then I would not hesitate to come back with such a proposal."
"But others, of course, must also play their part."
"Industry must take a fresh look at its responsibilities in an internal market which encourages its competitiveness and its prosperity."
"In this particular case Renault, and indeed the government which holds a 48 % share of the company, must abide by European and national law, both in the letter and in the spirit."
"The government - all governments - must ensure that in a people's Europe which is to be worthy of that name, social and economic dimensions must be given balanced attention with equality of treatment and protection rights right across the Union."
"I believe that the Intergovernmental Conference will provide an opportunity to do just that."
"A disastrous closure like this shakes confidence."
"It is important now - as it was at the time - always to mobilize all our forces and energies to restore investor and consumer confidence that will bring growth and increased employment."
"The role of social policy as a productive factor is a key element in this equation."
"We must not lose sight of that fact in our preparations for the final stages of the IGC discussions and the Amsterdam Summit and in the ongoing initiatives we are taking with the social partner."
"In the immediate future I will be coming forward with some important proposals in the social area, particularly on social protection and new methods of work organization; and there will be, as I stated in my opening remarks, the proposal on information and consultation at national level."
"I would like to use that instrument in the proposal, to fill any gap that might have arisen or appear evident following the run-through in this particular case insofar as it is pursued at national level."
"A successful conclusion to the Davignon Group would also unlock the company statute proposal and be a considerable boost to the internal market."
"We have also to look forward to the successful outcome of the negotiations between the social partners on part-time work, and this too would be extremely useful."
"Finally, I wish to say that, in my opinion, no company, irrespective of its size or influence, is entitled to dismiss its workers and to disobey the law in the cavalier fashion we have witnessed in this particular case."
"It is contrary to law and to the spirit that we thought endowed all the actions making up the integration of Europe and the internal market."
"The united response that we have here will do much to indicate to all those who have responsibility in this matter that it is not acceptable to act in an irresponsible fashion such as we have seen in this case."
"Workers' rights are enshrined in law and they must be respected in the spirit as well as in the letter of the law."
"That is the basis on which agreement is reached in the first instance, and to disregard that basis is just a recipe for industrial relations chaos."
"Damage to the building of Europe has been caused on this occasion."
"Let us be clear about that."
"So I wish to stress again that the social dimension is vital if we want European integration to succeed as a precondition for the support of European citizens for the European ideal."
"We would look forward to a better response in future from those who have responsibility in this regard."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Let us hope that this debate will have the best possible effect on the situation facing Renault workers."
"Industrial competitiveness"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0052/97 by Mr A.J. Donnelly, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions 'European Automobile Industry 1996' (COM(96)0327 - C40493/96); -A4-0040/97 by Mr Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the Commission communication on an industrial competitiveness policy for the European chemical industry: an example (COM(96)0187 - C4-0273/96); -A4-0036/97 by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy, on the Commission's communication: ' Shaping Europe's maritime future - a contribution to the competitiveness of maritime industries' (COM(96)0084 - C4-0211/96) Draftsmen of opinions: Mrs Estevan Bolea, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy Mr Pex, on behalf of the Committee on external Economic Relations Mr Belleré, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism Mr K. Collins, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection ( 'Hughes' procedure)."
"Mr President, I would like first of all to start by discussing the three reports collectively because, as you said, this is a joint debate on industry policy and I think it is very timely given the earlier debate we had on Renault and the very helpful response given by Commissioner Flynn that we look collectively at these three industries because, while of course the automobile sector, the maritime sector and the chemical sector are three clearly different industries, it is very clear to me that there are very similar characteristics in the way in which we have to try and provide an environment for those industries to operate within the European Union."
"They all face similar challenges of intensified global competition and rapid structural change and I think it is in that context that we need to have this debate this morning and I am sure it is in that context that Commissioner Bangemann will respond on behalf of the European Commission."
"Given that over 3, 000 workers have just lost their jobs following the Renault decision I think it is also very important that we give some thought to the links between competitiveness, productivity and employment because we talk too much in this House and in the European institutions about competitiveness but we do not link it to the issue of productivity and employment."
"Competitiveness in itself is not an end, it must be a means to an end, and that of course is to try and improve productivity and to try and improve employment opportunities."
"We have to get out of this orthodoxy within the European Union of assuming that competitiveness in itself is the answer to all of our problems."
"The issue of restructuring, transfers and plant closures is creating a growing atmosphere of insecurity among workers and the public in general, and it is essential that the European Commission come forward with proposals that can deal comprehensively with this issue."
"We accept that it is a complicated and complex matter in terms of industrial planning when you get transfers, restructuring and plant closures taking place."
"In that context if it is complex then we need a series of ideas and initiatives and solutions to ensure that we can try and take away the terrible feeling of insecurity that now exists within the European Union."
"Insecurity leads to demotivation, and that is part of the problem that the European economy is facing."
"I hope the Commissioner, when he responds, will take account of these issues in the general debate on industry."
"I want to use the rest of my time to talk specifically about the car industry, because this is Europe's biggest industry: it represents almost 2 % of the gross domestic product of Europe, it employs directly about 2 million people, it contributes to the revenue of the European Union over ECU 220 billion."
"It is an extremely significant industry and, frankly, if we continue as we are going today in the way in which this industry is planning for the future, we are going to see substantial job losses in Europe."
"We have got the problem at Renault, you have seen the problems at Enfield in London and at Halewood in Liverpool in the Ford company."
"We are going to see further pressures on this industry unless we can try and devise a plan for the future."
"So the first thing this House calls for is for Commissioner Bangemann, with the Parliament, to convene a meeting of the CEOs of the major car manufacturers in Europe with the components industry sector and the trade unions to see if we can put together a high-level grouping that can plan for the future of this industry."
"We want to see greater support given to the 'car of the future' initiative."
"It is an excellent initiative but it needs more resources and more support."
"We want to see greater progress made on the issue of international harmonization of standards."
"It is crucial if we are going to have a global market and a globally competitive market within the European Union that we move forward on international harmonization."
"And then specifically, on a number of initiatives, we need to make sure that the vehicles we produce are the sort of vehicles that will be acceptable, not only in our own market, but in the United States and in the other markets around the world, and the sort of product that the consumer wishes to purchase."
"That means we need to look at new technologies in the field of emissions and fuel consumption."
"We need to look at motor electronics, further improvements in vehicle safety, electric and hybrid vehicles, lightweight vehicle structures and materials, optimizing of production techniques, and systems for the recycling of all vehicles."
"I recognize that we already have something like 56 directives on the statute book as far as the car industry is concerned."
"We cannot simply, as legislators, pursue this agenda without consultation with the industry and so what I would appeal to in the spirit of consultation and collaboration is for us to move forward rapidly to look at this new agenda in consultation with the industry, the trade unions and the research sector so that we actually look forward to a secure future for Europe's biggest industry and we can stop the present decline."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the chemical industry is the second-largest sector of manufacturing industry in Europe."
"It provides 1.6 million jobs and has the highest export share of all."
"The largest chemical companies in the world are located in Europe, so their basic situation is almost comparable."
"Like the automobile industry, the chemical industry has to react to global market changes."
"The annual turnover of ECU 350 billion, which is equivalent to between 3 % and 4 % of total European GDP, offers a good basis for the future."
"The Commission communication on the competitiveness of the chemical industry is almost a model project, because it was drawn up on the basis of dialogue with the industry."
"In this connection I must definitely praise the Commission, which is so often criticized here!"
"Commissioner, if you have deserved praise, you should also accept it!"
"However there is one point which could have been improved on: participation by workers' associations was inadequate; this could do with improving."
"The radical structural changes and increasing globalization have led to a lasting regional shift in markets and production centres."
"Some of the reasons are the growing strength of new competitors in the Asian and Pacific region, the opening up of the Eastern European countries and their increasing integration in the world economy and the more intensive competition in the European internal market."
"The global structure of the chemical industry will have to adapt to the changing regional structure of the world chemical market."
"For instance, competitors in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe are already able to offer many chemical products, especially standard products, at substantially lower prices than European companies, despite an entirely comparable product quality and reliability of supplies."
"In these standard areas the chemical industry has also forfeited its technological advantage because these technologies are available worldwide."
"The globalization of markets and the siting of new production plants in the growth regions - which is often criticized but is necessary to the companies' survival - meant that employment in the chemical industry had to be cut by 25 % in recent years, to a workforce of only 1.6 million today."
"One of the future tasks of the chemical industry therefore - given the need for more market-oriented production - will be to protect employment in the chemical sector on a lasting basis and to offset the loss of jobs in traditional chemical branches by the creation of new jobs in forward-looking technologies."
"Here, Commissioner, biotechnology and genetic engineering, active substance and natural substance chemicals, environmental technology, new materials and the development of complex system solutions can do much to replace unprofitable product lines."
"That is why I also believe it is important, as the committee noted in relation to research projects, for the chemical industry to be involved more closely in the task forces as a multi-disciplinary industry rather than being marginal, for it can make contributions to the car of the future, to the traffic system, to synergetic solutions that go far beyond what the Commission has suggested to date."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has given profound thought to this."
"We organized a hearing."
"We took account of the views of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and the end result was a report that met with broad approval."
"Given the difficulties of the task, in connection for example with ensuring a minimum level of environmental legislation while cutting back on environmental rules that act as an obstacle to the production of chemicals and to the position of Europe as a centre of chemical production, the 55 votes in favour and only 2 against are certainly gratifying."
"This intensive consultation has shown that the Commission provided a good basic document but that our proposals can improve it."
"So it will be up to you, Commissioner, to show you are prepared to accept our good proposals, which have broad support."
"We take the view that the chemical industry could be an exemplary area for the Commission and the Member States to promote the social dialogue on technological lines of development."
"That would gain new product lines the necessary acceptance."
"It might also mean that the much-discussed question of the CO2 tax, which the committee is rather sceptical about - we do not believe it is a solution for ensuring competitiveness - can be discussed objectively and without ideological bias."
"The same applies to the development of the infrastructure, a pipeline network that would improve the transport of dangerous goods."
"I believe that in this overall context the Commission's communication is a useful one."
"Let me conclude by thanking all those who have contributed, the Commission, the associations that played an active part and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy; I believe that all in all we can be satisfied with this report!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to follow Mr Donnelly's example and introduce what I have to say about the shipping industry with a few more general comments concerning the problem of industrial policy in Europe."
"The main factors that determine the course of European industry nowadays are three in number: its persistently low productivity, its essential failure to make the most of the potential of new technologies, and the pressures stemming from increased public awareness of environmental issues."
"The combination of those three factors in today's circumstances has a restraining effect, like a brake, on the progress of European industry."
"With a new and creative combination, the brake could be changed into a driving force, and that should be task of industrial policy."
"New technology can increase productivity, and that, in turn, can create additional wealth, part of which can be devoted to improving the environment."
"The critical question is why the creative procedure is so slow in coming, and the only serious answer that has been put forward to that question is that the slowness with which economic activity is expanding, the relative recession that has been affecting us since the beginning of the 1990s, and even before then of course, and the relatively low levels of investment, are making it difficult to promote new technology."
"More particularly, for the types of new technology that concern us now, namely information technology, other difficulties are amplified by the fact that the consumer public is not aware, and has not had sufficient opportunity to become aware of the potentials of new technology, so as to create the necessary large-scale consumption and production demand."
"In the case of IT we must not only invest in equipment, but also in the creation of new markets."
"Now, so far as the shipping industry is concerned, despite the fact that it employs 2.5 million people, it has for a long time been considered a branch condemned to decline in the face of competition from countries with low labour costs and lax rules of operation."
"The idea that Europe can counter low labour costs by making the most of its own comparative advantage, new technology, and lax rules with services of high quality, and that upon those foundations a new, modern, dynamic and competitive industry could be built, is precisely the creative idea that the Commission, and the Commissioner honouring us with his presence here today, as well as our common creation, the forum for shipping industries, have been promoting since 1991 with their initiatives."
"Implementation of that concept can create a new, real industrial revolution in the branch, with incalculable gains for Europe, but none of this will become a reality without effort and constructive cooperation by all those involved in the branch."
"Shipowners must take advantage of the fact that present fleets are quite old, and speed up the process of their replacement."
"Postponement may gain them some short-term profit, but it undermines competitiveness and hence profits in the longer term."
"Banks and financing organizations, at a time when employment among the productive workforce in shipping is temporarily restricted - and I say temporarily because the volume of merchant shipping is forecast to double over the coming 15 years - should transform flexibility of funding and low interest rates into a serious incentive for new investment."
"Crews should strive for and demand from the Member States retraining in the new technologies."
"They should also cooperate to establish flexible employment and crew composition systems that will facilitate the application of new technology in ships and throughout the branch."
"Shipbuilding enterprises must be relieved of the necessity for State subsidies and must reconquer the position they once held in international markets."
"Port authorities and enterprises have a key role to play, since they can interlink land and sea transport in ways that will multiply the present level of productivity."
"But of course, it is the State and Community authorities which bear the greatest responsibility, because it is up to them to secure conditions of competition for European shipping, reductions of financial cost, and upgrading of the human resources."
"Above all, however, they should review the general framework of employment in the economy because, Commissioner, without the acceleration this involves and without much fuller employment, I am afraid that the penetration of new technology and the new industrial revolution, and with them the restoration of Europe's former dynamic status, will be postponed indefinitely."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the chemical industry is facing constantly growing worldwide competition, especially with all the companies that can produce at lower costs."
"This has already affected employment in Europe."
"It is an industrial branch that is export-oriented and should remain so for economic reasons, in order to give further support to the European economy."
"This branch of industry provides high-grade jobs in chemistry and in related industries, such as the automobile industry and the computer industry, since it can offer solutions which it has developed."
"So it is important if not vital for the chemical industry, as a highly innovative branch of industry, to promote new development in forward-looking disciplines, such as biotechnology, which can lead to new products and processes and also reduce the burden on our environment."
"However, European companies responsible for these innovations should have the same protection under patent law as those in other parts of the world."
"On the question of environmental protection: we must realise that modern environmental protection, as practised in Europe and all the other industrialized countries, is inconceivable without the chemical industry - we need think only of the catalytic converter."
"There is a great environmental potential here."
"So we should support the chemical industry in its endeavour to resolve environmental problems."
"Special attention should be devoted to small and medium-sized chemical companies."
"Often it is they that develop and apply the new technologies that lead to definite improvements in existing products."
"Quite often this also creates new jobs."
"Such companies should be granted start-up aid by suitable measures such as the provision of risk capital."
"Above all, their lives and survival should be made easier by deregulation."
"The chemical industry is one of the few industrial branches in Europe that has on principle not required state aid because it was always able to restructure by itself and to adapt to the constantly changing situation on the world markets."
"Our political aim must be to support it in this in future and not to hamper it by over-regulating."
"Finally, many thanks to Mr Langen for his very good report and for accepting the proposals of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at least I have one thing in common with Mrs Heinisch and Mr Langen, namely that we are all aware of the special responsibility of the chemical industry."
"Otherwise, we do not really see eye to eye."
"Let me make a few comments in this regard."
"I am convinced that the chemical industry - and the Committee on the Environment shares my conviction - has a special responsibility for healthy, environment-friendly products and for healthy, environment-friendly production."
"The conclusions the Committee on the Environment draws from this - Mr Langen is shaking his head, but luckily he said this in his statement too - are different from those drawn by Mr Langen, the chemical industry and Mrs Heinisch."
"For in view of the tensions facing the chemical industry we must do two things, on the one hand to generous with the chemical industry but on the other hand be strict with it."
"What does that actually mean, to be generous and yet to be strict with it - and, incidentally, also with the Commissioner?"
"Mr Langen interrupted by saying something the others did not understand."
"I shall have something to say on that in a moment."
"Nor will I try to dissect his report in detail, although it would be easy to do."
"If I did so I would sound like a primary school teacher."
"To be generous with the chemical industry does indeed mean to give it the measure of reliability, of status, that it needs."
"To be strict with it means ensuring that it produces products that do not damage our environment and our health."
"So there are a few faults to find with Mr Langen's report, which the Committee on the Environment does not support as it stands and which my group luckily will not support as it stands either - but I am saying this by the way."
"We in the Committee on the Environment are currently working on a report on voluntary agreements, in which we attempt to clarify what voluntary agreements can achieve and what they cannot."
"They can certainly not replace legislation."
"Nor do I agree with Mr Langen that it is urgently necessary to reduce the number of environmental rules in order to offset locational disadvantages."
"That is why I do not find it acceptable for the report to anticipate a result which this Parliament has not yet decided on."
"Moreover, lower energy prices are not something this Parliament has emphasized in the past."
"One last point and I shall finish."
"For a long time this Parliament debated a CO2 energy tax without results."
"I admire the courage of my colleague in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in talking about it, but saying so little also produces mistakes and therefore both I and the Committee on the Environment consider this part wrong."
"The maritime industries have been considered dated, in decline and that is not true."
"It is not true, ladies and gentlemen, because there are no obsolete industries; there are obsolete technologies."
"It is true that at this moment the European shipbuilding industry - to be specific naval shipbuilding - accounts for only 20 % of the world market, but that figure could be greatly increased."
"Maritime industries include not only the building of naval vessels and ship repairs; they include also the harbour services, the industries which use maritime resources such as fishing, the farming of fish, shellfish and algae and above all the industries engaged in extracting oil and gas from under the sea."
"There is therefore much to do in Europe, but we must clearly make far-reaching changes beginning with training for those working in these sectors, first modernizing and updating our industries -and I want to mention oil tankers."
"There are at the present time some 3 600 oil tankers navigating the globe - and 10 % of them need to be scrapped forthwith since they do not meet the requirements."
"Europe has seen the most serious oil-spillage accidents, although only 30 % of oil passes through our ports."
"In addition 10 % of capacity needs to be replaced."
"That is 700 new double-hulled oil tankers need to be built incorporating electronic security systems for safe navigation."
"The European Union, our industries, could build a large proportion of those 700 vessels."
"Many more oil rigs could also be built and a new specialist industry could be built up for the scrapping of oil rigs."
"We have over 40 abandoned oil rigs which need to be scrapped and I do not know whether we are prepared with the industry which that requires."
"Finally, in the fields of research as well as of energy we have much work to do and we have put various requests to the Commission - and Mr Katiforis has been good enough to include our requests in his report. These include ensuring that the existing directives are complied with so that vessels entering our harbours are safe."
"Moreover we think that the Commission should draw up first a recommendation then a regulation on the replacement of obsolete oil tankers - and there are 700 of them, ladies and gentlemen, as I said."
"The new ones must be doublehulled with twin engine rooms, dual propulsion system with separate cargo bay and equipped with the necessary electronic devices."
"But we are also of the opinion that the European Union's maritime terminals and other ports - and we have the power to make this compulsory - should have the facilities required to receive domestic waste, spent oil and waste water and thus to help to improve the environment as a whole."
"Mr President, following on from what has already been said, I would stress that what makes the maritime industries special is their close involvement in the international trading activities of the European Union."
"That is why the Committee on External Economic Relations has already done so much work on the maritime industries and shipbuilding in particular, such as the report which it drew up in 1995 on the OECD agreement on competitive conditions in the shipbuilding and ship repair sector."
"Ninety per cent of our external trade and 30 % of our internal trade goes by sea, keeping two and a half million people in jobs."
"The role of maritime transport is set to increase, especially in connection with the Mediterranean partnership and cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, such as Poland and the Baltic States."
"It is regrettable that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has failed to take account of much of the work done by the Committee on External Economic Relations and many of the recommendations in our report, a fact which I find very disappointing."
"It is extremely significant, I believe, that shipbuilding is doing very well in places which have been able to adapt to new technologies."
"And where is it struggling?"
"Precisely in those areas where competitive conditions are poor and there is unfair competition."
"The biggest threat to European shipbuilding is that it is far too occupied with its own affairs, instead of working together to try to establish its position on the international market."
"The entry into force of the OECD agreement will be vitally important for European shipbuilding, and I have to say that the position adopted by the United States, as the only country which has not yet ratified it, is very disappointing."
"I think it is vital for us to have fair competition within Europe, and for us to try to encourage fair competition internationally through the OECD agreement."
"Finally, reference has been made to the need to step up activities in the field of research and development."
"I would add that this costs a good deal of money and must not be allowed to result in further differences in operating conditions for the maritime industry in Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in its 1994 communication on an industrial competitiveness policy for the European Union the Commission presented a strategy for a horizontal approach to a modern industrial policy."
"Promoting immaterial investment, improving industrial cooperation, ensuring fair conditions of competition and modernizing the public authorities are still fields of action of strategic importance to the competitiveness of the industrial sectors we are considering today."
"In its resolution at that time, Parliament laid strong emphasis on the importance of this approach but also drew attention to other points; I want to address two of them."
"The first point is that the guideline for industrial development is socially-oriented and environmentally compatible products and product innovations."
"Secondly, we pointed out that besides the recognized growth areas, such as communications technologies, biotechnology, environmental technologies, in short hi-tech, great emphasis must also be placed on stabilizing and improving the competitiveness of traditional industrial sectors."
"By this I do not mean old industries but existing sectors that must remain competitive by being modernized, taking competitiveness as meaning a high user quality and high environmental quality of the products in question."
"In any case I regard the term 'obsolete industries' as dubious."
"In Germany an entire branch is currently being brought into disrepute by the use of this term, which is ruining not just that branch but also the net product chain including its modern technologies."
"But that is what happens when auto-liberal waffle takes the place of modern industrial policy."
"Nobody in the chemical industry or the automobile industry dreams of talking about obsolete technologies."
"Rightly so!"
"For they are the two most important manufacturing industries with their 3.5 million jobs and the world market shares they still retain, which goes to show that they are key industries for the European economy."
"In the case of the maritime industry Mr Katiforis indeed pointed out that it too was until recently regarded as obsolete."
"Only in recent years did people begin to realise again that for economic and strategic reasons its decline must not only be checked but in fact transformed into a recovery."
"So let me just indicate two aspects of strategic importance to the sectors we are discussing today."
"The first is the importance of investment in education, training and continuous training, but not only with a view to improving technical skills."
"It is just as important to promote and foster the creativity of all those involved in the production process."
"In that sense, social dialogue has a key role to play in improving competitiveness."
"The second is the need for the sustainable development of high-grade, quality products using clean technology, i.e. not environmental after-care when the damage has been done, but environmentally compatible products and processes."
"Only then is it justified to use the term the Commission takes as the heading for its communication on the chemical industry: an example."
"Mr President, during 1996 the number of newly registered cars within the EU increased by 6.5 percent."
"However, this is a considerably lower figure than at the end of the 1980's and the beginning of the 1990's."
"This is, in my opinion, a growing problem as the vehicle parc is simply getting too old."
"It is a step in the wrong direction, especially in the light of the fact that all new cars on European roads are both safer and more environmentally friendly than a car whose next stop is the scrap yard."
"Bearing in mind that nearly 50, 000 people are killed every year on the roads of Europe and that vehicles, especially cars, are a major factor in our environmental problems, it is important to reach the kind of decision which will favour the development and wellbeing of the car industry in Europe."
"In the light of the Donnelly report and the previous debate concerning Renault, there is cause for wondering whether we politicians really ought to try and influence the course of events."
"Of course, there is no doubting the serious implications of the possible close down of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde in Belgium."
"However, at the same time we politicians should move cautiously when it comes to interfering with a company's plans for the location of its operations as our actions may result in the company establishing its business not in Belgium nor Spain or anywhere else within the EU for that matter, but outside Europe's borders."
"Then we will all have lost out."
"In my opinion, it would instead be beneficial to turn the EU's car industry into a leader."
"I believe that we politicians have a greater opportunity for influence here, as parts of Europe's car industry are already leaders, in areas such as for example increased safety measures."
"Several companies are also making significant progress in research into hybrid vehicles or battery technology, for example, in order to find alternatives to the current internalcombustion engine."
"This must, as I see it, be one of the most fundamental challenges within the environmental area."
"It should be welcomed."
"I am convinced that Europe's car industry can succeed in taking up the challenge and developing an alternative which is both competitive and commercially feasible."
"It may take 10, 15 or 20 years, but the car industry will succeed provided that we do not put any further pressure on it."
"My question to Commissioner Bangemann is whether the members of the Commission are willing to draw up and work diligently towards such an environmental target."
"Mr President, a well-known European motor manufacturer recently received publicity in the French newspapers which demonstrated the defects of the motor car, reminding us that it causes pollution, and is dangerous and costly."
"Nevertheless, that company and every other European company continues to produce cars and is trying to eliminate these defects every day, making the car safer, more accessible, cheaper, less polluting, and so on, because the car is our daily companion for recreation and, more importantly, work."
"This effort is also called for by the rapporteur, whom I congratulate, and the Committee on Economic Affairs as a whole, in the resolution we are debating."
"It is our duty to confront and overcome the problems of today's motor car so that we have increasingly suitable vehicles tomorrow."
"More generally, the economic, social and hence occupational role of the motor car is now being reviewed from top to bottom. The progressive automation of factories and the loss of jobs involve drastic changes in a sector which is suffering from a consumption crisis but which has directly provided some 2 million jobs up to now, not to mention the indirect jobs."
"So we have two demands: the first is the acceleration of the renewal of the current stock of obsolete and polluting motor vehicles - particularly lorries and buses - in part through the fiscal measures and allowances envisaged."
"I am thinking especially of Italy, where the government could finally extend the right of companies to deduct the VAT paid on the purchase of vehicles."
"This would reduce the incidence of VAT on the overall economic activity of the firm."
"This must take place by strengthening the internal market and placing clear conditions on the non-European market: we must confront the United States and Japan on the safety and efficiency of the car, as established in Washington in April 1996."
"The second demand is to develop the car of tomorrow and transform the current European task force so that it takes on a strategic and pro-active coordinating role, using its resources primarily to protect the environment and develop the skills of those who work or might eventually work in the sector."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are discussing taken together three sectors which are of enormous importance in the European Union's production system: the chemical industry, the automobile manufacturing industry and the maritime industries."
"They all have problems in adjusting to the great challenge which the European Union itself accepted with the GATT Uruguay Round and its effects for progressively greater commercial openness at world level."
"Our competitors are no longer, as was traditional, the United States and Japan, but in addition to those countries the emerging economies with cost structures which make them very competitive on the international markets."
"It would be very negative if we were to allow the difficulties of some companies in these sectors - which have become particularly apparent over the past week - to lead us into a protectionist position, trying to protect certain markets and avoiding international competition."
"I think that what European industry needs to do - and the Commission needs to give guidance - is to increase competitiveness, as considered in the various reports, avoiding all temptation to embrace protectionism."
"We must consider which are the most important aspects and try to strengthen the three areas mentioned in former President Delors's White Paper, that is improving research and development, improving external markets - and, of course, international promotion - and improving education and training."
"Mr President, in March the European Parliament adopted my report on industrial relocation both within the EU and worldwide."
"Now the Renault case has given the Commission cause to take some of the measures called for by Parliament in that report."
"The Commission proposes to investigate the ways in which businesses relocate to areas where they receive support from areas in respect of which no support is paid."
"The European Parliament also called for the Commission to set up a monitoring unit to collect information on the relocation of businesses."
"I should now like to know whether the Commission, spurred on by the Renault case, intends to set up such a monitoring unit to analyse the reasons for which businesses change their places of activity."
"I give you the floor, Mr Blokland, for two minutes thirty seconds."
"You will the last speaker and the sitting will then be suspended and resumed at 3 p.m."
"Mr President, what has struck me about this morning's debate is that the different views expressed have more to do with the nationality of the speaker than with the political background."
"There are still differences in the way in which the industrial sector is regarded in the Member States."
"In Belgium it has a positive image, while in the Netherlands it is more negative."
"European industry is facing three challenges."
"The first is sustainability, and the main question is how we can maintain our natural resources."
"Energy and clean water are the biggest problem areas here."
"Achieving sustainability requires around 50 years' forward planning, and this is beyond the individual producer."
"It is thus the job of governments and scientists to convince producers and consumers of the need for change."
"It is striking that the chemical industry is not convinced that a CO2 tax would be effective and calls instead for voluntary undertakings."
"This is a perfectly understandable position, but it is untenable in the long term."
"One field where I do not welcome the market ideology is biotechnology and genetic technology, and I think the public is right to be concerned about the ethical problems and risks involved here."
"The second challenge concerns research and development."
"European industry is doing a great deal in this field, but not enough in comparison with the United States and Japan."
"Governments cannot carry on using tax incentives to encourage innovation for ever, since there is so little room for manoeuvre."
"What is most worrying is the fact that there is less and less interest in scientific research, which could mean that we shall fall behind in our levels of training and know-how, yet these are the very things that we need to keep up if we are to deal with other challenges."
"Finally, there is the issue of cooperation, and not just industrial cooperation: the Member States must also make an effort to harmonize the various requirements which apply to products and semi-finished goods."
"The differences in regulations are hampering trade."
"Secondly, we must try to bring about the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe as quickly as possible, which industry rightly recognizes as being in our interests."
"It is disconcerting to see, however, that the Intergovernmental Conference seems so reluctant to get to grips with the fundamental restructuring of the European institutions."
"Madam President, something very disturbing happened this morning: on a request for urgency on Italian fisheries - the conversion of certain fisheries activities practised by Italian fishermen - it was not possible to take the recorded vote we have regularly called for."
"The UPE group was in favour of urgency."
"Unfortunately we did not have the option of a recorded vote."
"I asked for the floor in vain, I was not allowed to speak."
"Unfortunately, because of this unpleasant incident, Italian fishermen were not able to make their voice heard in this Chamber."
"The issue of the 'spadare' is an emergency facing employment, vessels and fishermen in Italy. Unfortunately we were not able to deal with this sensitive issue."
"I repeat: we were in favour of urgency because it could have solved an longstanding problem; we could have given the signal Italian fishermen are awaiting from this Parliament."
"The Council and the Commission were in favour, but unfortunately Parliament decided to reject urgency, denying us the chance of a recorded vote."
"Mr Tajani, if you were treated unfairly this morning, I think you have now had a chance to express yourself very freely, speaking longer than the one minute allocated to you."
"Mr President, I do not want to start a debate but only say that this Parliament decided to take that position because a serious Parliament must have the time to do its work."
"So we voted to look at the matter in April, as we undertook to do in committee."
"Votes"
"Madam President, I should like to thank those Members who have placed their trust in this report."
"I should also like to say how astonished I am at the position adopted by the PPE Group, with whom we negotiated long and patiently to reach agreement as far as possible."
"In spite of all our efforts, they still voted against the report, and I have to say that I cannot understand why."
"Madam President, Mrs Van Lancker is quite right."
"We did have various discussions to try to reach a joint position between our two groups."
"A number of compromise amendments were proposed, but there were also a number of points on which we were unable to reach a compromise, particularly in connection with asylum policy and immigration policy, and it was for this reason, because the Socialist Group did not share our views, that we were obliged to vote against."
"But Mrs Van Lancker was quite right, we did have a number of discussions."
"Our Parliament is deciding today on a technical adaptation of a legal instrument, with the object of reducing aeroplane noise."
"Under this directive, aeroplanes originating in developing countries will be granted exemptions in relation to landing rights."
"Through the report by my colleague Mr van der Waal, our parliamentary committee is asking the European Commission to define the term 'developing nation' ."
"Indeed we must not level accusations against a country like Saudi Arabia on the grounds of the exemptions granted for some of its aeroplanes."
"However, we must also note that these are private aircraft and that to grant them excessive exemptions would restrict those that might be granted to the aeroplanes of national companies in developing countries, since the text provides for a limited number of exemptions for these countries overall."
"Noise nuisance is a crucial problem for areas bordering on airports and a solution must be found that is acceptable to all parties concerned."
"I hope the Commission will take account of our position."
"I have voted for the report."
"Certain developing countries cannot fulfil the requirements of a low noise level, making exceptions necessary."
"However, the number of exceptions should not increase."
"It is unacceptable that private airlines in 'rich' developing countries such as Saudi Arabia and Lebanon should account for most of the exceptions while the 'poor' developing countries such as Uganda and Zimbabwe are granted only a few."
"This report is acceptable to the Green Group in the European Parliament because it allows the Member States the scope to introduce more sweeping measures to prevent noise from aircraft."
"Amendment No 9 also removes the exemption for Saudi Arabia, which is hardly a poor developing country and where the aircraft are in fact privately owned."
"However, these few technical measures are only some of what is necessary to reduce this increasing source of noise pollution."
"The Commission's Green Paper on noise and its communication on a strategy against noise pollution indicate that wider European restrictions, such as on night flights to all European airports, will have to be considered."
"This should ensure that in the fierce competition between the neighbouring Euregio airports of Bierset, Beek and Cologne-Bonn, for example, flights are not transferred to the airport applying the least strict rules, in this case from Cologne-Bonn to Bierset."
"Caccavale report (A4-0010/97)"
"It is important that consumers' interests are safeguarded and strengthened on the consumer credit market."
"However, the report goes too far in the direction of harmonisation towards a single European civil law that I cannot support."
"As pointed out by the Committee, harmonised mortgage loans cannot be supported as these vary considerably in regard to the financial regulatory systems of Member States."
"Van Lancker report (A4-0014/97)"
"Madam President, the Van Lancker report is based on a premise that has done considerable damage to Europe over recent years."
"It suggests that questions of security or controlling immigration do not come top of the list and that the main thing is rapidly to abolish border controls in order to promote the merging of nations."
"We are dealing here with the advance of an ideology that tramples the citizen underfoot."
"The document before us regrets, for example, that the implementation of the Schengen agreements is geared mainly to restricting migration and to maintaining law and order."
"Everyone with a grain of common sense is more worried that is doing the opposite."
"Moreover, as usual the report calls for the abolition of all internal border controls, including checks on nationals of third countries."
"It even encourages a new fad, the supposed need to guarantee a procedure for applicants at the external borders to appeal against refusal of access as though, over and above specific cases of the right of asylum, there was a general right for foreigners to enter the territories of the Union countries."
"This position says a lot about the underlying implications and intentions of the European Parliament, which, let us not forget, is also calling for new powers in relation to immigration."
"In this context, it is no surprise to find that the majority of this Parliament is in favour of relaxing the compensatory measures provided for under the Schengen agreements."
"My group, on the contrary, would like to see them tightened."
"During yesterday's debate I already referred to fact that the system of declarations of entry into EU territory which nationals of third countries have to deposit is not working at all."
"Let me add another example, drawn from recent French experience."
"Our National Assembly has just adopted in second reading an immigration bill providing that any foreigner who leaves French territory must hand in his residence permit to the police services."
"But what will he do if he leaves France via an internal Community border where, in principle, these checks would no longer exist?"
"The chairman of our law committee agreed on the need to reopen negotiations with our Schengen partners."
"That is therefore a new point to be added to the list of complementary measures."
"It would be more useful to resolve this kind of practical problem than to reach for the sky by abolishing frontiers."
"Madam President, I would like to give an explanation of vote both on my own behalf and that of the British Labour Members here."
"We finally voted in favour of this report because there was a very great deal in it that we believe is right and needs to be said and should be supported by this Parliament."
"However, I want to make it clear that there are some parts of this report on which we have grave reservations."
"They relate in particular to the later paragraphs, from paragraph 47 onwards."
"We cannot support and indeed voted against those paragraphs which call for the end of unanimity in Council on justice and home affairs issues; we cannot support calls for total judicial control over free movement by the Court of Justice; and we cannot support calls for communitization of third pillar issues."
"These are matters which we and our party back home are clear on and we cannot go along with them."
"But we voted in favour of the report as a whole because we believe that the many things it says that need to be said and the good in it outweigh our reservations about it."
"I wanted to make those explanations."
"Madam President, the EPP Group voted against Mrs van Lancker's report because we are in favour of the Schengen process on principle, because we recognize that Schengen has brought more freedom of movement in Europe and has therefore also allowed many citizens to experience positive European developments for themselves."
"We must also underline that the dismantling of internal border controls must go hand in hand with better protection of our external borders."
"The Schengen process does indeed make provision for the need to make our external borders more secure when the internal border controls are dismantled."
"We must also make quite sure that the Schengen report is not used as a pretext for interfering in any national asylum policies."
"There have now been a number of changes to asylum law in Europe, mainly with the aim of preventing any abuse of it, and this endeavour must not be undermined via a Schengen report."
"For all these reasons, and because we are in favour of Schengen, we decided to vote against this report, which does not take account of these considerations."
"Madam President, I should just like to comment on what the rapporteur said about the discussions held between the Socialist Group and the PPE Group."
"These were successful on a number of points where the report was improved, but there were also a number of fundamental issues which we felt were unsatisfactory, and we were finally obliged to vote against them."
"I consider legal and illegal immigration to be a very important issue, and it is one of the major social problems facing our countries today."
"Illegal immigration is on the increase, and it is even happening on an organized scale."
"It is not a coincidence that hundreds or even thousands of people from Ghana should appear at certain periods."
"It is not because the situation in Ghana has suddenly deteriorated, but because 'people-trafficking' has now become big business."
"The European Union, or the Schengen area in this particular case, must not be laid open to this kind of abuse."
"In other words, I agree with what Mr Nassauer said: the fact that we have abolished our internal borders does not mean that our external borders can be left unprotected."
"We cannot vote for this report."
"We have a number of reservations about several points concerning the arrangement of the Schengen Agreement."
"The possibility that Sweden as a member of Schengen would have to extend the list of countries whose citizens are required to possess a visa when visiting Sweden has met with criticism."
"We have also expressed concern that this will, in various roundabout ways, result in a more restrictive refugee policy in our country."
"There is also a question mark over whether Sweden as a member of Schengen will be able to determine independently the level of its controls at its ""internal' borders."
"This question has also aroused apprehension in the debate in Sweden."
"It has, among other things, been pointed out that Sweden may have problems with the future harmonisation of the drugs policy of the Schengen countries."
"We do not yet know the implications that the removal of border controls between the Schengen countries will have on the younger generation as regards drug tourism."
"The Schengen collaboration is an interstate co-operation."
"This we believe is good."
"However, it does mean that each country has a right to say yes or no to whether they want to participate in each of the interstate forms of cooperation."
"We should of course open up Europe for its people, which for us means giving people the opportunity to travel freely without the need for a visa and to be able to work anywhere in Europe."
"We do not believe that border controls aimed at preventing the free movement of drugs, weapons, crime, etc. conflicts with the principle of mobility for the people."
"It is not a barrier to the mobility of people to have to show a passport at the border."
"Under items 31 and 32 of the report, France's border controls against Belgium and Luxembourg and the use of these to put pressure on the Netherlands to adopt a more restrictive drugs policy is being criticised."
"We cannot support this report."
"First of all, we believe that individual countries must be entitled to maintain such border controls as they deem necessary to prevent for example the inflow of narcotics."
"Secondly, we believe that France is doing the right thing in applying pressure on the Netherlands to alter their irresponsible drugs policy."
"'Yes' to Schengen, ' no' to a fortress Europe: that is the watchword of the report we discussed today."
"That does not worry us, but we are concerned about Schengen acting as a brake on free movement and security, actually becoming a pretext for hermetically sealed frontiers accompanied by the establishment of new administrative controls which may attack individual freedom and the rights of Community citizens themselves first, and then citizens from third countries who are legally resident in Community territory."
"The right to free movement and security must come under democratic control and hence the vigilance of the national parliaments, so that national legislation is adapted to the Schengen agreements in full respect of international conventions on asylum, protection of individual privacy and human rights."
"But the limited duration of the agreement, the absence of transparency, the lack of parliamentary control over it, and the delay in replacing it with Community legislation demonstrate that the various Member States have little enthusiasm for abolishing controls at their internal frontiers."
"In our view, the only thing that remains to be done is to get the most out of existing measures."
"We believe that the information system, much criticized because it is currently used as a database for undesirable foreigners, should be geared to the need to prevent real dangers and specific crimes and therefore obey the technical requirements of security."
"We concur with Mr Van Lancker in asking for the European Parliament to be informed about planned measures and decisions relating to all third pillar justice and home affairs matters, with a view to bringing that sector finally into the Community."
"Finally, in our opinion, to debate issues inherent to the agreement like free movement of persons, asylum policies, external frontiers, legal information, the fight against the drug traffic, international fraud and organized crime, we need to open up a discussion which will end in the abolition of the unanimity rule in the Council."
"Anttila, Lindqvist, Ryynänen, Virrankoski and Väyrynen (ELDR), Seppänen, Sjöstedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), Gahrton, Holm and Schörling (V), Bonde, Lis Jensen and Sandbæk (I-EDN), in writing."
"(SV) We fully agree with Mrs Van Lancker's criticism of the Schengen Agreement as regards the apprehension over 'fortress Europe' , the policy for dealing with people seeking asylum and how SIS is used primarily as a data base for 'unwanted Third World citizens' , etc."
"Our list of criticisms of Schengen is very long."
"We do not, however, share Mrs Van Lancker's conclusion regarding the legal incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Treaty."
"For this reason, we are voting against the report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Schengen agreements were initially intended to guarantee the free movement of the citizens and residents of Europe by abolishing internal frontiers while strengthening police and judicial cooperation at the Union's external frontiers."
"Today, however, the philosophy of Schengen has been substantially modified, to the advantage of 'Fortress Europe' ."
"The application, monitoring and administration of Schengen are, at present, still obscure and essentially geared to security, for it has been diverted from its initial aims."
"So where is the European spirit?"
"The Schengen dimension has itself been distorted."
"Moreover, France is not always prepared to abolish its customs controls with Belgium and Luxembourg."
"This is bad in terms of Schengen's image and, indeed, totally ineffective."
"The situation is serious enough to deserve condemnation."
"Certainly, we must consider the need to protect the Union from clandestine immigration, but does that mean we have to resort to uncontrolled procedures and multiply the administrative constraints which, in the final analysis, jeopardize human rights?"
"I say NO."
"As the rapporteur points out, the Union must live up to its ambitions."
"If we want to combat clandestine immigration effectively, we will have to have common policies on the right of asylum, external borders and the fight against crime."
"Once the third pillar becomes reality, we will manage to check the flows of migrations effectively and to combat all forms of crime equally effectively."
"I hope therefore that the intergovernmental conference will reach conclusions in its debates and that the governments will take account of our recommendations and expectations!"
"We can hope and dream... but the information we have so far on the progress of the current negotiations does not inspire much optimism."
"I am always somewhat surprised by the way the European Parliament approaches the Schengen agreements and by its deep distrust of the endeavour to protect a fundamental freedom of the people, their freedom of movement."
"It is without doubt essential to have genuine parliamentary and judicial control within the intergovernmental Schengen system."
"In an area where fundamental freedoms are at stake, the people have to be protected against arbitrary administrative and police action, whether they are Europeans or third-country nationals."
"So I fundamentally agree with the report when it maintains that 'the abolition of checks at internal frontiers must not be accompanied by the introduction of new administrative checks which would infringe human rights' ."
"There is, however, a real problem: the rise in international crime, the growing sense of insecurity among the people, the inability of the national authorities to combat crime at European level by themselves, the need to act here and now in the interests of Europe."
"Of course we can argue interminably about the powers of the national parliaments, the institutionalization of the CSA or the proposals to the IG on the third pillar."
"For the people, however, what is most important is direct action in the field, to achieve results that will improve internal security."
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats voted against the Van Lancker report because it contains many points that conflict with Denmark's reservations as regards cooperation on justice and home affairs."
"The report expresses concern over the lack of democratic control of the Schengen arrangements, in which neither the European Parliament nor the Court of Justice are sufficiently involved."
"There may be some justification for this view but, for as long as the cooperation is intergovernmental, it is the job of the national parliaments to exercise democratic control."
"If the structure of the Schengen cooperation is to be changed, that must happen within the framework of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The report wants the Schengen Agreement to be integrated into general Community law."
"The Danish Social Democrats take a sceptical view of this, since we wish to maintain the Nordic Passport Union alongside the Schengen cooperation."
"On behalf of the Spanish Partido Popular delegation in the PPE and speaking personally also, I should like to draw attention to the following aspects in the Van Lancker report."
"In general terms, the line taken by the PPE, the various public utterances of its members, both those who hold government office in the Member States as well as in particular those within the group in this House, have clearly shown that we are in favour of developing the freedom of movement specified in the Schengen Treaty and even more of the need to incorporate Schengen within the institutional framework of the Treaty on European Union and within the Community framework of the internal market - the development of the fourth freedom - the freedom of movement of persons - as laid down in Article 7A."
"Similarly it is clear - and it goes without saying that the PPE as a whole and in particular the current Government of Spain of which it forms part and the Members on whose behalf I am speaking - have always fully defended the need for a joint approach on the part of the Community institutions to the great transnational problems facing the European Union in the realm of the third pillar and we are particularly keen to see the creation of a common area of freedom and security."
"But we are against the partisan, partial and therefore methodological and legally incorrect use by any particular party of a resolution with the characteristics which emerged from the final vote."
"In fact this is not the forum for debating asylum policy, still less to nod through requests so fraught with inappropriate consequences, such as the automatic suspension of resources in any asylum proceedings."
"We are therefore clearly in favour of strengthening the principles which inspired Schengen: abolishing internal frontiers and instead having stronger external European Union borders."
"Our final vote against the report must be seen in this light."
"I want to voice my disagreement with certain sections of Mrs Van Lancker's report, as a French MEP but also on behalf of Jacques Donnay, MEP and president of the Conseil général du Nord."
"We should pay particular attention to problems linked to drugs, since this is, unfortunately, a serious matter for the Department of the North."
"A few figures are worth repeating: over a period of four years, the number of drug addicts charged in the Nord - Pas-de-Calais region has more than doubled."
"That same region has the highest rate of summonses relating to traffic offences and drugs use in the country."
"This is no doubt related to the region's economic vulnerability, but also to geographical factors."
"Our proximity to states that do not apply the same policies we do in this respect encourages a traffic that has spread far beyond our urban centres and affects the entire territory."
"In this context, we can only hope that temporarily at least some form of border controls will remain."
"That is why I oppose Mrs Van Lancker's report where it refers and alludes to drugs controls in France, notably in unamended paragraphs 5, 31 and 32."
"Of course this border surveillance can only complement the policies we are carrying out in the field: the North has taken a number of measures whose effectiveness is generally recognized."
"In any case, in all these areas I actively support closer cooperation with the Netherlands and Belgium in the search for means of reducing the damage caused by drugs."
"We must join forces in order to become more effective in the area of prevention, treatment and research."
"I believe everyone shares these concerns."
"That is the purpose of the first Franco-Dutch meetings on drugs now taking place in Lille, with the participation of our Belgian neighbours."
"Wim van Velzen report (A4-0045/97)"
"I want to draw particular attention to three points raised in Mr van Velzen's excellent report."
"The first is the importance of the universal service, in the context of liberalizing telecommunications, especially for certain peripheral areas, but also for certain population groups."
"If the information society is confined to certain urban centres and socio-occupational groups this will lead to a two-tier society that is fundamentally unequal and unfair in terms of general access to the most up-to-date know-how."
"Secondly, it is important to create legislation on the media which, by limiting their convergence, will help safeguard and stimulate pluralism of opinion and freedom of expression for all."
"Thirdly, it is important to protect the consumer."
"At present the information market is chaotic."
"The ordinary consumer - I am not talking about the specialist - has to spend large and sometimes unnecessary sums on equipment."
"The European consumer should therefore be offered access by means of an objective agency that will protect him against the dominant position of imports from Japan and the United States."
"These considerations, the Green Paper, the report by the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, must rapidly lead to practical decisions with a view to rendering the information society more dynamic while also rendering it useful to all concerned."
"We are voting for the report."
"Decentralised and network orientated business organisations with flatter hierarchies are good."
"The same goes for shorter working hours, teleworking, investment in small businesses with the whole population and all regions being given the same opportunity to participate in the development of the information society."
"This should in principle be decided and put into effect by all the social partners in the labour-market and by individual Member States."
"There is, in our opinion, no reason for the EU to legislate on this."
"We are also against a collective fiscal policy within the Union."
". (DA) The Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the Van Velzen report on the Commission's Green Paper on Living and Working in the Information Society."
"The Commission's Green Paper is strongly criticized for laying too much emphasis in its analysis of the information society on work, jobs and the competitiveness of the economy."
"The report therefore calls for more emphasis to be placed on how best the information society can be organized to benefit the individual, so that all get equal access to the information society."
"The report opens up a broad debate on continuing training, teleworking and parttime employment, which will have much greater importance in the future."
"The Danish Social Democrats take a positive view of a broader debate on the consequences of the information society for the individual and therefore consider that Mr Van Velzen has opened up an exciting discussion."
"However, the report contains certain points on which the Danish Social Democrats are sceptical."
"The Danish Social Democrats do not think that there is any immediate need at European level for legislative action to regulate matters affecting working conditions as a result of the development of the information society."
"The application of technological innovations, especially those that are certain to create deep rifts in the structure of society, can be justified on no criterion other than man himself, and his needs. Under no circumstances can innovations justify disregard for their human basis and subjugate man to technology and to the savage laws of the capitalist market."
"We have in our hands a Green Paper on 'Living and Working in the Information Society' , whose letter let alone spirit do nothing to advocate the priority of the human factor and respect for the rights of working people."
"We have before us a draft for the conversion of man into a mere cog-wheel, and indeed one of the cheapest and most flexible on the market."
"The proposals made and the measures promoted are dominated by the concepts of market cost and competitiveness, and intensify the effort to deprive working people of their rights and acquisitions, and to cripple and dislocate the very concept of labour."
"The control of working people and citizens is becoming ever more effective with the disorganization of labour protection systems, working time, social welfare, health and safety."
"Those measures are not a natural consequence of the rate of development and application of technologies, information and communications."
"The driving force for this policy is the huge amount of finance devoted to the acquisition of vast and quick profits."
"The Green Paper makes it clear with the most cynical frankness that 'the proposed social model is based on competition between enterprises' and calls for a 'stable and dedicated nucleus of working people' prepared to serve the needs of companies for rapid adaptation to market developments."
"It is therefore quite clear where and how the new technologies are to be used: wherever and however they can generate greater profits."
"The future of man in such a society is evident: uncertainty, insecurity, and conflict with his own needs, which will no longer shape his environment but be shaped by it, so as to serve those who determine that environment in the best, quickest and cheapest way."
"Plans such as those of tele-working and the isolation of people from the social context are plans to lobotomize man and turn him into a cheap and pliable raw material for profit."
"They are plans to create multiple-speed societies, societies of the one-third and the categorisation of citizens and working people, societies in which the unemployed, the aged, and the retired will be marginalized."
"In clause 23 of the report the establishment of a 'European authority' for data protection is proposed."
"I do not believe that the citizens of Europe benefit from this continuous demand for new authorities under the auspices of the EU."
"The probability is that this will create even more bureaucracy."
"I believe that the problem is best solved through national authorities."
"That concludes voting time ."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Industrial competitiveness (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on the reports by Mr Donnelly, Mr Langen and Mr Katiforis."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin my two minutes' speaking time in the debate on industrial policy by repeating that it is imperative for us to have a European industrial policy based on voluntary agreement."
"Our economic strength, our independence, our future, and above all our employment and unemployment rate depend on that."
"This is true of the maritime industry, it is true of the chemical industry and it is true of the automobile industry."
"In relation to the automobile industry, I first want to congratulate Mr Donnelly on the quality of his report and congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on its responsible Communication."
"Of course I am in favour of setting up a panel of representatives of the automobile and components industries, trades unions and user groups in order to define our future priorities and research strategies."
"Research efforts are needed to reduce pollution caused by motors, of course, but also if not above all by fuels."
"We must also continue with our efforts to improve safety."
"There are still far too many casualties and fatalities on our roads."
"All this is important."
"But, ladies and gentlemen, above all we must protect the European automobile industry as such from unfair and unjust competition and social dumping and do our utmost to develop it."
"This can be done by looking at all our European directives and decisions, asking the same question each time: will it promote employment, will it lead to a rise in production, consumption and market shares?"
"Lastly, and this is what I regret most on reading the documents under discussion today, the human dimension, the social dimension is missing."
"This morning's debate on Renault made that clear and the scandal of delocalization is even more serious in relation to the building of Europe."
"Without a political and social Europe, the rest is but crocodile tears."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Christian Democrats support the basic lines of the Commission's communication on Europe's maritime future."
"Parliament also takes the view that as one of the largest trading blocs in the world the European Union needs a competitive maritime industry in the long term too."
"But the broad outline is a little vague, Commissioner, and not likely to halt the decline in shipbuilding or the use of flags of convenience by ships from European shipyards."
"We both know that the meetings of the Maritime Industries Forum which you initiated many years ago have not come up with any major new ideas in recent years."
"There are a number of individual projects, but it seems we cannot expect much more in the way of general ideas from the Maritime Industries Forum."
"And yet we, the whole Parliament, believe that we need a new approach based on intensive consultation between the Community bodies and the economic circles concerned, be they shipyards, shipbuilding firms, suppliers, port authorities, etc., because only if the economic circles concerned commit themselves to voluntary agreements can we really secure a future for the European Community in the maritime sector."
"Let me address another two or three points very openly and plainly. On no account will there be higher subsidies for shipbuilding."
"People are still hoping that the OECD agreement will also be carried through in the USA and that shipbuilding subsidies can be abolished in general."
"The shipyards simply have to maintain or achieve productivity and competitiveness through their own efforts."
"And when I look at a country that I know well l find that the mediumsized shipyards are very much able to become competitive through their own efforts."
"The only means of helping the shipyards available to us in the Community is, for example, to withdraw sub-standard ships from circulation through more stringent port controls and thereby indirectly to meet the demand for new ships."
"Unfortunately the Commission has not taken up Parliament's call for the EUROS register for maritime shipping."
"Mr Bangemann, we must however reject the Commission's current policy of allowing the Member States to apply different aid systems since this leads to distortions of competition within the Community and even carries the risk that EU shipyards will fly the flag of another European Union country if, for example, the fiscal system is more attractive in the Netherlands than in another large Member State."
"Surely we cannot allow it in an internal market for shipyards to fly the flag of another country that has a more favourable tax system!"
"Apart from the framework conditions, which have to be uniform, the Commission must also pursue a consistent shipping policy."
"We cannot have DG IV preventing or hindering alliances between European shipping companies, which are urgently necessary to the survival of these companies, by pursuing a misguided competition policy."
"In that regard the Commission's industrial policy must also encompass the right kind of competition policy."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, as a representative of a historic maritime region, Genoa, I would like to mention some of the concerns of seafaring folk who see their calling threatened by the transformation of the maritime sector."
"I am particularly thinking of the employment difficulties facing young graduates of naval colleges and the fall in enrolments at naval schools."
"I think we need proper competition policy on the Union's external front, based not only on State subsidies but also on criteria for equilibrium, efficiency and protection of employees' rights."
"In this regard we are following developments in the CSCE agreements closely."
"On the internal front and in terms of economic initiative, I want to emphasize some of the recommendations our rapporteurs have made: the contribution to harmonizing the maritime policies of the Member States, the investment in port infrastructure and safe traffic control systems within the framework of the trans-European networks, and the contribution to training seafarers."
"I believe the Union should promote synergy through research and technological development programmes in research centres, universities and industry to generate innovation in an industrial sector which is becoming increasingly similar to aeronautics in terms of structure, equipment, control and communications."
"The Union should cooperate with the Member States to promote a policy of sustainable transport, using fiscal incentives, supporting projects and completing integrated systems."
"I propose specific inclusion of coastal regions undergoing transformation because of the changes in maritime transport in the structural funds intervention areas."
"Finally, given the reorganization of international freight traffic, returning to the Mediterranean route via Suez for structural reasons, I invite the Commission to consider the need for a joint study with maritime sector operators of the requirements of these regions, both in terms of their strategic relevance to the Union and in the context of the new relationships of cooperation with Mediterranean third countries."
"Thank you Madam President. I want to make my remarks in the context of today's wider debate on Renault and the discussion now on industrial policy, and largely to make one basic point."
"The role of Europe is to try to ensure that European industry can win a greater share both of its domestic European markets and of global markets; and we should help to enable, not to enfeeble, European industry in the strategies we pick."
"There is no doubt that unemployment is the major challenge that faces us in the next decade, and frankly in relative terms Europe is bad at creating jobs."
"The problems arise in terms of the taxed wage - the difference between what people take home and what people pay them overall is a problem; rigidity in the labour market is a problem; and we cannot shrink from those problems if we want job creation."
"What I welcome today in the Donnelly report and in the Commission's earlier report, is that this is the type of strategy that enables."
"It sets standards in environment, it sets goals for research and development, it helps to add something to the global challenge for European industry."
"That is where we are best placed, and I hope we go on with that kind of policy, though not into a more dirigiste form of economic management."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in this whole cocktail of debates we are holding, I can only discuss the proposals on the chemical industry in the short time available."
"First and foremost I would like to say that I do not quite understand the general attack launched by my Socialist colleague a moment ago."
"Of course we Greens also voted against the Langen report as a whole, but it is not true, Mr Langen, that this changes nothing, and I want to make that quite plain here."
"When we say that we take the view that economic instruments are a cost-effective means of tackling environmental problems, that is surely a step in the right direction, but of course that is not all we want to achieve today, at the end of the 20th century, in relation to the problems that chemical plants, the transport of chemicals and chemical products create in our everyday life."
"That is to say, it is a small step but certainly does not mean that we and the Commission can stop there."
"Let me add a few last words, and of course they are addressed specifically to Mr Bangemann, although I do not believe he will or can meet this demand during his term of office, but perhaps his successor can."
"These words are as follows: if you want to formulate an industrial policy for tomorrow, you cannot focus purely on efficiency but must take into account that the environment always plays a very major and important role."
"Madam President, I should of course like to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Bangemann and the Commission because in fact the Commission is presenting to us elements of European industrial policy from a sectoral point of view and that reassures many of us."
"Nevertheless I should like to comment on industrial policy and consultation of the workforce on the basis of this morning's debate which he attended."
"I have since examined the reports as regards consultation of the workforce and actions speak louder than words."
"We were discussing consultation at companylevel, the European company, but we have not discussed what the Commission can do for worker consultation by means of its industrial policy."
"Of course the report does mention a high-level consultative group in the automobile industry and, as regards the maritime sector it mentions a task force and the European Maritime Industries Forum."
"But my question focuses on the subject of the workers."
"The ECSC Treaty is coming to an end and that Treaty was a good European industrial model over the years when the sectors it covered were developing."
"It dealt with the various fundamental aspects: conversion policy, policy on technological innovation and social measures (it appears that in the future social measures are to be reduced merely to the question of training of the workforce)."
"But that Treaty featured one very important aspect and that was the consultative committee of workers and management."
"That model is no longer a valid model for the Commission."
"Since Community industrial policies are constantly leading to the conversion and transformation of companies, how can we incorporate in this sectoral consultation the European trade unions?"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, whether we are talking about the automobile industry, the chemical industry or the maritime industry, Europe is facing the challenge of international competition."
"Some people think they can meet it by barricading themselves behind national protective measures, which is quite unrealistic and utopian, or behind European protective measures, supposing that were possible politically, which I very much doubt as things stand."
"Economically, this kind of protection offers no prospects, given that the European economy is de facto integrated in the world market."
"Both the Langen and the Donnelly reports have the merit of pointing in the right direction, which is to adapt to this challenge, in other words to make further research efforts to improve the products in question, further investment efforts to improve productivity and further rationalization efforts to improve competitiveness at world level."
"On the Donnelly report, I basically agree with all his proposals."
"I have but one remark to make, a critical one, on something he does not mention."
"Not to mention certain things is rather like sweeping the dust under the carpet."
"Not a word on the question of labour costs."
"Not a word on the rigidity of the labour market."
"Not a word on those useful points that Mr Cox made, and that are after all fundamental questions that cannot be avoided simply by disregarding them and emphasizing all the other things."
"I know this is not a popular subject."
"I know that your party does not like tackling it, but hiding their head in the sand never saved anybody."
"So I believe we should have the courage to look things in the face."
"I know these are measures that are not easy to take, especially now."
"On the Langen report, I think most of what was decided is good and goes in the right direction."
"I was very surprised this morning listening to Mrs Roth-Behrendt to hear her say that she believed the Committee on the Environment took an entirely different view."
"This is not what transpires from the texts."
"Either Mrs Roth-Behrendt was speaking in her own name only or one would have to suppose that the Committee on the Environment does not entirely endorse her views."
"I do not know the background, but I did not see any major divergences between the documents submitted to us."
"There may be some differences of emphasis, but that is quite logical and normal."
"To conclude, Mr President, let me say this: we must remain consistent with ourselves."
"Everything we are proposing today in the three reports goes in the right direction, as I said."
"But we must also realise that if that is what we want, we cannot adopt other legislation tomorrow that goes in exactly the oppositive direction."
"This Parliament reputedly disregards the consequences of its legislative measures."
"We find we are no longer competitive, our costs are too high, our bureaucracy too ponderous, etc. But not a week passes without us here in Parliament voting with more or less enthusiasm, depending on our position in the Chamber, for legislative measures which in each case represent further costs or serious handicaps for investment, for research."
"So we should learn to control our tendency to legislate to an unreasonable degree."
"The objectives we are pursuing in relation to the environment and social protection are legitimate."
"We must concern ourselves with this; but we must also concern ourselves with the general objectives, which are not always or not all equally reconcilable."
"Madam President, I, like the other speakers, would congratulate the rapporteur and also the Commission for bringing forward this whole debate at the moment because we are at a vital juncture within the development of the European economy."
"In particular I can, like Mr Herman, support fully the points laid out in the Donnelly report."
"They are innovative and visionary and are an appropriate response to the changing circumstances in which we live."
"The Langen report on the chemical sector is particularly important to my own constituency of Munster, and Ireland in particular, because in Ireland at the moment there are 18, 500 people employed in this sector."
"It accounts for over £5 bn worth of exports and contributes over £200 m to the Irish economy."
"And advances in technology with new research techniques mean that the people employed in this sector are generally very highly qualified."
"Over 40 % of all the people employed in this sector are graduates with third-level education."
"It is important, when we are placing so much emphasis on one aspect of increasing education qualifications and increasing the opportunities for lifelong learning, that we provide a proper regulatory framework for employment creation in that area."
"I agree fully with Mr Herman."
"We must be logical."
"We must adopt a flexible approach to ensure that Europe can remain competitive in the world market and global market in which we now live. I would call on this House to ensure that we do not put in place any hindrances to the development of this industry, which is a vital sector for the economy and employment creation."
"Madam President, free competition and free market forces are necessary to safeguard the competitiveness of European industry."
"The Liberal Group therefore wants to ensure free competition in the European car industry and thereby also to secure economic advantages for us consumers."
"Hence we have tabled two amendments, Amendments Nos 6 and 7, with a view to tightening up Regulation No 1475/95 on block exemptions in connection with distribution and servicing agreements."
"This is a Commission regulation providing for exemption from the rules on free competition enshrined in the Treaty of Rome."
"I very much hope that the rapporteur, Mr Donnelly, and my colleagues in this Chamber can support these two amendments."
"I also hope that Commissioner Bangemann will act on the terms of Amendment No 7 calling for the Commission to put a stop to the systematic infringement by motor vehicle manufacturers and importers of the Block Exemption Regulation."
"I likewise hope that the Commission will take up paragraph 1(d) of the resolution and set up a High Level Panel for the motor industry on which all interested parties will be represented, including the independent motor traders and, of course, the consumers."
"At the same time I propose that this High Level Panel, as one of its first tasks, call a conference on the very important subject of the impending changes in the motor industry."
"Madam President, I wish, like other speakers, to take the opportunity to thank the rapporteurs and, in particular, Mr Katiforis for his detailed analysis of the problems facing Europe's marine industry, the comprehensive approach he has taken to tackling these problems and his conclusions."
"However, there is a glaring inconsistency in Europe's approach to the maritime industry."
"Every year this Parliament approves millions of ecus for the KONVER programme to assist small businesses to diversify from the defence industry into civilian production."
"But, at the same time, we penalize larger companies in the defence sector with over 230 employees that wish to diversify."
"One of these industries is naval shipyards."
"Due to the downturn in orders for warships these yards have to look elsewhere for work."
"If, however, these naval yards tender for civilian contracts within the European Union, they are immediately at a disadvantage due to the fact that they do not receive the same subsidy as civilian yards."
"How can we on one hand encourage diversification and on the other hand penalize firms which are attempting to diversify?"
"It is the economics of the insane."
"If we truly believe in diversification and changing from defenceorientated production to civilian production, then we must tackle this problem."
"I, therefore, would ask and request that this House support Amendment No 4."
"Madam President, we are having a whole day on industrial policy today: human and animal cloning, the maritime industry, and now the chemical industry."
"As well as congratulating the rapporteurs who have represented us throughout the discussions, I should also like to congratulate the Commissioner for taking such a serious approach to industrial policy."
"I think this is important for Europe."
"Our chemical industry is considerably more advanced than that of the United States or Japan, and we should be keen to hold on to this advantage."
"It is a sector which could set an example for many others, and the best thing about this proposal is that it finally sets out in black and white who needs to do what to strengthen our competitive position, it being clear that the main responsibility in this respect lies with the chemical industry itself."
"The Commission and the Member States must establish the basic conditions, such as by introducing clear environmental legislation and a framework for self- regulation, which could play an important part in making the industry more effective, cleaner and safer."
"I therefore cannot agree with my colleague Mrs Heinisch when she says that the chemical industry could be deregulated."
"Let us have clear and simple legislation by all means, but the industry is such a sensitive one that deregulation is really out of the question, in my view."
"One category within the chemical industry which could do with a little more attention is the small and medium-sized firms."
"Almost all the legislation is designed for the major companies, and the small and medium-sized firms do not have the manpower to meet all the requirements."
"Let me give you an example."
"In the European Union, firms are required to give details of the composition of their products on the label, and chemical firms must indicate not just the composition, but also the proportions of the ingredients."
"Just imagine if you were a small firm which had developed a new product after years of research and then had to hand your recipe over to your rivals."
"Mr Bangemann, you look like a man who likes to eat well: just try asking the head chef in a five-star restaurant whether he would be prepared to do this."
"I think the answer would be no."
"The Commission must of course provide clear environmental legislation and try to reduce CO2 emissions, but the environmental improvements being brought about here in the West would be of even more benefit in Eastern Europe, where their impact would be that much greater."
"Madame President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank Alan Donnelly for his good and expert report."
"The Renault motor concern has announced that it will be closing its factory in Vilvoorde in Belgium completely and will be making staff redundant in France as well."
"At the same time it has the nerve to apply for EU support in Spain."
"If Renault puts its worst-case scenario into practice, breaking EU rules, this will be a complete farce."
"Is this an indication of how industry intends to get in shape for the euro?"
"Euro could well become a dirty word among the unemployed, and no wonder."
"Those who called for flexibility should remember that each unemployed person has shown 100 % flexibility on his own part."
"Economic growth alone will not banish unemployment, and structural interventions will thus ultimately also be necessary."
"The plan should be to move the priority from taxing labour to taxing added value."
"This would encourage employment in the service sector and would at the same time permit the growth of the information-intensive sector."
"Let machines do the boring work and let people serve other people."
"I look to the Commission for initiatives in this sector."
"In almost all the EU Member States the economy is being thrust into the straitjacket of the EMU cohesion criteria."
"The problem is that the timetable for achieving the criteria is very fast and they are interpreted too strictly."
"Everything is now happening in an environment of record unemployment and difficult social conditions."
"The most serious shortcoming is of course that unemployment is not one of the criteria."
"I therefore propose that two types of security should be included among the hard EMU criteria: economic security and social security."
"Because monetary security does not appear to create social security or significantly to improve employment, Parliament should commit itself in particular to including social security among the EMU criteria, so that we can be saved from future Vilvoordes."
"Madam President, I applaud the report by Mr Katiforis."
"More specifically, the points he raises in the motion for a resolution are ones that I agree with."
"I must say that the future of the shipbuilding industry and more generally the shipping industry parallels that of merchant shipping itself."
"Shipbuilding was reduced by 82.5 % between 1985 and 1994, and European merchant shipping also fell by 40-50 % during the same period."
"Those are parallel tracks, and that should have caused us concern."
"As for the shipbuilding industry, a long time ago the Community introduced legislation to abolish State subsidies, but at the same time it failed to propose alternative solutions, which could have led to development on the basis of private-sector economic criteria for the shipbuilding industry in Europe. Throughout that time, the Community did nothing at all for European shipping."
"And all the proposals put forward - mainly on the European Parliament's initiative, such as the report on the Euros register of shipping - essentially sank without trace and made no progress."
"Consequently, - and I say this because Commissioner Bangemann is here today - with the exception of initiatives in some specific sectors of the so-termed 'para-maritime' economy, in other words equipment, electronic devices, etc., the shipbuilding industry has in general seen no interest, it has benefited from no interest on the part of Europe, while Europe itself, insisting on the abolition of subsidies, has essentially annihilated it and helped other shipbuilding industries in the Third World, as you must know."
"Madam President, there are two things I would like to stress."
"One is the situation we now have in Europe, with a constant proliferation of state aids and ever more ways in which competition is being distorted."
"We talk about liberalization."
"Parliament contributes substantially to this process."
"But at the same time there are countries which are lagging seriously behind in the on-going process."
"It is immensely difficult to get the European people to believe in what we are trying to achieve when they see firms moving out of their country with support from the Union."
"It is difficult to get the European people to believe in our project when they see state aid going to various enterprises behind the Commission's back and being approved after the event."
"My colleague, Mr Miller, is proposing that shipyards be supported in switching their production from naval to ordinary merchant vessels: support for shipyard reconstruction."
"Shipbuilding capacity in Europe is already huge."
"This is an example of how regional interests come into conflict with one another."
"I can well understand Mr Miller's proposal."
"But if I were to speak on behalf of the European shipbuilding industry - I do not, but if I were to do so - we would get into problems of excess capacity."
"There was some talk of holding conferences."
"We have had many of those."
"But we have a problem of what to say to the people of Europe."
"We constantly get into situations which run counter to the policy we actually want to pursue."
"I therefore appeal to the Commissioner to focus the Council's attention on these situations."
"It is not just that a firm can get aid to move from Denmark to Ireland; we also have competition in the field of taxation."
"A company does not pay much tax for the first ten years after setting up in Ireland."
"It does in the rest of Europe."
"Hence we are not merely concerned with competition policy here; we are also talking about fiscal policy and state subsidies."
"Madam President, I would like to speak on the Commission communication on Europe's maritime future."
"I am sure you will agree, Madam President, that since 'all the nice girls love a sailor' , it is important that we nurture and support our maritime industries and, in particular, the seafarers and their training for which I would like to think that the British Government has set a positive example."
"I would like to throw down a challenge to Commissioner Bangemann and his colleagues today."
"We must ensure a level playing field throughout the European Union."
"I would urge the Commission to make sure that state aids to ports and ferry companies are phased out as far as possible."
"Currently there is no transparency in the application of state aids."
"I hope the Commissioner will agree that he must address this and that it cannot be right that, for example, Stena/Sealink are actually making British seafarers redundant because the Dutch government, as Mr Jarzembowski mentioned earlier, is choosing to protect its own seafarers by giving a preferential tax rate."
"That has to be wrong."
"I would refer the Commissioner and the House to Mr Belleré's opinion and in particular paragraphs 8 and 9 in which we call for free and fair competition between transport modes with all modes of transport fully bearing their own costs including external costs and where we call for free and fair competition to be encouraged between the Community ports and between maritime shipping lines."
"If the Commission does nothing else after today's debate, I hope it will seek to establish a level playing field and seek to remove gross state aids such as those practised in Holland which I believe are grossly unfair."
"I support Mr Belleré's opinion and, indeed, Mr Katiforis' report."
"Madam President, congratulations are in order to the Committee and its rapporteur, Mr Katiforis, for the proposals presented, drawing attention to the arrangements and measures which could lead to improvements in maritime transport, in this case (and I am going to focus on this particular case)."
"Accounting for 90 % of extra-Community traffic and 30 % of intra-Community traffic of goods, maritime transport is the cheapest, least congested and least polluting means of transport, all facts which means it should be given increasing importance."
"In addition to what has been said, however, we must pay more attention to the articulation of maritime transport with other means of transport, in particular rail and road, as this is the only way of improving and giving a more complete coverage of European territory, including landlocked regions and countries, which are less favoured."
"Along these lines, more importance should also be given to the use of small and medium-sized harbours and ports, which are able to accept ships which account for more than 60 % of Community traffic."
"Apart from thereby avoiding congestion in large parts, something which is quite unnecessary, it also is an excellent way of achieving full coverage of territory, as already mentioned, in the interest of a more efficient network of supplies in all resources and improving the well-being of all Europeans."
"I think that these were some of the points which had to be added to this debate."
"Mr President, as one of the last Socialist Group speakers today I would like to clarify certain points which have arisen during the debate with regard to the report by Mr Langen."
"The Socialist Group welcomes this report."
"It shows a clear understanding of the problems facing the chemical industry in recent years."
"The industry is in a state of constant change brought about by the development of global competition."
"This means that we would support the majority of the actions proposed in the report to assist the industry to adapt to meet this competition."
"However, there are still certain points of difference between the Socialists and the Christian Democrats that go beyond nuance."
"There are issues relating to the liberalization of energy supplies and the deregulation of the regulatory framework as they apply to the industry, on which we cannot completely reach agreement with the Christian Democrats."
"In particular there is the use of voluntary agreements in the promotion of a carbon dioxide tax."
"The Socialists see voluntary agreements as having a complementary role to legislation, but not as a substitute for it."
"As regards the carbon tax, we see it as almost inevitable that some Member States will introduce this."
"So it must be sensibly prepared."
"The future of the European chemical industry is in building upon the basis that we already have: high-value industry producing high-value products, with a well-trained work force that is well paid and rewarded for its tasks."
"That is the future of the European chemical industry, not deregulation, and not an approach to competition which means cheapest is best."
"Madam President, there is no doubt that Europe's shipping industry is characterised first by a dramatic decline in the shipbuilding sector, and secondly by a decline and transformation of the great European fleet into a fleet of convenience."
"In my opinion, the responsibility for this disastrous course of the shipbuilding industry is the policy of competition implemented by the European Union and its Member States for a number of years."
"The shipbuilding sector has declined by 82.5 %."
"The question is: is it possible for Europe's shipbuilding industry to compete with that of the Far East under conditions of competition at the level of workforce remuneration and with full deregulation of the market?"
"The answer is no, and I think it is time for a different policy."
"Madam President, I wonder whether the policy, the direction which specifies 'training, education and up-to-date technologies' for those who work in shipping, has any value at all when almost all of Europe's fleets are governed by bipartite agreements and employ crews from the Far East, very cheap crews which even create dangers for the safety of shipping."
"These questions are not answered either by the statement or by the report of our colleague Mr Katiforis."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Alan Donnelly and Mr Langen and Mr Katiforis rightly began their reports with a short description of the way they see industrial policy."
"In submitting to Parliament a communication on individual sectors, on which Parliament then draws up reports, we are of course dealing only with small parts of a general policy."
"In that respect they were quite right to do so."
"I too would like to begin by telling you again how we see our industrial policy, which we have after all now been pursuing for eight years and, in my view, with some success."
"The situation of departure was quite clear."
"It was the time of the creation of the single market, i.e., new conditions of competition were emerging on our own markets and even at that time it was apparent that the trend towards globalization would increase, that the Union's external borders would have to be more accessible to its trading partners and that competition would increasingly become a principle of this global economic system."
"Now, one can look at competition in ideological terms or, if I may put it like that, in a quite relaxed way."
"Ideologically, competition can be damned or praised to the skies."
"I do not belong to either group because I do in fact think that competition is an instrument, a condition, for achieving many other aims too."
"Mrs Soltwedel-Schäfer saw a contradiction between an efficient and a socially or environmentally oriented economic system."
"That is only superficially the case."
"For as a rule, and every example in history has shown it to be so, an inefficient economic system is neither socially nor environmentally compatible."
"The difficulties that have emerged in, for instance, the new German Länder in relation simply to cleaning up the land on which the old industrial plants were sited and remedying the environmental damage they caused have shown quite clearly that this is simply not right."
"But efficiency or greater competitiveness is also an instrument for achieving better and higher aims."
"I will take the example of higher wages, which Mr Herman also mentioned."
"Higher wages per se can of course have an adverse effect on competition."
"It is quite clear that if I pay higher wages I have higher costs and that if I cannot absorb them, I will be at a disadvantage in relation to my competitor."
"But I can absorb them if I become more productive."
"That is one possibility."
"So, as is the case in many Member States, I can finance higher wages and higher fringe benefits and therefore also social systems if my productivity allows it."
"That means I simply have to be a bit better, a bit more efficient."
"That is why it always irritates me so much - and I have seen it again and again in my political career - when people are against efficiency."
"What is wrong with efficiency?"
"Surely it is quite human to want to do something properly."
"I cannot remember who gave the example of the head cook."
"If I am standing in front of two restaurants and one serves excellent food because the cook is good while the other serves rubbish then of course I will go to the one with the good cook."
"For the rest, all those people who are against efficiency will also go to the good restaurant."
"That is just one way of acting against one's own principles."
"So I do not consider efficiency something bad."
"We need it and it can help us make up for many of our disadvantages."
"Let us take an example in the automobile sector."
"I shall be returning to this question in more detail."
"Different undertakings are in quite different situations in the Union."
"There are undertakings with problems and others with no problems at all."
"To take the question of surplus capacity: some undertakings have surplus capacity and have to reduce it while others take more than a year to deliver certain models, which are not cheap cars."
"Once again that shows that the price aspect is not necessarily crucial, that the cheapest is not always the best."
"You are quite right, Mr Bowe."
"But nor should we pretend that whatever we produce, someone will buy it at some point."
"That will not work."
"That is why we always say in our industrial policy that we have to be a little better because we may well be a little more expensive."
"But we can sort that out."
"Above all, it requires flexibility."
"In the programme we submitted two years ago - and I think Mr Rapkay mentioned that - we focused primarily on intensive training and further training of workers and employees."
"For if we do not invest in human capital, we will not achieve what we all want."
"It is on that particular point that we really should seek agreement."
"Efficiency is necessary in order to achieve other political aims."
"I now turn to the various questions, first on the automobile industry."
"The Commission has no problem with all the additional proposals in this area."
"We are quite prepared to accept Alan Donnelly's proposals, in particular regarding the Forum, which is a permanent body in which we hold discussions with unions, undertakings and suppliers, i.e., with the entire car industry."
"Although I admit that I am of course always suspected of not being particularly keen on the unions, I would ask you to come and listen to what people in the Maritime Forum have to say."
"Mr Jarzembowski is my witness."
"I was almost the only one who managed by brute force to ensure that union representatives took part and could also play a part later in the high-level panel, i.e., in the steering committee."
"It is quite clear, and I am saying this again in relation to the case in question, that an efficient economic and industrial policy are impossible unless we have sensible social components; worker participation in the decisions of a company is not just a question of social policy or justice but a question of the efficiency of that company."
"The company will become more efficient if workers and employees have a say in important decisions."
"My colleague Mr Flynn has already said how difficult it is to carry something like this through in Europe."
"You are familiar with the drama of the Social Charter."
"During the attempt to draw up a statute for a European company I myself saw how incredibly difficult it was to resolve even the question of co-determination."
"That was the sole reason why the whole thing failed in the end."
"Some people wanted nothing at all, others did not want to give up their particularly good systems and in the end nothing came of it."
"Of course there is no sense in that."
"So, yes to dialogue and also to the other demands."
"Without a shadow of doubt the automobile industry will have to embark on structural change, but it is in a position to survive it."
"I do not think, although some seem to believe I do, that it cannot manage this."
"It will manage it with a certain reduction in capacity."
"This will be possible in some undertakings because we have now become more competitive than we were even a few years ago."
"There are no doubt several reasons for the declining market share of Japanese cars in the Union; but no doubt one of the most important in this connection is that our car manufacturers now offer better products that attract buyers more than cars from Japan or Korea."
"Someone said we should be consistent."
"I very much agree."
"Unfortunately, we are holding discussions with very different participants."
"When we discuss industrial policy we are always dealing with the same people; when we discuss environmental policy we are dealing with different people."
"The same applies in the Council."
"There is a Council of Ministers of Industry which discusses and then says energy prices have to be cut."
"And then there is the Council of Environment Ministers that says energy prices have to be raised. The decision will depend on the inclinations of the presidency."
"That is a nonsense."
"We must keep to a consistent line and of course we also need a more common approach in Europe."
"Mrs Peijs and others said that better solutions were found in the Netherlands and that is why people go there."
"So long as we do not have a common policy, I regard that as the second-best solution."
"In any case everything is far better in the Netherlands."
"So let us all go to the Netherlands, why not?"
"That creates a pressure which would actually bring about these joint solutions and I am the first to say we need that in the tax system, and the Commission will indeed be making a number of proposals here."
"So, in response to what Alan Donnelly suggests: yes we will do so and transpose it very quickly."
"I come now to the chemical industry."
"That really is the first example of benchmarking."
"We agreed with the industry that we want to develop a kind of model of how an industry can keep itself competitive while also responding to the social questions this creates."
"As you can see from the most excellent report by Mr Langen, the chemical industry managed to do so."
"For this really is possible, even in an industry where price does indeed play a decisive part."
"It is still conceivable to say that if a car is more expensive it may be a bit smarter, a bit better; but if you produce some kind of raw material, as the chemical industry generally does - leaving aside derived and upstream products - anyone else could in fact manufacture it too and it is purely a question of price."
"Nevertheless our industry has managed very well to retain its position and I think that is an excellent entrepreneurial achievement and also a good achievement on the part of the unions, for in this industrial sector the unions are very open as regards structuring and restructuring and discuss it in a manner we could only wish other industrial sectors would imitate."
"We are not discussing coal today but, Mr Rapkay, I would like to say to you that an industry in which every job is subsidized by DM 120 000 a year cannot survive, and those happen to be the facts and cannot be disputed; every job costs DM 10 000 a month in public money."
"After all, we cannot criticize the towns in the Ruhr area which have given up this industry and are looking towards modern, new prospects, such as Essen, which is the biggest services town in Germany."
"If you talked to people in these towns or to the SPD there you would hear them say: ' why did we not do so sooner?'"
"And the situation in the shipbuilding industry is the same."
"And that is why we said we must clear up the misunderstanding about these traditional industries not having a future."
"Indeed we have managed to do so because everyone now believes they do have a future."
"Do not ask me how we can justify an industry in which inspite of subsidies German hard coal is DM 200 more expensive per tonne than imported hard coal from anywhere else, including freight costs."
"I do not understand that."
"That is where my understanding stops and I think we have to be open and honest with each other about this."
"For years now, I think it is five years, we have had the Maritime Forum in the shipbuilding sector and I believe it has been successful."
"I agree, Mr Jarzembowski, dazzling new ideas do not come up every year."
"It is very rare for that to happen and if it did I would look at the person concerned with some anxiety for he would certainly not have his feet on the ground."
"We are making very good headway in research and development."
"One Member, Mrs Estevan Bolea, said that shipbuilding is more than shipbuilding."
"If you read the report, and obviously you did read it because that is precisely what it says, you cannot use it as a criticism of the Commission."
"For it is in that Forum that we said that we need ports, suppliers, classification systems, scientific institutes, oceanography, etc. We need all that to establish a system that works."
"So we had some success with that."
"What is not included in this report, as was rightly mentioned, is the new situation that has arisen with the American refusal to ratify the OECD agreement."
"At this point I no longer believe they will do so."
"That faces us with the question: what now?"
"The first is to go ahead without the Americans."
"That is possible and indeed quite reasonable for our most difficult competitors here are the Japanese and in particular the Koreans, not so much the Americans."
"Or we can formulate a quite different new policy of our own."
"The third option, which we are probably tending towards, is to do both."
"We are trying to keep the OECD agreement alive without the Americans while at the same time formulating a new policy for the shipbuilding industry in the broad sense of the term."
"Of course navy shipbuilding plays a crucial role here, for if we want our own security and defence policy then, as I keep saying to the defence industry, we also need a minimum capacity for the production of material, which also means ships."
"It is quite obvious that cost is less of a priority in naval shipbuilding than in civil shipbuilding so that shipyards that can do both thus achieve a cost mix that is more advantageous to them."
"We must also consider to what extent merchant shipbuilding is competitive in the EU."
"That cannot be planned. We cannot set ourselves objectives here."
"Someone said the Commission should do so."
"That no longer has anything to do with a market economy."
"But of course we can define the conditions under which such an industry can operate more clearly than in the past."
"And we will do so."
"I turn now to the question of subsidies and relocation."
"We have discussed this on several occasions."
"Here too there are two exaggerated and therefore misguided approaches and only one real way of tackling the problem."
"It would be a great exaggeration to say that there is no problem, to pretend that all is well."
"In that respect perhaps Renault has had at least one positive effect, namely to show that there is a problem."
"The other misguided approach is to say that we must now introduce very strict rules: nobody must move, everybody has to remain where they were!"
"Nobody is allowed to decide on job losses or changes, that is not allowed!"
"That too would bring about the end of a competitive industrial structure, for some shifts make sense and of course some relocations can certainly be supported under certain circumstances by granting subsidies."
"So that means - and this is the right approach - that we must check in every case whether there really is any point in granting subsidies from the regional, social or any other fund."
"For here there is a contradiction between two objectives: first the objective of developing an industrial structure in a region, secondly the attempt not to create any surplus capacity."
"The steel industry was mentioned, not without reason."
"For after all, there we managed the trick of reducing surplus capacity, and in a manner which certainly created social hardship, but which was also accepted and understood."
"Accordingly, we have a capacity that corresponds to demand, we have reasonable prices and, consequently, no problems."
"We must check, not only in the automobile industry but in other sectors too, whether there is any point in creating new capacity or whether this would confuse the market and we end up with situations we can then only control by taking countermeasures, i.e., by spending more money, which is of course quite ridiculous."
"We have to do this."
"In fact we have rules of this kind for synthetic fibres, where do not allow new capacity to be created because enough exists, or rather, we do not grant subsidies because if anyone wants to do so by themselves they can."
"This could produce a good general approach and I hope, as this discussion has shown, that we will abandon the dogmatic approaches that keep being proposed, because in the case of economic problems there are always good, right and wrong solutions."
"A fairly prominent SPD figure once said: ' There is no such thing as SPD economic policy or CDU economic policy...' - and I am not quoting a Liberal but an SPD supporter because I think the Member concerned would find him more credible, although now you do not seem to like this either - anyway, in my view this man quite rightly said: ' There is no such thing as SPD, CDU or FDP economic policy, there is only a wrong or a right economic policy.'"
"The question, of course, is who decides what is wrong or right."
"The Commission always does that!"
"Sometimes not!"
"Thank you, Mr Bangemann."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"The information society, culture and education"
"The next item is the report (A4-0325/96) by Mrs Morgan, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, on the information society, culture and education."
"Madam President, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media has always acknowledged the importance and significance of the information society for our future economic wellbeing."
"There is no question of the fact that we loudly applaud the efforts to provide universal access to the new communication methods and welcome the great strides made in the infrastructure development throughout the continent with the help of EU finances."
"Nevertheless, if we all pull together we will inevitably come to the point - perhaps not now, perhaps not in this century - some time in the 21st century where we are all linked to the information society."
"But then what?"
"Why would anyone want to use it?"
"The Culture Committee was extremely aware that there had been a serious lack of focus on the content aspect of the information society and the need to concentrate both on educational and cultural opportunities and obstacles that the information society will throw up."
"This is why the Culture Committee decided to initiate this report."
"We are all aware of the speed of developments in this field and since the original draft we have been delighted to see that many of the report's recommendations have already been implemented or are at least being given serious consideration."
"It is interesting to note that even last night, it was not just the Commission that responded, but Jacques Chirac, in a speech, made a commitment to connect all secondary schools to the information society by the year 2000 and to reduce VAT on multimedia products."
"I hope this is restricted to educational multimedia."
"Before I go any further, it is important to inform you why I have introduced five amendments to my report, introducing a timetable calling for their implementation by the year 2000."
"Some Members have asked: ' Why the year 2000, why not 1999 or 2001?'"
"If we do not set targets in the timetable, we will not have a framework on which to base the propositions contained in this report."
"For that reason I hope everyone will support these amendments."
"The European Union must set benchmarks."
"I have just heard that Mr Bangemann is very keen on benchmarks so I hope he will take up the idea of benchmarks in this report."
"It is important that Member States across the continent reach these benchmarks."
"Otherwise we will develop into an information-rich elite which will do nothing to help the social cohesion across Europe."
"The first thing we should do is equip our children with the tools of this new trade but in order to do this we must equip our teachers first."
"Member States should be looking at the introduction of compulsory IT modules within teacher training courses."
"This must be supplemented with lifelong learning so they can keep abreast of new technological developments."
"Parents should also be encouraged to take an interest in order to avoid a technical generation gap developing."
"These technological developments are occurring at such a pace that it is important that we take a look at what is possible so that we adapt our educational institutions accordingly."
"Computers can be made so small these days that pupils could easily hide them from both teachers and parents."
"They could even hide them in their trainers."
"Data retrieval will become second nature to many pupils."
"Recently I visited a school in my constituency where the pupils were given an assignment which was to go and draw a picture of an atom."
"One of the children came back with the latest picture from the home page of MIT."
"That is the kind of level of education we are talking about."
"They must therefore be taught how to analyse the information they receive."
"We must ensure that they learn to interpret the data and assess it in a critical fashion."
"Most importantly we must ensure that women take up the opportunities offered so that they do not become further marginalized in the 21st century."
"There will also be opportunities for slow learners to develop at their own pace, and, crucially, for rural areas so that they do not feel marginalized."
"We will always be confronted with the question of who will pay for the new technologies, particularly in the educational field."
"It makes sense, therefore, to look at examples of best practice and see how we can develop public and private partnerships to provide and ensure quality for future generations."
"The new technologies could change our whole culture and the way we run our lives."
"But culture in the narrower sense of the term also needs to be addressed."
"Where better to ensure access to culture than through our libraries?"
"The effect of information technologies on our libraries could be enormous."
"That is why we are delighted to see that the Commission has again responded to our calls for a Commission report on libraries and IT to be produced."
"Finally but crucially, I am proposing the creation of a millennium archive."
"This would be an archive in digital form of the EU's fifteen Member States' major national cultural collections."
"Open access should be given to all EU schools, colleges and libraries."
"But it is important that we act now."
"There is a major threat that the sale of exclusive digital rights may go to the powerful multinational companies, thereby restricting members of the public from seeing their own cultural heritage."
"Madam President, I wish to begin by warmly congratulating the rapporteur on her excellent report."
"There is a great deal in this report, so much that in the allotted time I am going to find it difficult to pick out the real points."
"For this reason, I want to concentrate on paragraphs 27 and 28 - the position and role of libraries in Europe - to which the rapporteur has just referred."
"The existence of libraries is a mark of a civilized society: an educated and sophisticated society has good and easily accessible libraries."
"By contrast, those who wish to distort history or suppress sections of society have often destroyed or suppressed libraries."
"It is our role to ensure that the immense power of the information revolution does not leave out, damage or neglect our libraries."
"They are crucial links to bridge the gap between rich and poor, to provide vital knowledge of other cultures and other languages - social cohesion, as the rapporteur has just said."
"In the information society of the future - a society to which this report more than well refers - libraries must have a major role."
"Eluned Morgan has just spoken of data retrieval, and electronic storage of and access to materials and information provide wonderful opportunities, mixing the physical realities with virtual roles."
"This can be expanded, new opportunities can be extended to the benefit of millions and whole collections previously inaccessible to most people can now be made easily accessible at many different outlets - public libraries, schools, colleges and all educational establishments."
"But these are opportunities that a free market will not provide."
"A world where making money is the sole objective will not see this as a priority."
"The role of the European Union therefore becomes more important than ever, to protect our culture and our heritage certainly, but also to open new doors to the millions not to the few - doors that will remain closed if we leave the market to its own devices."
"This though is an area that has really only been touched on; it is one that deserves more attention."
"I support the call on the Commission to come forward with a green paper."
"I am delighted that it has indicated its support for this and hope very much that it will move quickly so that the libraries are not left behind."
"The rapporteur has presented an excellent report."
"I congratulate her."
"Cymru am byth ."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first I want to congratulate Mrs Morgan on the quality of her report, a report that calls for several remarks on our part, with which I am sure many here agree."
"Over a period of some years now, many Europeans have become familiar with the new concepts of communication."
"France indeed spearheaded this cultural revolution by giving every French household access to minitel."
"Addressing the question of young people, President Jacques Chirac emphasized the urgent need to combat illiteracy and to give access to information technology to the greatest possible number of people, mainly by making it more affordable."
"This is a vital issue for Europe."
"The decisions we take must reflect this sense of urgency, for the new information technologies are advancing very rapidly."
"Those extraordinary educational tools represented by the multimedia must be used in a targeted manner."
"They must become the necessary accompaniment to traditional educational material such as books and the written word; but under no circumstances must these various educational tools compete among themselves, for that would be disastrous."
"We must also support our young people in deciphering this language so that we do not dehumanize it and we must also protect its content."
"To protect does not mean to barricade; on the contrary it means enabling each individual to express his or her vision, especially in cultural matters, on the basis of respect for all."
"Needless to say, at a time when we are all shocked by news of terrible barbarities, we must protect minors more effectively both in the creation and the dissemination of software."
"Once we have taken these precautions we can rise to the great challenge of promoting the establishment of networks and contacts between north and south, between urban and rural regions, tourist and industrial regions, in order to encourage our European co-citizens to carry out joint projects."
"The sharing of common experiences and common know-how is an important factor in our fight against unemployment and more generally our fight against social division."
"Madam President, Commissioner, Mrs Morgan's excellent report is welcome, because it is high time to stress the central position of education and culture in the information society."
"Now is the time to redirect our resources towards developing content and improving quality."
"The market in multimedia for education is a growth area in which there is a need for cooperation between producers and users and for the cultural and linguistic adaptation of products in order to encourage Europe's diversity."
"The INFO 2000 programme should contain more support to this end, and the research programmes should stress the development of multimedia and programmes with an educational purpose."
"It is also essential for the Commission to produce rapidly for discussion its Green Paper currently in preparation on libraries, and open up the important debate on public access to electronic information, copyright from the user's as well as the producer's point of view, the place of books and reading and the professional profile of work in the library and information sector, and educational needs in the modern network and information society."
"The problems have long since ceased to be quantitative even in terms of information, and are now to a far greater extent qualitative."
"Its a matter of whether everyone manages to obtain the information which is relevant to them and whether they have the capacity to assess and select from this information."
"Madam President, the Morgan report has the merit of focusing attention on the central importance of the cultural and educational dimension of the information society."
"The new technology certainly represents an extraordinary opportunity but it also conceals extraordinary risks."
"The two principal risks are exclusion and homologation."
"It is obvious that the most disadvantaged strata of society risk further marginalization by not possessing the cultural and economic tools to gain access to information."
"Furthermore, technology left exclusively in the hands of private initiative risks reducing culture to the banal, by progressively eliminating the individuality and expression of different local cultures."
"That is why we think the measures and initiatives set out in the Morgan report are crucial, particularly as regards teacher training."
"The Member States must commit themselves, amongst other things, to converting their national cultural collections into digital form to contribute to creating a European archive."
"And the Commission could enter the vast heritage of our museums, art galleries and theatres into the network of available information."
"Madam President, first let me voice a regret."
"I think it would have been preferable to consider this report at the same time as the White Paper we discussed yesterday, for I find the difference of legal basis not just factitious but also detrimental to political coherence and effectiveness."
"Turning to the report we are considering today, I want to congratulate Mrs Morgan on the quality of her work."
"She was intelligent enough to avoid the two pitfalls of systematic rejection dictated by fear of progress and blind admiration for that progress."
"The central issue in this debate is whether the development of these new technologies is synonymous with progress in the science of education, that is to say, whether it is likely to reduce inequalities."
"For even if these new communication technologies enable us to effectively combat failure at school, we also know that the cost of the equipment is a source of inequality."
"So we have to find a fair balance between the acquisition of these basic disciplines and access to the new technologies, for the keyboard, the screen and the mouse cannot become the only writing tools and exercize books of the 21st century."
"Mrs Morgan's report has many good qualities and courageously points to a number of dangers, while at the same time showing the potential for culture and education."
"But I think it suffers from certain illusions in relation to family life, school life and culture."
"The crisis facing many young people in their family and in society springs from difficulties with language and communication."
"Mastery of a language and skill in using it to make oneself understood and more able to live with others comes mainly from time spent together, from the richness of interpersonal communication."
"The tools provided by information technology are useful for people who are already in a structured situation and who will therefore benefit from the extra potential they offer."
"The problem arises when this structure, in relation to language, in relation to education of the mind, and therefore judgment, does not exist."
"In such cases, using machines is no palliative."
"So we are faced with a number of illusions here."
"The domain of school life and culture is also the domain where people discover a taste for making an effort."
"To pretend that intellectual work, that culture, is easy, is in everyone's grasp, is in a sense easy to consume, is a great illusion."
"This taste for making an effort, for progress in seeking the good, the true and the beautiful, is very much dependent on the richness of interpersonal communication."
"In information technology, the screen is omnipresent."
"In fact the word 'screen' should make us stop and think."
"I fear that these tools are marvels only for those who are already structured, already well-versed in this general culture, which will enable them to profit from them, while they pose a serious threat if we regard them as a palliative."
"Madam President, the globalization of trade which raises the level of knowledge, the arrival of the information society which will radically transform the nature of work and the organization of production, together with the acceleration of technical and scientific progress are the scenarios of the future, obliging the Union to reflect now on how it can respond adequately to the new demands of the world of work and education."
"There are two possible responses on these issues; upgrading education generally, which is the indispensable basis for acquiring new technological skills and developing student and worker mobility, but above all the implementation of a system which permits any individual to gain access to general education and develop approaches to work by adapting training methods to changes in day-to-day reality, due precisely to the globalization of the economy, the rise of the information society and the development of the scientific and technological society."
"With the vast mass of messages immediately available in today's information society, teaching cannot remain confined to the scholastic microcosm, but must train the citizens of tomorrow to be able to identify the best strategy for accessing what is most appropriate, useful and relevant in the mass of available information."
"If we want to exorcise for good the demons that escaped from Pandora's box when technological progress lifted the lid, our training systems must become the mirror of society, reflecting it in their methods and technology."
"Europe is lagging behind in the information sector and this is a serious obstacle to defining educational policies and approaches that are right for the times."
"Information is coming as a genuine shock involving change in the very concept of civilization, and that means we will have to change our educational culture."
"In fact, a veritable metamorphosis is needed if we are to meet the obligation to train young people for the jobs of the future. The technology obliges mankind to think about nature, economic and social problems, management of space and time and the phenomena of decomposition of materials."
"It will be an imperative to adapt the system to the new demands."
"The Socratic philosophers themselves, always seeking truth despite their scepticism, would have accepted that education must be adapted to the new needs!"
"Madam President, the new information technologies are going to have an enormous impact on the fields of education and culture."
"There are great opportunities as well as serious risks."
"The information society provides an opportunity to reduce the educational and cultural disadvantages of the handicapped, people living in rural areas or those who for economic or other reasons do not have access to the traditional channels of education and culture."
"But the reverse side of the coin is that the information society might also exclude large groups of the population, as in previous industrial revolutions opening up a chasm between those acquiring the knowledge and those lagging behind."
"Because in the future society of knowledge those who have access to information by means of the most modern means and continue their training throughout their lives will get the jobs and a decent standard of living."
"On the other hand those who do not have such training will remain marginalized and condemned to unemployment and low-skill jobs."
"We are dealing then with a question of equality of opportunity, social justice and making the most of human intellectual resources, which are the main source of wealth in European societies."
"The Member States must make an effort providing schools with the required computer equipment so that multimedia education is available to all, since many families, for obvious economic reasons, are not able to buy multimedia equipment."
"At the same time teaching staff must be trained and informed so that the new technological instruments are introduced into teaching practices."
"From the point of view of culture, our European cultural, national and regional heritage is available in digital form."
"The multimedia products thus produced give easier distribution of and access to this cultural heritage, particularly for young people."
"Museums, monuments, cultural sites etc can be recorded and educational centres and libraries given free access."
"The RAPHAEL programme deals with that; it lacks only financial resources commensurate with its ambition, just as a major injection of cash is required to provide schools with the appropriate funds."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, there is scarcely another economic sector that is experiencing such a boom as information technology."
"The EU Commission, and especially Mr Bangemann who is here today, are surpassing themselves in the production of documents, communications, green papers, etc., but I am glad that Mrs Morgan's report raises a painful subject, namely the lack of political measures in relation to the cultural and educational aspects of the information society."
"The advantages of the new media are sufficiently well-known and we keep being told about them, and about the opportunities for the labour market; but we must also look at the risks of the information society and try to counter them."
"The global data networks are particularly difficult to control."
"Many legal questions relating to copyright and combating international crime remain unresolved."
"Nor will I conceal the fact that in individual cases they could lead to anonymization or to Internet junkies in need of therapy, as became apparent in the Netherlands last week."
"Both the inexhaustible benefits that keep being cited and the unresolved adverse side-effects makes one thing clear: the European Union must rapidly take account of this headlong development."
"But it must not just do so by giving support to technology but must ultimately endeavour to take educational and cultural measures."
"We must provide our educational establishments, schools, universities, further education colleges, with adequate computers and network access. We must also interlink them."
"We must include libraries in this network."
"But we must also ensure that the teachers are adequately prepared and that they are always kept up to date, that they do no limp along behind the young people they teach in terms of their knowledge."
"If they are to transmit the new technologies, they must also be able to transmit the means of using them properly."
"It is important to ensure that everyone who is interested has a chance to take part in this high-speed development."
"Above all, we must not make the mistake of regarding these means of communication as an end in themselves but must use them as meaningful aids, like the surgeon carrying out an operation who consults overseas colleagues or the pupils in our countries who get to know each other and their cultures via the Internet."
"In that way we can do away with borders in the fullest sense of the word."
"Nobody should be afraid of the human teacher being replaced by a virtual colleague one day or of the written book becoming a museum-piece."
"Information technology is only a support."
"We must aim to give it a meaningful educational and cultural content; we must not just concentrate on technical questions."
"I hope that the Morgan report has made that as clear to others as it is to me."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Morgan has given us a masterly demonstration of the very important decisions and deadlines that the information society represents."
"It is fundamental that everyone should be guaranteed access to information so as to benefit from all the educational and cultural opportunities in the public and private sector which arise from the new technologies."
"Particular attention must be paid to the developing countries so that they are put in a position to evaluate and adapt the potential of the information technology to their own experience."
"The potential for using the new information and communication technology for executive purposes is enormous."
"In fact it represents an opportunity to deal with problems of illiteracy and educational failure, the development of open and distance learning and adult education, linking schools and language tuition to the network."
"It also represents challenges and opportunities for libraries through interconnection, thus promoting the economic, social and cultural life of the Union and access to the national cultural collections of every Member State, pooling Europe's vast and precious heritage of sites, monuments, museums and visual arts."
"We need to bear in mind that books, newspapers and the other means of communication based on the written word will remain extremely important."
"The Commission must continue its initiatives to improve internal consultation in the information sector and draw up a plan of action for the future, creating a permanent working group to coordinate initiatives relating to culture."
"Finally, we must continue to consider the cultural and educational aspects of the information society, the risks it presents and the benefits it offers, in a calm, just and balanced atmosphere."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we too consider Mrs Morgan's report an excellent one, especially the section concerning technical and educational questions."
"However, one problem of concern to Austria is being rather overlooked."
"We have a nationalized telephone system."
"In Austria it is up to the state to ensure that every pupil and every student obtains access to this information society."
"This relates even to minor problems, such as a second home telephone line that does not cost more than an ordinary family can afford."
"We are running the risk of producing a two-tier society of pupils and students, which conflicts with the old idea of general and free compulsory schooling."
"If the state insists on continuing to control the telephone system, we must make it clear that we are living in a historic time in which the state has the responsibility to ensure that all pupils and students have the same access to learning and studying."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Morgan for the work that she has done."
"The main objective for us social democrats is to fight against the devastating unemployment affecting millions of people, many of them young."
"I am personally convinced that one way of creating new, lasting and environmentally friendly jobs is through the information society."
"Information technology has already initiated an industrial revolution."
"To accept this does not mean that we are allowing technology to rule our lives."
"For me it means that I will work to ensure that information technology improves peoples' lives and not create new divisions between social groups or geographical areas."
"We need European computer programs for education: CD-ROM or Internet-based."
"These are not intended to take over the role of the teacher, a role that will become ever more important with the increasing amount of information made available to students."
"Technology must be introduced in the classroom at an early stage and teachers must be trained and supported to enable them to exploit the vast potential of information technology."
"In addition, IT opens up new horizons for the disabled both as regards education and on the labour-market."
"We must focus on democratic, social, cultural and educational interests, rather than economic and technological."
"If you concentrate only on the infrastructure and the technology and not the contents of the services, the most important component in the information society, i.e. the human being, will be forgotten."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I consider the own-initiative report very important, for it emphasizes my view that culture and education are a major factor of innovation and growth in the new environment of the information society and that great importance must therefore be attached to them in the shaping of this society."
"On no account must the new means of communication be looked at independently of the information that is transmitted."
"The aspect of educational quality is fundamental, especially in regard to the introduction of the new technologies in the educational field."
"It is also important to discuss the new concepts of teaching and learning methods."
"Firstly, the teachers need to be trained adequately."
"They have to learn to change their traditional role as sources of knowledge and make more and more use of the new technologies in their teaching and help the pupils to learn how to choose, so that they take a critical approach to the material transmitted to them."
"Of course it is also vital to have continuous and intensive further training of teachers."
"But this message goes to parents too."
"They form the basis of our society, so that acceptance of the new technologies and the concept of the information society, and thus their success or failure, largely depends on them."
"So I am strongly in favour of virtual parental education and of the creation and development of virtual libraries; indeed I have proposed a project of this kind to STOA."
"The aspect of lifelong learning is also very important."
"The information society relies less and less on material resources and energy, but far more on human know-how."
"I agree with the rapporteur that in the past the Commission's measures to promote various multimedia projects were too diffuse and often confusing for the applicants."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's educational multimedia joint call, which is finally coordinating the various programmes more closely and therefore making them look more user friendly."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too congratulate Mrs Morgan on her most important report."
"After so many statements of principle and given that even the Commission sometimes seems to feel a certain multimedia euphoria, let me make a few comments on three practical questions in this area."
"To what extent are the Commission's multimedia activities actually integrated in the individual Member States' educational policies?"
"Is there a coordinated, overall plan?"
"I very much doubt it."
"The Commission says that all the schools in Europe should be networked."
"But at present less than 5 % of European schools have access to the Internet or other networks."
"So how can there be equal access to new media and therefore to new employment opportunities in an increasingly mobile Europe?"
"Limited-time subsidies from Telecom or through the Commission's pilot projects for schools are all very well and good, and I welcome them."
"But of what use are they to committed teachers and trainers if the follow-up financing of projects is not secure?"
"We must promote good, cross-frontier projects and additional modules in vocational training, in order to make foreign-language teaching more lively and effective."
"They are all pending."
"Another question that has not really been clarified - and here I am turning to the Member States - is how rapid and how comprehensive the teacher training and further training is in this area."
"Let me point to one aspect: here it is also a question of the educational and social opportunities of schools to have a positive guiding and stimulating effect on young people in terms of their private computer consumption."
"I need hardly mention that the halt in the recruitment of young teachers, who are after all computer literate and trained now, is having devastating effects."
"Let me end by turning to the Commission. Mr Bangemann, I would like to point out that unlike Mrs Heinisch I think the programme descriptions and application procedures for the European Union's multimedia programmes are too remote from the people and lack transparency."
"There is too much red-tape involved in the application procedures."
"The procedure for the multimedia joint call last December is very confusing because it docks onto various programmes, as practical experience shows."
"Given the variety of management committees each of which only takes partial decisions for a particular project, it is almost impossible for new applicants to participate flawlessly."
"So I really would ask you to give this serious consideration and to create a programme that is transparent and also usable by newcomers."
"Mr President, the Morgan Report is an own-initiative report of the Culture Commission. I think we had to stress the fact that without co-ordinated educational actions and without a cultural perspective, European information society would be an empty balloon."
"Our generation, which invented the information superhighways, now has before it the greatest of challenges, either to turn it from a Pandora's box into an Ali Baba's cavern or to transform the danger of the pulverisation of information and the uncontrolled circulation of products into a marvellous area of knowledge and memory."
"Since time immemorial, Europe has been the continent which has been aware of its long past and which has insisted on transmitting to others."
"This is what distinguishes us from other world cultures, that of America, because it is so young and has such a short history, and those of Asia because, being so old, they were always selfsufficient."
"Therefore, if possible before the year 2000 - and we cannot over-emphasise the urgency of acting in fields which could grow at rates of something like 40 % a year - I repeat that we must take essential measures:"
"Commission studies setting out all of its activities in this area, comparing measures and funding systems in the different Member States and assessing their relative effectiveness; -compulsory training for teachers and young people, guaranteeing at the same time technical support accessible to everyone; -strengthening the Community budget, setting up a sub-title in this area and the framework programme and transferring to the development of content some of which has already been earmarked for infrastructures; -stimulating national inter-school and university networks, creating economies of scale; -giving incentives to associations between enterprises and teaching establishments through tax breaks and other means to stimulate the quality of production and build this very important bridge between education and leisure.What we must do, Mr President, Commissioner, is make sure that the communication and information technologies - which we should now stop calling 'new technologies' - should not be seen as an end but as a means for selecting and communicating knowledge."
"I must congratulate Mr Morgan on having condensed into his report the essence of these concerns, which are concerns for us all."
"Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur."
"The report is very good and will help us in the work we have already started on."
"But I also have a request to all those who took part in this debate: we are not just producing paper for the sake of it but are trying to make our contribution to showing where something still needs to be done and how it should be tackled, and we are also trying to bring together the various bodies that have to work together in this area."
"It would be useful if the debates sometimes also took note of all the things we are already doing."
"For it is not true that we have concentrated only on technology or on infrastructure."
"From the outset we have emphasized the question of content, as it is generally called, and the fact that we are speaking in terms of an information society shows quite clearly that we have considered this sociological, social and of course also cultural aspect right from the start."
"We have created a Forum for the information society which brings together all the forces, the unions, the creators of culture and those involved in the media."
"This Forum has adopted its first annual report."
"For the rest, Members were also invited to it and even those who did not take part can read up in this report how hard we are trying to come up with solutions, especially as regards schools and libraries, i.e., generally accessible public culture."
"For instance, this Forum has instructed two of the six working parties to deal specifically with these questions, namely libraries and the development of the media in general, and secondly, schools and learning and the related vocational training questions."
"I am not suggesting that we have lapsed into some kind of blind enthusiasm, for that is not the case."
"From the start I have always said that there is no reason to assume the world is coming to an end."
"On the other hand there is no reason to assume that the world will now become a paradise. We have to use these new instruments in areas where they are meaningful and useful; in areas where they are not, we can do nothing and in areas where they have bad results we have to do something about this."
"Which is to say that in this case too we are taking a very pragmatic approach."
"As the rapporteur has just done, I want to draw your attention to the report by the Task Force on Educational Multimedia."
"You must not say that this is just another document."
"You know that the task forces which Mrs Cresson and I set up are an attempt to make research policy more transparent but also more effective, because it can consider and try to resolve certain practical problems."
"This task force has concerned itself specifically with all the questions raised in Mrs Morgan's report."
"I will not read this document out to you now."
"You can of course obtain it from the Commission."
"It is dated 1996 and is numbered SEC 96/1426."
"It describes everything we are doing at present, which is a great deal."
"Incidentally, it also says that we must simplify the call to tender forms and the procedures that have to be gone through before becoming eligible for assistance, as you said, and I hope we will manage to do that."
"However, it is sometimes difficult, for we cannot complain of any lack of interest."
"I have just heard that we receive between 600 and 1000 applications for one programme."
"On the one hand that is very pleasing because it shows the broad interest that exists, but on the other hand it shows how difficult this task is."
"Let me just make two or three other comments on more general questions that have come up again."
"I very much support what has been said about culture and creative work."
"It should not be assumed that creative work can be democratized."
"That is wrong."
"The access and instruments required can be democratized and made generally available."
"But to assume that will make us into a society of geniuses is wrong, because creative work will remain work, and presumably, if it is creative, if will remain the work of the few, of a minority."
"We should not deceive ourselves that there will be any wide interest in this culture."
"But what the information society actually can do is to create easier access to what is perhaps at times rather hermetically sealed data."
"Here we should not reject new tools either."
"For instance, if there is a problem we should not have to rely only on the book as the traditional means of gaining access to information but also have other, smarter, processing tools for looking at problems."
"We know from our experience with schools that there are now many new opportunities for pupils who cannot come to terms with the relatively abstract system of the written word and do not find that way of thinking very easy but who think in a different way."
"We certainly have to be innovative here."
"So these opportunities should not be rejected from the outset but should be exploited."
"But nor should we succumb to the error of thinking we can now live in what might be called an entirely different cultural world."
"The other prejudice is to say that is what is done on the basis of public law is of higher quality, while what is done under private law is merely dirty money-making."
"That too is nothing but prejudice."
"In any case, if you look at what is actually being done in the Member States to connect schools - and the informal Council in Amsterdam adopted a report by the Swedish minister which showed how this is done in Sweden and wants to use it to formulate guidelines for the Union as a whole - then you will see that much of it is financed by private initiative, at least in the initial stage."
"Of course this cannot be left to private initiative indefinitely, but at least the private sector has made a start."
"And here I also want to say in favour of the large public telephone companies that they are being very active here, that they are cooperating with the school book suppliers and are processing the information that in practice already exists in school books and disseminating it in this new way."
"So quite a lot is already happening, with the help also of the private sector."
"People should not assume that things are always better if they are done by a public law institution."
"We need only look at some of the television broadcasts produced by public broadcasters to see that they do not always match up to the high cultural standards these organizations require of themselves."
"So here too I would ask you not to throw out the baby with the bathwater but to try to do what is necessary."
"Incidentally, we have one other difficulty that I must mention. In these areas, often it is not the Member States that are responsible but sub-organizations of the Member States - such as the Länder in Germany - which means we have a double hurdle to overcome, but I am quite hopeful here."
"To my surprise, at the conferences we have held so far the Member States did not keep telling us to go away and mind our own business!"
"On the contrary, they told us to work something out, to show us something!"
"Show us what we can achieve with this!"
"That can only be useful to us."
"So once again my thanks to the rapporteur."
"I hope that when we produce our progress report we find we have a considerably higher number of schools on the network by the end of the year and achieve this very well."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Statement by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to inform you, at the request of the President of the European Parliament, that this morning, in the city of San Sebastian, the psychologist at the city's Martutene Prison was shot dead, presumably by an ETA terrorist."
"The killer was taken into custody."
"Convinced that he was interpreting the feeling of the European Parliament, the President has sent a message of condolences to the victim's family and the Spanish Government, lending his support for it to continue to fight all acts of terrorism with determination."
"Genetically modified micro-organisms"
"The next item is the report (A4-0070/97) by Mr Trakatellis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public health and Consumer Protection, on the proposal for a Council Directive 90/219/EEC on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (COM(95)0640 - C4-0271/96-95/0340(SYN))."
"Mr President, one of the most important fields in biotechnology concerns the applications of genetically modified micro-organisms produced in laboratories by altering their genetic material."
"Those organisms are among the most important tools of biotechnology, which by means of genetic modification, can cause a micro-organism to produce a useful substance, such as human insulin."
"Those applications have an important influence on issues relating to health and disease, nutrition, environmental protection, agriculture and other important sectors of human life and activity, and consequently investigation of the potentials of genetically modified micro-organisms must go ahead, because it is a field full of promise."
"However, we do not exactly know the nature and dimensions of the risks involved for man and his environment from genetically modified organisms, and it is precisely for that reason that work with such organisms must take place in areas appropriately designed to cope with every kind of risk."
"Now that Directive 90/219 has been implemented for seven years, its positive and negative points have become clear."
"That Directive must now be amended to respond to present-day developments and needs."
"I consider that the demand expressed by universities, pharmaceutical companies, industries and SMEs for a simple, clear and flexible framework is both reasonable and logical, so that they can go ahead with their work and investments without uncertainty and lack of clarity."
"At the same time, however, we must bear in mind the great importance attached by the various bodies and groups to the protection of health, the environment and biodiversity from dangers associated with genetically modified micro-organisms."
"Precisely for that reason, the proposal to amend the Directive should strive for the greatest possible administrative flexibility, not at the cost of safety, but to create a framework that is simple, clear and easy for users and the responsible authorities to implement."
"A warning bell must be rung here: flexibility and clarity of the framework must not conflict with the rules of safety."
"The danger of an accident sometime in the future is all the greater because the field is continually expanding, and consequently, as we saw with the 'mad cow' crisis, with its disastrous effect upon the beef market, a simple accident is enough to give a bad name to the industry of biotechnological applications and lead it into crisis."
"Improved information for citizens residing in close proximity to areas in which genetically modified micro-organisms are used, but also more general transparency and information of the public concerning the new knowledge and applications of biotechnology, is the best guarantee for the safety, investment and development of this technology in the European Union."
"The main elements which in my opinion should be modified in the Directive proposed by the Commission are as follows:"
"First of all the definition of what a micro-organism is, is complete as given in the old directive."
"In contrast, the addition which the Commission proposes to make to that definition creates problems, and it is scientifically difficult to accept that animal or vegetable cells can be defined as micro-organisms."
"The replacement of the word 'restrict' with the word 'prevent' is necessary, because whereas the first implies some exposure of man and the environment, even if restricted, the second excludes it."
"And that is consonant with the treatment of wastes proposed by the Commission."
"Thirdly, the classification of work and its associated risk is a step in the right direction."
"However, we believe that it is certainly scientifically difficult to prove that all projects in category 2 are low-risk ones."
"This is because they involve micro-organisms such as staphylococci, streptococci, diphtheria colibacteria and tetanus clostridium, which are recognised as fairly dangerous towards human health."
"Furthermore, category 3 projects are characterized by the Commission as medium-risk."
"That is an inconsistency, granted that Directive 90/679 already characterizes them as high-risk."
"For example, the AIDS virus cannot possibly be considered medium-risk. It is of course high-risk."
"The main problem with the Commission's proposal is precise assessment of the risk."
"That point is very unclear."
"We have tabled amendments which define in a much better way how that risk is to be assessed."
"The assessment will of course be based on estimating the risk to human life, to the environment, and finally, the combination of those two risks together."
"It is important to allow the possibility of adapting the directive."
"However, we consider that certain essential elements should not be capable of change by commitological procedures and we consider it unacceptable for such elements to be present in the directive's annexes."
"As we know, yesterday the Legal Committee discussed the extent to which the present directive should be based on 130 S, when we would have a cooperation procedure, as opposed to 100 A, when a co-decision procedure would be required."
"I should like to stress two things:"
"First, this directive is directly related to the practical application of methods for the production of biotechnological products, hormones, vaccines, drugs and foods, and it is clear that the cost of research for the development of those products in the context of the directive, will be passed on in the price of the end products."
"This is precisely where harmonization of the rules is needed in the context of the internal market."
"But even where doubts exist about the extent to which measures are available for the internal market and automatically under 100 A, I would like to remind you, as a second important factor, of the decision we took recently in this Parliament on health protection issues."
"Parliament's decision on 19th February was clear, in that where health issues are concerned it wanted the co-decision procedure."
"What I would like to ask the Commission is why there were two texts from different Commission Services during the preparation stage, and finally, which of the amendments will the Commission accept?"
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my colleague Alain Pompidou, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Research."
"Today we are discussing the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms."
"The objective is the dangerfree exploitation of the micro-organisms produced by this technology, which appeared in the 1970s."
"This is not a new procedure but a procedure that is now well-known, correctly handled and in relation to which we must distinguish between objective and potential risks."
"If a genetically modified construction, or the act of obtaining it, presents a risk, that risk can manifest itself in different ways depending on the characteristics of the operation."
"The experience gained over the last 15 years has led to a review of Directive 90/219, with a view to adapting the administrative provisions to the real risks of the operations and take more account of international technical recommendations on bio-safety, namely the protection of human health and the environment."
"In relation to risk management, we must ensure that there is close correspondence between the level of risk defined by more accurate evaluation and the complexity of the administrative procedures."
"Thus to each level of risk there correspond conditions of containment and experimental practices that depend on both the type of organism and the mode of use."
"That is the purpose of the amendments for which our group will vote."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I would like to welcome this report and thank the rapporteur for the immense amount of work he has done."
"The proposal, as we know, sets out measures to protect human health and the environment from the risks associated with activities working with genetically modified organisms in contained conditions."
"That means basic research in laboratories and institutions, but also industrial production: for example, brewing, vaccine production and some activities in the food industry."
"It will certainly become an important part of the regulatory regime for the biotechnology industry."
"We recognize that the present directive needs reform in the light of technical progress and experience gained in the last few years."
"The Commission proposal is generally acceptable in principle but we feel we could go further in some areas by focusing particularly on those activities that pose the most significant risks: namely, activities using those organisms listed in Classes III and IV in the risk categories."
"In addition, we consider that all the technical annexes to this directive are important and should be subject to adaptation by a technical committee that operates in a way that respects the modus vivendi and which we would hope to see developed into a true partnership between the Commission, Parliament and the Council in the coming few years."
"A further concern of the Socialist Group is the issue of risk assessment."
"This must be uniform across the Union."
"We need to detail this clearly in the annexes to ensure that we have a uniform level of risk assessment across the Union."
"In addition, we also think that the containment and control measures, particularly in some aspects of the technical annexes, could be improved."
"These are detailed in some of the amendments that we will be supporting."
"Finally, I would draw attention to the issue of civil liability."
"This is an essential safeguard."
"The Commission must accept the need for people carrying out activities in this area to accept legal responsibility for the consequences of any accidents."
"We need the Commission to explain clearly its position with regard to this subject, and how it will advance the issue of civil liability, not just in this sector, but in other sectors where human health and the environment could be threatened by inappropriate activity."
"In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to accept Parliament's amendments and utilize them to improve the text; to ensure that progress in this area takes place in the atmosphere of public trust and confidence which is necessary if the industry is to prosper."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the proposal it submitted on 6 December 1995 to amend the implementing directive the EU Commission is taking account of more than twenty years of worldwide experience in the use of genetic engineering."
"In line with current international scientific knowledge it has introduced new and clearer distinctions, providing for four classes of risk instead of the former two, as is already the case in many European countries."
"The proposal also abolishes the distinction between research and trade, which was not very useful in practice."
"The proposed changes therefore bring greater simplicity and avoid any unnecessary red tape, since they make the administrative procedure as tight as is possible without sacrificing safety and the industry supports them almost without reservation."
"This kind of safe cutting down on red tape is most important to the position of Europe in biotechnology."
"To delay these changes would give European research and industry disadvantages in competition, in relation particularly to the USA and Japan, for no practical reason."
"I welcome the Commission proposal and the opinion of the Committee on Research and I thank Mr Pompidou."
"He managed to improve on the innovations in the Commission proposal with a few very good amendments, without affecting or even putting at risk the simplification and clarification that have been achieved."
"Moreover, Mr Pompidou has successful demonstrated the great importance of this directive for European research establishments and managed to induce the Committee on the Environment to accept many of the proposals."
"I think the amendment calling for liability insurance in relation to environmental damage would be difficult to carry through in practice."
"Moreover, the Commission is in any case intending to draft a white paper on environmental liability, which it will be presenting shortly."
"It is doubtful whether there is any point, given this situation, to anticipate the Commission proposal and run the risk of the various rules conflicting with each other."
"Mr President, I will concentrate on three points."
"The first is the procedure for the proposal."
"The second is the reason for amending the Directive, and the third is the content itself."
"With regard to the procedure, I will not dwell on the particular legal arrangement by which the Directive should be covered."
"Opinions may differ as to what is most appropriate."
"But I would stress that it is highly unsatisfactory to have a proposal for debate here in plenary on which a compromise proposal has already been put forward by the Presidency in the Council dealing with points on which there is wide disagreement."
"It may be claimed that it is because Parliament has been too long in discussing the matter but, whatever the case may be, it is not a satisfactory situation."
"It also seems to show that the Commission and the Council are all too well aware that Parliament's only real scope for action is to say 'yes' or 'no' to the proposal as such, while the Council and the Commission in reality can cock a snook at the amendments we put forward."
"As regards the reasons for amending the Directive, the Commission maintains that there may be grounds, in an area in full spate of development, to look again at a directive which has its origins in the 1980s, although it was not adopted until 1990."
"The problem is that the Commission nowhere mentions the scientific results and experience in the light of which the Directive is said to require amendment."
"We are thus expected more or less to take the Commission's word for it and adopt the proposal without actually knowing who the Commission has consulted on this matter, who its advisers were and so forth. As I have said, there may be grounds for amending the Directive, but the need for an amendment should be documented."
"On the content itself, the key issue for us is that the level of protection must not be lowered. This leads me on to point out that, on the amendments regarding classification, the crucial shortcoming of the proposal is that there are no guidelines on how classification should be approached, hence individuals are allowed considerable latitude to classify as they see fit."
"This means that we will be supporting a number of amendments in order to make the proposal more acceptable."
"Mr President, our Group is in agreement with the excellent work done by Mr Trakatellis and with the additional material by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy under the guidance of Mr Pompidou."
"Nevertheless in view of the well-founded state of public alarm, above all as regards genetic engineering, we have tabled two separate amendments pointing out the possible risks and thus preempting the consequences."
"To be specific, we think that in the annexes, both in the assessment and classification and in the procedure for urgency, details should be given as to which biological chains, living species, could be affected and how to deal with the risk - because now it is possible to give that information."
"Mr President, although the laboratory directive was not adopted until 1990 and has not yet been transposed in many Member States, the Commission has already made a proposal providing for massive deregulation and a drop in environmental and safety standards."
"Let me refer to two points."
"We need liability for the environment and for human beings, and here I would quite openly ask the Commissioner why the scientists themselves should not be held more responsible?"
"If the situation is as the industry and science promise us, namely that biotechnology is safe, why are they so vehemently against liability?"
"Secondly, authorization once a specified period of time has elapsed."
"I think it is totally irresponsible for authorization to be given on expiry of a certain period of time and for that period to be reduced from 60 to 45 days!"
"Surely it is absurd that I have to wait longer for authorization to park my bicycle in a certain place than for the authorization of a research laboratory working with pathogenic, genetically manipulated organisms."
"We do not need lower environmental and safety standards; what we need is more environmental standards, more safety and above all more transparency!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since 1990 the European Union has had the strictest legislation on biotechnology anywhere in the world."
"Some Member States have been even more stringent when transposing these European rules into their own legislation."
"In my view this caution was justified."
"But meanwhile we have gained worldwide experience in the use of biotechnology."
"The stringent rules in Europe are increasingly proving to be an obstacle to Europe's position in terms of research and applying the research findings."
"Let me give a clear example: a European industrial undertaking, a chemical firm, has 26 research and development establishments, of which 6 are in the European Union, 20 in North and South America, South Africa and the Far East."
"Genetic engineering is one of the most important key technologies for the next century and has broad applications in medicine, pharmaceutics, agriculture, food production and the environment."
"Genetic engineering and its innovations will have a decisive effect on every country's economic development in the decades to come."
"The 1990 directive on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms was based on the scientific knowledge of the 1980s."
"Our group fully supports the Commission's aims in the proposed amended directive of reducing unnecessary bureaucracy - and I mean unnecessary - while at the same time ensuring the necessary precautions and safety measures."
"That includes adapting the system of classification to existing international practice and revising the technical annexes, which are no longer up to date."
"Instead of two there will now be four classes of risk, which will make it much easier to assess the risks and take the necessary protective measures."
"My group considers it particularly important that the European Parliament will in future be involved fully in any major changes to the directive."
"If the risks can be controlled, as has been shown in the past 20 years, I think it is also our responsibility as Christians to look into the chances offered by genetic engineering and to use this technology in a responsible manner."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, technology strides on, new findings mean that laws have to be adapted."
"And that is a good thing."
"But presumably it will remain a secret on what experience the Commission is basing itself here."
"The development of this technology and the associated research has to go on for more than a mere five or six years before we can gain an overview of the possible results of the use of genetically modified micro-organisms."
"For that is how brief our experience is with the directive before us."
"That is why I consider two amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection most important."
"Once concerns information to the public."
"In the name of democracy and transparency, the safety measures must be made known."
"In this area, public information is the real guarantee of safety."
"So it is not enough for the public only to have access to information on emergency plans."
"The information must actively be provided to the public."
"That is one demand."
"The second amendment is based on our recent experience with the Commission; I am thinking, for instance, of the authorization of genetically modified maize."
"This experience shows that we have to set very tight limits to the area where the Commission can make major changes and take major decisions by itself."
"That is why it is very important to set very narrow limits to comitology."
"That is the second major amendment we tabled."
"Nevertheless I have serious doubts whether the necessary safety will actually be guaranteed even if all the amendments are accepted."
"The future will tell, and I hope the story will not be a sad one."
"Thank you Mr President. I very much hope that when the Commissioner replies she is able to give us quite a detailed position from the Commission on the various amendments put down."
"I would like to ask her to circulate, before the vote tomorrow, a list of those amendments that the Commission is likely to accept and those amendments which it finds difficult to accept."
"This has been done in the past and it would be of enormous help to us."
"It is clear from the debate on cloning which we have already had this week that the usefulness of scientific endeavour in the genetics field has come under very close scrutiny - and I think rightly."
"It is also clear that after the BSE crisis we have found it necessary to focus attention on the potential risk to human health from a hitherto unsuspected, possibly microscopic source."
"In this context it is understandable that some colleagues are dubious about this proposal, which seeks to streamline approval procedures in a very sensitive field."
"I am glad that the committee under Mr Trakatellis' guidance has felt that it could support the directive, with some amendments to tighten it up."
"However, I would like to draw Parliament's attention particularly to Amendment No 22 to this directive, which has been put down not by our rapporteur but by the Energy Committee, and to draw attention to its importance."
"I very much hope that the Commission is able to accept it."
"There is a real danger for this Parliament and for the people who elect us that this will be one of our few moments of involvement with the draft directive, and indeed the final directive on the contained use of genetically modified organisms; that once this directive is adopted - as I think it will be - we will no longer be able to exercise any supervisory role."
"Amendment No 22 by the Energy Committee does make sure that the European Commission would submit to Parliament a regular report on what is happening as a consequence of this directive."
"I recommend that amendment to the House and I very much hope that the Commission will be able to accept it."
"Mr President, I must devote the first few seconds of my speech to a matter unrelated to the Trakatellis report, but bound up with collective ethics."
"The President kindly announced to us a few moments ago the immediate response of the Presidency of Parliament to the latest ETA terrorist attack and I am deeply grateful, as a Spaniard, for the solidarity of the citizens of Europe; but the citizens of Europe, whom this Parliament represents, should know that this feeling of outrage at each ETA murder is difficult to reconcile, from the moral point of view, with the retention of the right of asylum within the European Union for citizens fleeing Spanish justice in connection with these terrorist activities."
"Thank you very much, nonetheless, for Parliament's swift response, Mr President."
"To return to the subject of the Trakatellis report, I must say that, in spite of the large number of amendments it contains - which might suggest that it is a very controversial and polemic report - I nevertheless think, as some speakers have mentioned, that irrespective of the amendments - very partial ones -which have been adopted or which are to be put to the vote tomorrow, the whole Parliament is agreed that this proposal for a directive is timely and necessary and that the report is an excellent one - my congratulations to Mr Trakatellis - and that most of the Committee's amendments are aimed at combining prudence on the part of the public authorities, which we are, in laying down a legal framework with continuing to make use of the resources obtained as a result of genetic engineering."
"Consequently, I think that everything has moved towards making the United Nations proposals on bio-diversity, which date from 1992, compatible with one another; in this respect, the upholding of the security and dignity of the human race is compatible with the industrial use and continuing research into this subject."
"This directive has two objectives, firstly the safe use of genetically modified microorganisms and secondly to stimulate biotechnology research."
"The Commission's proposals need to be improved in two main areas: firstly in relation to damage liability, as has been said."
"Anyone working with genetically modified micro-organisms must be liable for any damage that may occur if they are released."
"Here I take a quite different view from Mrs Heinisch."
"Secondly, there is the question of the legislative processes. Parliament must not be deprived of its right of codetermination in relation to any changes to the scope of this directive."
"That applies to Annexes I and II of the directive."
"For these are not, as might appear at first glance, technical rules but concern the core of the directive, namely safety."
"It did not help us in trying to assess the Commission proposal that the Commission's general report on the application of the directive is still not available."
"Mrs Bjerregaard, you should see to it that it is made available."
"In its reply to my written question the Commission announces that it will present its report at an unspecified date in the course of 1997."
"According to the directive it should have presented it last year."
"I hope that with its proposed speeding up of the authorization procedures, the Commission will in future also provide the required information to the public and the European Parliament more quickly and at least keep to the prescribed time-limits, i.e., penalize the Member States suitably for any delays in transposing the legislation."
"In view of its negligence in relation to BSE, I think it is all the more necessary to draw the Commission's attention to these renewed delays."
"Mr President, I thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the rapporteur for an opinion of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, Mr Pompidou, for the thorough work that has gone into this report."
"As we all know and as has been stressed in the debate here today, the regulation of the GMO area is a difficult matter, and it is high on the political agenda."
"Directive No 90/219 is a horizontal directive, and it builds on the precautionary principle."
"It is intended to ensure that the development of the technology does not endanger human health and the environment."
"The Directive thus regulates the rules of play or the safety precautions that must be observed by laboratories conducting research and carrying out work on GMOs."
"This Directive covers a highly technical area, which is in a process of rapid development."
"It is a field which also has considerable implications both for employment in the EU and for industry."
"Experience with the Directive hitherto has shown some weaknesses."
"Let me name them; they are: unsatisfactory classification of GMMs, inadequate guidelines on risk assessment and containment measures, lack of flexibility as regards adaptation to technical development, lack of consistency between notification and administration requirements on the one hand and the risk inherent in the activities in question on the other hand, and excessive administration in connection with low-risk activities."
"The Commission's proposal observes the precautionary principle, while at the same time setting out to solve the practical problems which have arisen in connection with the existing Directive."
"The most important changes are that the administrative procedures and notification requirements will be adjusted to the risk inherent in the activities involving genetically modified micro-organisms and - a point raised by several speakers - they will be classified into several risk groups."
"Procedures will be simplified, provided that does not lower the level of safety, and clear minimum requirements on containment and control will be introduced for each of the four risk classes; and it will in future be easier to adapt the Directive to technical development."
"Of the 68 amendments tabled, the Commission can unreservedly accept Amendments Nos 2, 3, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19, 31, 41 and 42, 49 and 56."
"They all serve to clarify the principles in the Commission proposal."
"The Commission can in part accept Amendments Nos 4, 11, 27, 30, 35, 37, 38, 39, 43, 47, 48, 54 and 55, and it can in principle accept Amendments Nos 7, 8, 14, 15, 17, 21 and 22, to which Mrs Jackson in particular sought a reaction, 23, 24, 25, 64 and 68, which should however be formulated somewhat differently so that they do not create problems in new areas."
"I would like to make just one observation regarding Amendment No 37, because I think that Mrs Gebhardt was indirectly referring to this proposal, namely the question of the legislative procedure for Annex I. The Commission can in part accept the requirement that the full legislative procedure be applied for Annex I. A full legislative procedure, as you know, offers the advantage, sought by several speakers, that both Parliament and the Council have an influence over amendments to the Annex."
"Following on from that, the Commission cannot accept 31 of the amendments, and I will comment briefly on some of them."
"To begin with, there is Amendment No 1, which means altering the legal basis for the Commission proposal from Article 130s(1) to Article 100a. We cannot accept that."
"It is not because the Commission does not sympathize with Parliament's desire to be fully involved in the legislative process."
"We strongly support that."
"However, as I understand it, there is no legal authority under the present Treaty for selecting Article 100a in preference to Article 130s, unless the scope of the Directive is altered significantly, so that it has a direct bearing on the internal market."
"There is no doubt that the fact of choosing between one or the other of these two provisions amounts to discriminatory treatment of Parliament in a quite incomprehensible way."
"I myself hope that this matter will be put to rights by new Treaty amendments."
"Let me also add that the proposed amendment of the legal basis would mean that the Member States would not be free, as at present, to introduce stricter requirements for containment and control than those laid down in the Directive."
"The present provisions mean that Member States can lay down stricter standards in their own legislation than those required under the Directive."
"If the legal basis is amended to 100a, it will mean full harmonization and the Member States will no longer have this freedom."
"As a result they may be obliged to weaken their containment and control measures in order to comply with this amendment, and that is of course not desirable."
"Amendments Nos 18 and 20, calling for a separation between Class 3 and Class 4 activities as regards notification requirements, cannot be accepted."
"Such a separation would, in the Commission's opinion, complicate the practical application of the Directive and lead to confusion."
"The Commission does, however, realize that the intention of these amendments is to strengthen the administrative supervision of such high-risk activities."
"The Commission therefore proposes that both these aims be achieved by requiring express consent for subsequent uses in respect of both Class 3 and Class 4."
"The Commission is not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 44, 45 and 46, which seek to limit the scope of the Directive in such a way that only laboratory work for research purposes is included."
"The reason is that the Commission wishes to regulate all activity involving laboratory work, irrespective of the final purpose of the work in question."
"Then there are Amendments Nos 26, 36, 50, 57 and 58, which we also cannot accept, because they mean that information to which the public may have access, or aspects of activities on which the public may be consulted, would be limited to health and environmental protection and emergency plans."
"In the Commission's opinion, this is not desirable since it is important that the public should have confidence that gene technology is being satisfactorily regulated."
"In the Commission's view, it would be questionable to leave it up to the notifier to decide what should be covered by health and environmental protection and emergency plans."
"For the same reason, the Commission also cannot accept Amendments Nos 32 and 33."
"According to these, the information to be given to the authorities responsible and the Commission in the event of an accident would only include those aspects that relate to the possibility of serious damage."
"Again, an unfortunate limitation from the point of view of the public interest."
"Concerning Amendments Nos 13 and 28, it is correct, as Mrs Heinisch said, that we are working on this matter in the form of a White Paper, and I can say that I entirely share the view of Mr Bowe and Mrs Breyer that it is particularly important to have the question of liability dealt with under EU auspices."
"While I do not wish to go into detail on all the rejections, let me just mention Amendment No 39, in respect of which the Commission can accept committee procedure IIb, which allows the Council to adopt arrangements other than those proposed by the Commission, instead of procedure IIIb as provided in the Commission proposal."
"As regards the Commission's report on experience with the Directive, this requirement already arises in Article 18(3)."
"The report will be sent to Parliament."
"Parliament's proposal that the decisions and minutes of the advisory committee be made available to the public cannot be accepted, since it is not in conformity with the new interinstitutional agreement between the Commission and the European Parliament on transparency and public information in connection with committee meetings."
"At the same time I stress - although it goes without saying - that the Commission will honour its commitments under this agreement in full."
"The Commission can accept the principle underlying Amendment No 15 tabled by Mr Bowe, but does not think that the wording of the amendment is in conformity with the intention."
"Instead, the Commission would propose an amendment requiring that good microbiological practice be regularly assessed."
"I will close by again emphasizing the value that the amendments which have been accepted in whole or in part add to the Commission proposal."
"An example of this is Amendment No 9 from the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, which strengthens the application of the precautionary principle."
"Under this amendment, if there is any doubt as to the risk class within which a given activity falls, the higher class would be assigned until sufficient documentation is available."
"As I have said, the amendments help to tighten up and clarify the Commission proposal. They will thus assist in bringing about more appropriate and effective outline legislation to achieve the high level of safety we all want to see for activities of the type covered by the Commission proposal."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately I have to put another question. It is important both to Mr Bowe and to myself to know your position, Commissioner, on liability."
"You said very little on Amendments Nos 28 and 30."
"You said you agree with both me and Mr Bowe, but also with Mrs Heinisch."
"That is a major contradiction."
"We had asked you specifically whether you believe there should be more selfresponsibility in relation to this science?"
"That would mean assuming liability."
"Anything else, Commissioner, would mean indirect subsidies."
"I would like your position on that too."
"Last point: I cannot understand how you can say that transparency and access to information would infringe an interinstitutional agreement."
"We have the environmental information directive and you are bound to take account of it."
"So I really would urgently ask you to answer these two questions."
"They are quite elementary and the credibility of biotechnology is at stake here."
"Mr President, Madam Commissioner, you did not answer me why in your directive there is an inconsistency relating to the previous Directive 679, which concerns the protection of working people from biological factors."
"In that directive it is mentioned that category 3 is a high-risk category, while in this directive it is said that category 3 is a medium-risk category."
"That is a serious inconsistency and I would like to ask you: do you consider that working with genetically modified AIDS virus is a medium-risk occupation or a high-risk occupation?"
"I therefore urge you to correct that inconsistency, because the Commission had two texts, one official and one unofficial which differs from it in important ways, and in this connection the unofficial text indeed agreed with the previous directive."
"I would also like to ask you: what do you intend to do about risk assessment?"
"Will you accept our amendments which give completely clear indications about how risk is to be assessed?"
"Mr President, when I spoke earlier, using up a great deal of my speaking time, I made a brief attempt to answer the question on liability. I said then that I agreed with Mrs Heinisch that the Commission should now draft a White Paper on the subject, after we had first discussed some of the matters in a communication."
"That is because we regard it as a horizontal matter, which means that we cannot deal with the question of liability in the sole context of the proposal under discussion here."
"At the same time, I stated my agreement with the remarks of Mrs Breyer and Mr Bowe on the importance of the subject."
"I therefore hope that we can return to the matter in a broader context."
"I do not think there are problems as regards transparency and public information in connection with the agreement in place."
"In my answer here to Parliament, I argued quite specifically in favour of public involvement, and I rejected some of the amendments because I think that they would diminish public involvement, and I referred in that connection to the agreement entered into with Parliament."
"With regard to the question put by Mr Trakatellis, I will say that I concentrated in my answer on addressing the various amendments which have rightly retained Parliament's attention, and it is our impression that there is no material difference between the directive Mr Trakatellis refers to and that we are discussing here."
"The problem is that these directives use different classes, and that is what we have tried to resolve in the proposal in its present form and in our acceptance of the amendments I commented on during the debate."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Question Time (Commission)"
"The next item on the agenda is questions to the Commission (B4-0019/97)."
"Question No 28 by Mary Banotti (H-0116/97)"
"Subject: Interim trade agreement with Israel"
"Is the Commission satisfied that Article 1 of the interim trade agreement with Israel is being both properly monitored and implemented?"
"Will Parliament receive a report from the EU special envoy to the Middle East, with particular reference to the special tasks assigned to him in the Dublin Declaration of December 1996?"
"The Israeli authorities are well aware of the importance the European Union attaches to the rule of law and to strict respect for the undertakings to which Israel has subscribed by her adherence to international conventions on human rights and the Barcelona Declaration of 1995."
"The monitoring of human rights and respect for democratic principles in countries linked to the EU by association agreements is carried out in accordance with the rules of CFSP."
"Under the present interim agreement respect of these principles is periodically monitored."
"Once ratification of the recently concluded Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Union and Israel is completed, the Union as a whole will be in an even better position to exercise a positive influence regarding all human-rights-related issues in the framework of the political dialogue with Israel established by the agreement."
"A specific human rights clause stipulates that respect for democratic principles and human rights constitutes an essential element of the association agreement."
"The EU special envoy to the Middle East peace process reports regularly on his mission to the Council through the presidency and the Commission, with special regard to his mandate, as outlined in the decisions of the Ministers' meetings of 28 and 29 October 1996 and the Dublin Declaration of 14 December 1996."
"The Commission is fully associated with the special envoy's tasks."
"The special envoy has recently reported to Parliament on the occasion of the hearing at the Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy."
"Since Sir Leon has galloped through the answer at enormous speed, I will have to ask him if he would give me a copy of his answer."
"I am also really concerned about the question of exports from Palestine and the difficulties many producers are still experiencing when trying to export their goods - and I understand fully the need for security and everything else - because of an excessive amount of rather exigent security checks at the border."
"I would also be interested if Sir Leon could tell us why it is considered necessary to register some of the Palestinian produce as being Israeli in order to facilitate its export to European markets."
"I would of course be delighted to provide a copy of the answer."
"I am sorry if I spoke too quickly; I was anxious not to take up too much time."
"On the specific points, they are not related to the matter of the monitoring of the interim agreement or to the report of the special envoys, so I am not in a position to give a specific answer to them."
"But I will certainly draw the attention of those in the Commission dealing with these matters to the points raised."
"The first point to be borne in mind is that Community regulations and directives apply throughout the Community and not just in the United Kingdom."
"On average nineteen regulations and two directives were adopted each week in 1996, most of them concerning the common agricultural policy."
"These figures are taken from Celex, the publicly accessible interinstitutional database."
"They do not, it should be specified, include regulations of what can be called transient status, that is, those which concern the day-to-day management of Community policies such as the common agricultural policy, instruments whose titles appear in ordinary non-bold type in the Official Journal and have a period of validity of between a few days and a few weeks."
"In addition - and I think this is very important - it should be emphasized that almost exactly the same number of regulations and directives as are adopted each week also expire or are repealed each week."
"The global practical effect therefore is that the sum total of regulations and directives which are applicable in the Community remains more or less constant."
"Many thanks to the Commissioner for his very illuminating response."
"Members will be aware that over recent weeks Sir James Goldsmith has been funding an extremely expensive poster campaign in the United Kingdom saying, amongst other things, that Brussels 'spouts' , to use his word, over 100 rules and regulations every week which the United Kingdom must obey."
"I think the Commissioner's response today shows how that poster campaign is not just misleading, it is actually totally untrue."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner to give this House an undertaking in the very near future that the Commission will embark upon a campaign in the United Kingdom, spelling out, as he has done to this House today, exactly what the situation is."
"Can I first of all say that the honourable gentleman has done a public service in giving me the opportunity to put the record straight and to correct misleading impressions that may have been given."
"As to conducting a campaign, I am not sure that the Commission's resources extend as far as those of the honourable gentleman who has been referred to, but in general terms I certainly think it is important that we should put the facts out as clearly as possible, and this is one of the facts that will now be available to the Commission through its offices in London and other parts of the United Kingdom to make the true facts known."
"I myself, in a slightly different context, last week in London, launched the European Movement's campaign to present the facts on Europe generally, that is, an all-party and non-party campaign to present the facts; it is given support by the Commission financially too."
"Thank you very much, Sir Leon, but may I put a question to you and earn my keep and prove worthy of my office as vice-president."
"I should like to be able to call upon you to speak, which would accord with the procedure we follow in this Parliament."
"I know that you like to reply right away out of courtesy to the Members, but I too should like to play my part and earn my keep."
"Question No 30 by James Provan (H-0126/97)"
"Subject: World Trade Organization"
"The Uruguay Round Agreement of the GATT means that EU agricultural trade is operating within a global trading system and that future agricultural policy decisions must take account of this."
"As we prepare ourselves for a new round of World Trade Organization talks it seems imperative that the EU should put itself in a strong negotiating position."
"What action is the Commission currently taking to bring this about?"
"It is undeniable that agricultural trade operates within the global trading system."
"It is the agreement on agriculture negotiated in the Uruguay Round which sets the ground rules for agricultural trade."
"The question of future negotiations is taken up in the agreement on agriculture which foresees that, and I quote: ' Negotiations for continuing the process will be initiated one year before the end of the implementation period' ."
"The Commission is aware of the need for an in-depth preparation of the negotiations, which are due to start at the end of the century."
"The Commission is ensuring that work is put in hand in a timely fashion so that we are placed in a strong negotiating position from the outset."
"I thank the Commissioner for that very interesting and, I am sure, correct answer."
"Many of us in this House, however, are concerned that whilst maybe certain DGs within the Commission are interested in trade negotiations, it appears that DG VI in particular - the agriculture directorate - is perhaps hanging back a little bit."
"The feeling is that we really have to take a major step to try to ensure that reform of the CAP is seen to be continuing, and that is not highly apparent at the present time."
"It would be helpful if the Commission were to take an initiative fairly quickly to make the agriculturalists and the farmers in the European Community aware of the fact that these negotiations will be coming and that if we do not take the correct steps to reform the CAP before those negotiations we will be on the wrong foot and on the defensive."
"I should just finish by saying that I hope the Commissioner understands this and that DG VI will therefore be fully involved in all the negotiations that he is going to be undertaking."
"The agricultural community is well aware of our commitment to resume negotiations, as agreed in the Uruguay Round, and all parts of the Commission are also aware of this."
"With regard to the question of the evolution of the CAP, there are, of course, a number of pressures pointing in the same direction: one is the prospect of new negotiations in the context of the WTO; another is the prospect of enlargement and a third is, of course, internal pressures of a budgetary kind, relating to the cost of agriculture."
"All of those are coming together and will mean that the common agricultural policy will have to evolve further."
"But it is also fair to say to our trading partners that they cannot expect to get any further progress ahead of what has been agreed in the Uruguay Round, which is what some of them tried to do in the period before the Singapore ministerial meeting of the WTO."
"What was agreed was that the process of analysis and information exchange should take place, but no more than that."
"So it is quite natural that, in defending ourselves from premature pressure from the outside world, we should take a properly cautious position."
"But I can assure you that will not prevent us doing what is necessary, being aware of the timescale and the cumulative factors that will bring to bear, and we shall make every effort to bring about a situation in which all parts of the Commission work together to handle this issue."
"A strong bargaining position is for me the same as aggressively helping European farmers to obtain a reasonable share of an increasing world market."
"There is a concern within the EU about free competition in this market."
"I believe this concern to be exaggerated."
"It is in my opinion important to adjust EU price levels to those of the world market."
"A certain level of compensation may be required, but the profit would still be there."
"Do the members of the Commission share this view?"
"As, at the moment, we are simply working on the process of analysis of information exchange, it will not surprise the honourable Member to know that the Commission has not formulated its negotiating stance for the next round to begin in some years' time."
"It would be very unusual to do that at this early stage."
"But I understand the force of the honourable Member's point and I have no doubt that it will be a rich contribution to the evolving debate."
"Since the author is not here, Question 31 falls."
"Question No 32 by Wolfgang Kreissl-Dörfler, which has been taken over by Mr Schnellhardt (H-0170/97)"
"Subject: Support for environmental protection and the land rights of indigenous peoples under the EU-Canada action plan"
"According to a study by the Sierra Legal Defense Fund, even following the introduction of the most recent forestry law in the Canadian province of British Columbia (British Columbia Forest Practises Code), 92 % of the felling undertaken by the major timber companies is still carried out as clear felling, with the directives on watercourses also being disregarded in most cases."
"In addition in th great coastal rain forests which are the traditional territory of the Nuxalk Indians, large parts of their land are being released to timber companies for clear-felling under long-term lease licences."
"What joint actions will the Commission take under the Canada-EU action plan to hal these clear felling practices and the destruction of the territory of indigenous peoples, thus also implementing the international obligations for sustainable development entered into both by the EU and the Canadian government (e.g. the Convention on Biological Diversity, Agenda 21)?"
"Chapter 3 of the EU-Canada joint action plan contains specific language concerning preservation of the environment in general and sustainable management of forestry in particular."
"In the action plan the EU and Canada, for instance, commit themselves to exchanging information and reports on forestry issues."
"The action plan furthermore provides that the EU and Canada will work together at the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and will continue to work on a successful conclusion of the Commission's work on the sustainable management of forests."
"There is thus a clear mandate in the action plan to continue and further develop cooperation and dialogue with regard to forestry and the environment."
"The action plan is, however, not considered to be a legally binding agreement but rather a statement of intentions and political will to cooperate on a wide range of issues."
"The EU and Canada agree that a legally binding international regime for sustainable management of forests is necessary and we are working together to initiate negotiations on a global forest convention under the auspices of the United Nations."
"An opportunity to raise forestry-related issues with Canada on a bilateral level already exists through the so-called ad hoc Working Group on Forestry, which is part of the EU-Canada annual high-level consultations on the environment."
"At the last meeting of the working group on 24 October last, the Canadian side mentioned that Canada is launching a new aboriginal forestry programme."
"With regard to the question of indigenous people, the Commission and the European Union are deeply attached to promoting sustainable development practices which take due account of indigenous peoples' human rights, including land tenure and the preservation of traditional lifestyles."
"The European Union has raised these issues repeatedly in relevant contexts, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and, in line with the conclusions of the Rio Conference of 1992, it has always emphasized the link between the promotion of human rights and respect for the environment."
"Thank you, Sir Leon."
"Mr Schnellhardt does not wish to speak, so we have come to the end of this block of questions."
"Whilst we are waiting for Mr Van den Broek to arrive, I suggest we break for a few moments."
"(The sitting was suspended for a few moments)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, now that we have had a few moments of welcome relaxation - for which we gratefully than Mr Van den Broek - I suggest that we resume our sitting."
"I have to inform you that Question No 33 by Mr Graziani on the situation in Albania will not be considered because, as you know, it is being discussed within the scope of this Parliamentary session."
"Question No 34 by Leen van der Waal (H-0117/97)"
"Subject: Customs levy imposed by Ukraine on humanitarian aid"
"According to reports in the Dutch press, Ukraine abolished the tax-free import of goods constituting humanitarian aid on 1 January 1997."
"Aid is now subject to a customs levy of some 30 % which has to be paid by the recipient of the aid."
"Although the measure is designed to counter any misuse of the opportunity of importing goods free of tax, it is reported that the activities of bona fide aid organizations are also being adversely affected by the customs levy."
"Can the Commission confirm these reports and indicate what steps might be taken in order to secure the free export by bona fide aid organizations of goods constituting humanitarian aid?"
"I should like to make the following points in reply to Mr van der Waal's question."
"The Ukrainian Parliament adopted a law on 17 December 1996 abolishing the exemption enjoyed by humanitarian aid from import duties, VAT and other taxes."
"The law came into force on 8 January this year, and was designed to eliminate abuse and fraud in the sending of aid consignments."
"The Commission contacted the Ukrainian authorities through its delegation in Kiev in an attempt to resolve this problem, and the European Union troika brought the issue up at its meeting with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Mr Udovenko, on 5 February in The Hague."
"The troika was given an assurance by the Ukrainian authorities that an amendment to the law would be brought before parliament to restore the tax-free status of humanitarian aid."
"On 20 February, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a resolution giving the government the power, in the short term, to allow humanitarian aid to be imported tax-free, on condition that each part of the consignment is properly labelled."
"This provided a legal solution to the problem."
"However, donor organizations and their counterparts in the Ukraine are being advised to contact the Ukrainian authorities or their embassies before sending any aid."
"Organizations receiving funding from the Commission, such as through ECHO, and which encounter problems should contact the Commission delegation in Kiev."
"I hope that this answer has reassured Mr van der Waal."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his answer, and in particular for the trouble his office has taken over this matter."
"It does indeed appear that there is legislation in the pipeline which will once again make the import of these goods tax-free, and I think we need to concentrate now on the period until this legislation comes into force."
"The Commissioner suggested that we should look to the embassies for as much help as possible, but I can foresee problems here, in that wherever the aid supplies arrive, permission will be needed to release and distribute them, and instructions will be needed from the authorities in Kiev if all this is to run smoothly."
"These are details which we cannot expect to resolve at the moment."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could tell us if the European Union ambassador could also be notified about aid consignments that are to be sent, and if he will promise that the Commission will constantly monitor the situation."
"I think it would indeed be best for anyone sending aid to contact their counterparts who are to receive the goods, their own ambassador or the Commission delegation."
"I think I would be overstepping the mark if I said the Commission delegation would handle all the consignments sent to Kiev by the Member States, aid organizations and so on."
"So as I said, if the goods are financed by Community programmes such as our humanitarian organization ECHO, then of course our delegation can be approached."
"Otherwise I would strongly recommend contacting the appropriate national embassy."
"If there is not an embassy, then our delegation will always be pleased to help."
"Commissioner, thank you very much for your answer, but I would like to put a practical question."
"There are still difficulties today, especially in countries bordering on others where there is genuine misery."
"Would it not perhaps be useful for the Commission to try to come to a general agreement at least with the states that have already applied for membership of the European Union, in other words with the 11 states that really do want relations with us?"
"We need a general agreement that also covers the question of transit in the various states where there really is misery - Romania for instance - so that we can resolve this problem, for to act through embassies takes a very long time and is very bureaucratic."
"Muchas graçias, Señor Presidente!"
"I entirely agree with Mr von Habsburg that the countries which have applied to join the European Union are certainly not expected to cause any problems here, or else have already agreed not to obstruct goods in transit, to take the example he mentioned."
"But the country in question here is not an applicant country, it is Ukraine, and as you know we have a partnership agreement with Ukraine which specifically states that in areas such as goods in transit, the goods must not be discriminated against compared with goods of national origin."
"In this respect, I entirely agree with Mr von Habsburg that we must try to eliminate these kinds of obstacles, even with countries with which we have partnership agreements."
"However, I fear that this will have to be done on an ad hoc basis each time the occasion arises, because in this case, for example, the levy on humanitarian supplies and so on was reinstated quite unexpectedly, and we were forced to intervene at a political level to have the decision reversed."
"We shall have to make sure that the new rules are applied throughout the country, but I am confident from our contacts hitherto that there will be a considerable improvement in the situation."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"Question No 35 by Ursula Stenzel (H-0128/97)"
"Subject: Phare - Poland"
"Since its introduction in 1995, the Phare programme has been the most important financial instrument for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"However, implementation of Phare is beset by major problems because the programme is very fragmented and its funds are poorly allocated."
"What is the Commission doing to utilize Phare programme funds more efficiently in the important preparatory stage?"
"What specific measures are being introduced in favour of Poland with a view to using Phare programme funds to prepare that applicant country's administrative authorities for accession?"
"Does the Commission plan to step up training for Polish officials to familiarize them with current EU law?"
"As you know, the Phare programme began in 1989, primarily as a programme of technical aid to assist the process of economic conversion and reform in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"As part of the pre-accession strategy, Phare was identified in 1994 as the ideal financial instrument for helping the associated countries to adopt the 'acquis communautaire ' and to complete the market reforms and economic restructuring required in the medium term to make them eligible for membership."
"In view of the political timetable for the enlargement negotiations, we are currently planning a fundamental reorganization of both how the aid is allocated and what it is allocated for, in other words of the entire implementation system."
"The aim is to help the applicant countries with the transposition, interpretation and enforcement of the 'acquis ' , and it will make Phare more effective and useful as the main financial instrument for helping the applicant countries to prepare for membership of the Union."
"In 1995 and 1996, Poland was allocated a total of ECU 377 million, 82 % of which was divided between just six sectors: transfrontier cooperation, transport, agriculture, small and medium-sized businesses, regional development, and the well-known Tempus programme."
"The aid in these sectors was concentrated on promoting the integration process either in material terms or in the fields of legislation or education."
"Harmonizing legislation and institutional consolidation are important elements of these programmes and are sure to be continued in future."
"Together with the Polish Government, the Commission is examining the further concentration of Phare assistance to support the Polish Government's national integration strategy."
"On the training of government officials, I can tell you the following: in 1992, Phare financed a public administration reform programme in Poland which played an important part in the development of the new law on government services and the central government reforms introduced in 1996."
"The European Institute for Public Administration is currently holding training courses for officials in Poland which are also being funded by Phare, and funding is also being provided for a Dutch organization to give veterinary inspectors important training in methods of quality control."
"From 1997, funding is to be provided for further specific institutional consolidation and training for officials on the Union 'acquis ' , in line with the government's new priorities under its national integration strategy, which I mentioned earlier."
"I have just one small supplementary in relation to the training of officials, which the Commissioner referred to."
"I hope that it would be possible, since officials of the Polish parliament and Polish ministries will have to deal with this Parliament and assist, in the course of time, Polish Members of this Parliament, that the training could also involve links with Parliament and, indeed, Members of Parliament."
"In this context I was pleased to be invited along with others to speak last autumn to a group of officials from the Polish parliament who were visiting London under the auspices of one of the London universities."
"It seemed to me that the officials were very keen to know more about Parliament."
"Could we take account of that in what is being organized?"
"We would be more than happy to look into this matter."
"I would also point out that we are very much in favour of the Poland/European Parliament joint parliamentary committees which meet at certain times and which may well provide opportunities for exchanges of information between MEPs and members of the Polish Parliament."
"More generally, however, I agree with the honourable Member that in our democratization programmes, for example, and our programmes designed to strengthen democratic institutions in Poland, consideration must also be given, wherever the need arises, to providing information for members of parliament as well."
"Thank you, Mr Van den Broek."
"Question No 36 by Felipe Camisón Asensio (H-0129/97)"
"Subject: Partnership and cooperation agreements with the countries of Central Asia and Mongolia"
"What is the Commission's proposed time-frame for approval of the partnership and cooperation agreements with Central Asia and Mongolia?"
"Three partnership and cooperation agreements have been signed with Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan in January 1995, Kirgizstan in February 1995, and Uzbekistan in June 1996."
"For these agreements to be concluded and enter into force, they must be ratified by the national parliaments in the Member States and, of course, by the European Parliament."
"Hitherto, the agreements with Kazakhstan and Kirgizstan have been ratified by the parliaments of seven Member States."
"The European Parliament has ratified the agreement with Kirgizstan, but the agreement with Kazakhstan is still pending."
"The process for approving the partnership and cooperation agreement with Uzbekistan began only recently and it has therefore not yet been ratified by anyone."
"The Commission has also been instructed by the Council to negotiate a similar agreement with Turkmenistan, but so far there are no plans to negotiate such an agreement with Tadjikistan, where there is still a situation of armed conflict."
"Finally, it is also not planned to enter into negotiations with Mongolia in the foreseeable future, since relations between the European Community and Mongolia are already covered by a trade and cooperation agreement which came into force on 1 March 1993."
"I thank the Commissioner for the information he has this afternoon given to this House."
"In any case it is very clear that there is still a long way to go and the pace is slow."
"In fact, as the Commissioner has told us, the cooperation agreement with Uzbekistan signed in June 1996 has been ratified by Uzbekistan only."
"I should like to ask whether Finland has ratified recently."
"In the case of Kazakhstan it was in fact seven."
"Kazakhstan itself has serious problems with the democratic deficit and has not ratified either."
"The case is similar for Kirghizstan."
"It appears that this Parliament, which has still not ratified any of the three agreements mentioned, is proposing to ratify the Kazakhstan agreement after tomorrow."
"In any event, as regards the three which the Commissioner mentioned, Mongolia, Turkmenistan and Tadzikistan, the process should be speeded up as far as possible since the main objective is to step up political dialogue with these countries."
"I entirely agree with what the honourable Member said regarding the need to speed up the procedures for approving agreements which have been concluded, or are about to be concluded."
"I had the pleasure of accompanying the Dutch presidency and President Santer to the Moscow summit ten days ago, and if I tell you that the partnership agreement with Russia was concluded two years ago, as was the agreement with Ukraine, and we are still struggling to have them both ratified, you will have some idea of the effort required to persuade all 15 Member States to conclude the ratification process in good time."
"In this particular case, there has been an additional legal complication caused by the accession of Finland, Sweden and Austria, which now also have to go through the ratification procedures."
"But you may be sure that the Commission is doing everything it can to speed things up, since there are no actual political obstacles in any of the cases to which you referred."
"Can the Commissioner comment on the current human rights situation in Uzbekistan, and does he think the situation there is suitable enough for the EU to proceed with the ratification of a partnership and cooperation agreement with that country?"
"I would be interested to hear his views."
"The reason why the Commission recommended that the Council should give it a mandate to negotiate a partnership agreement with Uzbekistan was because of the country's importance in the Central Asian region, and not because the democratic and human rights situation there is ideal."
"What persuaded us to approach the Council, and what persuaded the Council to agree to our request, was the fact that we were convinced that the government of Uzbekistan was entirely open to discussions on its human rights record, and indeed talks are still continuing."
"So while I would agree with Mr Truscott that the situation leaves something to be desired, it is also true that Uzbekistan is open to dialogue, and continuing to work on the partnership agreement could be an incentive for it to improve the quality of its democracy and its record on human rights."
"Thank you, Mr Van den Broek."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with Question No 36 we have used up the 20 minutes allocated for this block, so I must therfore first thank the Commissioner for the time he has given us, then tell you that Questions 37 to 44 will be answered in writing."
"So, ladies and gentlemen, we can move on to the next block which comes under the jurisdiction of Madam Commissioner Bjerregaard."
"Question No 45 by Ivar Virgin (H-0077/97)"
"Subject: The creation of wetlands"
"Wetlands are able to trap nutritive salts and can protect our seas against eutrophication which poses a threat to the reproduction of animal species."
"This is a big problem in the Baltic Sea."
"The current EU programme for environmental improvements in agriculture, Programme 2078, includes incentives for the creation of wetlands, though only in the case of the area set aside for this purpose."
"Support for the investment required to create wetlands capable of trapping nitrogen would benefit the environment, especially with regard to eutrophication."
"Does the Commission intend to change the rules so as to make this type of support possible?"
"Mr President, under Regulation No 2078 of 1992 the Member States must introduce programmes for environmentally compatible agriculture, but the detailed formulation of the programmes is in the main left to the Member States."
"There is nothing to prevent a Member State from using Regulation No 2078 to create wetlands at any suitable location on the territory of the State."
"It is not obliged to limit such measures to specially designated areas."
"Within specified ceilings, the Community can contribute to the financing of such projects."
"I will merely confirm the conclusion Mr Virgin drew from my answer."
"Clearly, there are various economic possibilities for supporting these areas and various forms of co-financing which fall within the powers of the Commissioner for Agriculture."
"As there are a good many questions to answer, I will refrain from going into detail on the matter, but there are a number of facilities that can certainly be used."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerregaard."
"Question No 46 by Tom Spencer (H-0114/97)"
"Subject: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals"
"Is the Commission aware of increasing scientific evidence which points to human and wildlife reproduction and hormonal balance being affected by a cocktail of chemicals passed through the food chain, through industrial emissions and products, and present in consumer food packaging?"
"These hormone-mimicking substances, known as endocrine disruptors, have been shown to have direct effects on animal reproductive systems and have been linked to declining human sperm counts, increased evidence of reproductive cancer, such as breast cancer and behavioural problems and neurological deficits."
"Given that existing EU legislation on toxicity tests and release of harmful substances does not cover the effects of endocrine disruptors at present, what action does the Commission intend to take to safeguard future generations?"
"The Commission is well aware of the question of endocrine disruptors which affect various parts of the general hormone system, including reproductive systems, on which possible effects are mentioned in the question."
"There is now no doubt that these effects exist, but there is doubt as to what could be called the mechanism of action. There is also doubt as to the causal relationships, and test methods are lacking."
"Irrespective of this uncertainty, there are some rules in the field."
"We have classified as toxic to the reproductive system a number of substances which probably have effects on human health due to endocrine disruption."
"Substances such as PCB and DDT, which have often been mentioned as endocrine disruptors, have of course long been banned for other reasons."
"It is true that Community legislation on test programmes for industrial chemicals does not cover toxicity to human reproduction or effects on wildlife."
"That is a deficiency, because there is a need for test protocols to establish which of the hundreds of thousands of substances on the market can cause the endocrine-disruptive effects described."
"In the Framework Programme For Research, and the arrangements under it for bilateral cooperation with the USA, the Commission has given top priority to the development of screening methods to identify potential endocrine disruptors and to new methods of assessing new side-effects, which are not covered by current legislation, as well as epidemiological studies to determine the extent of the problem."
"Thus, while it recognizes that there are certain effects on humans and the environment which may be due to disruption of the endocrine system by industrial chemicals, the Commission will seek to clarify how great the problem is, develop these screening methods and establish the causal relationships with a view to selectively regulating specific substances or groups of substances within the framework of a comprehensive programme."
"I thank the Commissioner for that thoughtful answer."
"I suggest that this is a clear case of when we should observe the precautionary principle that if even 50 % of the threats implied by our current state of scientific knowledge prove to be real, then we are facing a very serious and very complicated challenge indeed."
"I ask the Commissioner to confirm that we might expect from the Commission some specific work in the research programmes of the European Union (things which both the Commission and the European Environment Agency do directly), using her considerable influence to encourage both industrial and theoretical research in this area; and secondly, that she might consider, with her colleagues in the Commission, a review of how this threat impacts not just on the Environment Directorate but across a broad sweep of Commission proposals and activities."
"I entirely agree that these matters must remain subject to the precautionary principle, and I also agree that that principle must be applied extensively in the research programme."
"I mentioned in my answer that we had already ensured that it would be applied, and I also consider it important that we continue to build on that."
"I think it may be appropriate to look at the matter in a broader context and, in the light of the brief debate we have had here, we will consider how we can tackle it on a somewhat broader basis than dealing with it solely as an environmental issue."
"Apart from the matter of endocrine-disruptors raised by Mr Spencer, the Commissioner will be aware that there are others areas where EU legislation does not cover the ingestion of harmful substances through both the food chain and the water supply."
"Will the Commissioner also consider looking into EU standards to encompass the recent outbreak of crypto-spirillum bacteria in the UK?"
"I have submitted a more detailed question on this matter but would be interested in hearing the Commissioner's initial thoughts on the issue."
"I cannot promise to answer all supplementary questions on substances we need to look at more closely in connection with the question put by Mr Spencer."
"We have already got to grips with some of these problems in the context of the Drinking Water Directive, of which the questioner is no doubt also aware. I understand from Directorate-General XI that we have not concerned ourselves specifically with the problems raised by the questioner, but we will look at them in the context indicated."
"Would the Commissioner agree that things seem to have been moving very slowly on endocrine disruptors, and could she give any dates by which she hopes there might be some results from the research?"
"Could she tell us whether she is planning research simply on substances in isolation, or whether any work at all is going to be done on the cocktail effect, which many people feel is particularly dangerous in this field and about which very little is known?"
"When we discuss these problems relating partly to human health and partly to the environment, we very often get into a situation in which we quickly need scientific results other than those immediately available to us."
"It very often happens that the results we get are such that we rightly become concerned over a development and feel the need to act."
"On the other hand, we cannot do that without ensuring that it is thoroughly investigated."
"We cannot act on suspicion. Hence, as I said in answer to Mr Spencer earlier, we are endeavouring to move things forward on the research front and to secure some of those results."
"Clearly, we are also endeavouring to prioritize these subjects which are giving rise to concern among the population."
"I am sorry that I cannot give a more precise answer at the present time, but I am not in a position to do so."
"I am only aware that we have got things moving on the research front."
"How far we are forward and when I shall be able to present any results, I am not able to say in the context of Question Time today. But it provides an excellent opportunity to seek some clarification of the matter, and I will make sure that that is done."
"Thank you, Mrs Bjerragaard."
"Question No 47 by Konrad Schwaiger (H-0124/97)"
"Subject: Decimation of fish stocks by cormorants in the Rhine and other EU inland waterways"
"Is the Commission aware that the destruction of fish stocks by cormorants in and along the Rhine has become a European problem?"
"Is it aware that in late 1996 thousands of fishermen from France, Germany and Switzerland held a mass demonstration in Strasbourg to draw attention to the cormorant menace?"
"Does the Commission regard the Land government of Baden-Würtemberg's 'Cormorant Decree' of 16 December 1996 as an appropriate and adequate measure for decimating cormorant populations in internal waterways in which they were not indigenous?"
"Would it not be desirable to consider other measures to bring a permanent cross-border reduction in cormorant numbers?"
"Is the Commission contemplating, if they continue to proliferate, removing cormorants - at least temporarily - from Annex 1 of the bird protection Directive?"
"It is not the first time I have had the occasion to answer such a question. We are aware of the rising number of cormorants in certain regions of the EU, which are widely regarded by anglers and fishing interests as having a negative effect on fish stocks."
"The situation was described in a recent study from 1996, entitled Cormorants, Phalacrocorax carbo, a first step towards a European management plan ."
"This report does not contain any particular indications or complaints of observed damage to leisure or commercial fisheries on the Rhine, but I am aware that the subject often crops up in public discussions."
"On the other hand, the report does point out that the species has attained positive conservation status."
"In order to take account of this fact and the many and varied viewpoints and concerns manifested on this subject, the Commission will present a proposal to the committee concerned to remove the sub-species from Annex 1 to Council Directive 79/409 on the Conservation of Wild Birds."
"The Commission will also urge Member States to cooperate on controlling populations of this sub-species."
"In fact, the Member States can control the populations of species locally under the terms of Article 9 of the Bird Directive, if they wish to take action at places where cormorants constitute a problem."
"As regards the Cormorant Decree of Land Baden-Württemberg of 16 December 1996, the Commission has not yet received notification of any such a measure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, are you aware that the Committee of the Regions' working group on agriculture has also drawn attention to this problem and that the ministers of agriculture of various regions are now also addressing the Commission on this question?"
"The first cormorants appeared here, in this area on the central Upper Rhine, in 1973."
"In the late 1970s there were 10 pairs. Now there are 20 000."
"Are any further studies needed here given that fishermen and anglers are already on the streets to draw attention to their problems?"
"Should we not take joint action here and consider culling the stock to a reasonable level?"
"Your answer seems rather hesitant to me."
"I do not think my answer was particularly hesitant. I pointed out that a proposal would be presented to the committee concerned to remove the sub-species Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis from the Directive."
"I also stated in my answer that we would be urging Member States to cooperate on controlling populations of this sub-species. So I think my answer gave a sufficient indication that we are looking at the problem and are putting the matter before the committees and authorities which will have to deal with it."
"Emphasizing my support for the wild bird directive, it is important to say that angling is the biggest participation sport in Britain and, I assume, in Europe, and it is important to show that we listen to the points made to us by anglers."
"It is not just a problem on the Rhine, it is a problem in the UK too, where, for example, the Billericay and District Angling Society in my constituency, which has over 3, 400 members, has seen the fish depleted in the 22 different waters which they use for angling."
"It is a voluntary association but they had to spend £1, 700 last year to restock with fish waters that have been depleted."
"I do not want to see the culling of wild birds but I would like to see every alternative explored."
"I particularly ask the Commissioner two things: firstly, will you accept that there is a European dimension to this?"
"It is the depletion of fishstocks in our coastal waters and the failure of the common fisheries policy which is driving the cormorants inland."
"Secondly, will you comment on the position of the British Government where the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries has said it will take three to five years before it reports on this?"
"If they can act under Article 9, as she said, will she not talk to them so that they can act more quickly?"
"I have to say that I am not aware of the reaction pattern of the British Government on this matter, but I stress again that what I have said here today is that we will use the Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds to ask the committee concerned whether this sub-species, Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis by name, not a particularly easy one to say, can be removed from Annex 1, so that we can solve this problem which has been raised in various quarters."
"If I understood the Commissioner correctly, she intends to remove cormorants from Annex I of an earlier directive."
"I find this most regrettable, because the link between cormorants and fish stocks has never been clearly proved."
"The main threat to fish stocks is actually overfishing, so we would be changing Annex I of the earlier directive for the wrong reason."
"I would hope that the Commission will change its mind on this, but Parliament will naturally have an opportunity to give its opinion on the proposal once it receives it in writing."
"But at this stage, I do not agree at all with what the Commissioner intends to do."
"I was of course not proposing that Annex 1 should be removed from the Bird Directive."
"I was referring to a single species of cormorant and, on the basis of the information available to me and the DirectorateGeneral, I will present to the committee responsible the proposal I have indicated."
"Mr President, I have to say that I do not think I have a really satisfactory answer to give to these two questions."
"I will say to Mrs de Rivera that, at the 16th meeting of the Standing Committee, a common position was presented on progress achieved on the setting up of a marine nature park in Greece."
"A number of matters falling within the sole powers of the Community, such as fisheries, could not be dealt with, however, because the Commission had not yet received the mandate it had asked for from the Council."
"Mr President, there is no doubt that the response, as the Commissioner said, is not at all satisfactory."
"Therefore, if she says it is not satisfactory, I must ask her whether she does not fear that there will be no common position by December 1997, which could affect the protection of species in the first place; if we are going to manage to arrive at a joint position by December 1997 what changes will have to be made?"
"Will the Commission be better organized in order to reach agreement?"
"And thirdly, are talks due to be held beforehand with non-government organizations, as is usually the case?"
"As I said, I did not think it was a particularly satisfactory answer to give. Of course it is not unusual that we are not able to discuss a matter because there is no common position."
"Prompted by this question therefore, and against the background of the representations I have received from the NGOs which have a special interest in this area, I intend to ensure that we do not end up in such a situation again."
"We must do what we can to move things forward in the Council - there is a recommendation from the Commission on the matter - so that we can get to play a more active role."
"So at least I can promise that, prompted by the questions raised in Parliament today, we will do what we can to avoid getting into such an unfortunate situation again."
"I could understand you answering both our questions together, but it should not be so difficult to give me a separate answer to my question on what consultation arrangements there have been over the past five years between the Commission and the Member States."
"It must be quite easy to answer."
"I am not just interested to know whether the Commission will in future come prepared with a common position since, without it, we block fifteen votes, i.e. everything that is to be adopted by qualified majority in conjunction with the Berne Convention cannot be adopted when the Commission blocks fifteen votes, votes that cannot be used."
"That is in itself extremely unsatisfactory."
"But, after we got a habitat directive, the way things went was that the Commission met with the fifteen Member States at the preparatory meetings of the Berne Convention Standing Committee, where a common position was established."
"Does the Commissioner think it appropriate that the Commission should determine the common position of the fifteen Member States at a time when the NGOs were not yet in the picture and there was no possibility of taking into account the views of the NGOs, since the NGOs cannot be present at this preparatory meeting?"
"I hope that it is clear what I wanted to ask about, now that time is so short."
"No, I was not trying to get out of giving Mrs Sandbæk an answer to the question she had asked."
"I merely pointed out that there was a connection between the two questions and, in essence, I do not think the answer I gave to Mrs Sandbæk was all that much better than the one I gave to Mrs Rivera."
"As regards the formal consultations, there is no requirement that such formal consultations should take place in this area. So I cannot of course say that there have been so and so many consultations, because there was no obligation to hold such formal consultations."
"It is not so long ago that we had a discussion on financial support to the NGOs, in which we had the occasion to discuss the role of NGOs in the environmental field and in which I clearly stated my view that we should try to involve the NGOs actively in the work."
"That also applies in this area, and I think there is much to show that we are pressing for an improvement here. We must make sure that we make progress on that."
"Mr President, the Commission's recruitment and staff policy is based on the principle of equality."
"Under this principle all suitable candidates are treated equally and all members of the Commission's staff have the same possibilities for career development."
"The Commission looks favourably on all measures which promote the integration of disabled people into the Commission's working environment."
"The Commission has issued guidelines for the recruitment of disabled people."
"Its aim is that these guidelines should come into use in all the EU bodies."
"The guidelines relate to all areas of working life: recruitment, education, career development and the working environment."
"In this they also comply with the principles which the Helios programme stresses."
"An official will be appointed to follow up the implementation of the guidelines."
"The Commission's new buildings will have to comply with the national legislation on access to public buildings for disabled people in the country in which they are situated."
"The rules concerning Commission buildings contain strict criteria on the adaptation of buildings to meet the needs of disabled workers."
"Very briefly, firstly, my question was not specifically about recruitment policy but policy towards existing personnel."
"I should like to give the Commissioner a hypothetical example: if a 62-year-old, registered blind official was working in an external office - in other words he is only three years from retirement - and he is comfortable in that office, can find his way around about it and there are no complaints about the quality of his work, would he think it a reasonable policy towards disabled people to consider compulsory transfer of that individual back to Brussels at that stage of his career?"
"Mr President, it very difficult to answer hypothetical questions."
"If this occurred to a disabled person who was carrying out his duties well and wanted to carry on working, I should gladly do my best to ensure that he was able to continue in his former duties, if this was in the interests of himself and the Community."
"In such matters an employer must show a great deal of flexibility."
"The Commissioner mentioned making Member States' buildings accessible to disabled persons."
"Would he be in favour of having discussions with the other institutions at Community level to ensure that all our buildings - parliamentary buildings, the new Council building, and any agencies the Commission has - would be able to be accessed easily and speedily by disabled persons?"
"On his recruitment policy, would he look again at the problem of discrimination on the grounds of age, which has been a considerable difficulty?"
"Would he enter into discussions on the recruitment policies on ageism as well?"
"Mr President, we have a project on this very subject which is just now being launched. Its purpose is to organize an architects' competition together with the Brussels institutions and the Belgian authorities."
"The aim is to create pedestrian ways between the buildings which can be safely used by disabled people."
"At present moving safely from one building to another in Brussels is completely impossible for disabled people too."
"We will be discussing this matter among the institutions on Monday, and on Tuesday we will be meeting the Belgian authorities."
"I am prepared to bring up this matter of rules governing the buildings themselves with the officials responsible in other institutions too, at our meeting on Monday."
"I am prepared to return to this matter later."
"Concerning age limits, the Commission has decided on a new policy for the recruitment of officials on fixed-term contracts."
"This will mean that the Commission will continue to hold competitions for young applicants of under 32 or under 35 years of age, but also for older applicants at A4 to A5 level where the age limit will be considerably higher, even up to 55 years."
"The aim is thus to achieve more differentiated competitions."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner, following on from his own response just now, with regard to access to buildings and discussions between the European Union authorities and the Belgian authorities, what plans, if any, he has in his role to consult with the disabled people themselves to ask them what access and what kind of special facilities they may need."
"All too often in these architectural situations everybody goes by the textbook, and when you look and ask a disabled person afterwards what the textbook solution is like, firstly, invariably it is more expensive than what disabled people want themselves, and, secondly, it is actually not right for what they require themselves."
"I would just point out one factor alone: that in the new buildings we have in Brussels it is impossible for a person in a wheelchair to move from the B block to the C block or from the B block to the A block, because the passageways are too narrow."
"Therefore you have to go down in a lift to the ground floor and cross across the buildings outside or inside and get to another lift and go up there to get from one side of the building to another."
"Mr President, I have spoken on this matter with individual representatives of disabled people but the Commission has not heard their opinion at organization level."
"I would be glad to speak on this issue with the honorable Member and hear of his experiences."
"It is clear that people who have personal experience of a disability will understand the matter best."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"Question No 58 by Josu Imaz San Miguel (H-0162/97)"
"Subject: 1998 budget and the Structural Funds"
"When the 1997 budget was drawn up an ECU 1 billion cutback was made to the Commission preliminary draft in the headings relating to Structural Fund payment appropriations."
"This reduction by the Council only affected Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 and the Community initiatives, leaving Objectives 1 and 6 untouched."
"However, examination of the implementation of the 1996 budget as at 31 May reveals that the Objective 2 payment percentage (23 %) is higher than that relating to other objectives, such as Objective 1(17 %)."
"In its 1998 preliminary draft budget, is the Commission planning to increase the Structural Fund payment appropriations corresponding to Objectives 2, 3, 4 and 5 and the Community initiatives?"
"Does the Commission consider the reductions made by the budgetary authorities to be logical in the light of the above budget implementation statistics?"
"Mr President, in 1996 there was an underspend in the payment commitments on the Structural Funds of 5.2 % or ECU 1200 m."
"In 1994 and 1995 the underspending was even more significant."
"In 1996 the utilization of appropriations in Objective 1 areas was 99.3 % and in Objective 2 areas 98.3 %."
"In 1997 by the beginning of March 14 % of Objective 1 appropriations and 27 % of Objective 2 appropriations had been spent."
"This shows that the level of utilization of appropriations may vary considerably from one objective area to another during a calendar year, but the differences do not always remain the same throughout the year."
"It is also useful to note that appropriations are transferred within budget headings to improve the efficient use of resources."
"The Commission estimates that it will be able to deal with the requests for payment during 1997."
"But at the same time it has stated, in connection with cuts made in the Structural Funds by the budgetary authority, that it intends to propose additional appropriations during the course of the budgetary year if this proves necessary."
"In this connection it is still too soon to assess the individual points of the 1998 budget."
"The Commission will take a decision on these in April 1997."
"Mr Commissioner, I thought I heard that 98 % of the payment appropriations under Objective 2 had been implemented."
"Could you please confirm that? Is it correct that 98 % of the payment appropriations under Objective 2 have been implemented for 1996?"
"If that is so, then the ECU 1 000 million reduction in payment appropriations suggested by the Council at its July 1996 meeting seems all the more incomprehensible to me, since that reduction in payment appropriations referred only to Community Objectives 2, 3, 4, and 5 - and excluded Objectives 1 and 6."
"I should like to know therefore whether the Commission shares my surprise that the Council should make this reduction exclusively as regards those objectives and whether the Commission considers that the Council made this proposal not for technical reasons of implementation, but for political reasons in line with the interests of certain Member States."
"Mr President, the Council did indeed decide to cut the appropriations in this way."
"When the Council decided to cut payment appropriations, the Commission thought it best that these cuts should be made equally for all the objective areas."
"However, following a very long and difficult discussion, the Council decided to exempt Objectives 1 and 6."
"I can however state that our commitment appropriations have been largely used but that there has been clear over-budgeting for payment appropriations."
"There has been significant saving of appropriations."
"I do not myself believe that there will be any special problem in dealing with payments during this year."
"If there should be any such problem, we have already announced in the Council and in Parliament that the Commission will produce a draft supplementary and amending budget."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"Question No 59 by Charlotte Cederschiöld (H-0169/97)"
"Subject: Making the Commission more efficient"
"The Commission has launched several projects aimed at boosting its efficiency, including SEM 2000."
"The Community's institutions must be made more efficient, as many citizens will lose confidence in the Community if it does not operate as it should."
"Are the efficiency-boosting measures going according to plan, and what economic benefits have they already yielded?"
"Mr President, when it took office the present Commission stated that an important objective was to reform its financial and staff management structures."
"This administrative development project, known as the SEM 2000, aims to rationalize administration and create a new administrative and budget culture for the Commission."
"At the third stage of the project cooperation will be tightened up between the Member States."
"This is important because 80 % of the appropriations in the budget are administered in the Member States."
"A working party made up of representatives of the Member States' finance ministries is currently working to improve the management of Community funds, and its work has progressed very well."
"The working group's first report, which contained numerous proposals for measures, was prepared in December last year and had a positive reception in the Council and in the European Council."
"In general, the administrative development work is progressing according to plan."
"As time goes on the necessary reforms will improve the efficiency of the use of Community funds."
"I agree with the honorable Member that administrative reforms are very important in boosting the confidence of the EU's citizens."
"I do not yet wish to put a figure on our results, but Parliament will have an excellent opportunity to assess these results annually when the Court of Auditors report comes out for Parliament's inspection."
"I would like to thank you for an encouraging response, but I also understand that there has been some criticism from members of the Committee who have pointed to unreasonable working methods and bureaucracy."
"This criticism has now died down, which is all to the good, provided that it is based upon considerations of efficiency rather than on constructive criticism that is not allowed to come to the fore."
"SEM 2000 has many beneficial part-projects."
"Amongst other things, the preliminary checking level, on payments, is to be increased."
"Three quarters of all payments are to be checked."
"Has this been done and has it produced a better result?"
"In addition, not enough has been done on the personnel side of things."
"We are aware of the large number of people employed by the Commission."
"SEM 2000 has for example taken up 23 of the positions of which 8 are on A2-level."
"Does the Commissioner know how many are directly employed by the Commission, how many work on a consultative basis and how many are used by the Commission as third party contractors?"
"I would be grateful for information about the number of people working for the Commission and maybe some figures as this would make it easier for people to assess whether the work is being carried out in a more financially efficient manner."
"Mr President, I would say to the honorable Member that the Commission is currently preparing a significant administrative reform."
"Our objective is, in connection with the 1998 draft budget, to take significant measures to decentralize administration."
"This will imply a reduction in in-house bureaucracy and greater powers begin given to the DGs to work in their own fields and at the same time increase their responsibility."
"We aim to decide on this matter at the end of April together with our decision on the budget, so that the first stage of the reform can enter into force in January next year."
"At the same time the Commission is preparing a broader set of measures in connection with the 'Santer package'."
"When the funding packages for the years after 2000 are proposed, the Commission must also propose in that connection a concept for the Commission's role for the years 2000-2006: how its activities can be made more efficient and more transparent, to enable it to accept the challenge of enlargement."
"At the end of July, in connection with the first communications on the Santer package, Parliament will have an opportunity to debate this."
"As regards criticism in general, I regard this as the basis of any healthy debate."
"It is even better if the criticism contains suggestions for improvements and how the implementation of reforms might be speeded up."
"Thank you, Mr Liikanen."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with Question No 59 we have come to the end of the time which is allocated under our agenda for questions to the Commission."
"Questions 60 to 94 will therefore be answered in writing."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.20 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Question Time (Council)"
"The next item is Question Time to the Council (B4-0019/97)."
"Question No 1 by Mr Crowley (H-0098/97)"
"Subject: Second-chance schools"
"According to the Commission, five million young people between 16 and 25 years of age left school without a diploma and another 2 million are at risk of doing the same by the end of the century."
"Does the Council consider that this serious social problem requires urgent action and will it now invite the Commission to develop partnership programmes with Member State governments with a view to utilizing European Social Fund resources to offer these young people training in skills which would better assist them to get a job?"
"I would like to thank you for the opportunity of being here with you today."
"I would answer Mr Crowley's question as follows: the question refers to schools for second-chance education and I would point out that for a considerable time now the Council has been paying special attention to the problem raised by Mr Crowley."
"In 1984 and 1987 the Council in its conclusions stressed the need for an ongoing campaign to combat illiteracy."
"On these occasions the Council and the Ministers of Education emphasised the serious consequences of school failures."
"And again in 1987 and 1989 the Council and Ministers drew conclusions and adopted a resolution which specifically dealt with combatting failures at school."
"The importance which the Council and Ministers attach to professional training for future opportunities for job seekers is evident from the fact that since 1976 the Council and Ministers of Education have passed thirteen resolutions or conclusions on the subject."
"This illustrates the continual attention which the Council pays to this problem."
"May I also remind you that in the decision of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 October 1995, which called for 1996 to be the European year of life-long education and training, the subjects for that manifestation included promoting professional training which ensured that all young people could acquire qualifications and promoting continued education and training."
"I would also remind you of the Council decision of 6 December 1994 on deciding an action programme for the development of a European Community policy on profession training, the so-called Leonardo da Vinci Programme, which covers Community measures to improve professional training systems and provisions in the Member States by means of pilot projects and transnational programmes."
"The Leonardo da Vinci programme stipulates, and I would refer Mr Crowley to part 4, section 1, that Community aid is given to initiatives in the Member States to set up transnational partnerships in this field and training to submit transnational pilot projects."
"As to the question of possible finance from the Social Fund, I would point out that Article 8 (2) of the decision to determine the above-mentioned Leonardo da Vinci programme stipulates, and I quote, ' The Member States have, within their responsibility to implement Community provisions, the possibility of creating links between this programme and the structural funds in accordance with the provisions on the implementation of the structural funds' , end of quotation."
"So there is already a link between Leonardo and the social fund."
"Finally I would point out that under Article 10 (4) of the decision, the Commission must by 31 December 1997 present an interim report on the implementation of the programme to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee and the Consultative Committee for Professional Training."
"As soon as that report is available an assessment can be undertaken into the way in which the above mentioned provisions have been implemented."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his very lengthy and informative response."
"However it did slightly go off the mark, because the question related specifically to the opportunities for secondchance education."
"In particular I am looking at people who are at risk, whether because of social problems and their lack of access to formal education, or because of dropping out of formal education and getting involved in crime and other activities."
"What I would like to ask the President-in-Office is, accepting that high priority has been placed on this issue in the Council in the past, why is it that we are still facing this problem?"
"Why is it that we have failed to look at the structural problems that are causing people to drop out of education?"
"Finally, why is it that the Council as an appropriate body cannot work together in exchanging best practices? - because there are many Member States where there are fantastic second-chance educational facilities that do not seem to be available in other areas."
"I would ask the President to bring this back to the Council if possible."
"I shall do as Mr Crowley requests. I would point out that the chief responsibility for education and creating opportunities through education for socially weak young people lies first and foremost in the exclusive authority of the Member States and that the Community only has an ancillary role to play here and only takes action when, for example, it involves a trans-border project, or where special measures can be taken under the social or structural funds."
"If Mr Crowley is pressing for the Council to take action under its own responsibility then I think he is going a little too far with the normal division of authority between the Community and the Member States, but I shall certainly pass on your comments to the Commission and those responsible for any follow up and for the use of structural funds when the report is being drafted so that they may be taken into account."
"Question No 2 by Mr Camisón Asensio (H-0103/97)"
"Subject: Madrid to Lisbon high-speed train service"
"Is there any likelihood that the projected future high-speed railway line linking Madrid and Lisbon will pass through the Spanish region of Estremadura?"
"Mr Camisón Asensio's question refers to the route of the future rail links between Madrid and Lisbon."
"I must reply that the decision on this kind of high speed railway link and the relevant route is a decision for both Member States."
"I recall that this link was included in the decision 1682/96/EEC of the European Parliament and the Council of 23 July 1996 on community guidelines for the development of transEuropean networks."
"In the map annexed to this decision, no. 3, 3.5, this link is described as a planned high speed railway link, but the exact route, however, is not given."
"Mr President-in-office of the Council, thank you for the information you have given us."
"I have to say, though, that in recent years hundreds of documents have been distributed - quite a lot of them by the Council itself - some of them with a profusion of colours showing a hypothetical high-speed railway line between Madrid and Lisbon."
"The natives of Madrid and Lisbon, the inhabitants of Estremadura and La Mancha knew that the improvement was of great interest, albeit in the long term, and the proof of that is that it is not even included in the trans-European networks."
"But this 'in the long term' , since it is feasible, does bring some hope."
"Now we are told that it is a question of a multi-modal link between Spain and Portugal and the rest of Europe and I am in fact asking this question in order to dispel the doubts once and for all."
"We see that there is still some doubt, but there is still hope from the Commissioner's words."
"And since there is hope, let us keep on hoping; but finally we see that the work has not been abolished, since the multi-modal Lisbon line has been approved from Lisbon to France via Valladolid."
"I welcome the fact that Mr Camisón Asensio and myself are totally ad idem on the priority of this project and on the importance of international links between Member States."
"As you are aware, the European Council in its meeting in Essen came out strongly in favour of top priority being given to community involvement and to the financing of high speed links."
"As I said, the question of the actual implementation and choice of route are matters to be decided on by the Member States but nevertheless the European Council and the Council as such have always considered it a high priority."
"I am tempted to say, but I may be too outspoken, that it is up to your colleagues in the European Parliament to exert your influence when you can, and try to ensure that the higher priority of financing high speed links is reflected in the budget."
"Question No 3 by Mrs Sandbæk (H-0108/97)"
"Subject: EU and CITES and elephants"
"The African elephant (Loxodonta Africana) was listed in Appendix I of the CITES Convention at the 7th COP held in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1989."
"Southern African nations opposed the ban on the grounds that their elephant populations were well managed and in many cases growing beyond the carrying capacity of their land, and wished to resume a legal and controlled trade in elephant products for the benefit of conservation and rural communities."
"Southern Africa is home to 50 % of the total population of the species."
"CITES COP 10, to be held in Harare, Zimbabwe, from 9-20 June 1997, will address the issue and analyse proposals from several Southern African countries."
"Will the European Union honour CITES Resolution conf."
"7.9 (the Somali amendment) and support the down-listing of any elephant population that meets the criteria of the CITES Panel of Experts' review?"
"If not, why not?"
"Does the EU have plans to compensate those countries for losses of conservation revenues from an ongoing ban on the sale of elephant products?"
"Mr President, I would answer Mrs Ulla Sandbaek's question as follows."
"The Council has not yet received the Commission's proposal on discussing the EU's standpoint to be taken during the tenth conference of parties to the CITES Convention."
"And I am therefore unable to give a specific answer to the questions put by Mrs Sandbaek."
"I would, however, like to point out at this juncture that the report from the panel named in Resolution 7.9, the resolution quoted by the honourable member, forms only the basis for the parties' talks on any requests for transfers from Annex 1 to Annex 2."
"I am equally unable to comment on any possible loss of income resulting from the protection of those animals, as elephant products will not longer be allowed to be sold, nor on whether the EU intends to compensate the countries concerned."
"As I said the Council has yet to study the Commission proposal which has not yet been presented."
"Since this has yet to be considered by the Council, I should like to ask it to take account of the fact that the panel of experts set up to review CITES has given its opinion on the elephant populations in Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe, which states that these are not under threat and are increasing, and in the case of one of these countries, the panel has said that it is very probable that the proposal will have a positive effect on elephant conservation and community conservation and development programmes in the country."
"This means that there will be a positive effect if controlled sales of ivory are allowed."
"Could you perhaps comment on this?"
"I agree with Mrs Sandbaek, but now I am talking in general terms, that with proper wildlife management it should be possible to market the products resulting from that wildlife management."
"The only thing is that it must be properly balanced against the more general and wider measures of tackling the ban on illegal trade, particularly in ivory."
"There is a certain area of tension there and we should always assess that sensibly."
"Once the Commission has presented its proposal on the CITES Conference I shall bring Mrs Sandbaek's remarks to the attention of the Council."
"Question No 4 by Mr Bianco (H-0110/97) and Question No 5 by Mrs Ahlquist (H-0148/97) on the situation in Albania will not be taken as the issue is already on this week's agenda."
"Question No 6 by Mrs Banotti (H-0115/97)"
"Subject: Interim trade agreement with Israel"
"Is the Council satisfied that Article 1 of the interim trade agreement with Israel is being both properly monitored and implemented?"
"Will Parliament receive a report from the EU special envoy to the Middle East, with particular reference to the special tasks assigned to him in the Dublin Declaration of December 1996?"
"The article to which Mrs Banotti refers in her question is often called the human rights clause."
"Respect of human rights and of democratic principles is an essential part of the Barcelona process, the cooperation between the European Union and the countries of the Mediterranean."
"It is an integral part of all Euro-Mediterranean association agreements, including the interim agreement with Israel."
"The European Union therefore follows closely the human rights situation in countries with which such agreements have been concluded in order to ensure that the conditions for the agreement are being respected."
"That refers to both Israel as it does to the PLO, with whom the European Union signed an interim agreement on 24 February last."
"Under the joint approach in relation to the appointment of a special envoy for the peace process in the Middle East the envoy on the authority of the Presidency must report to the Council of General Affairs."
"This in no way prevents Parliament from inviting the envoy to the relevant parliamentary committee for an exchange of views on the subject raised by the honourable member."
"Mr President-in-Office, are you satisfied with the reports that are coming from the special mediator?"
"Do you anticipate that he will give direct reports to the relevant parliamentary committee on a regular basis?"
"There are disturbing reports that the Palestinians are still encountering considerable difficulties, particularly in relation to the export of their goods from Gaza and the somewhat exigent security measures which can have a detrimental effect on these products before they are exported: products, for example, such as flowers which form a significant part of Palestinian trade with Europe and which, when exposed to the sun, very quickly die."
"Ambassador Moratinos was appointed at the end of last year as the Council's special envoy to the peace process in the Middle East."
"His first job was to pull out all the stops to concentrate his total attention on restarting the peace process which had grounded to a halt, especially the situation in Hebron and the evacuation in Hebron by the Israeli army."
"I can assure you that the Council, and especially the Dutch presidency, is extremely pleased with the work and achievements of Mr Moratinos in the peace process."
"At the present time, for Mr Moratinos has been in his position for only a few weeks, I have been given special reports on the human rights situation."
"Mr Moratinos has specifically been asked to observe that since relations between Israel and the Palestinian authorities and the Palestinian people require close monitoring, as does action on breaches of human rights."
"It is also regularly discussed in normal contacts between the Council and Ambassador Moratinos."
"Mrs Banotti's question of impediments to trade is also being monitored by the Council and the Member States."
"What we are particularly concerned about here is doing everything possible to stimulate economic activities and create economic opportunities in the Palestinian areas in view of the unemployment and the social problems in these regions; a strong economic basis is essential for stable, peaceful relations in the Palestinian regions and between the Palestinian authorities and Israel."
"The smooth resumption of trade is regularly addressed in our talks with Israel and with the Palestinian authorities, especially with the leadership of the PLO."
"We are aware of the situation."
"It is an old subject of discussion, but the European Community, the Commission and the Council will not let it be dropped from our talks."
"Question No 7 by Mrs Hautala (H-0120/97)"
"Subject: Groupeuro"
"In the context of the Information Programme for European Citizens (Prince), the Commission has established a network of independent EMU experts called Groupeuro."
"The Commission demands that they sign a statement whereby they agree that 'they may speak in a personal capacity for a part of their lecture, provided that they state explicitly that they are going to do so and do not express any views contrary to those of the Commission.'"
"Is the Council aware of such demands by the Commission?"
"Does the Council find them helpful in order to convince the European citizens of the single currency?"
"Is this declaration in accordance with the ethics normally expected of scientists and with democratic, pluralist values?"
"In reply to Mrs Hautala's Question on the Groupeuro, I would point out that the Council is unaware of the Commission's rules for the activities of a network of independent EMU experts that was set up in the context of the information Programme for European Citizens, the so-called PRINCE programme."
"The Commission is entitled on its own responsibility to take a decision on this information campaign and the conditions attached thereto."
"The network to which Mrs Hautala refers was set up independently by the Commission under its right of initiative conferred by the Treaty, and I would ask her to consider putting this question to the Commission and not to the Council."
". (FI) Mr President, I would point out to the President-in-Office of the Council that in fact I also put this question to the Commission, because it is indeed as you say, and the Commission has the right to make these rules itself."
"I received a written answer today and I am concerned that the Commission really supports this practice."
"Certainly in Finland and a number of other Member States it has been severely criticized."
"How can we trust the experts sent by the Commission if they have already been gagged and bound to support the Commission's point of view?"
"Worse still, the Commission says in its reply that in such circumstances it is perfectly entitled to ask for such guarantees of loyalty."
"This in its way is an even more wide-ranging practice and in my opinion it will be good for the Council to be aware of this."
"I should also like to tell you that Commissioner Liikanen, who represents a slightly more modern and perhaps more democratic concept of administration, has condemned this practice today in the Finnish press."
"I hope the Commission will take up a position on this and will talk to the commissioners about it because this project is important to the Council as well."
"My first problem was that I was unaware of the Commission's regulation, but I now have a second problem, namely that I do not know the Commission's answer to Mrs Hautala's question, so this debate is rather bizarre."
"If she thinks the Commission's activities in her country hinder normal events concerning the European Monetary Union, then the government in Helsinki will not fail to raise the matter with the Commissioner responsible either directly or through its own Commissioner."
"But I find it rather difficult to answer this question on the basis of documents and information with which I am not familiar."
"I must say that I am rather surprised that the Council is not taking this matter more seriously."
"The Council should after all be responsible for whether these types of methods are acceptable or not."
"The matter cannot be waved aside with the excuse that you do not know anything about it."
"First of all I find it deplorable, ignorant even, not to know what is going on in one's own organisation."
"Secondly, I think it ought to be a matter of principle to reply when you are given a question and not to refer the matter to another institution, especially as it is the Commission's own proposal that is being criticised and the Council has overall responsibility for what is happening in this area, as has always been the case with the Council and the Council's representatives."
"My question is what action the Council plans to take bearing in mind the information given by a Member of the European Parliament."
"To avoid any misunderstanding: the Commission has a responsibility of its own to provide information on the implementation of legislation and the implementing decisions concerning the European Community and it is not up to the Council to monitor the Commission in all details."
"I repeat that it is difficult to continue discussion on these questions and answers because I do not know the Regulation nor the Commission's answer to the written questions put by Mrs Hautala."
"As Mrs Stenzel is not present, Question No 8 (H-0127/97) falls."
"Question No 9 by Mr Bertens (H-0132/97)"
"Subject: Developments in the negotiations on the ban on anti-personnel mines"
"The European Parliament has declared its unequivocal support for a ban on anti-personnel mines."
"It has also welcomed the action recently taken by the Council in this matter on the Community's behalf."
"APMs are currently being discussed both in the 'Ottawa process' and at the UN disarmament conference."
"The UN conference is, however, in danger of grinding to a halt over other issues."
"It is therefore extremely important that the European Union should give a high priority to the Ottawa process."
"Does the President agree that the first follow-up conference in the Ottawa process in Vienna was a success, partly because it was attended by more than 100 countries?"
"Can he guarantee that the Council is committed to the Union's active involvement in the Ottawa process, regardless of the activities of the UN disarmament conference?"
"What specific action will the President of the Council take to ensure that the follow-up conferences in the Ottawa process, like that in Brussels in June, are successful, with a treaty being concluded at the end of the year?"
"I understand that Mr Bertens has put three questions and I shall take each of them in turn."
"I agree with Mr Bertens that the participation of 110 countries in the Vienna conference must be regarded as a great success."
"This large-scale participation demonstrates international concern about the problem of land mines and anti-personnel mines in particular."
"At the same time, however, it is equally clear that major efforts still are required to overcome the differences of opinion on the content of a general ban on antipersonnel mines and the way such a ban should be implemented."
"On Mr Bertens' second question I would say that in the past the European Union has supported the Ottawa process on various occasions."
"All 15 Member States took part in the Ottawa and Vienna conferences."
"Land mines and the way in which a total ban should be effected is the subject of intensive EU coordination."
"It is also important to adopt tactics which offer the greatest chance of results."
"The forum is a means, not an aim in itself."
"In deciding on its tactics the Union also takes account of developments in the various fora, including the Geneva Disarmament Conference."
"The European Union recently decided to try to start negotiations in the Geneva Disarmament Conference on an effective world-wide ban on the use, production, possession and transfer of anti-personnel mines, with the aim of producing a treaty as quickly as possible."
"This negotiation process does not in any way exclude active EU participation in the Ottawa process."
"At this stage, however, it is impossible to determine what the future specific contribution of the European Union in the Ottawa process will be, independent of developments in the conference on disarmament and elsewhere."
"To Mr Bertens' last question I would reply that the Presidency assumes that all 15 member States will make a constructive contribution in Brussels."
"I cannot yet indicate the specific content of the EU contribution in Brussels."
"As I have already said, it will partly depend on developments elsewhere."
"The Presidency has proposed to the Member States that coordination meetings should start at the beginning of June."
"I would like to thank the Council warmly for its commitment to a total ban on the most inhumane weapon we know, the anti-personnel mine or the anti-people mine."
"I am also pleased that the Ottawa process is not only being closely monitored but that it is also regarded as a good forum."
"I hope that this forum, which was instigated at Canada's initiative last October, will lead some way or other by the end of this year to like minded countries supporting a convention."
"I regret that land mines will not feature prominently in the disarmament conference, as also happened in 1995 and 1996."
"I realise that there are some five Member States of the European Union, including France and the United Kingdom, which prefer it that way, but I hope that this Presidency at any rate will use its diplomatic endeavours to change that position."
"On behalf of the Presidency I wish to stress the absolute political priority of containing an international plague which has got completely out of control."
"Land mines used to be a military weapon, nowadays they are an instrument of terror which in the wrong hands spread death and destruction."
"The Presidency lays great store by coordination prior to the Ottawa process but especially in developing formal disarmament negotiations which could under the auspices of the UN bring about a treaty on the ban on production and trade in anti-personnel mines."
"Resistance to such a concept will have to be broken down and the economic interests will undoubtedly also have to be considered, but this process has been started and we shall bring it to a conclusion as best we can."
"I just wish to thank the President-in-Office for the excellent, lengthy and detailed answer on this important subject."
"I just wondered, following Mr Bertens' third question on follow-up work, whether the Council is aware of the large level of publicity that was generated on this very subject by the visit to Angola with the Red Cross of a former member of the British Royal Family, Princess Diana."
"Does the Council feel that she and other international celebrities have a role to play in perpetuating the serious publicity that could be given to this highly important issue?"
"The Council as such has taken no note of the visit of a member of the British royal family to Angola."
"I personally learned about it through the media, and without commenting specifically on that visit I think it is very important to create sufficient political support to put an end to land mines as an instrument of terror."
"People with vision and power to motivate other people can in their own way contribute to public awareness."
"Question No 10 by Mr Wibe (H-0133/97)"
"Subject: Tax-free sales in the EU"
"The Commission stated in its answer to a question on 18 February 1997 that there was no need to investigate the consequences of abolishing tax-free sales in the EU and that the decision to abolish them had been taken long ago, so that there had been ample time in which to adapt."
"Commentators believe about 100 000 jobs in all to be at risk if tax-free sales are abolished."
"Ferry services between the Scandinavian countries in particular earn vital revenue from tax-free sales."
"Many routes, such as that between Umeå (Sweden) and Vaasa (Finland), could close if tax-free sales are ended."
"In view of this, does the Council not think that an impact assessment should be carried out before tax-free sales are abolished in 1999?"
"If such an assessment indicates that the consequences will be severe, e.g. for employment or ferry services in Scandinavia, the Council ought to be able to review its decision, e.g. by extending the time limit for its implementation, at least in the case of ferries."
"Is the Council prepared to commission an assessment of the impact of ending tax-free sales and is it prepared to postpone implementation of the decision or grant exceptions, e.g. in the case of ferries operating between Member States?"
"Mr President, I would answer Mr Wibe's questions as follows. I would remind you that tax-free sales in intra-Community travel does not mesh with an internal market without frontiers."
"That is why the Council in adopting the directives on the abolition of tax borders, with effect from 1 January 1993, decided to put an end to these tax-free sales."
"The Council is equally aware of the economic problems and social consequences this means for the sectors concerned."
"That is why it decided a long time ago to allow a long transition period, namely from 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1999, during which these tax-free sales may be enjoyed by travellers in intra-Community travel."
"Thank you for that brief reply."
"I have learnt that when discussing these types of reforms one ought to ask oneself: Where is the beef?"
"Or to put it in 'European terms' : Where is the profit?"
"In this case, I cannot see any profit for anyone involved."
"In a theoretical model with unlimited competition and a balanced market reforms of this kind could possibly bring a financial profit."
"However, in the EU, as it is at present, with 20 million unemployed, such profits do not exist."
"It should be mentioned that in Sweden we are talking about approximately 5, 000 jobs, primarily on the ferries, that will be lost."
"For the Community this must be closer to 10, 20 or 30 times more, in addition to the indirect effects of freight becoming more expensive."
"I believe it is wrong to push through this type of reform when the levels of unemployment are as high as they are. I therefore appeal to the chair of the council to bring the matter up for discussion and to at least initiate an analysis of the implications of these amendments."
"I take note of Mr Wibe's comments."
"I think he has a rather one-sided view of this issue."
"The major winner of this policy change in Europe is the treasuries of the Member States which will have considerable increases in their excise revenue because the big tax-free sales, which were always an anomaly for normal intraCommunity traffic, will cease and be replaced with normal tax levies."
"I also think that the major winner will be public health as the problem of alcoholism may well be slightly reduced."
"May I thank the Council for its reply, even if I think it was somewhat negative."
"I can understand the principle that an internal market should not have duty-free trade."
"The most important question is on the other hand what is to be done to reduce unemployment in Europe."
"It is undoubtedly the case that this proposal will have negative consequences for employment, particularly in those countries furthest away from the centre of Europe."
"These countries will be worst hit."
"Through its Minister of Labour, the Netherlands have, in other matters, put forward exceptionally good proposals as far as employment is concerned."
"This is currently the most important issue, one that must take precedence over any principle."
"Reality is more important than any principle."
"Employment is more important than abolishing duty-free trade."
"My first reply may have been somewhat short, my second reply to Mr Wibe was short but to the point."
"I think that if you want a serious discussion on this we must approach it in a serious way."
"My basic assumption is that tax exemptions, particularly excise on cigarettes and alcohol, for this is what it is all about, for normal intra-Community trade is a total anomaly."
"Now it is a fact of economic life that a certain economic activity has grown up around this anomaly, on ferries and tax-free sales at airports."
"That is what the whole discussion centred on when this measure was being prepared, away back in the eighties, so there is no question of any surprise element here."
"And in addition to that there was a six-year transition period."
"I think that everyone who wittingly benefited from this anomaly was warned in plenty of time, plus the transition period, so that they could do whatever was necessary to switch over to other types of marketing of their transport services from the sale of cheap alcohol."
"I also think that you are underestimating the macro-economic effect in general."
"I think that if you investigate the amounts the British treasury is currently losing through tax-free import of alcohol in lorries, or perhaps not lorries, but in any case in the luggage of her own citizens, I think that treasury loss could finance a large number of new economic activities in Great Britain, for example, which would more than compensate for the activities on the ferries."
"And I think that if you are insisting that some kind of injustice is being meted out to a specific group, then logically you must be presenting a one-sided view of affairs, with which I cannot agree."
"The President-in-Office has himself said that it is time to start tackling this matter more seriously."
"I would therefore like to give him the chance to do so by asking him two specific questions that he should be able to answer more or less in detail if he agrees to the abolition of duty-free trade."
"The first question is: How many people will be without work if the EU decision to abolish duty-free trade between Member States is implemented in 1999?"
"The second question is: If the ferry companies' income is to be reduced by approximately 30 per cent, which probably will be the case if duty-free trade is abolished, how will this affect transport charges?"
"Mr Stenmarck will not be surprised to learn that when he bombards me with such a specific factual question that I do not have the information at my fingertips."
"But I would say that you can never isolate that from other facts if you calculate the effects of abolishing tax-free sales on ferries."
"In the English Channel it is related to the opening of the channel tunnel or other new forms of transport."
"So it cannot be seen in isolation."
"I also do not think it opportune to continue this discussion solely from examining the consequences for one sector alone."
"One could equally say that this measure produces a considerable increase in revenue from excise for the Swedish or British treasury."
"That can be used to help promote economic activities or reduce taxation which will also help to stimulate the economy."
"So if you want to have this debate we must have it on the basis of serious wider considerations with account taken of all aspects which are relevant and which are based on accurate statistics."
"Question No 11 by Mrs Kinnock (H-0140/97)"
"Subject: Combatting international corruption"
"Can the Council assure Parliament that preventing and combatting corruption on an international scale will be added to areas listed in Article K.1 of the TBU as a matter of common interest with a view to cooperation and common action?"
"I would reply to Mrs Kinnock's question as follows."
"As she will appreciate, I feel that in general terms and in particular as President-in-Office of the Council it is not my place to dwell on what is being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference as these are matters for negotiations between the Member States and the Council as such has no role to play there."
"I can however confirm that this question, which was included in a draft proposal from the Irish government for the Intergovernmental Conference, is receiving full attention."
"I cannot, however, give her the assurance she is seeking on behalf of the Council."
"That depends on the final result of this Intergovernmental Conference."
"I can inform the Honourable Member that after the protocol to the Convention on protection of the financial interests of the European Community was adopted in September 1996 the Council continued to work on combatting international corruption."
"Parliament gave its opinion on that in a resolution on 15 November 1996."
"There is every reason to hope that the irregularities referred to by the Honourable Member have already been tackled under the present Treaty."
"I thank the President-in-Office for his response and I appreciate the difficulty he has in being more specific."
"However, I would like to pursue one or two issues with him."
"Under the third pillar, bribery within the European Union is a criminal offence."
"So why is it that we do not make a similar commitment when dealing with third countries?"
"Would not such an initiative be desirable in developing countries and countries in transition, as well as within the European Union?"
"Since the Council was not able to be more specific, I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he would be prepared to welcome a Commission proposal designed to secure such a development in developing countries and countries in transition with respect to bribery and corruption?"
"I must consider that carefully because the subject raised by Mrs Kinnock, international bribery and corruption, covers an enormous area where the European Community as such, for example through its responsibility for international customs traffic or its development cooperation programmes, is involved in the most varied ways, including in relations with third countries."
"I can assure you that it is certainly taken into account in the normal execution of programmes and activities and in the general functioning of the European Community, and not only because the European Court of Auditors warns where the European Union runs the risk of entering the danger zone on this point."
"When it comes to judicial cooperation and detection cooperation with third countries then the matter becomes somewhat more complicated because the whole responsibility of the European Union is based on intergovernmental cooperation and one of its shortcomings, I must admit, is that it is difficult to develop very constructive cooperation with third countries on the basis of the third pillar."
"This subject as such is not really on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference but will be studied in a group of senior officials which was set up by the Dublin European Council and which was instructed to report in a very short time on organised crime in Europe and beyond, in so far as Europe is involved."
"As I understand it attention will also be paid to improving the judicial and administrative working of cooperation with third countries in preventing and detecting fraud and crime."
"Question No 12 by Mr Sjöstedt (H-0141/97)"
"Subject: Opt-out from the third stage of EMU"
"It seems most likely that a majority of Members of the Riksdag will vote against Sweden taking part in the third stage of EMU at the beginning of 1999, even if it fulfils the convergence criteria."
"Sweden does not officially have a derogation from the relevant part of the Treaty."
"Does the Council take the view that, in order to settle this matter, Sweden should, during the current IGC, follow Denmark and the UK in applying for a formal exemption from the third stage of EMU?"
"Or would it be equally acceptable for Sweden simply not to sign up to the common currency, regardless of what the Treaty officially says?"
"First of all I would say in reply to Mr Sjöstedt's question that the European Council in Madrid fixed the starting date for the third stage at 1 January 1999."
"Under Protocol 11 to the Treaty the United Kingdom, however, is not committed to proceeding to the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union without its government and parliament specifically deciding to do so."
"Under Protocol 12 Denmark announced it would not proceed to the third stage of the Economic and Monetary Union, at least until further notice."
"Under the Treaty of the Union or a treaty of accession all other Member States decided to participate in the third stage on condition that the Council, in the composition of heads of states and government, and I refer in this context to Article 109J(4) of the Treaty of the Union, confirms they meet the conditions for participation, the so-called convergence criteria."
"Member States not meeting these criteria will be granted a derogation under Article 109K."
"Any Member State may itself determine which procedure should be applied, including the role of its parliament, in order to prepare for the above mentioned decision of the European Council."
"During the fourth sitting of the negotiation conference on Sweden's accession to the European Union the conference took note of the declaration to that effect made by the Swedish delegation."
"As to the operation of the Intergovernmental Conference, it is not up to the Council to comment on the conference agenda or on any initiatives the Member States may wish to take."
"I thank you for a detailed, legal reply to the question."
"However, the question also concerns a very specific political reality that I am sure Mr President is aware of, i.e. that the majority of the Swedish Parliament probably will decide not to be part of a single currency from 1999."
"Despite the reply from the Presidentin-Office, I still want an answer to the actual question."
"Do you really mean that a country can do this?"
"Or does the council prefer to make changes in the actual Treaty during the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"Surely this is something on which the council has a viewpoint."
"I would like a clearer reply to my question about which model the council prefers when Sweden decides not to be part of the single currency."
"I have tried to explain clearly the legal situation of the accession process to the third stage of monetary union."
"I would point out that the decision will only be taken in a year's time, that a lot of water can flow under the bridge between now and then and that I do not wish to jump the gun, either with regard to decisions in the European Council or decisions by the Swedish government or decisions by the Swedish parliament or decisions any other Member State may wish to take under Article 109J a year before the due date."
"I would, however, urge you not to speculate on what might happen, we still have a year ahead of us to prepare the way."
"Mr President, I should just like to ask one question, and at the same time I must apologize, because we could not hear very clearly over here, so I only think I understood what the President-inOffice of the Council was saying."
"My question is as follows. Is there really any point in speculating about what will happen in Sweden in the year 1999?"
"As far as I know, elections are due to be held between now and then and, to judge by current public opinion, there is likely to be a change in the majority, in which case the whole thing would be invalidated."
"It would be better to cross that bridge when we come to it."
"Mr Habsburg's comment is exactly in line with what I myself said. I said that there was no point in speculating about any decisions to be taken by either the Swedish government or the Swedish parliament or the Council or the government of the Member States in a year's time, and a year in politics, as Mr Habsburg well knows, is a long time."
"I should like to take both Mr Papayannakis' and Mrs Daskalaki's questions together."
"Under the conclusions of the European Council in Cannes in June 1995 accession negotiations with Cyprus on the basis of the Commission's proposals begin six months after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I would add that account will be taken of the results of that conference."
"This is the Union's starting point which was confirmed again to the government of Cyprus at the meeting of the Association Council on 25 February 1997."
"Close coordination within the international community to support the efforts of the United Nations is essential in order to reach a general settlement in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council leading to a federation with two communities and two zones."
"The prospect of Cyprus joining the European Union offers a chance this year to find a solution to the old and thorny Cyprus issue."
"As confirmed in its conclusions of 6 March 1995 the Council believes that Cyprus' accession to the European Union should lead to greater security and well-being for each of the two communities on the island."
"It should help the northern part of the island to catch up in economic terms and to improve growth and job prospects."
"The Council believes that the Turkish Cypriot community ought to appreciate more the advantages of Cyprus' accession to the European Union and overcome its misgivings."
"The Council has asked the Commission to make the necessary contacts with the Turkish Cypriot community, in agreement with the government of Cyprus."
"The Council equally confirms its stance of not recognising the authorities of North Cyprus."
"It was with this aim in mind that the current financial protocol was signed in June 1995 to support the efforts for a general settlement of the Cyprus question."
"An amount of ECU 12 million was earmarked for possible confidencebuilding initiatives agreed with Cyprus."
"It is expected that additional funds may be made available to finance programmes and projects to promote the development of the whole island."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, for your answer."
"I agree with most of what you said, and am very pleased to do so."
"However, the decisions you described, on the one hand recognition of the Republic of Cyprus as a partner in talks, and on the other hand participation of the Turkish Cypriot community in the negotiations, a participation which the Republic of Cyprus has in any case accepted and proposed, those two decisions should lead towards some development, some outcome."
"My question, therefore, is this: Can you tell us now when the European Union is to meet with Cyprus in the context of political dialogue, in the context of structured dialogue with a view towards accession?"
"Because since we agree about the general principles, progress ought to be made."
"I am telling you that time is passing."
"So when will meetings take place to further the structured political dialogue?"
"Contacts between the European Union and the Cypriot government in general are very intensive."
"I have already mentioned that the Association Council met very recently."
"Commissioner Van den Broek visited both parts of Cyprus very recently."
"We are very busy preparing for the prospect of starting accession negotiations with Cyprus in the near future."
"Such negotiations will also have the necessary accompanying political monitoring."
"Mr Papayannakis' question referred to a very specific point, namely the political dialogue between the European Union and Cyprus."
"Mr Papayannakis is undoubtedly aware that this political dialogue did not get far with the Association Council because the fifteen Member States were unable to agree on the political declaration drafted by the European Union to prepare for this political dialogue."
"I am sure there will soon be an opportunity to resume talks whereby I am assuming that everything being done by the European Union and by Greece in the context of the Council is directed at creating the conditions under which the peace talks with Cyprus can be resumed, and resumed in such a way that gives assurance that there will be no political spokes in the wheel to upset the commitment given by the European Union on the start of accession negotiations with Cyprus."
"I repeat: all efforts on the part of the Council and of the Members of the Council must be directed at creating the political environment for smoothing the path towards the start of the accession negotiations with Cyprus."
"It is clear that the general atmosphere would be improved by a definite prospect of peace negotiations being resumed in the near future under the auspices of the United Nations and preferably producing results in the very short term."
"Mr President, I am particularly grateful to the President-in-Office of the Council for his detailed answer, and I share the view expressed by Mr Papayannakis that along general lines it is a very good answer. However, I would like to return to the subject of structured dialogue."
"I want to ask, indeed to insist a little, on the following: granted all these difficulties and facts that we all know about and that the President-in-Office mentioned earlier, does the Council have a view about any specific timetable for this resumption of structured dialogue?"
"And in any case, what must now be done to overcome the previous difficulties?"
"The Council will undoubtedly resume talks on the small difference of opinion, because the disagreement was about one small sentence, on the political declaration to prepare the structured dialogue."
"I am confident that this will also be taken in the wider context of these talks, for it is not about the structured dialogue with Cyprus at all."
"It is about creating the political conditions for the Council's commitment on starting the accession negotiations with Cyprus being put into action without hindrance."
"That is a commitment the Council which is standing by and which we also want to put into action."
"We want no political complications there."
"It is part of a wider context which involves Greek-Turkish relations and relations between the Turks and the European Union which affects all parties - and I would point out in this context that the European Parliament has also a certain responsibility of its own here - and which should contribute to the whole complex of political sensitivities and political risks being brought back to manageable proportions, to the political difficulties being reduced to problems which can be resolved and to the accession prospects of Cyprus being fulfilled."
"As Mrs Izquierdo Rojo is not present, Question No 15 (H-0151/97) falls."
"Question No 16 by Mr Lindqvist (H-0153/97)"
"Subject: The EU's foreign and security policy"
"The clearest expression of the Union's objectives in security and defence is to be found in Article J.4(1)."
"The present wording is: 'the common foreign and security policy shall include all questions related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence.'"
"In the draft for a new Treaty the word 'eventual' has been replaced by 'progressive'."
"The present wording 'which might in time lead to' now reads 'in the perspective of'."
"This represents a clear upgrading of the objective for the common foreign and security policy, i.e. a common defence."
"Are these changes designed to pave the way for a common EU defence?"
"My reply will not completely satisfy Mr Lindqvist because he is asking about the Intergovernmental Conference and I am unable to give him an answer on behalf of the Council."
"I do not think it opportune to answer, but from my own observations and involvement in the IGC I would just like to assure Mr Lindqvist that the matter he raised is receiving a great deal of attention."
"I would even go further and say that it is one of the main subjects of negotiations within the framework of reviewing the second pillar of the Treaty on European Union."
"I thank you for the reply, even if it did not reveal anything new."
"For a Member State such as Sweden, the question of military alliances is very important."
"It is important in the light of Sweden's long experience, 180-200 years, of being a country free of military alliances."
"However, it is also important for the future to preserve what the people and the parties more or less agree on."
"It would therefore be a loss and a dilemma - a rather serious dilemma - if new regulations were introduced into a future EU Treaty, which would take the matter even further than the regulations, which still apply and which even during the referendum in 1994 caused an intense debate in our country."
"I do understand that the members of the Council cannot say at the present time what will come out of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"However, the matter is important from our point of view which is the reason for asking the question."
"Question No 17 by Mr Needle (H-0154/97)"
"Subject: OECD recommendations on combating bribery"
"In 1994 and 1996 OECD member states adopted at ministerial level a set of recommendations on combating bribery in international business relations."
"Very little has happened in terms of implementation."
"Would the Council share the view that a concerted, simultaneous action of the 15 Member States would be a means of breaking the deadlock and of carrying other OECD members along?"
"Should not one of the first steps consist in ending tax deductibility of bribes paid to foreign officials (which creates considerable distortions of competition and represents a major obstacle to development)?"
"I would like to say the following in response to Mr Needle's question."
"It is correct that the OECD Council adopted a recommendation on 11 April 1996 inviting the OECD members states to review their tax legislation and end tax deductibility for bribes paid abroad."
"As a result of this recommendation and of other current discussions, such as those in the Council of Europe, some countries have either ended tax deductibility of bribes paid abroad or are planning to do so."
"As this issue in some countries is linked to a possible change in their penal legislation, in particular the penalisation of corrupt foreign officials, it may take some time for the legislation in the various member states to be revised in the light of the OECD recommendation."
"Although this is a recommendation adopted outside the framework of the Community and therefore does not come within the powers of the Union, the Presidency will certainly pass on Mr Needle's request to the delegations."
"I would just mention in this context that the Council is currently working on a draft agreement making the bribing of officials from the EU Member States a punishable offence."
"The Council views corruption as a very important matter."
"We must unequivocally condemn the practices of individuals who unscrupulously harm the whole community and tax payers in particular."
"It goes without saying that the Dutch presidency will leave no stone unturned in dealing with this subject."
"I thank the President-in-Office for that very encouraging reply and I am delighted that, taken together with the question from Mrs Kinnock earlier on, we have had a welcome and very positive response on this important subject this evening."
"I should like just to press you on a couple of small points about what can actually be achieved, particularly given the slow process in the Council of Europe and the OECD."
"Does the Council believe that the Commission could be encouraged to use the legal instruments already available to it, in particular in the field of competition rules, for example, and rules governing the internal market?"
"Lastly, given the initiatives about which you have spoken in the framework of the OECD and the changes by the World Bank, does the Council intend to press for new European Union procurement rules so as to prevent corruption more effectively?"
"On the implementation of the OECD recommendation which concerns tax legislation and penal legislation, it strikes me that regulations on competition and the internal market do not directly affect this discussion, so I must think carefully about this one."
"For the time being I am unable to answer your question on European rules on procurement."
"I think it very important that the European Union, which is responsible for a large number of invitations to tender every year, should be extremely wary of any shady practices involving tenders."
"I think the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors must constantly be on the alert."
"The Council Presidency will not fail to play its part."
"As Mr Pirker is not present, Question No 18 (H-0165/97) falls."
"Mr Pirker's office told me that the Bureau had been informed that I would be taking over Mr Pirker's question."
"Mr Pirker's office was kind enough to inform you, but it was not kind enough to inform us as well."
"I was told that the Bureau had been informed."
"I am sorry, but that did not happen."
"Question No 19 by Mrs Cederschiöld (H-0168/97)"
"Subject: Deadlines in areas which are part of the third pillar"
"The IGC is discussing the introduction of deadlines in areas of the third pillar that are now being transferred to the Community domain."
"The term 'deadlines' in this case means the year by which Member States must fulfil the requirements imposed by virtue of communitization."
"In the Council's view, how will the introduction of such deadlines affect enlargement of the Union?"
"On Mrs Cederschiöld's question on the deadlines for transferring powers under the third pillar, I can only say in my capacity as President-in-Office of the Council that this too is one of the many proposals being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"As my predecessors and I myself have said on various occasions in earlier replies to questions on the workings of the IGC, the Council is not a party to this conference."
"It is therefore inappropriate that I say anything further here today."
"I repeat that it is not opportune for me to comment on the content of the Intergovernmental Conference, but Mrs Cederschiöld put another question which does fall within the remit of the Council."
"She asked about the link between the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and the start of accession negotiations."
"I wish to state that the Dutch presidency attaches the greatest importance to doing everything in its power to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference under its presidency, and that is because of the political link between the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and the start of accession negotiations."
"The Intergovernmental Conference, including the work of the think tank under Mr Westendorp, has already been on the go for nine months and we consider it of the utmost importance that the governments of the Member States meeting in the conference continue to make themselves available during the final three months to conclude the conference properly."
"I fully agree with Mrs Cederschiöld that we keep the periods for starting accession negotiations - and we all know that these negotiations will be rather lengthy and that they have to be followed by a ratification process - as short as possible for precisely the reasons adumbrated by Mrs Cederschiöld, namely that we cannot afford the expectations of the applicant countries to be dashed through internal division and procrastination."
"Question No 20 by Mr G. Collins (H-0174/97)"
"Subject: Cot deaths"
"Despite efforts to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the number of deaths rose in Ireland in 1996 following a steady decrease during the previous five-year period."
"Will the Council outline the ways in which it believes the European Community can contribute to preventing Sudden Infant Death Syndrome?"
"Does it consider the 5th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, in addition to research in the fight against age-related diseases, should support research into SIDS and, finally, will the Council encourage the setting up of a Union-wide register of cot deaths which will enable all unexplained cot deaths to be notified, as is the case in Ireland, to the respective Departments of Health and relayed within the EU?"
"Mr President, in reply to Mr Collins' question on cot deaths I can assure him that the Council shares his concerns on the development he described."
"I must, however, inform him that in the context of action in the field of public health the Council has not yet received any specific proposal on the notification of cot deaths or on the creation of a Union-wide register."
"It is possible that certain general actions in the framework of the Community action programme on public health, information, education and training which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council on 29 March 1966 could indirectly contribute to the prevention of cot deaths, but sudden infant death syndrome as such is not specifically mentioned there."
"It is the duty of the Commission in cooperation with the Member States to ensure the implementation of this programme."
"Were the Commission to produce a proposal, the Council will certainly consider it seriously with the encouragement of the Presidency."
"As Mr Andrews is not present, Question No 21 (H-0176/97) falls."
"Question No 22 by Mr Gallagher (H-0181/97)"
"Subject: Compensation for Irish fishermen"
"The fishing industry and the fish-processing industry in Ireland have been severely hit by the storms of recent months."
"Will the Council now instruct the Commission to immediately bring forward an urgent compensation package to assist fishermen and those involved in the fish-processing industry affected by these severe storms?"
"In reply to Mr Gallacher's question on compensation for Irish fishermen for the damage suffered from the storms of recent months I wish first of all to express my sympathy to all concerned."
"I must point out that it is not the responsibility of the Council to request the Commission to present proposals for compensation."
"It is up to the Member States concerned to bring this matter to the attention of the Commission which is authorised to grant emergency aid to victims of disasters."
"I want to thank the President-in-Office for his reply."
"However I do not accept what he suggests, that it is a matter for the Member States to make a case to the Commission."
"He also suggests by implication that there is a fund there."
"Could I draw the President-in-Office's attention to the fact that the Commission made a case to the Council of Ministers in March 1995 and it included a proposal for aid for the establishment of bad weather unemployment funds."
"This was rejected by the Council of Ministers."
"That contradicts what the President-in-Office has just said."
"I am asking the President-in-Office now, is there a fund there and if there is a fund can he give me details of it?"
"If there is no fund will the Council now give favourable consideration to the proposal which was rejected in March 1995?"
"I am not familiar with the 1995 proposal which was rejected by the Council or by Parliament, I am not too clear about that."
"I cannot comment on it."
"The Commission has funds for emergency aid."
"But this form of intracommunity aid for victims of disasters comes specifically under the authority of the Commission."
"The Commission decided independently on 16 October 1996 to use ECU 300, 000 for victims of the severe floods in Ireland in January 1996."
"Incidentally Parliament may ask the Commission itself to release funds for victims of disasters by adopting a resolution, for example, in its debates on urgent questions."
"As Mr Papakyriazis, Mr Ephremidis and Mr Theonas are not present, Question No 23 (H0184/97), Question No 24 (H0190/97) and Question No 25 (H-0191/97) fall."
"Question No 26 by Mr Posselt (H-0193/97)"
"Subject: Enlargement and internal security"
"What stage has been reached in the cooperation and structured dialogue with the Central and Eastern European candidate countries with regard to internal security, and what implications does this have for the security situation on the EU's external frontiers?"
"In reply to Mr Posselt's question I can say that the structured dialogue with the Central and Eastern European countries started in June 1996 under the French presidency in Luxembourg."
"It entered a new phase in March 1996."
"A specific subject is given top priority attention during each presidency."
"During the second half of 1996 the dialogue concentrated on the problem of drugs."
"A seminar was held on that subject on 24 and 25 October 1996 and the conclusions of this seminar adopted as such by the partners on 28 and 29 November 1996."
"A meeting of the working party 'Drugs and Organised Crime' was held with the Central and Eastern European countries on 10 March."
"The Council services are currently implementing the conclusions of that meeting, which include a number relating to internal security, for example exchange of information, monitored deliveries and rules on the control of precursors for chemical drugs."
"The dialogue is now concentrating on asylum problems."
"The conclusions will be presented to the Council in May."
"Specific practical problems of border controls are being dealt with under the so-called 'CIREFI' , which is an EUwide data bank on asylum affairs."
"The applicant countries have already attended meetings in the past on this subject."
"A second meeting with Central and Eastern European countries on this matter will be held under the Dutch presidency."
"Mr President, thank you for this very precise answer, and I should just like to ask whether certain elements of the cooperation that would be expected to result from membership might perhaps, given the length of time the negotiations will take, be given priority, in the interests of cooperation and in the interests of public security."
"For example, could not EUROPOL start working directly with the police forces of the candidate countries, and could not the structured dialogue be extended to cover three issues that are particularly explosive, namely the slave trade, an area in which organized crime is already earning more than in the drugs trade - and secondly the theft and smuggling of works of art, which is a major problem in Bavaria and the Czech Republic, and thirdly the drugs problem, which has already been mentioned?"
"I reply to Mr Posselt's second question I would say that the Council attaches the utmost importance to cooperating with Central and Eastern European countries on the prevention of and fight against organised crime."
"Organised crime does not stop at the borders of the European Union."
"Central and Eastern European countries are just as concerned as ourselves."
"The Union and Member States attach great importance to giving this top priority, including the areas mention by Mr Posselt."
"There are still some restrictions which have not yet been solved but we are working on them."
"The first restriction is that the Europol Treaty has not yet been ratified."
"Practical cooperation in the immediate future can only be on the provisional European Drugs Unit which has a limited capacity."
"We must keep that in mind."
"But I believe that as soon as Europol is ratified and the necessary human and financial resources made available then it can quickly be extended to the Eastern European countries."
"Another aspect I would refer to, and I already mentioned this in reply to Mrs Kinnock's question, is the shortcoming in the institutional means of the third pillar; specifically, it is very difficult to make agreements with third countries under the third pillar."
"I have already mentioned that the group of senior officials dealing with combatting organised crime, a group set up in Dublin by the European Council which is to report back to Council in April, will also discuss this aspect of cooperation between the European Union and Central and Eastern European countries in fighting organised crime."
"Question No 27 will be answered in writing."
"That concludes Question Time."
"Driftnets"
"The next item is the oral question by Mr Arias Cañete, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Council (B4-0017/97 - O-0001/97), on driftnets."
"Mr President-in-office of the Council, I thank you first of all for being here and for being willing to discuss the future of driftnets with us."
"As you know, the Commission has a proposed amendment to the current regulation on technical measures seeking to ban driftnets exceeding 2.5 kilometres in length as from 31 December l997."
"This proposal dates from 1994 and thus far neither the Council nor the Commission has done anything to break the deadlock."
"I am putting this question to the Fisheries Committee to underscore our conviction that various events which have taken place since 1994 in the legal, legislative, social, economic and environmental spheres, have placed the Commission proposal in a totally different global context."
"We therefore think that the content urgently needs to be reviewed."
"Although there have not since 1994 been the serious disputes seen in previous years, that was because inspection vessels were permanently deployed by sea-bordering countries as well as a Commission monitoring vessel."
"That has all proved so costly that it appears that the Commission does not intend to deploy its vessel for next summer's fishing year in the Atlantic."
"That will no doubt mean that the member countries will step up their inspection activities, because those of us who know the fleets well are aware that the dispute is still lurking beneath the surface and that rules are still being broken, as the Commission's own reports indicate."
"It seems clear that nets of 2.5 kilometres are not an economic proposition for most ports and the proof is that many countries, under pressure to carry out inspections, have dismantled their driftnet fleet as uneconomical - as in the case of Ireland and the United Kingdom - or for other more complex reasons nonetheless directly related to unprofitability, as is the case with Italy."
"On the other hand, we in the Council, Commission and Parliament are currently working on a new proposal for a regulation on technical measures."
"Is there any point in approving this proposal when there is still an amendment to the previous regulation which is still dragging on and which has not even been included in the new proposal?"
"Another original - and in my opinion very important - aspect arises from the approval of the New York Agreement on trans-zonal and highly migratory species which the European Union is preparing to ratify."
"I would draw attention to some of the points in Article 5, particularly 5 (f), according to which the states undertake to reduce to a minimum contamination, depletion of stocks, waste, fishing by equipment which is used once then discarded, accidental catches of species of fish or other creatures outside the scope intended, by the adoption of measures which include the use of gear and techniques for selective fishing which do not harm the environment and which are not expensive."
"Other sections of this Article might be mentioned, but I think that is sufficient to make the point that promises are not being fulfilled with regard to these nets."
"There again the ecology movement and those Member states most concerned about the environment have a much clearer view of driftnets nowadays than they had in 1994 and what happened with regard to the United States' threatened embargo against Italy, which directly affects the entire Community tuna and sword fish production, further demonstrates what we can expect if we do not tackle the problem."
"Finally, Mr President, I should like to remind you of another factor which has been largely responsible for the changes cited: this Parliament's own resolution on the banning of driftnets dating from 1994 and which was, moreover, by excluding the Baltic and use within the 12-mile zone, instrumental in securing the agreement of the northern countries of the Union."
"We therefore think that there are sufficient aspects left to warrant a new proposal and that, if it makes the requisite effort, the Council can find a way out."
"On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries and in view of the arguments put forward, I ask for that effort and that impetus."
"I must put the record straight on a number of facts."
"The present Community legislation on drift nets, EEC Regulation 3094/86, amended by Council Regulation 345/92, bans the use by Community vessels of drift nets of more than two and a half kilometre's length, irrespective of the waters being fished."
"The only exception to this regulation is the Baltic Sea where special international rules apply."
"On 8 April 1994 the Commission presented a proposal to the Council for a total ban on drift nets with effect from 1 January 1998."
"The Council debated this proposal in the light of the opinion from the European Parliament and the opinion from the Economic and Social Committee on various occasions but has so far been unable to reach a qualified majority opinion."
"The proposal is still on the table and while waiting for a Council decision the Member States and the Commission have cooperated in implementing stricter controls and conservation measures on tuna fishing in the Atlantic Ocean and since 1996 in the Mediterranean Sea."
"The proposal was last discussed at the Fisheries Council of 22 April 1996 when the Council again stressed that the present Community legislation on drift nets must be fully respected."
"The Council also expressed its satisfaction on the results achieved to date on the conservation measures."
"The Council also welcomed the Commission's initiative to try to meet these objectives during the fishing season without increasing the overall fishing activities."
"The Commission representative stated that the Commission wished to see progress made and would welcome any constructive ideas from delegations on procuring a qualified majority on its proposal."
"On 17 December 1996 the Commission presented the Council with a plan produced by the Italian authorities for a decision on a specific measure to encourage Italian fishermen to switch certain fishing activities."
"This proposal was aimed at the Italian fleet gradually abolishing the use of drift nets with the smallest possible effect on employment."
"Measures have been taken to encourage fishermen to switch to other more selective methods for the period 19971999 and to offer them compensation for any loss of income."
"This proposal of 17 December is currently being debated in the Council and the European Parliament consulted."
"In the light of Parliament's opinion the Presidency intends to do everything in its power to ensure that the proposal is adopted during the Dutch presidency."
"The Member States are also reminded of the Commission's request during the Council meeting of April 1996 to take the initiative and produce constructive proposals to solved the problem of drift nets."
"Without such an initiative, for which unanimity is required in the Council, in the absence of an amended Commission proposal, the prospects for a solution are not favourable."
"I think I should leave it at that."
"Mr President, Mr President of the Council, I believe it is right to hold this debate, and to be able to go deeper into the matter next month, when we will be dealing with the conversion plan for driftnet fishing, which affects Italy."
"Italy, or more accurately its new government, has taken a firm line on the issue and it is highly likely that within three years it will have succeeded in moving fishing vessels using driftnets up to 2.5 kilometres in an acceptable direction."
"The plan is voluntary and will therefore involve those intending to convert their own businesses."
"But the problem has to be dealt with not just from a distinctly Italian viewpoint, but taking account of a wider area surrounding the Mediterranean."
"We are convinced certain resources are being overfished and overuse of driftnets is creating problems, not least environmental ones."
"This has been scientifically proven."
"This problem reaches beyond Italy to third countries, because the risk is that once the European fleets have been converted, the use of driftnets could easily proliferate in the third countries."
"So there has to be a conversion plan covering the whole Mediterranean and it is also important for Europe to develop its Europartenariat role with Mediterranean countries, encouraging awareness in these countries of the environmental effects of this type of fishing."
"We also have to recognize that there are fleets fishing indiscriminately in the Mediterranean - I am referring to the Japanese and Korean fleets - as well as flags of convenience ploughing those waters and having an enormous impact on fisheries resources."
"That is why the problem of driftnets has to be analysed jointly with the complex effort in the Mediterranean fishing sector."
"Other types of fishing and other fishing gear are extremely prejudicial to the maintenance of certain very delicate species. Dolphins and 'caretta caretta' turtles are of course suffering significant repercussions from other types of fishing too, like longline."
"So I believe we must press ahead with controls, but recognizing our duty to comply with the Community regulation setting the length of driftnets at 2.5 kilometres."
"I believe this is a fundamental point we must keep to."
"In my opinion, Mr President, your answer is completely unsatisfactory."
"You say that there are no constructive proposals."
"But from whom?"
"In my opinion, these constructive proposals are lacking on the part of the Council, and certainly not on the part of the European Parliament!"
"We have already, on many occasions, given our opinion on the problem of driftnets."
"In the past, we have always prohibited them - quite rightly - because public opinion, which is what we represent here, regards the protection of marine creatures and the maintaining of the ecological balance as being threatened by these nets."
"The fishing industry also means safeguarding people's economic and social living conditions."
"However, we must be extremely careful here, particularly at a time when those areas where fishery resources are available are experiencing losses."
"The use of driftnets brings with it two negative consequences. First of all there is the problem that when driftnets are used the species to be caught cannot be selected."
"In addition, sea creatures are senselessly killed by these so-called 'ghost nets' ."
"Even if we have to make a distinction between the fishing problems in the North Pacific, the South Pacific, the North Atlantic, the South Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and within the twelve-mile limits, the fact remains that, basically, the use of driftnets is disastrous everywhere."
"We should continue to set an example on this issue, in accordance with our previous decision."
"Some updating is needed."
"The Council's acceptance, possibly revised, of the Commission's 1994 proposal is therefore absolutely vital and a matter of great urgency."
"In order to defend its interests and values, and those of other communities and countries, the EU must find a way, within its own institutions and within the international bodies concerned, to achieve an immediate and appropriate prohibition on the use of driftnets, and at the same time come up with the necessary effective control measures."
"Mr President, if a man wants to drown his dog he first accuses it of having rabies."
"Nowhere is this proverb better illustrated than in the case of driftnets."
"First of all, there is the question of what is included in the mixture."
"To lump together under the same heading the nets that are used in the Mediterranean and those that are used in the Atlantic really smacks of trickery."
"In the Mediterranean, they fish for swordfish, a rare species. The fish are very scattered, which makes it necessary to use very long nets, whereas in the Bay of Biscay, which is the subject of my proposal, they fish for tuna, a species which occurs in abundance and which is found in shoals, so that it can be caught in nets that are not so long."
"It has also been claimed that nets that are 2.5 km in length could not be profitable."
"Yet this is just a generalized falsehood."
"You only have to go and check."
"And people did go and do just that - two boats were chartered by the Community in 1995-1996 - and checks were carried out - 60 to 70 inspections per season - and no infringements were found."
"Now we are being led to believe that these nets would be diabolically efficient, but do you know what percentage of tuna is fished using nets? Is it 80 %, 50 % or 25 %?"
"Not even that much, but less than 12 % of the total catch!"
"So what arguments are we now left with?"
"The resolution contains only one: the argument that driftnets are described as non-selective, and the bigger they are, the more this is true."
"But this argument completely ignores the study carried out by the IFREMER, which covered two seasons and included observers from five countries."
"The conclusion of this study was that the rate of selectivity is 85.8 %; in other words, it is one of the most selective methods of fishing."
"Finally, what would be the consequences if French tuna fishermen were to abandon this technique?"
"It would be a disaster as far as resources are concerned."
"In actual fact, these are fishing vessels that derive 50 % of their annual turnover from the tuna-fishing season."
"If they are denied this opportunity, they will have no alternative but to give up fishing for tuna, and carry out their winter occupation, which is trawl-fishing, all the year round. This would have an effect on species, such as the hake for example, which are very much at risk."
"Mr President, if it had been up to the European Parliament there would have been no need to ask this question because away back in 1994 we said that at the end of that year there should be a ban on drift nets."
"I would just remind you of our report."
"There is no need either for me to explain why we in this House object to what happens with drift nets."
"Mrs Langenhagen has described that in sufficient detail."
"The Italian drift nets in particular catch less than 20 percent of the total allowable catch of tuna and sword fish, the remaining 80 percent is by-catch."
"I do not need to explain how serious that is for the marine environment."
"Now the President-in-Office of the Council says that the Dutch presidency will do its best to discuss this proposal again, this proposal that was last discussed in the Council on 22 April."
"I would ask the Council to take seriously the Commission proposal, namely for a ban with effect from 1 January 1998."
"I wish to ask the President-in-Office of the Council when it will be put on the agenda and how the Presidency intends to prepare this for the coming Fisheries Council."
"Mr President, it is three years since the Commission presented its proposal on the banning of driftnets and the decision is still blocked within the Council."
"Although governments, such as the Italian government, are prepared to adopt measures to reduce the use of such nets, these initiatives are not sufficient from any point of view and there are Member States which have banned them, but until there is a generalized ban the situation will be exactly the same."
"It is argued that fleets from third countries are still using such nets."
"Let us not fool ourselves - until the European Union bans them it will be impossible to take action against third countries to persuade them to desist."
"Moreover, the European Union tries to excuse itself by carrying out monitoring operations, which do not basically affect the problem and which, furthermore, are exorbitantly expensive in relation to their effectiveness."
"There are weighty arguments for banning the use of driftnets."
"First reasons concerning the environment and the conservation of fish stocks."
"When these nets are used approximately 80 % of the catch is accidental which has an enormous impact on protected species."
"Banning such nets is fundamental, both for the sake of conservation of resources and the protection of endangered species."
"There are also reasons of an economic nature which militate in favour of banning these nets."
"They are not very selective, affect other fishing activities and place those fishing with selective methods at a distinct disadvantage."
"Let us make no mistake."
"These nets do not even benefit those using them."
"Some governments are turning this into a state issue, but that is another matter."
"The market situation, the low quality of the catches which these nets yield and the high investment and amounts for amortization make their use uneconomical."
"The fishermen indeed are the prisoners of the investments they have made."
"The reduced profits which these catches bring pushes the amounts for amortization up to excessive levels."
"Some governments ought then to deal decisively with the problem of conversion for the sake of their own fishermen and future generations."
"Fishing in the Community and throughout the whole world is facing an unprecedented crisis caused by the lack of resources and the problem of the market."
"Driftnets are an example of what should not be done in fisheries policy."
"The Council should be aware of that and solve this question once and for all."
"Here is a challenge and a great opportunity for the Netherlands Presidency."
"Mr President, like others, I too must express a certain disappointment at the reply from the President-in-Office of the Council, because I do not believe it can be said there is a lack of constructive proposals."
"The problem is that we have before us a 1994 Commission proposal, a series of positions taken by the European Parliament, but also a UN resolution."
"Given this situation we might have expected coherent decisions from the Council and action to obtain positive results from the Presidency-in-Office."
"Why are we asking for a total ban on the 'spadare' ?"
"The answer is that the 'spadare' is non-selective tackle, as has already been mentioned, and it is used not only in the Mediterranean, but also in the Atlantic. In particular it is used on French, English and Irish fishing vessels, although the practice has tended to decline in recent years."
"But there is no doubt that the greatest impact is occurring in the Mediterranean."
"This impact can be summarised as follows: according to the International Whaling Commission, the 'spadare' , so-called because it is used to catch swordfish, kills around 5000 dolphins and dozens of sperm whales every year."
"Furthermore, the target species, the swordfish, constitutes only 17-18 % of the catch, which demonstrates the non-selective nature of this type of fishing."
"Furthermore, according to the FAO, swordfish stocks are being overfished."
"This means that a decrease in fishing would involve an increase, by weight, in catches which currently comprise young fish which often have not reproduced."
"In the Mediterranean, the area at greatest risk, an Italian fleet is now operating and, perhaps increasingly, fleets from third countries."
"The only way to control these third countries is to state that the European Union no longer uses the 'spadare' and establish trading relations with third countries creating disincentives against using the 'spadare' ."
"That is the only credible solution."
"Either there are advantages to 2.5 kilometre net lengths or there are not."
"If there are advantages, the complaints are incomprehensible; if not there are two possibilities: either fishermen who say they use 2.5 kilometre nets are using longer ones, or they would benefit from a change in direction."
"So the only way to guarantee Italian fishermen an income and a future in fishing is to ban the 'spadare' completely, carry out a conversion process, use more selective methods that are less dangerous for the environment and cement relationships with third countries to ensure control of the use of the 'spadare' in that zone."
"Why, Mr President, are we resuming here today the debate on driftnets, when the only new scientific evidence confirms their selectivity, and when other types of fishing equipment are being developed that are highly questionable, such as the 'naveran' , for example?"
"Why is it that we are trying, at all costs, to stir up a controversy which has already been settled, to the best possible advantage to everyone?"
"The last two long-finned tuna fishing seasons in the North Atlantic have demonstrated the responsible behaviour of driftnet fishermen, who have been strictly observing the 2.5 km limits."
"This is proved by the very large number of national and Community inspections that have been carried out on French tuna fishing vessels."
"These two seasons have also shown that vessels can use both nets and lines at the same time, and that these two techniques have proved to be perfectly compatible."
"Finally, it has been proved that minimum profitability is possible within the framework of the 2.5 km limits."
"But let us not forget that, for many fishermen, accepting the 2.5 km limits represents a considerable sacrifice."
"Some of them have given up fishing, and there are also all those who naturally based their calculations regarding their vessels' capacity and their investments on the rules that were in force at the time, when the limit was 5 km."
"Dropping it to 2.5 km has placed an extremely heavy burden on them in the form of extra costs."
"This is not, therefore, the moment to give them the impression that the rules might be changed again."
"As far as driftnets are concerned, we must stop stirring things up for political reasons, and stop maintaining this climate of uncertainty and anxiety."
"What our fishermen need, on the contrary, is for the rules of the game to remain stable. They need a lasting regulatory framework if they are to be able to carry out their difficult occupation with the necessary degree of forward planning."
"What we have to do, Mr President, is very simple."
"First of all we must remember that the driftnet is a vital piece of working equipment for many fishing communities in Europe."
"We must then confirm the fact that there is a system of rules, and that there is one system that applies to everyone and to all fishing areas, and that that system is the 2.5 km limit."
"Even if this is harsh, at least it has the merit of being clear."
"Finally, we must also make sure that everyone is scrupulous in applying it, both third countries and, of course, the Member States concerned, all of whom should send out an inspection vessel during the next season."
"It is by doing this, Mr President, and not by fanning the flames, that we shall avoid a return to past conflicts, which are harmful to everyone, and it is in this way that a lasting peace will be brought to our fishing grounds."
"It is in this direction, Mr President, that our parliamentary group would like to see the Council, in its wisdom, proceed."
"Mr President, we are conducting an old debate here, since it goes back to 1994, when Carmen Fraga - who is to swordfish and tuna what Astrid Lulling is to honey or what I myself am to vines - the passionate advocate of the swordfish, first brought up this subject, this problem of the conflict between net and line."
"At the time, the Commission proposed a ban, but a ban that would come into force after a period of four years."
"This period will come to an end at the end of December 1997. Carmen Fraga Estévez herself wanted an immediate ban, with no variations, though as it turned out there would have been some variations - an immediate ban except for the Baltic (why the Baltic?) and for territorial waters, but it is true that, as far as the twelve-mile limits were concerned, the coastal State would have sovereignty."
"This is a problem of a Hegelian nature."
"It is a dialectical problem, because the good and the bad are not only on one side."
"It is true that there are opposing economic arguments: the hundreds of Spanish fishermen, who are, moreover, Carmen Fraga's voters, and the Italians."
"We went, with Mrs Péry, to Palermo, where 500 Italian fishing vessels are involved."
"On the other hand there is the question of financial equilibrium - Mr d'Aboville, or the Mayor of Luçon, was talking about this just now - the financial equilibrium of the sixty fishing undertakings, or the sixty vessels, of the Isle of Yeu, and all the problems that would arise from having to convert the fishing fleets."
"Mr Baldarelli mentioned this a few minutes ago."
"And then there are the ecological arguments, the real walls round the Atlantic - 20 km in the case of Italy - against which everything is battering, just like in the days of the Second World War!"
"The turtles, the dolphins, would die!"
"If we look at the real situation, the actual wastage, if I may call it that, is only 2 %, though I admit that that is already too much."
"I should like to remind you of what the fishermen of Sicily said to us."
"When we went to see them, they told us that, although they understood what was happening to the dolphins, they were themselves under threat of extinction."
"Father and son, they have always fished for a living."
"The little dolphins were at risk of disappearing, but then so were the little fishermen!"
"They also pointed out that the Koreans and the Japanese were not affected by the ban."
"But will the dolphins make a distinction between a Korean net, a Japanese net and an Italian net?"
"This poses a problem."
"There is also the risk of intensive fishing."
"I think that Mr d'Aboville said just now, for heaven's sake, that it was something like 12 % of the catch."
"The Commission, in its wisdom - which is rare, and therefore worthy of comment - has finally, for once, arrived at a sort of compromise, which originated with the United Nations, and which the UNO itself adopted in 1989: a 2.5 km net instead of a 5 km net."
"It involved cutting the net in two, if I can put it like that."
"One net, one piece of fishing gear."
"But with all the risks that this involved, all the problems of damage to nets, and the time it takes to change a net, this could mean losing at least one day's fishing, if not more."
"I thought that with this compromise we had managed to put an end to the psychodrama, the neurosis, about fishing nets in the Bay of Biscay. And it was all being done under supervision - eight inspectors to keep watch over the long-finned tuna, eight EEC inspectors!"
"If British cows had had as many inspectors as tuna fish, we would probably not have had that other drama."
"So, the tuna war will not take place, because, and Mrs Fraga will understand what I am saying, we should stick with the 2.5 km limit."
"This is a compromise, and it will enable us to restore peace to the troubled waters of the Bay of Biscay."
"Mr President, the key word in this question is 'balance' ."
"We must try in the first place to find a fair balance between viable fishing activity on the part of the Community fleet and the conservation of resources."
"Despite what some French colleagues have said, the fall in the number of scombroid species in the Bay of Biscay is alarming and it is a result of the use of these very nets."
"Balance means in the second place equal treatment for all."
"Driftnets have been banned for Spanish and Portuguese fishermen since the 1986 Treaty of Accession."
"Fishermen from other countries use nets up to 2.5 kilometres long and in the Bay of Biscay nets up to 25 kilometres are allowed."
"We ask that the use of driftnets be banned in general, irrespective of area."
"We also ask the Council to tackle the question directly, to take a decision on the banning of the nets and at the same time to settle what amounts of compensation would be appropriate."
"We should also like to call attention to the paradox involved in importing into the Union large quantities of fish caught by foreign fleets using these nets."
"Could we be selective in our imports so that we put the brake on driftnets not only for our own fleets and our own waters?"
"Finally, Mr President, during the transitional period the Commission should ensure there is more monitoring."
"Although they are not sufficient, the two vessels chartered by the Commission and other measures taken with regard to fishing for tuna in coastal waters were decisive in reducing tension and avoiding the sad events of 1994."
"Mr President, the reply from the Presidency of the Council could not have been more misleading."
"It gave no indication that things would move any faster."
"We get the impression that this proposal will still be excluded from the agenda or systematically blocked within the Council."
"And that we find disconcerting, as is the obstinacy of some Member States, because the only thing which the stepping up of monitoring over the past few years by the Member States and the Commission has shown is that driftnets of the regulation length are not economically viable; some Member States' fleets have stopped using them and where they are still used it is thanks to aids granted by some Member States."
"These are fishing techniques which, when all is said and done, are ecologically harmful, uneconomical - within the letter of the law - and which, moreover, in the present situation for some Member States actually cause commercial disputes with third countries."
"I the circumstances the Netherlands Presidency has a golden opportunity to settle this question which cannot simply be left to one side in the general revision of technical measures."
"It would be absurd if, in a situation where there was over-capacity when the new multi-annual guidelines were being discussed, we were to continue to allow the use of non-selective fishing techniques."
"The amendments proposed by Parliament might provide the flexibility needed to achieve the requisite majority in the Council - so that could not of course be the Commission's original proposal."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I urge you to include this question in the agenda of this Council and to establish the necessary contacts and talks to make it possible to achieve agreement there on a solution which would constitute a step forward in the development of a responsible and sustainable common policy."
"Mr President, we are against the proposal for an immediate ban on driftnets in the Mediterranean because it would only hit Community fishermen, while third countries' vessels would continue to fish without rules or controls."
"No-one would argue that driftnets are harmless or have no impact on resources, but it is obvious that immediate abolition would not only fail to produce the desired results, but would look like discrimination to the fishermen and have serious consequences on jobs."
"The consequences would be especially serious for Italy, bearing in mind that this activity goes on almost exclusively in the Objective 1 area, and public order problems cannot be ruled out."
"Italy itself is now demonstrating willingness to find a solution."
"A 'spadare' plan has been drawn up, the fruit of an agreement between the government and the organizations in the sector, and providing for financial participation by the Community."
"The Commission's proposal for financial support has already been analysed and judged favourably, at the Council of Fisheries Ministers last December."
"But the fishing vessels are being fitted out to start the fishing season even now."
"So the Community must give a clear signal of its determination to resolve the issue of Italian driftnets positively, so that the fishermen and shipowners do not find themselves, yet again, starting the season in an uncertain and precarious atmosphere."
"The commitment we are seeking from the Council, Mr President, is to adopt the support measures to the Italian plan as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the extraordinary situation which justifies not only recourse to the FIFG but also access to other Community funds where the quotas intended for Italy are not fully used."
"Mr President, as some previous speakers have said, the Council's answer seems to me to be far from sufficient on this problem of fishing with driftnets."
"I am referring only to the problem seen in the Mediterranean and the specific harm which such fishing with driftnets causes for the fishermen, to be precise in the Balearic Islands, which suffer the damage occasioned by the presence of over 500 Italian vessels fishing with driftnets."
"It has often been said that the Mediterranean is an ailing sea, a sea with problems concerning the conservation of species."
"The conservation of these species depends on the use of fishing techniques which are as selective as possible and driftnets can never be a selective system of fishing."
"I have approached the Commission on several occasions concerning the harm being done in the Balearic Islands by this type of fishing."
"It has been indicated and stated that the date for prohibition would be December 1997 at the latest."
"I cannot see at the moment that the Council is intending to meet these deadlines envisaged, which will do serious harm to some Community fishermen."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the words of the President-in-office of the Council really are misleading."
"Previous speakers have mentioned this and I must repeat it."
"We were hoping for much more from the Presidency of the Council and still more from the Netherlands Presidency."
"The current impasse in which the legislation on driftnets finds itself is simply untenable."
"It has been said here that the Commission asked for these nets to be discontinued from the end of this year - Parliament has repeated it on many occasions - and it appears, ladies and gentlemen, that we are going to have to keep on repeating it."
"Allowing time to go by without solving this problem makes the situation worse, detracts from the credibility of the Community institutions and leads to undesirable situations, such as the present situation in Italy where there is pressure from North America, as mentioned here also."
"A new fishing year will be opening soon bringing with it the risk of confrontation between Community fleets and the deployment of costly patrol and monitoring measures which could be avoided, since the problem is none other than the manifest incompatibility between fishing methods, as has been mentioned here; on the one hand the traditional and selective methods which respect the environment and on the other the destructive driftnets."
"It is known that nets of 2.5 kilometres are not profitable."
"The same course which the Italian government has taken for conversion by means of the corresponding aids should be pursued for the Atlantic and those Member States still using it, thus settling the problem which keeps the fishermen on tenterhooks and each year costs the Community budget dearly."
"The new situation in the Mediterranean, Mr President, the proposed exclusion of the Baltic should make it possible to obtain a better majority in the Council to break the deadlock on this problem finally as Parliament has requested."
"It is the Council which is in a position to solve the problem."
"I might say that the Netherlands Presidency could not be in a better position to achieve this historic political success, since it is not directly involved."
"We therefore request the Council to show political responsibility and coherence."
"Since we were not satisfied with what the Council said, and I think most Members agree with me, we ask them not to give up until these 'walls of death' have been totally eradicated."
"Mr President, firstly, I wish to take the opportunity during this debate on fisheries to refer to an incident off the south-west coast of Ireland on Sunday last on a bright, sunny day, with calm seas and good visibility."
"The incident involved the 16-metre Irish vessel, Exodus , and the 33-metre British vessel, the Seahorse , crewed by Spaniards and Portuguese."
"An inquiry is under way by the Irish authorities."
"I suggest to the House that the Commission keep itself fully informed of developments relating to the inquiry and that it keeps the Committee on Fisheries fully informed."
"I hope that we will have an opportunity to debate the outcome of the inquiry at a later stage."
"I call on Parliament to send its condolences to the relations of skipper Danny O'Driscoll who died as a result of this incident and, indeed, to the community of Castletownbear."
"I, for one, am not disappointed at the response from the Council as the Council is being realistic in relation to the driftnet issue."
"If it is intended to ban driftnets, then logic would suggest a ban on beam trawling or indeed any other method of fishing deemed to be deleterious to the environment."
"Since a reduction of the limits to 2.5 km, there has been a 66 % fall in tuna landings in my country."
"There has been no economic analysis or consultation with the industry and scientists have never recommended a ban on driftnetting."
"Mr President, I too want to sympathize with the relatives of the fisherman who was drowned off the south coast of Ireland in a collision which took place on Sunday."
"I want to refer to the question by Mr Arias and to say that I admire his tenacity and that of Mrs Fraga on this question."
"But obviously there are two sides to it."
"Most of the public sentiment surrounding the whole question of driftnet fishing comes from experiences in the Pacific, where everything is entirely different, where the tuna fish swim close to dolphins and where driftnets do cause a loss of other sea life besides what they are intended to catch."
"In the Pacific, also, nets are 40-50 km in length and that is an entirely different situation from what we have in the Atlantic."
"We should remember that a net 2 1/2 km long spans a distance of about 1, 500 metres when deployed in the Atlantic."
"It is a fairly insignificant length of net in that situation."
"We should remember we are not dealing with the Atlantic."
"What I want to say is that we should try to find a solution."
"There are two problems, but what we have here is mainly a conflict of interests between the French, on the one hand, who use long liners, and the Spanish, on the other."
"What I would suggest is that if we as a Community decide that nets may not be used, then the people who are prevented from engaging in the legitimate practice of catching tuna fish with nets should get compensation."
"A sensible solution would be that if the French and the Irish and British are forced out because their system of fishing is unacceptable, then obviously the Spanish fleets will catch more fish and they could concede to the Irish and the British and the French other quotas of similar value and everybody would be happy."
"The tuna would be caught in the way that is acceptable to us and the French and Irish and British would not have to sustain any losses."
"That is an obvious solution: either financial compensation or compensation in some other form."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"It is reasonable and necessary to increase production in the fisheries sector, always provided that is accompanied by increased selectivity."
"Driftnets to not achieve that selectivity, but rather pose a threat to the resources/production ratio mentioned previously."
"To give an example: just imagine that if the 400 Basque and Gallician vessels were to use those nets the stocks of scombroid species in the Bay of Biscay would be wiped out forthwith."
"Something must therefore be done."
"I should like to put a specific proposal to the Netherlands Presidency: the Presidency of the Council could spearhead an agreement between the Member States for the final solution of this problem."
"You, Mr President of the Council, mentioned the consideration of initiatives to achieve voting by qualified majority in the Council."
"Consider the possibility of excluding the Baltic from that initiative, laying down the definitive ban on these nets from 31 December 1997."
"And try to associate States such as Italy with this initiative - Italy's Minister for Fisheries, Mr Pinto, said in Venice on 29 November last year that he was in favour of taking these nets out of the Mediterranean, in exchange for the compensatory measures which you have mentioned as a socioeconomic alternative."
"The Member States which might oppose these measures - the United Kingdom, France and Ireland - do not constitute a minority sufficient to block the procedure."
"But they could join forces with a majority with an alternative plan for conversion from driftnets in the Atlantic - a plan financed from the FIFG which could in the course of 1997 and 1998 finance: first the cost of the investment already made in driftnets; secondly training for fishermen in more selective methods of fishing for the same species - tuna; thirdly the investment needed for conversion."
"Please try to convince governments such as the British government that during the last fishing year it spent six hundred thousand pounds to monitor fisheries activities which brought in only four hundred thousand pounds from catches by only five vessels."
"This is one alternative - the other is to carry on with an unresolved environmental problem, a latent conflict in Community waters, vast Commission expenditure, gaps in the legislation described annually in the Commission reports and finally the threat of commercial sanctions by the United States which will adversely affect the entire Community market unless the Italian problem is solved."
"The ball is in the court of the Netherlands Presidency."
"As we just heard, Mr Imaz San Miguel has given the President-in-Office the floor."
"I imagine Minister Patijn wishes to reply, as several Members have criticized his earlier speech."
"The Dutch presidency, and the Dutch in general, are well known for knowing their way about water."
"Unfortunately I have not yet learned the art of walking on water."
"That is the kind of skill expected when it comes to reaching a Council decision on the Commission proposal of April 1994."
"With the best will in the world the Council has been unable to produce a qualified majority on the basis of the Commission's current proposal."
"You may regret that, but that is the political reality and it also means that no legally valid decision can be taken on the basis of the Treaty on European Union, which is the constitution of our community."
"But there are two ways of producing that result."
"Either the Commission amends its proposal so that a number of Member States currently against it can change tack, but I fear that the Commission is unlikely to do so because it would then have to come here and explain to you why it has amended its proposal and would then be subject to the same kind of criticism as the Council presidency, or the Council presidency tries to overrule the Commission with its own compromise proposal, but that requires unanimity and that is quite out of the question."
"You have encouraged us to do everything in our power to bring the Commission proposal of April 1994 to a successful conclusion."
"If we see a chance to do so we shall take it, but the Dutch cannot walk on water."
"The other track, even if this is apparently blocked at the moment for political reasons, is to act, for example, on the basis of the Italian government's proposals to work through structural measures aimed at the fishing communities in Italy to phase out the use of drift nets by these communities and encourage them to switch to other techniques or other economic activities."
"There is a Commission proposal from December last year, I believe, which invites the European Parliament for an opinion and I would urge you not to block this second track and to produce your opinion as quickly as possible so that something can be done which might produce a tangible effect in the Mediterranean."
"Preserving the marine environment is a Council priority, but in realistic terms of everyday politics it will have to be balanced at all events against economic and regional interests."
"If we win that one there will be a decision in the Council, but if the diversity of the Community is such that no agreement can be reached then you are left without a decision and I unfortunately must say that at the moment that is what it looks like - unless you can give the Commission some political margin for manoeuvre to amend its proposal so that a majority in the Council can accept it."
"We cannot continue the debate, Mr Eisma, because we have another item on the agenda."
"But what exactly was your point?"
"Does the Commission share the wish expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council to amend the Commission proposal?"
"Mr President, on behalf of Commissioner Bonino, I should like to stress that the Commission certainly also regrets the fact that no progress has been made on this matter in the Council."
"As we have heard, the Commission's proposal has been pending there since 1994 and, according to the information I have received, the Commission has repeatedly indicated to the Council that it is in favour of a compromise being reached which could secure a qualified majority."
"I can only reiterate what I gather has already been said a number of times, namely that we are in favour of a solution being found which takes account of the economic interests of the fleets in question and of the relevant environmental considerations."
"On a point of order, Mr President, I do not consider that the Commission has answered the question put by the previous speaker and I would ask if the Commission could indicate soon whether in fact it is thinking of playing an active role in the drafting of a new proposal."
"Fishing off the coasts of Angola and Guinea"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"(A4-0013/97) by Mr Cunha, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council Regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining, for the period from 3 May 1966 to 2 May 1999, the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Angola on fishing off the coast of Angola (COM(96)0323 - C4-0475/96-96/0176(CNS)); -(A4-0385/96) by Mr Macartney, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol establishing, for the period 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1997, the fishing rights and financial compensation provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of Guinea on fishing off the Guinean coast (COM(96)0111 - C4-0270/96-96/0084(CNS))."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, since 1987 the European Union has had Fishing Agreements with Angola. First of all, a three-year Agreement and since then the Agreements have been renewed every two years."
"The current Agreement which is valid from May 1996 to May 1997, covers the fishing fleets of five Member States - Spain, Portugal, France, Germany and the Netherlands - and includes a considerable enlargement of the possibilities of fishing off those coasts."
"It maintains catch levels for prawns and shrimps - species of extremely high value, and substantially increases fishing opportunities for bottom long and surface longliners, specialising is sea bass and other demersal species and including for the first time pelagic fishing for horse mackerel and Atlantic mackerel."
"This Agreement costs a total of 40 million ECU, which is a considerable increase over the previous Agreement, which cost only 18.5 million ECU."
"There are three fundamental reasons for this increase, the first, the most important one, is the increase in the period of duration of the Agreement which has gone up from two to three years; the second reason is a considerable increase in the possibilities for fishing given to the Community's fleet; the third reason is the updating of the cost of compensating the Angolan State, which had not been updated since 1992."
"I should like to emphasise the fact that this Agreement is also innovative in other areas, in particular in that it very much respects the principle of conservation of fish resources, allowing for the possibility of declaring biological rest periods on the basis of scientific data calling for them. It also sets maximum capture limits on the more sensitive species such as shrimps and prawns."
"On the other hand, I should like to emphasise the fact that although this Fishing Agreement - as is the case of all fishing agreements - is a commercial agreement, it also respects the principles of co-operation and development, in particular because it finances activities such as scientific research into fish resources, bursaries, the promotion of the local fishing fleet, and it also increases from three to five the number of sailors who can sail on Community ships, in addition to providing for vocational training for those same sailors."
"Our conclusion, as rapporteur, is that this is a positive Agreement for both sides: for the European Union and for Angola."
"It is also positive because it increases from two to three years the duration period, which should give shipowners risking their capital some stability."
"Finally, I should like to draw the attention of the European Parliament and the Commission to the habitual delays in consulting the European Parliament, something which is now part of our history!"
"I should just like to point out that this Agreement was signed by the Commission with Angola on 2 May 1996 and that the European Parliament was only consulted for its opinion on 12 September 1996."
"This is really very strange!"
"On 12 September, in other words just a fortnight before the deadline for paying the first amount due under the Agreement."
"This is a sign that something is not working quite right here."
"The rapporteur notes that, in fact, in order for the institutions to be properly respected, we really must change the administrative and political machinery so that the European Parliament can be consulted within a reasonable length of time and so that its opinion can really have an effective influence on the decision-making process."
"I do not think that this is asking too much."
"Mr President, I would echo some of the points which my colleague, Mr Cunha, has made."
"But let me say that in approaching the discussions on this issue, I first of all took what seems to be the rather unusual step of consulting the Embassy of the Republic of Guinea and tried to get their input into the report."
"I commend this to others who find themselves in the same position because they very much appreciated that we were talking to them to get their opinions."
"The agreement was already reached so that no aspect of it could be called into question."
"But they made some comments to me on behalf of the Guinean Government, which I was able to incorporate in the report."
"First of all, it has to be said that Guinea is desperately dependent on revenue from agreements like this for its ordinary governmental functions."
"So they have a rather weak position because they are so dependent on the EU for revenue."
"Nevertheless, within the agreement there are some new developments which show exciting possibilities for using these agreements towards the development end of the spectrum."
"We often talk about the dilemma of whether these agreements should be trade agreements or development instruments."
"Parliament has repeatedly said we should move more and more towards seeing them as development instruments."
"Mr Crampton has made this point in his own contribution to Parliament, as have many others."
"So it is good to see that the Guinean agreement begins to move in that direction."
"For example, there are for the first time specific grants for scientific research and for study and training built into the agreement as well as the amounts of aid offered for general revenue, some of which will find its way - this is always the defence of this kind of system - through the priorities of the relevant government to schools, clinics and development of that nature. So we should not rule out that aspect at all."
"However, the potential for these agreements is enormous."
"A country like Guinea, which is one of the poorer countries of Africa, has a great potential if it can achieve stability, which I think it has now achieved despite the instability in the region, if it can exploit the economic zone which it possesses."
"This is a problem because it faces invasion by foreign boats."
"I am not talking about EU boats - at least we have an agreement which regulates that - but a number of fleets from elsewhere, particularly from Asia which have been found in violation of the territorial waters of the Republic of Guinea."
"Guinea is, at the moment, very vulnerable."
"We really have to look, as the EU, at that problem and look towards a regional solution right along the West African coast."
"This, I know, would be welcomed by most of the countries in Africa with which we have agreements."
"They feel vulnerable to blandishments or the simple invasion of boats from parts of the world other than the EU."
"In 1958 Guinea became famous in Africa because when De Gaulle said to the French colonies 'Do you accept the new French Union of all the colonies?' , they all said 'oui' but Guinea said 'non' ."
"And the famous 'non' of Sekou Touré was met with a whole lot of reprisals from the French."
"Guinea suffered quite severely for standing up for its principles and becoming independent."
"Ironically, two years later, all the other colonies which had said 'oui' were also being given their independence, no questions asked, and a lot of aid."
"I have a lot of admiration for the Guineans for standing up for independence but they have a backlog from that period to cope with. So, as we approach countries like Guinea, we should be generous in our interpretation."
"In conclusion, I should like to say a few words about the comments from the other committees of Parliament."
"The Committee on Budgets is absolutely right on its procedural points."
"Every time this Parliament makes the same point saying: ' we want to be concerned and consulted before the agreement takes effect' , and every time it is ignored."
"Mrs Jöns has made the point very precisely and I would support all her arguments."
"Likewise the Committee on Development and Cooperation, as I mentioned, made absolutely the right point in saying that these agreements should be seen as tools of development."
"These agreements are important."
"We take them seriously in Parliament."
"I wish, however, that we could get the Council and the Commission to build us into the procedure in a more effective way so we could really feel part of that process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, and I should like to emphasize the following points. As the previous speaker has already said, we are dealing here with agreements that were initialled in December 1995 and May 1996."
"The history of these two agreements proves yet again how important it was that we should finally improve the procedure for keeping this House informed and involving it in the concluding of international fishery agreements."
"I hope, in any case, that the kind of evasive tactics demonstrated by part of the budgetary authority will now be a thing of the past."
"The code of conduct that we adopted along with the 1997 budget was intended to ensure that this would be the case."
"Not to be consulted until five (and in the other case four) months after the initialling of the agreement is bad enough!"
"But for the Council to go on to decide that the agreements should be provisionally implemented, and for the Commission then to pay out not inconsiderable sums of money to Guinea and Angola, namely ECU 2.7 million in one case and in the other case as much as ECU 13.5 million, without having consulted our opinion, that really is too much!"
"In other words, the Commission, as it generally has done in recent years, took the Council's decision on provisional implementation as a sufficient legal basis for paying out the first tranche."
"One might almost be forgiven for thinking that our opinion counts for nothing any more!"
"Therefore I would ask the Council and the Commission - and I am sorry that the Council representative is no longer here - that in future negotiations on fishery agreements they should observe the code of conduct, and when concluding an agreement they should inform both the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Budgets regarding the progress of the negotiations and the financial consequences."
"This is what we agreed jointly - and I emphasize the word jointly - in the code of conduct."
"The code of conduct also lays down that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament should do everything possible to ensure that the procedures involved in the legislative process are carried out as rapidly as possible."
"But this also means - and I would ask the Commission to take particular notice of this - that the Commission should begin its negotiations with non-member countries in good time, so as to leave enough time for the rest of the process to proceed properly."
"It would be nice if these requests did not have to be repeated, rather like a prayerwheel, every two years!"
"Mr President, one of the key characteristics of the global fishing situation at the moment is that stocks worldwide are heavily depleted."
"We have to ask ourselves why that is the case."
"One of the major items which has always been identified with that stock depletion is the overcapitalization of the global fishing fleet."
"One of the reasons for that overcapitalization is the vast sums spent by national governments on subsidizing longdistance fishing industries."
"That in itself means that there is a race to fish in order to make enough money to service that capital, that agreements are made with different countries in order to move fishing volume away from home waters into other EEZs elsewhere around the world."
"That is exactly what international fishing agreements, as concluded by the European Union, are all about."
"It is that subsidy that has caused the overcapacity that has led to the depletion of stocks."
"It is a cycle that has to end in order to protect fish stocks for fishermen for the longterm future."
"That is why the Liberal Group in this Parliament is the only one that is actually facing reality and saying that the public subsidization of fishing agreements has to stop."
"That is why within both these agreements we are tabling amendments that say that the fishing fleets, the vessels and the owners themselves who benefit from these agreements should pay the full cost of these agreements, and that they should no longer rest on the taxpayers of the EU - not because that is bad in itself but because through subsidy we have overcapitalization and continued depletion of stocks."
"I ask this Parliament to support those amendments to ensure that we safeguard our fish stocks and fishing communities for the future."
"Mr President, this opinion is just once again a pro forma, a formal intervention in the legislative process on an Agreement which has already been carried out."
"Against this background, it is no surprise that the European Parliament should be less and less happy with international fishing agreements."
"This is an institutional problem but it is also a procedural one, a methodical problem, given that the Commission systematically confronts the European Parliament with a fait accompli."
"It is important that this should not penalise fishermen and other people connected with the industry, who depend on this vital aspect of fishing policy: international fisheries agreements."
"An approach to these Agreements which is solely based on cost benefit is reductive, limiting, equivocal; what it is aimed at is ending the so-called international fisheries agreements."
"Against such a tide, I should say that this is a good Agreement - I am talking about the Agreement with Angola, for both the European Union and for Angola itself."
"Let us hope that the shipowners and Community fishermen using it can benefit in full from the fisheries opportunities which have already been negotiated."
"Mr President, I agree with a lot that has been said about the lack of consultation with this Parliament and I hope that the Commissioner present will take that back to the Commission."
"We need to be fully involved in the presentation of these fishing agreements right from the start."
"Like Mr Mccartney, I went to the Angolan Fishing Ministry and talked to them and they were dreadfully concerned."
"They were going to sign the agreement because they needed the money."
"I do not think that these developing countries, especially countries that have gone through such a tragedy as Angola, should be forced into that position."
"But they need the money and they were saying quite clearly they do not think they will be able to monitor this agreement."
"They will not be able to monitor 1, 500 km of coastline with seven outdated boats and no airplanes."
"So we ought to help them."
"We ought to help these developing countries."
"Our fishing agreements ought to be coherent with our development policy."
"This is the theme, or one of the major themes, of the report I shall produce for this Parliament in May."
"I have to stress this."
"We have a responsibility all of us, particularly to the developing world, and particularly to countries which were our colonies in the past to whom we have not shown the respect they deserve."
"We need to help them develop their own fishing industries so that in the long run - and I emphasize the long run because it will be the long run - they are able to export their own fishing products and get the added value of their fishing industries for their own development."
"Mr President, I welcome the renewal of the fisheries agreements with Angola and Guinea, because they benefit European fishermen and consumers and also help Angola and Guinea who thus receive a significant source of income."
"The mutual benefit is assured by making fishing by local and European fleets complementary activities."
"The cooperation agreements with both countries have also been strengthened, as mentioned here, as have aids to the fisheries sector in the form of technical programmes and practical occupational training, for example."
"This, it seems to me, is a question of a few balanced and fair protocols entailing a cost for the European Union which is reasonable."
"The ACP countries must also be helped of course with monitoring measures in their waters in order to conserve stocks and also to drive out those factory ships fishing illegally."
"We must deplore, as we so often need to, the fact that the Commission and the Council relegate the Parliament to a very marginal role beneath its station in budgetary matters."
"The information submitted to us by the Commission is normally very scant and consultation of Parliament - which is one of the budgetary organs - scarcely takes place; everything arrives late, wrong and when the agreements have already come into force."
"I think the European Parliament should act, but extremely carefully if it wants to kick the Council and the Commission into action, for fear of accidentally kicking our own fishermen in the process."
"And we must stamp out the image which some people with a bad conscience have of these fisheries agreements with the ACP countries; they are not agreements which harm the population nor do they threaten the local fisheries sector."
"The European Union pays a fair amount of financial compensation and the agreements are beneficial for the development of those countries and at the same time keep our fishermen in employment."
"Mr President, the Commission would firstly like to thank the rapporteurs for these two excellent reports concerning fisheries agreements."
"As regards the new protocol to the fisheries agreement with Angola, it should be pointed out that this creates increased scope for a variety of fishing activities."
"Also, the fishing opportunities for shrimps and prawns are maintained and a new type of fishery is included - pelagic fishing - which opens up the agreement to other EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands."
"It should be emphasized that the agreement's period of validity has been extended from two to three years, and this longer timescale will provided more stable conditions for Community shipowners."
"For the first time, the annex to the protocol allows the Angolan authorities to introduce a biological recovery period."
"The financial compensation has been increased to take account of the new fishing opportunities created by the agreement."
"As regards Amendments Nos 1 and 3, the Commission agrees with the sentiment they express, but is unable to endorse them."
"The Commission already ensures that information is provided in an appropriate way on implementation of the agreements, in particular at the meetings of the Committee on Fisheries and prior to each meeting."
"Nor can the Commission accept Amendment No 2, since when the interinstitutional agreement was negotiated, only the Mediterranean financial protocols were included in the classification as non-compulsory expenditure."
"The other agreements were excluded, such as those on fisheries."
"The Commission cannot approve Amendment No 4, since the Council lays down negotiating directives individually for each agreement, but not when every protocol is renewed."
"When the Commission negotiates these protocol renewals, it ensures that the directives it was given by the Council are respected."
"Turning to the fisheries agreement with Guinea, the Commission believes that the new conditions for fishing by the Community fleet in Guinean waters can ensure that the agreement is implemented more effectively, while observing the fundamental requirement that fishery resources should be conserved."
"Through this new protocol, the Commission and the Guinean authorities have sought to encourage EU vessels to return to Guinean waters, a return which was started under the previous protocol, and to provide Guinea with resources that will enable the country to improve the supervision of its fishing zone and combat illegal fishing."
"The technical and financial provisions of the protocol have this dual aim, and this applies in particular to the provision concerning the special financial contribution for fisheries surveillance bodies."
"As for the amendments which have been tabled, the Commission cannot endorse the four amendments, since the first three fail to make a clear distinction between the aims, the thinking and the procedures which are specific to the fisheries agreements with the ACP countries and those which are specific to the European Development Fund."
"It must also be considered that even if the outcomes which the Commission is aiming at in the negotiations on fisheries agreements are of a commercial nature, in the sense that a balance is being sought in the concessions made on each side, these outcomes respect and are in keeping with the measures being applied as part of development policy."
"On Amendment No 4, the Commission would point out that the protocol does not impose an obligation on Guinea to submit a report on the detailed use of the sum referred to in Article 6."
"However, the Commission will make enquiries of the Guinean authorities as to how this sum is used, and will then pass on the information to the European Parliament in an appropriate way as part of the current information procedures."
"In conclusion, I should like to say that I will of course ensure that the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Bonino, is made aware of the fact that Parliament wishes to be involved in the process at an earlier stage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for the late hour, but I felt that I should tell the Commissioner that I am deeply disappointed with the response that she has given to our very modest proposals for amendments."
"I must say here, before the European Parliament, that the Commission has not given the slightest signal of changing a perfectly ridiculous situation which is insulting to the European Parliament when it comes to Fisheries Agreements."
"As far as Amendment No 3 is concerned, calling on the Commission to present us with a progress report in the last year of an Agreement's duration, the Commission does not even seem willing to approve such a suggestion."
"Quite frankly, we are being messed around!"
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"(The sitting was closed at midnight)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of yesterday's sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I have come into possession of a letter you wrote to a Secretary of State in England, Mr Howard, indicating that you did not approve of a meeting with Roisín McAliskey in Holloway Prison; that it was not an official delegation."
"It was not intended to be an official delegation."
"What was intended was that a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs should visit Roisín McAliskey."
"This delegation would not contain Irish or British Members."
"On a humanitarian basis, I want to ask you why you wrote this letter to Mr Howard."
"On what authority?"
"Under what rule or regulation did you write the letter?"
"If you, at the beginning of your presidency, are going to behave towards Hedy d'Ancona, a distinguished parliamentarian for many years, and the other Members of the European Parliament in this fashion, it seems to me that your presidency will fail almost instantly."
"When I saw this letter to Mr Howard, I have to say I was absolutely horrified and so were other Members of the European Parliament to whom I showed it."
"Mr President, would you please indicate to the House on what basis and why you wrote this letter cancelling the visit by Hedy d'Ancona and other Members of the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs?"
"I am very happy to respond, Mr Andrews."
"Pursuant to Rule 24 of the Rules of Procedure, the Conference of Presidents is the body responsible for all political relations of the committees of this Parliament."
"It is therefore standard practice for a committee seeking authorization for a visit, to approach the Conference of Presidents, and the Conference of Presidents will either grant it or not."
"So my letter was sent with the knowledge of the Conference of Presidents, to make clear that it was not a committee delegation authorized under the Rules of Procedure."
"I have to comply with the Rules, whether I like it or not."
"If you do not agree with this procedure, the simple remedy is to change the Rules of Procedure and dispense with the powers of the Conference of Presidents, and then every committee will be able to send as many delegations or groups as it likes."
"What is not possible, Mr Andrews, is for a Committee to skip the authorization and send three members, giving the public impression that the committee has sent a delegation."
"I was told it was not a committee delegation in a letter from the chairman, Mrs D'Ancona, and I merely informed the government of the Member State that it was not a committee delegation."
"I did this precisely because there was confusion in the media."
"And if, when I ask the chairman of the committee for the relevant information, I am told that it is not a delegation from her committee, that is what I tell the British government."
"Because it is important that there should be no ambiguity."
"Mr President, given that we use all customary respect in our dealings with one another, I think that the proper procedure, before you write a letter to the British minister telling him that this is not an official delegation, would be to inform the Committee chairman, namely myself, beforehand."
"I do not think this is a very nice way of doing things!"
"Mrs D'Ancona, I would remind you that I asked you for information on the matter, and you told me in a letter that it was not a delegation from your committee."
"When I saw that the press was describing it as a delegation, then, with the knowledge of the Conference of Presidents, I merely conveyed what you told me in your letter to the British government."
"I could not say that a delegation was not being sent and then leave things ambiguous."
"I could not do that, because under our Rules of Procedure the Conference of Presidents must have control over relations of bodies of this Parliament which might have a political impact."
"That is all I did, and I believe the Conference of Presidents, which I informed, was fully in agreement on the need to remind all Parliament's committees that, when they want to send delegations, they should communicate that and ask for proper authorization."
"And if they do not, they are not delegations and we must make that known."
"Mr President, I know how important it is for a lawyer and a President of this Parliament to respect rules."
"However we are talking here about the will of the various groups in Parliament who wished a delegation to go."
"If you get a proper request for an official delegation, can you assure us that you will assent to such a request in view of the particular concerns of Members of this Parliament on humanitarian grounds?"
"There is nothing unusual about parliamentarians visiting this prisoner."
"Many Irish parliamentarians have already visited her."
"I think it would be symbolic and possibly helpful if you were to assent to such a request."
"Mrs Malone, I have said this twice, but I will happily say it a third time. It is not my responsibility, it is the responsibility of the Conference of Presidents."
"You must put this question to the Conference of Presidents."
"Any Member may visit any prison on his own behalf whenever he wants, and be admitted."
"On his own behalf."
"As a Member."
"He does not need authorization from this Parliament or from the Conference of Presidents."
"A delegation of Members on behalf of a committee or delegation must have permission from the Conference of Presidents."
"I cannot give it, I have to put the request formally to the Conference of Presidents. I cannot do anything else."
"Mr President, I would like to pick up a comment of Mr Andrews."
"He stated that you had written a letter to..."
"Not another word on the matter."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am very sorry, but we cannot have a debate on it."
"Mr President, I wish to deal with another matter which comes under your authority, namely the use of the Chamber and the premises associated with it."
"In the corridor I noticed a display of photographs of personalities, some of whom are called famous, one or two of whom I would call infamous and one whom I would call thoroughly discreditable."
"I refer to the photograph of Robert Maxwell."
"Robert Maxwell was responsible for stealing millions of pounds of pensioners' funds in my country."
"He is responsible for conning his way into the confidence of highly placed politicians and receiving their support at a time when he enjoyed authority."
"He is responsible for the suppression of free speech in the press of my country by the use of litigation."
"So I would ask you, Mr President, to consider whether Robert Maxwell's photograph should be removed from the photographs outside the Chamber."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Falconer, it is the Quaestors' responsibility to authorize displays, and I shall convey your request to them immediately."
"Mr President, just to clarify what someone said earlier."
"The Home Secretary in England is, in fact, the Home Secretary of the United Kingdom..."
"Mr Thomas, I have said I will not accept another word on the subject."
"Mr President, as regards the voting on the Van Lancker report, item 49, the second part of the final resolution, I am mentioned in the voting protocol to have voted yes."
"My intention was to vote no."
"I would appreciate if the protocol could be amended to rectify the matter."
"Very well, that will be taken into account and will appear in the Minutes."
"Mr President, the same applies to me."
"I am recorded as having voted yes in these matters when in fact it should have been no."
"That will be corrected."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes as amended)"
"(The sitting was suspended at 9.25 a.m. and resumed at 10.40 a.m.)"
"Community Transit System"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the report (A4-0053/97) by Mr Kellett-Bowman, on behalf of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System; and-the draft recommendation (A4-0054/97), on behalf of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry on the Community Transit System, on the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System."
"Mr President, the Committee of Inquiry met over 15 months and held 37 formal meetings."
"I want to pay tribute to the overwhelming majority of the members of the committee for their attendance, diligence and discipline, which were necessary in order to get a report with a degree of consensus contained in it that will be imperative for that report to command respect from the Commission, the Member States, the Council and those engaged in the transit trade."
"I commend all Members of the House to read at least volume 1 and, if that is too much, certainly chapters 1 and 17 of volume 1 - the executive summary and the recommendations - so that they know clearly what is being said in their name."
"This report may sound to some as if it is a technical report - it is not."
"It is a highly political report and has a very clear starting premise which is that, despite the crisis in the transit system and the damage caused by the problems in the transit system, transit arrangements are nevertheless vital to the single market and must change if they are to serve the needs of the single market."
"They must change because they are outdated, inhibit transit and encourage fraud and corruption."
"To give Members an idea of the monies we entrust to the transit system, it is necessary to understand that in that total of 18-20 million transit movements a year to which Mr Kellett-Bowman referred, if it is 18 million, each of those transit movements represents an exemption from taxation privilege while the goods are in transit."
"The average value of that exemption from taxation privilege is ECU 25, 000."
"If you multiply 18 million movements by ECU 25, 000 you see that we have entrusted to this archaic, paper-based transit system ECU 450, 000m of fiscal liability."
"I have to say that if I go into my local Co-operative supermarket in Walsall on a Saturday morning to buy a can of baked beans, they actually protect their interest in that can of baked beans with greater scientific control than is the case when we control financial liability in the transit system."
"So there are ECU 450, 000m of fiscal liability in this system and it is entrusted to a paper-based system, discharged by a rubber stamp - a rubber stamp that can be forged, stolen or corruptly used by a corrupt customs official."
"That is not adequate!"
"The monies cheated from the transit system not only cheat the own resources of the European Union but also the revenue of every Member State, because as they cheat our resources they cheat the European taxpayer in the Member State of the VAT and the excise duty."
"That is why we do not merely ask but demand of the Member States that they protect our interest by protecting their own and that they act simultaneously to defend the interest at European and national level."
"Fraud represents not just unlawful gain to the criminal, it represents the policies forgone because of the shortage of public resources; it represents the policies that the Commission could have had without an increase in own resources; the policies that the Member States could have pursued without increasing taxation rates."
"Therefore fraud in this area is nothing less than a corruption of our democracy, and, following the Committee of Inquiry, action must take place."
"It has to be action beyond reading the report: it must be action on recommendations 1-6 that deal with strengthening the customs services; 7-13 that deal with the imperatives of improved control; 14-20 dealing with the legal issues; 21-26 dealing with improvement of the transit system, including computerization; 2737 dealing with the political choices that must be made; and for us, recommendation 38 dealing with the follow-up."
"I wish to add my thanks particularly to our rapporteur, who has faithfully served the committee, and to all the Members, the Secretariat, the technical services from translation through to printing, the Commission and the many witnesses, without whose evidence we could not have had the recommendations because each of them stands on the evidence we have been given."
"I commend the report to the House."
"In conclusion, I particularly thank Mr Kellett-Bowman for the diligence with which he has reported our findings to this House."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already pointed on another occasion to the quality of the work done by the Committee of Inquiry, the first such committee ever set up by the European Parliament."
"Here I want to give particular thanks to its chairman, Mr Tomlinson, and to the rapporteur, Mr Kellett-Bowman, as well as to all the members of the committee."
"On behalf of President Santer and all our colleagues, let me stress the importance the European Commission attaches to this report."
"The report makes a major contribution to the debate on customs transit."
"It states that the Committee of Inquiry managed to bring the question of transit out from the recesses of administrative action and onto the political scene, and I entirely agree with that and would underline its importance in relation to the reform activities we now expect."
"The report highlights the fundamental role played by customs in relation both to the functioning of the single market and to international trade and economic growth."
"With the completion of the single market, the customs administrations have come under crossfire."
"Initially the emphasis was on the abolition of frontiers and internal controls."
"Far too often this process was simplistically associated with the dismantling of structures."
"That obscured and undervalued the continuing role of customs in administering the Community's external borders, preparing the applicant countries for enlargement, fighting fraud and implementing trade agreements."
"Perhaps the European Commission, in its 1993 programme, did not entirely understand the importance of the new challenges facing the customs either, and this was reflected in its political analysis."
"Secondly, the Member States did not manage, and some also did not really want, to adapt their customs administrations to the Community priorities, giving precedence instead to national concerns."
"Here too, I am sure, it was a question of inadequate political awareness."
"It is not my intention, Mr President, to comment on each chapter in detail or to respond to every single recommendation."
"I prefer to indicate the way in which we propose to take account of the recommendations, in particular those addressed to the Commission, in determining our policy."
"I shall briefly summarize my observations on what I regard as the five fundamental points highlighted by the Committee of Inquiry."
"I am using the term 'highlighted' in the fullest sense of the word and in a spirit of admiration: the Committee of Inquiry has given a new political form to various elements, which gives us all a clearer vision of the problem and of the necessary solutions."
"These five points are as follows: the question of a European customs service, the investigative services, reform of the transit system, relations with the European economic area and the associated central and eastern European countries, the question of unpaid duties."
"Firstly, the question of the European customs service."
"The analyses of the crisis carried out by the Committee of Inquiry reveal that many of the problems encountered in transit derive from anomalies in the operation of the customs union, which therefore needs global reform in the framework of customs policy."
"The report recognizes that many of the difficulties affecting transit are a direct result of the fact that the customs union is made up of 15 different administrations."
"Although the report does not postulate the creation of a common customs service, the Commission notes that it strongly recommends the establishment of a European framework that will, as the rapporteur said, enable the 15 national customs services to act as one."
"That is the most important practical objective."
"Thanks in particular to Parliament, we now have one instrument for working towards one goal: ensuring that 14 customs administrations can work as one."
"Let me refer you to the 'Customs 2000' decision approved last December."
"Some of the recommendations put forward by the Committee of Inquiry are specifically provided for in the 'Customs 2000' decision and, having participated closely with the delegations of the European Parliament and the Council in the conciliation procedure, I can say that the political lines set out by the European Parliament have been reflected in and acted as practical forerunners for that decision."
"The second area I want to dwell on briefly is the investigative services."
"The Commission is in favour of the recommendations on the creation of a common investigative service and a centralized European Union customs office."
"This is also consistent with the need to standardize the administration and implementation by the customs services of the rules on combating fraud, as called for by the Committee of Inquiry."
"The Commission fully endorses that approach."
"Of course this proposal cannot be implemented via the 'Customs 2000' programme, which is aimed at other objectives."
"I am sure my colleague, Mrs Gradin, will be happy to respond to any requests and to look at these questions in greater depth."
"It is important for the Commission to play a greater part in the control activities in order to fight fraud effectively."
"That would imply far closer coordination between DG XXI and the activities of UCLAF."
"The recommendations on the organization of the structures, powers and administrative responsibilities in the Member States are closely related to those on improving the investigative and inquiry structures, as are those on judicial cooperation."
"And, Mr President, I must say that in this context the report has come at a good time, given that it also clarifies the need for a successful outcome of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference on increasing and strengthening joint action in matters relating to the third pillar."
"The third question is the transit system."
"In this context, let me point out at once that the Committee of Inquiry, starting from an analysis of the system and the serious problems to which it gives rise, rightly situated this question in the framework of a more general problem."
"With that in mind, my services have organized wide-ranging consultations both within the Commission and with the Member States and other countries involved in the common transit system, as well as with the entire private sector."
"As you know, the Committee of Inquiry was closely involved in this process which led, early in February, to the Conference on Eurotransit in which 250 public and private sector representatives took part and which was also addressed by Mr Tomlinson."
"The Commission now proposes to translate the results of these consultations into a range of practical measures."
"I can assure you, Mr President, that the Commission will take the fullest account of the recommendations by the Committee of Inquiry; moreover, by the end of April I intend to submit the action plan for reform for the College's approval."
"The Commission endorses the overall conclusion of the report, namely that the transit systems are essential to trade in Europe and outside Europe, but that they are in need of radical reform."
"Allow me to say that the Commission also examined this question at the beginning of this Commission's term of office, in its communication of March 1995, followed by another in February 1996 and by the interim report on the transit system last autumn."
"The work done by the Committee of Inquiry, which sheds so much light on the situation and provides strong political impetus, will be of great help when it comes to translating these initiatives into action."
"Fourth point: the European economic area and the associated central and eastern European states."
"The report voices serious concern about the functioning of the common transit system and its enlargement, last July, to the four Visegrad countries."
"I have already expressed my views on the political timeliness and technical soundness of this enlargement and the fact that so far it has not had any dramatic effects per se."
"I will confine myself here to a few comments."
"In the Commission's opinion, it will become increasingly difficult to maintain three different types of transit system - Community transit, common transit and the TIR."
"The Commission will be submitting practical proposals on integrating Community transit and common transit in a single convention."
"The Commission is also working towards closer cooperation with Switzerland, a point the report discusses at length. To that end we have concluded a mutual assistance agreement which constitutes not just an important technical instrument but also demonstrates a real political wish on the part of Switzerland to cooperate with the Commission."
"The Commission assumes its full share of responsibility for the decision to extend the system to the Visegrad countries."
"Having said that, I stand by the undertaking I gave to the Committee of Inquiry - and I know how much importance Mr Tomlinson and Mr Kellett-Bowman attach to this - that there will be no further extension of the common transit system until it has been reformed and computerized."
"Finally, Mr President, the fifth and last point I wish to discuss briefly is a delicate one: that of unpaid duties."
"Here I will confine myself to a brief comment and leave it to my colleague Mr Liikanen to go into more detail if necessary."
"The report calls on the Commission to make a proposal on cancelling unpaid duties if these are due to poor administration."
"However, it is difficult to make a proposal of this kind that would take account of the particular situation involved in every single case."
"The customs code provides for the refund or cancellation of the duties in individual, analysed and justified cases, but makes no provision for this kind of general measure."
"The Commission is aware of the potential final implications for the operators concerned, however this question can only be resolved by legal means and by checking the merits of each case."
"Otherwise, all kinds of abuses would be possible, to the detriment of the European tax-payer and the financial rigour we are all facing."
"In any case, the Member States can secure favourable payment terms, on a case by case basis, and the Commission encourages them to do so."
"In conclusion, Mr President, I would say that it is not possible in the time available to do justice to the wealth of detail in the report, which really is a very comprehensive one."
"It contains 38 recommendations, many of which call on the Commission to make proposals and carry out studies or encourage the Member States to take specific measures."
"The report calls on the Commission to show greater political leadership and on the Member States to show a stronger political resolve."
"It is also clear that if the Commission is to play a more important part, that will increase the workload, especially for DG XXI and UCLAF."
"This implies the availability of adequate human and financial resources."
"Whatever the transit system that emerges in future, we need sufficient funds and staff to ensure that the system is correctly applied, controlled and adapted to change."
"The Commission counts on Parliament's support in obtaining adequate financial and human resources and is resolved to make its contribution towards directing the Member States' attention more closely to these questions."
"The success of the reform will depend also on the courage and determination shown by the Council, the national customs administrations, the economic operators and the European Parliament."
"In this context, I intend to fully involve the Internal Market Council and the ECOFIN Council in the transit question, to ensure that they too assume their responsibilities, a need that is often and rightly underlined in the report on which, once again, let me express my very warm congratulations."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The applause from honourable Members is sufficient evidence that the proposals you have put forward and the commitment you have undertaken were greatly appreciated by this House."
"Madam President, Mr Tomlinson, Mr Kellett-Bowman and the other members of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry have produced a detailed report on the transit system outlining its weaknesses."
"These were also highlighted in the Commission's transit report which was passed to Parliament in April last year."
"Organised criminals exploit the weaknesses of the system and this results in large losses for taxpayers and companies within the European Union."
"The Committee of Inquiry has proposed a series of measures to be taken."
"We now need the political will to carry them through."
"As already mentioned by my colleague Mr Monti, the Commission will continue to work constructively on the issue."
"I hope Member States and the other institutions also are willing to take action."
"We must together create a flexible and at the same time safe transit system as this is vital for the Community."
"The system was after all created to simplify the flow of goods through the Community."
"Since then a common internal market has been set up with 15 countries participating."
"The Berlin Wall has fallen and the borders with the East are open."
"This is important and constructive."
"Trade has increased enormously and has become internationalised."
"However, the control system has not adjusted to the increased flow of goods through the Community and applicant countries."
"The Committee of Inquiry's report is constructive and basically supports our efforts within the Commission to modernise the system and make it more effective."
"The principle task for us all is now to reform the transit system quickly without hindering free trade."
"There should be improved controls."
"Investigation into suspected frauds must be made sufficiently effective to deter criminal gangs."
"It is encouraging that several of the recommendations in the report are about increased control and more effective investigations."
"Two of my areas of responsibility are directly affected, i.e. financial control and the battle against deception and fraud."
"Recommendations 2 and 3 propose a joint Customs investigation body and a joint office for information and analysis."
"These are interesting proposals."
"The Commission's experiences from its work with UCLAF show the importance of the police, Customs and other specialist co-operation in the battle against deception and fraud."
"The current system is totally inadequate but I believe that these proposals complement each other well."
"I hope Parliament also realises that if these changes are to be carried out, financial resources must be made available for the additional investments required in this area."
"This will have to be taken up again in the budget discussions."
"In addition, a regrouping and restructuring will be necessary within the Commission."
"The proposal to strengthen and facilitate the judicial collaboration between Member States is also in line with the work started by the Commission."
"As you know, several initiatives have been taken."
"Various long-term programmes have commenced."
"These promote the exchange of experiences and education between the different categories of employees fighting international crime."
"One of the programmes, Grotius, is aimed at judges, prosecutors and others within the legal system."
"Another programme, Sherlock, is generating a mutual understanding on how to deal with fraudulent documentation."
"A third programmes under the name of Oisin is working for the police in our Member States to develop co-operation procedures."
"The Council of Ministers and the Commission are at the same time discussing a formal legal structure for a more effective legal collaboration within the Union."
"This relates to proposed regulations for direct contact between the justice offices and the setting up of a network between the Union's examining magistrates."
"The exchange of information between crime investigators and the magistrates must improve."
"An important proposal has been made as to how the exchange of documents between the courts can be made quicker and more efficient."
"We would like the courts to be in direct contact with each other and not to have to go via embassies and the Foreign Office."
"Another proposal discussed concerns the mutual recognition of employees' legal status."
"A proposal for a joint registration of criminal investigations and a register of judgements has also been tabled."
"All of this is concerned with the fight for better communication on cross border crime."
"However, these discussions are as you know very slow, partly due to the unmanageable decision-making process of the Maastricht Treaty for the Third Pillar."
"I hope the Intergovernmental Conference will change this and give us a better and more effective decision-making instrument for legal collaboration."
"An example of the current system's slowness is that none of the four important conventions signed by the Member States has been ratified."
"These are the conventions on Europol, co-operation between Customs, extradition of criminals and protection of mutual financial interests."
"I therefore wholeheartedly support the Committee of Inquiry's recommendation No. 16 which requires the prompt ratification of the convention to protect Community financial interests and which also should apply to all the other conventions."
"This convention was after all signed two years ago."
"However, not a single country has honoured the agreements they signed."
"If we are to have these instruments and facilities at our disposal it is important to get a response from the Member States."
"Recommendations 19 and 20 involve the Member States introducing an extraterritorial legislation, i.e. that the courts in a Member State are given jurisdiction over Customs violations even if the violation has been committed in another Member State."
"This is a very important instrument that we need."
"In addition, UCLAF would be entitled to provide evidence in conjunction with proceedings in our Member States."
"I share the opinion of the Committee of Inquiry that the Commission ought to be given a legal right to use our evidence in court."
"The Commission should in my opinion be able to take legal actions in a criminal case and to give evidence in courts on the same basis as the national authorities."
"A similar concept has been presented within the high-level group who are also attending the meeting with our Heads of Government in Amsterdam discussing international organised crime."
"As regards recommendation 27, the Committee of Inquiry suggests the outstanding debts caused by poor administration on the part of Customs should be written off."
"I must say that I am not sure whether I agree with this and believe that the matter should be thoroughly discussed."
"I cannot quite understand how writing off the outstanding debts of the Customs can improve Customs controls."
"After all, it does not concern the Customs' own money but that of the tax-payers."
"There must be other ways of supporting the Customs who work with great efficiency and integrity despite manpower reductions and an increased flow of goods."
"What we need to do is to develop co-operation between Customs officials throughout the Community."
"Using all these means, the Commission should be able to create effective transit controls."
"Finally, I would like to say that the Commission appreciates the report submitted by the Temporary Committee of Inquiry."
"We will most likely have reason for coming back to this in due course."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Socialist Group I want to welcome the Committee of Inquiry's report and in particular to extend our congratulations to the rapporteur, Mr Kellett-Bowman, for the excellent work he has done in producing the report before us today, and to Mr Tomlinson for the excellent way in which he has managed the Committee of Inquiry as its chair and for the excellent basis it gives us for the committees of inquiry in the future."
"I should also congratulate the Commissioners, who, at the opening of this discussion, were certainly here in considerable numbers."
"I understand why one or two have drifted away, but I congratulate them on being here."
"Frankly, I have to say that I am disappointed that so very few Members of our House have stayed for what is a hugely important debate."
"Bearing in mind the turnout from the Commission, that needs to be said."
"(Applause ) I look around the room and I recognize many Members from the Budget and Budget Control Committees who, of course, are committed to this cause of fighting fraud in the European Union; but we are all clear that fraud in the European Union and the reaction to it amongst the people of the Union are a major political issue for every Member of this House, not just for the Budget and Budget Control Members."
"I can only hope that those Members who are not here are sitting in their rooms reading the four volumes of the Committee of Inquiry's report: I will be charitable."
"But I do think it ill behoves us to go home and rail about fraud in the European Union and talk about what we are doing about it, when we have this excellent Committee of Inquiry's report and very few people are here to debate it."
"This report demonstrates the European Parliament at its best."
"That is another reason why I regret that so few people are here."
"Here we have the European Parliament acting - for the first time really, because this was the first committee of inquiry established under the Maastricht Treaty - and the way in which it has performed, the way in which it has been conducted, the evidence that it has taken from people from the Commission, from Member States and from individuals, is a model of the way in which we would want committees of inquiry to work in the future."
"It has been deadly serious, combative certainly, and it has come forward with a range of proposals which do this House very great justice."
"We should also be clear that what the Committee of Inquiry has exposed is the fact that the workings of the Single Market, the flagship policy of the European Union in recent years, have been exploited."
"This report is all about the Single Market, and most of our citizens would have assumed that the Single Market was actually working in a way that demonstrated that none of this could happen."
"There is clear evidence in this report of the failure of the Single Market at this moment, and of the need to tighten up."
"But let us remember that this was the first committee of inquiry set up by this House, and that when, at the Conference of Presidents under the chairmanship of Klaus Hänsch when he was still President of this House, we were looking to first use our new rights under the Maastricht Treaty, we wanted to be sure that the first committee of inquiry set up was one that dealt with an issue where we could have a real impact on public consciousness."
"Indeed Mr Martens initially came up with an idea that we should deal with fraud in the Union, and my group came up with the specific proposal about the area of fraud we should deal with. That has allowed us to demonstrate the truly effective nature of this House in its role to monitor, to examine, to investigate and to expose."
"If there is any message that the media of the European Union ought to take away from this, it is that the European Parliament is exposing this fraud perpetrated against the institutions of the Union in terms of its budget and, of course, against the Member States of the European Union; that we are actually saying now to the governments and the parliaments of the Member States of the Union: ' Please now get on and do what you are supposed to do and follow up this report' ."
"I hope the media will remember that and realize that it is not the European Parliament which is hiding or dissembling about fraud; we are exposing it and offering that analysis to the rest of the Union."
"I think it is fair to say that over the time that the Committee of Inquiry sat, the mood certainly changed from one, not of hostility but of a certain degree of scepticism, to one of great support and help from the Commission and from other bodies."
"The key recommendations - and I will close on this - in the Committee of Inquiry's report are really about the nuts, the bolts, the gears and the wheels of the Single Market, and we have got to take note of them and make it work."
"(Applause )"
"Mrs Green, I should point out that the Presidency did strongly express the hope that large numbers of Members would attend this debate."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of my group and on my own behalf, I want to congratulate Edward Kellett-Bowman on his months of work, of which this extensive and welldocumented report is the tangible proof."
"I also want to acknowledge John Tomlinson's effective and probing chairmanship, which enabled us to extract more information from many witnesses than they initially seemed disposed to volunteer."
"Underlying the problem of Community transit there is something more than crimes committed by organized mafias who corrupt the system for gain, which equates to loss for Community taxpayers."
"The fact is, underlying the unsatisfactory functioning of the system there is also the clash of two different customs cultures."
"One which favours maximum speed in putting goods through customs at the cost of control and the possible loss of customs duties and another which reverses those priorities."
"Broadly speaking, this division distinguishes the countries where Community transit originates and the countries where that transit terminates."
"The conflict between these two customs cultures has done much to degrade the Community transit system."
"The temporary committee has demonstrated that customs cooperation between the Member States must be urgently strengthened."
"It has also demonstrated that customs policy has frequently been used as an arm of trade policy, thus endangering the maintenance of the system, which is vital to the functioning of the single market."
"The temporary committee has also demonstrated that fraud and smuggling is not sporadic, but is already a genuine Pan-European problem; a striking example is cigarettes, where testimony after testimony has demonstrated that they are being smuggled throughout Europe."
"We are aware that the development of the work and recommendations of this committee has been followed with interest from Commissioner Monti down to each and every one of the national administrations concerned, and those recommendations must be basic to the Council's agenda to ensure that customs cooperation is strengthened and the system survives."
"Beyond the timescale of the report lies the future of Community customs and the answer to the question of whether a single market can operate with five separate customs services or whether we should look for some way of advancing towards a common customs service which does not undermine national sovereignty but does deepen the Community dimension."
"Above all, ladies and gentlemen, it must be clear that the European Parliament has detected a problem and that the various political forces will jointly and correctly analyse the causes and provide concrete solutions."
"Like Mrs Green, I do not think there can be a better example of what this European Parliament is here for."
"Madam President, let me say at the outset that the Committee of Inquiry has done a great job; and I personally must join in the applause, which is not ritual but really is due to the rapporteur who managed to put it all together so ably and to reflect the unanimous view of that committee. The committee worked with great determination and we must give credit for this to its chairman, Mr Tomlinson, whom I thank for his work."
"Madam President, the evidence shows that there was an enormous amount of evasion, with significant losses to the Union's budget and therefore also to that of the Member States."
"We cannot hide the fact that in 1993 we saw a flight forward, in the sense that politics took precedence over reason."
"A single market was established overhastily, without taking account of the devastating effects of 15 different organizations, with profoundly different customs systems."
"In fact, the level of intensity of the controls differed and there were also very marked inequalities because of the significantly lower commitment on the part of some countries."
"Italy, for example, which maintained its strict customs controls, was heavily penalized."
"All this has had serious consequences, such as inadequate protection of the Union's financial interests, major distortions of competition and the wide margins offered to organized crime, which has found new opportunities for making big profits."
"We also note the egoistic approach hitherto taken by the states, which has resulted in the Council's inability to act together with the inertia of the Commission; in fact the Commission could often do no more than stand by and watch because it was unable to find any margin for the necessary discussions with the Council; to our satisfaction, we hear from Commissioner Monti and Commissioner Gradin that the Commission is now beginning to move, and this is due - as we must recognize and as was honestly recognized today - to the new awareness created by the Committee of Inquiry."
"The work of the Committee of Inquiry has stirred up the stagnant waters of those who preferred not to see and not to know."
"The gravity of the situation is plain for all to see."
"We must therefore immediately draft a customs protocol that defines an equal level of control in the 15 Member States in order to avoid the present extremely serious distortions."
"We also need an efficient and rapid information system so that we can move away from the current paper-based system and switch to a computerized system and to the use of modern technology in order to monitor movements in Europe by satellite."
"Finally, we must activate 'Customs 2000' as a first approach to reforming the transit system and to a single European customs system."
"That is the only solution we can see for the future."
"Globalization means more rapid trade, free of bureaucratic red tape; this must be achieved without any serious losses of revenue or opening up new opportunities for organized crime."
"The committee's activities have shown up an alarming fact: if more people had been aware how inadequate the system actually is, there would have been even more evasion; if the people of Europe had been aware of the scale of funds that disappear from the Union's budget as a result of these inadequacies, that would certainly have increased their distrust in Europe."
"So we can no longer tolerate this but must act and act at once!"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, all too often in discussions I am confronted with the view that the European Parliament has too few powers, cannot make any real decisions and is basically not a proper parliament at all."
"We know that these preconceptions are rooted in ignorance, but we also know that our public image will only change if we represent the interests of our citizens even more effectively than hitherto and are seen to be doing so."
"To that end, the Maastricht Treaty gave us this new right of investigation, which has now been exercised by two committees of inquiry."
"These two committees, on BSE and on fraud in the transit system, have considerably strengthened our Parliament."
"Even a year ago, who would have thought that the House would carry a suspended motion of censure on the Commission for its scandalous mismanagement of the BSE crisis?"
"How would have said just 15 months ago that fraud within the Community transit system and the related problem of organized crime were matters that concerned all levels of responsibility and could no longer be dismissed with platitudes about the smooth functioning of the single market?"
"Both committees of inquiry have proved that when Parliament is granted a right it knows how to exercise it competently and purposefully."
"We have been given a potent instrument here with which the Commission, the Council and the Member States can be subjected to close scrutiny."
"In this way, things that were previously concealed are brought into the open."
"Where supposition and unsubstantiated suspicion once prevailed, we are now able to prove which person in which post, by abusing his powers and neglecting his responsibilities, has inflicted damage on the Community or individual citizens and to indicate whether and how such damage can be repaired."
"The crucial point, however, is that this right of enquiry is creating a European public who take an interest in what is happening in the EU."
"In this way a two-way process is established, in which Parliament develops as a source of democratic control and consequently - or so I hope - the people of Europe gain confidence in the European institutions."
"Nevertheless, if this right of enquiry is to be made even more effective in future, the existing loopholes must be closed and present weaknesses remedied."
"To that end I propose the following five points: those in positions of political responsibility, whether in the EU institutions or in Member States, must have an obligation to appear and give evidence to the committee."
"Surely it cannot be left to the discretion of Mr Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, whether he justifies his actions to the BSE Committee or not."
"Secondly, committees of inquiry must be granted a general right to summon witnesses, swear them in and impose penalties for infringements of the rules."
"Thirdly, the power of investigation must be extended to cover the actions of individuals and corporate entities, even if they have not been operating on behalf of the Community or the Union, as for instance in the tobacco industry."
"The fourth point follows from this, namely that individuals and corporate entities must also be compelled to submit documents; the fifth point is that committees of inquiry will need to have their own right of access to all documents of the European institutions in future."
"And one final point: the secretariats must be better equipped in future."
"Michael Shackleton and his crew often managed to do the impossible, and the demands made of them sometimes bordered on the unreasonable."
"For that we give them our sincere thanks."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have all received the four volumes detailing everything which is going wrong."
"Going wrong in the Community transit system."
"It is a fascinating dossier and impressive in terms of the result."
"Not only do we see what is going wrong, we also see what can and must be changed, and I must make a point here of paying tribute to reporter Kellet-Bowman."
"He has been an outstanding reporter, and the secretariat too has done a splendid job."
"I must also compliment Mr Tomlinson on his excellent chairmanship of this Committee."
"We are talking about fraud totalling at least one billion, one billion ECU."
"The system is totally out of date; it is oldfashioned and actually invites fraud."
"Organized crime has naturally homed in on the weakness of the system."
"The Committee too concentrated on a number of very specific dossiers: cigarette fraud is one example and I am particularly pleased to see that a number of supplementary points, a number of comments I made, about fraud involving meat and livestock for example, were incorporated."
"This dossier is concerned solely with fraud which uses road transport but one has to bear in mind that this is not the only route; the mafia bosses are very inventive, they are switching in some cases to using air and sea routes."
"They are also switching to other Member States, and to other tax havens; Switzerland had and still has a very bad reputation in this regard, and Cyprus is now going the same way."
"Many people at grass roots level advocate a single Community customs administration."
"That is perhaps the ideal scenario, but it would be better, and the rapporteur agrees, for us to take more concrete measures."
"Extremely concrete measures, practical steps towards co-operation."
"UCLAF needs to be given a lot more scope."
"It has already broken a lot of new ground: UCLAF is required not only to record everything that goes wrong but primarily it has to be a channel for information, a nerve centre and above all UCLAF must be empowered to forward dossiers to the judiciaries of the Member States."
"Parliament must appreciate this and consequently UCLAF must be given a bigger budget so that it can be more directly in touch with the general public."
"The report makes a whole series of specific proposals: for the setting up in the immediate future of an EU Customs Academy, the use of new technologies and the need for computer and IT methods to co-ordinate all areas of malfunction."
"We need to do what can be done already."
"It became apparent from our visit to Antwerp and Rotterdam that co-operation within Benelux is immediately feasible and co-operation in Northern Europe can be organized too."
"The job is not yet finished, Madam President."
"Fortunately the Committee on Budgetary Control will be taking the work forward and I shall make available to it my dossier which contains up-to-date figures for the United States plus statistics."
"I am happy to say that Mr Kellet-Bowman and Mr Tomlinson are members of this Committee and they will certainly see to it that the work continues."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the report by the Committee of Inquiry is an admirable document in its account of the failings of the Community Transit System and the scale of the fraud."
"In undertaking this substantial workload, which has taken thirteen months and involved thirty-seven meetings, the thirty-four members of the Committee of Inquiry - and its rapporteur and chairman - have, beyond doubt, complied with the mandate laid down for committees of inquiry in Rule 136(1) of the Rules of Procedure, which is, and I quote: ' to investigate alleged contraventions of Community law or instances of maladministration in the application of Community law' ."
"Although I agree with the diagnosis thus arrived at, I cannot endorse the proposals made."
"That is why I expressed a minority opinion, and I ask all honourable Members to read that opinion, which appears on pages 207 to 210 of the report."
"My point is that I would have liked to see preference given to the swift introduction of effective measures."
"To quote one example: the crucial problem of the illicit trade in cigarettes, on which the Committee quite rightly dwelt at length, is the subject of just one recommendation, the establishment of a working group."
"Instead of this rapid introduction of effective measures, the Committee proposes as the main objective the establishment of a single customs service operating within a European framework."
"This is an ideological measure, which the Committee itself recognizes would not meet the need for immediate results and would involve considerable structural upheavals."
"So the report is a missed opportunity, typical of the attitude of this Parliament which so often denounces, criticizes and condemns but fails to go far enough in the search for effective solutions, preferring dogmatic and ideological ones."
"That is why I voted against the final report and against the recommendation - in which, I am sorry to say, I differ from my colleagues."
"Madam President, Mr Kellett-Bowman has produced an excellent report on this problem of transit, in other words free movement between one third country and another third country through the European Community with the suspension of excise duty, VAT, etc."
"I would call this report a very handsome birthday present marking forty years of the Treaty of Rome."
"On the very first page, Mr Kellett-Bowman summarizes the record of those forty years."
"What is that record?"
"Criminals cross borders; the profits of unlawful activities do the same because there are no longer any borders!"
"Mr Kellett-Bowman continues by explaining that manpower in the customs services has been reduced, that there is a loss of morale among those who remain, and that, of course, the whole situation involves consequences which cannot be quantified."
"Are we talking about ECU 750 million over four years, or are we talking about ECU 3 billion per year?"
"Our inability to determine a figure is, moreover, a revealing indicator of the European Commission's methods."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman's second gift is a paean of praise for borders - in the present case, customs borders, criminal law borders and health borders, too."
"The report tells us that a single country, Poland, was able to send us 1000 lorries, 150, 000 head of cattle and 6000 tonnes of meat - and that happened despite the outbreaks of foot-andmouth and swine fever, which have spread freely because there are no longer any borders."
"I can tell Mr Mario Monti that if tax borders existed VAT fraud would not."
"The common VAT system itself engenders fraud."
"All you need is a false identification number in another country and you can go about your fraudulent business with impunity."
"Mr Kellett-Bowman's third very interesting contribution relates to the European Commission's working methods."
"The basic approach is very simple: a leap into the unknown."
"Get rid of what exists and replace it with absolutely nothing."
"Like the Commission, and like Mr Medina Ortega in the case of mad cow disease, Mr Kellett-Bowman confines himself to a reference to a 'substantial omission' ."
"His fourth point relates to the consequences of excessive taxation, especially excise duty on cigarettes."
"This creates an American-style prohibition situation."
"It is obvious that fraud offers the chance of an 83 % profit when excise duties vary from 76 % of the price of a pack to 83 % in Portugal."
"As for solutions, we are offered the panic advance - the revision of the transit system, a modest enough answer."
"Mr Mario Monti tells us that 'the European judicial pillar will allow us to compensate for the deficiencies of the European administrative pillar' ."
"A European supervisory body which will be just as inefficient as those we already have!"
"The reality is that fraud is an inescapable counterpart of European integration."
"There has been fraud from the beginning."
"Peoples have been deceived, sovereignty has been circumvented, lies have been told to the democracies in order to set up an oligarchy, from the Director of the Central Bank to the European Commission."
"From the very start, Madam President, the nations and peoples of Europe have been lied to."
"Europe, or Europa as she then was, was a young girl from Asia Minor, a Turkish maiden carried off by what she thought was a bull but turned out to be just Zeus."
"The mother who bore the child lied, and its natural father was a lie himself."
"How do you expect their offspring, 2500 years later, not to have lying bred in the bone?"
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, Mr President of the Commission, almost nobody, scarcely a single one of these 370 million citizens of the European Union whom we claim to represent, knows that there is a Community transit system and that it is not working."
"We must recognize that."
"We must bear it in mind."
"Nevertheless, although no-one knows that it is not working, these 370 million citizens are well aware of the threat to themselves that results from the failure of the system."
"As Mr Kellett-Bowman said, the main beneficiaries of the system have been criminals, and Pauline Green said this morning in the debate marking the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome that disillusionment with the way the European Union operates is growing."
"The feeling of being threatened, unprotected, of being deprived in one way or another of social and economic security, and even of physical security, by this Europe jeopardizes the development and future of our European Union and endangers its very existence."
"In this broad panorama the fraud that is occurring within the Community transit system is but one small feature."
"Yet it is a tile in the overall mosaic, and we should see it within this political context and treat it with due seriousness."
"What I am about to say is not intended to absolve anyone of responsibility, least of all the Council and not the Commission either."
"But the criticism we have made today - thorough, competent, based on 15 months of hard work - would surely be more credible in the eyes and ears of the European public if we included ourselves, this Parliament, the 'High House' , as we like to call it in German, in this criticism."
"The question is, ladies and gentlemen - and it is perhaps an advantage to be asking it now, when there are at least a few more ears listening - have we taken the matter seriously? Have we said that this system was conceived for six Member States, but now there are 15, with more to come?"
"Have we asked the questions that need to be asked?"
"No!"
"Of course we can criticize the Commission and the Council for not having asked these questions."
"We do not take back one jot of that criticism."
"But we should have been asking them, and if others fail to act, it is our responsibility to do so."
"Commissioner Monti, you referred to the link between Customs 2000 and the committee of inquiry, and I know that the entire body of experts in this domain recognizes that link."
"But have we as a Parliament taken that seriously?"
"Did we conduct the debate on Customs 2000 with due diligence and care?"
"So did we do that?"
"No, we did not!"
"In point of fact, we had to fight to get it on the agenda at all!"
"That is the problem."
"We did not grasp the whole picture."
"To the 38 recommendations made by the committee, which I fully endorse, I should like to add one more. We are the European Parliament, and we wish to be regarded as such."
"So let us please act in such a way that we can hold up our heads."
"We sometimes treat our resolutions as if we were no longer responsible for them from the minute they leave the House."
"But we bear responsibility, and that can be clearly expressed through the work of a committee of inquiry."
"Nevertheless, it must also be expressed in our daily work, and we must take ourselves more seriously so that others will also take us more seriously, which will also lend more weight to any criticism we make of the Council and the Commission."
"Madam President, allow me to finish on a personal note."
"Commissioner Monti, during the meetings of the committee of inquiry I criticized you very directly and sometimes very sharply."
"Since this criticism was public and is now being further publicized, I should like to apologize for those aspects of it that offended you."
"I do not take back any of the substance of my criticism - on the contrary - but the manner in which you have spoken today, the change you have demonstrated, proving that such developments are possible, has won my deep respect, and I wanted to tell you that today."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the single market brought us the four celebrated freedoms."
"Did it not also bring a fifth, namely freedom of movement for fraudsters, smugglers and black-marketeers?"
"Finding the answer to that question was the task of the committee of inquiry, which investigated in the course of 16 hearings, various fact-finding missions and numerous meetings the devious routes goods can take after coming into the EU free of customs and excise duties under what is basically a regulated system and the way they can cross the entire continent, with the appropriate duties not being levied until goods reach their destination."
"If I may go straight to the committee's conclusion, to which several references have already been made here, the transit system is working badly at the present time."
"That is hardly surprising in view of the fact that it was created in the late sixties, when the Community was smaller and the volume of trade was lower."
"Today there are up to 18 million operations per year at some 3000 customs posts in more than 20 countries."
"Drivers, hauliers and customs officials play an active part in the transit system, but there is also a passive role played by the beneficiaries of fraud, namely the final recipients of smuggled goods, most of whom belong to criminal organizations."
"They derive their profits from the difference between the duty-free import price and the selling price obtained on the black market."
"This means that heavily taxed items such as cigarettes are particularly susceptible to fraud."
"A containerload of cigarettes has a customs and excise value of about one million ECU."
"Fraud costs the EU and its Member States billions in customs duties, VAT and excise duties."
"In spite of the single market, the diverse powers of the national customs authorities end at the borders of their respective Member States."
"Their working methods are archaic, comprising ponderous paper exercises with documents and rubber stamps that are easily forged."
"Cuts in staffing and resources prevent comprehensive controls."
"Spot checks alone are not enough."
"A lack of cooperation and reluctance to recognize evidence from other countries make it almost impossible to prosecute fraudsters."
"Furthermore, the fact that VAT is levied in the country of consumption rather than the country of origin is virtually an invitation to commit fraud."
"How could this have happened?"
"In creating the single market, neither the Commission nor the Council considered this debit side."
"Parliament, however, certainly did issue warnings, Mrs Wemheuer!"
"And for years the mounting losses were ignored."
"The supreme achievement of the committee of inquiry under its dedicated chairman, John Tomlinson, consisted in bringing to light the abuses of the transit system."
"Our sincere thanks are due to the rapporteur, Edward KellettBowman, and the secretariat for the enormous amount of work they have done."
"Like a thread, Madam President, running through the committee's 38 recommendations is its awareness that a European customs service ought to be the long-term aim."
"In the meantime, however, measures are proposed with a view to creating a common framework for the transit system."
"The Commission view on this has been very clearly expressed today, for which I am grateful."
"The Commission has already taken initiatives, and I should like to put on record here my thanks to Mrs Gradin and Mr Monti."
"Greater efforts, however, are also needed in the administration of justice, in matters such as judicial assistance and the treatment of evidence."
"In general terms, it is apparent that some important aspects of customs procedure are political in nature and are closely associated with political reality."
"That is why the Commission and the Council, which, I am gratified to note, is also represented here today, need to demonstrate their desire and their efforts to follow up the recommendations of the committee and to achieve progress in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Parliament, and especially its Committee on Budgetary Control, will monitor and support such measures."
"Thank you, Mrs Theato."
"The debate is adjourned. It will resume at 3 p.m."
"Mr Martinez has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, in this very House, at the entry to the Chamber, there are young people handing out political tracts."
"It's not particularly relevant that they are directed against the French National Front - they might be against the Communist Party or against the Socialist Party - it would come to the same thing."
"Mr President, I ask you to use your presidential powers to have an usher put a stop to a situation in which this Chamber is becoming a distribution centre for political tracts."
"You are right, Mr Martinez."
"Every Parliament deserves respect and of course - this building is very large - leaflets can be handed out somewhere that is not right in front of the Hemicycle ."
"Votes"
"I just want to say that in connection with this particular item I have a copy of a letter from the chair of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy which has my name on it as apparently agreeing to this."
"I never indicated any such agreement."
"Some similar process took place as we just now had and I did not have the space to indicate my disagreement with this proposal and I now do so."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Ahern."
"The statement you have just made will be included in the Minutes."
"Mr President, I would like to remind Parliament that Amendment No 37 provides that the Commission cannot change substantive points that are in the annex. It accepts a number of them which are basic to the directive, for example risk assessment, which is the core of the directive."
"Unless that amendment is adopted, it will remain possible for committees to change the substance of the directive."
"I therefore ask Parliament to adopt Amendment No 37."
"After the vote on the amended Commission proposal"
"Mr President, I should like to ask Commissioner Bjerregaard:"
"Firstly, whether she accepts the change of the legal basis, and I would like to remind her that on 19 February this House accepted the Commission's statement on mad cow disease, and one of the Commission's conclusions and proposals was that all acts related to public health should in future be based on the co-decision procedure."
"Secondly, she told us yesterday that she accepts part of the amendment on risk assessment."
"Which part does she accept?"
"Because that amendment is the most substantive, it is the core of the Directive."
"And I would like to hear that she accepts it in its entirety, because it really gives a correct assessment of the risk, and consequently the correct area for work with genetically modified micro-organisms."
"Mr President, we were able to have a thorough debate yesterday on the proposal on which Parliament has now voted."
"I explained then why the Commission was not in favour of a change in the legal basis."
"I also emphasized that, on the other hand, the Commission was inclined to follow the amendment which meant that Parliament would exert its full influence on the annexes, something that was advocated by several speakers."
"There has of course been no further development overnight, except that we must naturally look at the amendments which have been adopted here in Parliament."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Mr President, I consider it my duty to point out to the House an inaccuracy in relation to recital F. In Amendment 12 it is alleged that the European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine expressly bans cloning and that this is the first prohibition of cloning in international law."
"That is untrue, as many other Members are aware."
"I consider it important that this is clear before we vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, the next vote on our agenda is with regard to the Renault closure."
"In the gallery we have men and women trade unionists who, since yesterday, have been here, coming directly from the demonstration in Paris, representing the 3, 100 people of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde who will be made unemployed if this decision goes through unreversed."
"I think we should welcome them to the gallery and demonstrate our support for their cause."
"(Loud and sustained applause )"
"Thank you very much, Mrs Green."
"I know you understand the institutional limitations on the Chair, but your words will appear in the Minutes, with mention of the emphatic support of this House has given them."
"Mr President, let me respond to Mrs Green's friendly words of welcome to the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery by expressing my disapproval of the way she has chosen to draw the attention of Parliament to this situation."
"(Heckling and applause) We are all freely elected Members of Parliament, and I attach a great deal of importance to the right of a Parliament to decide freely without pressure from the streets and without pressure from the gallery."
"That is what I wish to have placed on record."
"(Uproar in the public galleries)"
"Silence in the gallery! Silence in the gallery!"
"Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery! Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery!"
"Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, please listen to me. Ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, you know that our Rules categorically prohibit demonstrations of any kind from the gallery."
"So if you are not silent, it will be my sad duty to have you removed."
"So please maintain silence."
"And to you, Mr Konrad, I have to say that in this Parliament every Member has the right to speak."
"And there is complete freedom in this Parliament to express opinions through the vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the debate on this matter has already taken place, so we will move to the vote."
"Please help me complete the vote successfully in the calm appropriate to such an important matter."
"Joint motion for a resolution on the closure of the Renault plant in Belgium"
"Before the vote"
"Mr Giansily is asking for the floor."
"He may speak after the vote."
"(Mr Giansily insisted) Mr Giansily, I must remind you that as long as I am in the Chair, I will make the decisions in this House, right or wrong."
"I have told you I will give you the floor after the vote, so please sit down."
"Ladies and gentlemen, if you do not respect the work of Parliament, I shall be forced to remove you."
"Parliament's work must be respected!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, as a section of the Hemicycle has already voted with its feet, let us get on with our work."
"Mr Giansily, if you do not respect the Chair, I will have you expelled from the Hemicycle."
"Leave the Chamber, Mr Giansily!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure and after calling Mr Giansily to order repeatedly, I am using my powers under the Rules to expel Mr Giansily from the Chamber."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please calm down."
"The Chair has taken a decision in accordance with its powers under the Rules."
"Mr de Vries is asking for the floor."
"I think we are all aware that the issue we are about to vote on is extremely sensitive."
"We are also aware of the fact that there are a number of important differences of detail which have to be resolved through the vote."
"We owe it to the people of the Renault factory that this vote proceeds according to the standards of this House, quietly and in a dignified manner."
"Mr President, as we all should, I fully respect your authority."
"I do not wish to question your authority as President of this session."
"I want to make that absolutely clear."
"However, in view of the fact that it is now after 1 o'clock, it might be advisable to take this vote at 3 o'clock right after the lunch break, so that we can do it in peace and quiet."
"Therefore, I propose that we suspend the session."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must remind you that if you accept Mr de Vries' proposal, it will not be possible to take this vote this afternoon, and it will have to be taken tomorrow."
"Secondly, I think we can calm down and make progress."
"Mr Martens has the floor now."
"(NL ) Mr President, I think the best thing Parliament can do at this time is to approve the resolution backing the workers at Vilvoorde."
"But, Mr President, in order to restore order in the House and Parliament needs order to be restored, I would ask you to suspend the sitting and sort out the incident which has just occurred involving a member of this House."
"So I would ask you to suspend the sitting so that this incident can be dealt with and we can vote on the resolution in a calm and orderly fashion."
"Mr Martens, if I adjourn the sitting, then under the Rules of Procedure the vote will have to be taken tomorrow."
"So given the importance of the vote we are going to take, I would rather resolve the situation if the whole House will assist me."
"The incident began because Mr Giansily asked for the floor."
"Ladies and gentlemen, please bear in mind, that during the resolute demonstration in the gallery, the Chair acted energetically, warning that if it happened again those responsible would be expelled from the gallery."
"After that there were various interventions."
"So as not to delay the vote, I told Mr Giansily I would give him the floor after it had been taken."
"You have the floor, Mr Martens."
"Mr President, it is perfectly possible to suspend proceedings for five or ten minutes to settle the matter and then let us vote."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I propose that we suspend the sitting for five minutes."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 1.20 p.m.)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, after consultation with the group presidents, and irrespective of their assessment of this incident and their agreement or disagreement with the action of the Chair, we are going to resume the session and give each political group one minute."
"I ask you to cooperate with the chair, because it is important that we get on with today's voting."
"Mrs Dury has the floor."
"Mr President, I am glad you were able to find a way of resuming our sitting on a dignified basis, something we all want because we are anxious to vote on this motion."
"Yesterday, I heard many honourable Members talking about social Europe and their support for the Renault workers in every country, not just at Vilvoorde."
"I hope they will now give substance to their words by voting in favour of our motion."
"And I am also looking forward to hearing them speak now."
"I am very glad this solution has been found."
"Let us cast our votes worthily, and with dignity, to show those who doubt us that the European Parliament can support a social Europe!"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what we have to do now is the customary and proper work of this House, that is to say we must approve this resolution."
"As I said just now, this is the most important thing we are required to do, and we must learn to behave like a proper and worthy Parliament."
"Our main weapon here is the debate and an expression of solidarity in the form of these resolutions."
"All of us feel for these workers whose livelihood is under threat."
"So what we have to do is to show respect for the rules of Parliament and to conduct a fair and honest debate."
"So let us now vote on this resolution."
"Mr President, what happened just now is completely unacceptable. This is not a trade union meeting, this is a parliament!"
"We were in the process of voting."
"You should not have allowed Mrs Green the floor."
"You should not have allowed people in the gallery to speak, and when these incidents occurred you should immediately have suspended the sitting and ordered the galleries to be cleared."
"I believe that in these circumstances, with this kind of pressure, it is impossible for us to vote."
"If you continue with the vote I shall refer it to the group chairmen at the Conference of Presidents."
"Having said that, I call upon my group not to participate in the vote but to leave the Chamber."
"As has already been said, Mr President, the gravity of the issue we are dealing with requires us to fulfil our obligation."
"We have already re-established calm debate in Parliament."
"I congratulate you on the decision you took to resume the sitting and you have the support of the majority of the groups through our group presidents."
"We will deliberate and take a decision."
"Today we are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome and, after this morning's fine speeches it would not be much of a celebration if we could not hold an ordinary though very important vote."
"I have to add that our group was surprised at the wording of point 8 of the joint resolution expressing the hope that the management of the company will draw up, in agreement with the workers' representatives, a company plan which will make the dismissals acceptable."
"We cannot support this resolution, we withdraw our signature and we ask for rejection of point 8 so that we can support the resolution."
"Mr President, please take note that we withdraw our signature from the joint resolution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, when human misfortune spills over into this House, it is a matter of dignity for us to accept that, sometimes, the problems of society may make themselves felt even here."
"I don't think there's anything to get worked up about."
"Everyone knows how we are going to vote, because we have voting lists."
"So stop the amateur dramatics!"
"Stop the circus!"
"Remember your dignity, and remember that there are millions of people unemployed!"
"Let's get on with our job!"
"We are well paid to do it."
"Let's vote!"
"Let's vote!"
"You will vote against, we will vote in favour, and History will be the judge!"
"My thanks to the gentlemen on the Right for bringing the class struggle into Parliament!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Renault crisis is so serious that it is easy to understand these demonstrations of emotion and a certain amount of excitement."
"But precisely because this is a very serious business, our duty is to keep calm, as others pointed out just now."
"Our job today, our responsibility, after debating this matter, is to vote upon it."
"Some may vote one way, others the other."
"That is our political responsibility."
"Whatever may be the procedural incidents in connection with the Rules of Procedure which occurred at the start of voting, and which we can return to in due course, I believe we must now vote - very calmly, very peaceably."
"Mr President, you are responsible - as Jean-Claude Pasty said just now, and he was right - for the incidents that have occurred."
"You cannot, in this Parliament, continue giving preference to particular speakers."
"If you give the floor to one Member you should give it to another if he asks for it, at the same time on the same subject."
"That is called democracy."
"In a democracy, giving preference to some Members over others is forbidden."
"Next, I have a question to put, first to you and then to the Bureau."
"There are visitors in the gallery."
"I myself brought two groups of visitors here this week. The seats in the gallery are booked, as of now, until December."
"Which Member allowed entry to the people responsible for the demonstration?"
"Out of which quota?"
"When did he reserve them?"
"That is a very specific question."
"You allowed - and I am not challenging the presence of the people who are there - but you, quite simply, allowed them to be applauded although they were not an official delegation."
"You have not put Mr de Vries's motion to the vote, although under Rule 111 you must put it to the vote."
"I now ask you to put to the vote the motion tabled by Mr Pasty that the sitting be suspended under Rule 132."
"Mr President, I personally am delighted to see the Renault workers here with us."
"But I am not going to tolerate your giving the socialist Members an opportunity to conduct electoral propaganda when we all known that the Renault works was shut down by Mr Schweitzer, who is a socialist himself and a friend of Laurent Fabius."
"I say that for the benefit of Mrs Dury, and I warn the Renault workers that the socialists are going to take up their fight, although if they are unemployed it's because of the socialists."
"Secondly, for the benefit of Mrs Green, who has taken advantage of her position to conduct electoral propaganda."
"I would remind her that the United Kingdom has caused much suffering to Belgian workers, since, in the 1980s, the British Leyland works was also relocated to the United Kingdom."
"On that occasion thousands of Frenchspeaking Belgian workers were put out of work, and nobody cared."
"We, for our part, defend the workers, and we do not do what the socialists have done today: lying and cheating as they always do."
"Thank your very much, Mr Féret."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy has formally requested a suspension of the sitting, and I must put that to the vote."
"I shall now put the request to suspend the sitting to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request) Ladies and gentlemen, we will therefore proceed to the vote on the joint motion for a resolution tabled by five political groups, as Mr Puerta has just told us the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left has withdrawn its support for the joint motion for a resolution."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr Giansily has the floor for a point of order."
"Better late than never, Mr President."
"Mr President, my actions just now were not prompted by any aggressive intent as far as you were concerned - I simply wanted to ask you what Rule you were using to suspend the vote in order to give the floor to a Member who just happens to be the chairman of the largest group in this House and cause us to vote on an important motion under pressure from a number of individuals in the gallery."
"In doing what you did, Mr President, you did no service to this House."
"Our Parliament lacks credibility outside these walls."
"It is regarded as a quaint assembly."
"There are people here who, when they were thirty, were shouting 'let's smash it, let's smash it, let's smash it' and now those same people this morning are saying 'let's vote, let's vote, let's vote' ."
"I believe, Mr President, that all those who are present here voted for you in the election for the vice-presidents because there was a consensus, and it seems to me that the consensus in this House is, first, to show respect for its Members."
"And when you get into an absolutely incredible situation where you have people in the gallery shaking their fists at Members of Parliament, and your response to this is to say that the Member concerned should be excluded from the Chamber, that, Mr President, means that you have failed in your duty and that if you were an honourable man you would resign immediately."
"Mr Giansily, I always aim for institutional balance when I am in the Chair."
"I can make mistakes, but I am not aggressive either with you or with anyone else, and I am always willing to learn."
"So although your words are unmistakably aggressive, I shall try to learn from them and I hope to do better in the future."
"Mrs McIntosh has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order, not only have you damaged the dignity of this House, but you have called into question the office which you have held today as President of this House."
"Rule 127 is extremely clear."
"A Member may be allowed to draw your attention to any failure to respect Parliament's Rules of Procedure."
"A request to raise such a point shall take precedence over all other requests to speak."
"I would like to know under what Rule Mrs Green spoke and was called to speak."
"I would also like to know why when Rule 126 with the request to suspend the sitting was raised, it was not immediately taken and put to the vote; and why, when Rule 101(3) was abused by the people in the gallery, not only disrupting the dignity of this House but then continuing to conduct television interviews in the gallery and make telephone calls on mobile phones which are strictly illegal in this building, you did not immediately evict them before the vote was taken under Rule 101(3)."
"I would also like to know why a colleague of mine who was trying to exercise his right under Rule 127 was not allowed to speak and why you, Sir, did not vacate the chair under Rule 111 and immediately suspend the sitting until order was restored."
"Thank you, Miss McIntosh."
"I said earlier - and I will say again now - that, in application of paragraph 1 of Rule 19, I take full responsibility for what has happened during this sitting and I am prepared to answer to the Bureau of Parliament and the Conference of Presidents at any time."
"Miss McIntosh, I have worked to paragraph 1 of Rule 19 and as long as I am in the Chair I will continue to do so, however hard it may sometimes prove to be."
"Mr Falconer has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, there speaks Miss McIntosh."
"Now we understand how lawyers end up in places where politicians should be."
"My point is that the way you have conducted business in this Chamber today was correct."
"Mrs Green spoke in favour of the resolution which was put to this Chamber."
"You then allowed someone from the other side to speak and that speaker opposed what Mrs Green had said."
"You therefore had a speaker for and a speaker against."
"Given that it is their livelihoods that are at stake, people in the gallery quite rightly expressed resentment."
"It was not outrageous."
"Anyone who has been on picket lines or involved in industrial disputes will know that this was not outrageous."
"So, Mr President, you conducted business quite correctly."
"You did not allow Mr Giansily to comment because you wanted to proceed with the business."
"I just wanted to say that the way you have conducted the business today has been to your credit."
"I would ask Members of this House to remember that they are here as politicians and should not be so thick-skinned as to be unaware of the concerns of ordinary working people who may be put on the dole queue as the result of the whims of multinationals who care not a jot about their livelihoods."
"Mr President, I want to place on the record of this House that during this afternoon's discussions, particularly during the distressing scenes, Members of the British Conservative Party were seen making obscene gestures towards people in the public gallery."
"I strongly deprecate this, and I would ask that at some point in the future, some sort of disciplinary action is taken against those Members."
"It is quite wrong that Members of this House behave in that disgusting manner towards people who have just lost their jobs."
"Mr President, the order and authority of this House depend on respect for the Chair and the decisions taken by the Chair."
"Under Rule 109, if the President excludes a Member from the Chamber for disciplinary reasons, he or she is not allowed to return to the Chamber for the remainder of the sitting."
"In the case of the Member whom you did so name, not only did he return to the Chamber, he also took part in the votes."
"I would therefore ask that his vote be deleted."
"He was also given the right to give an explanation of vote."
"I do not want to further inflame what is already a tense situation, but the respect for our Rules of Procedure which is fundamental for the conduct of this House's business requires that even that particular part of the Rule be respected."
"For if that is not respected - that is, the final bottom line when it comes to the authority of the President and order in this House - then we will degenerate into mob rule."
"Thank you, Mr Corbett."
"I have to say again, and to you too, that the Chair assumes every one of its responsibilities including those you have just pointed out."
"When positions differ in the House the Chair must take a decision and cannot please everyone."
"It must try to do so in what it considers the most correct way, sometimes in the way that will defuse the situation, always in line with the Rules of Procedure."
"So I was actually trying to stop the debate opening up again, and progress the vote - I did not succeed and I called the House to order - and then I took a different view with the group presidents, who helped the Chair extricate us from a tense situation."
"I do not want to reopen that tense situation."
"I shall allow all who ask to speak to do so, but I think we have succeeded, if not in resolving the incident satisfactorily - it is still open for further consideration - at least in moving our work forward and taking a vote which everyone, absolutely everyone, considered very important."
"Mr Pasty has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, your first duty as the president of the sitting is to ensure respect for the Rules of Procedure."
"Well, you should not have given the floor to Mrs Green because we were voting."
"Mrs Green made a political speech."
"She was not making a point of order or an explanation of vote, she was making a political speech."
"Once that had happened, all Members were within their rights in asking for the floor."
"All."
"One per group."
"And that was what you did not do."
"You actually refused to do it, which is a very serious matter."
"Then we had some even more serious problems, because there were disruptions in the gallery."
"We respect the people in the gallery, because they are our guests, but they must respect the Members of Parliament."
"Well, the behaviour we have witnessed was an attack on Members of Parliament."
"And you, Mr President, should immediately, and without waiting for someone to ask you - that is what the Rules of Procedure say - have suspended the sitting, because that was the only way to re-establish order and call for the galleries to be cleared."
"You failed to do so."
"I shall refer this matter to the Conference of Presidents."
"I also want the Bureau to consider it, because your behaviour was unacceptable."
"I would even call you a repeat offender, because I can recall another incident, also involving the gallery, when you were in the chair."
"That was a problem about people without papers."
"So this is not entirely a coincidence, and I want this matter to be referred both to the Conference of Presidents and to the Bureau, because it is intolerable that vice-presidents should behave as you have."
"Thank you, Mr Pasty."
"I take note of your remarks which will appear in the Minutes."
"I have repeatedly said that I hope you will discuss this matter wherever and however you think appropriate; but I do think that we should put it to one side now. Still, I am feeling generous at the moment as there are no more votes to take."
"Mr Cox has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, I asked to make this brief intervention following the observation of Mr Corbett."
"I am sure that in the strict technical detail of the Rule he cited he may be correct."
"But as a political observation the point lacks any utility."
"Today's comedy of errors and misjudgments would be gravely compounded if the error of naming Mr Giansily for expulsion was on some technicality to be followed through."
"He had the right to intervene and I regret that he was not facilitated as others were."
"Were he to be expelled on a technicality, as an act of solidarity I would wish to be expelled with him."
"Thank you, Mr Cox."
"Mr Seppänen has the floor for a point of order."
"(FI ) Mr President, I support the procedure you followed in this case, but I should also like to point out that Mr Giansily was expelled from the Chamber on a decision by the President."
"In my opinion the speech made in this connection is justified."
"We cannot expel a person from the Chamber and subsequently allow him to take part in votes and make use of his speaking time."
"The person in question belongs to the same group as Mr Pasty, who on a former occasion voted on behalf of another member in this Chamber."
"Now a member of the same group does not leave the Chamber even though he has been expelled, but subsequently takes part in the debate and the vote."
"In my opinion this matter ought to be brought before the Conference of Chairmen, if this kind of thing is to be permitted, it would mean that anyone could be present, even if he or she had been expelled from the Chamber."
"Mr President, I think we should come back down to earth."
"You criticized Mrs Green."
"But you did then call Mr Konrad."
"Mr Konrad saw fit to be provocative."
"I found his remarks provocative towards these guests who have come here with their emotions running high, fearing for their livelihood, with their jobs on the line, with families who do not know what will happen to them."
"Whereupon, Mr President, you also criticized these guests and told them to be quite otherwise they would have to leave the gallery."
"We know that it is not right to agitate from the public gallery, but these people were surely unaware of that!"
"Let us come back down to earth!"
"What lies behind these emotions? Why are they so anxious?"
"Should we not be pleased - and this question concerns the very identity of this House - that people who are troubled, who are fearful, who expect political action from our Parliament, have come to us."
"And then to demand, as several Members have done, that they be expelled is, in view of the problem facing these people, in extremely bad taste."
"Secondly, I should like to make a personal statement."
"A Member called Féret, a representative of the Front National, called both Mrs Green and myself fascists."
"I utterly repudiate that!"
"It was a Member representing the Front National, mark you, who used the term 'fascist' to describe a Social Democrat and a Green."
"That, I believe, speaks for itself!"
"Mr President, I have sat quietly since my first intervention in this."
"I must say that I was astounded at the reaction to that intervention because it is normal practice, as everybody in this House knows, for Members to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are people in the Gallery during debates on certain items in which they are interested."
"It was nothing other than that."
"I was astounded at the reaction at simply having a delegation from the Renault factory here when we were about to vote on that resolution."
"It seems to me a completely extraordinary and disproportionate reaction."
"However, I must say, Mr President, that, having taken Mr Konrad, whom you did - in other words, one speaker in favour, one speaker against - and then trying to stop the clear disruption in the Gallery, you acted with great dignity, and what followed after that was quite out of order."
"I would be delighted if Mr Pasty brings this up in the Conference of Presidents."
"I should be happy to debate it with him there."
"I am sure the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament - many were here - will be happy to support your action in the Bureau."
"Mr President, you were quite correct, you acted with dignity and finally calmed the situation down, and allowed the vote to be taken, which was what this was all about."
"Mr President, my concern is not with your behaviour, or indeed with the behaviour of the demonstrators in the Gallery."
"My concern is with Mrs Green's behaviour, because she knows perfectly well that it is not the tradition of this House to make interventions designed to influence the outcome of the vote immediately before the vote."
"It was Pauline's decision to engage in that piece of street theatre, using the very emotions and concerns of those demonstrators to make a political point at an inappropriate moment in the conduct of this House's business, which led to the subsequent chaos."
"If anyone is culpable for this morning it is not you, Mr President, it is not the demonstrators, it is not the Members of this House, it is Mrs Green for putting us in an impossible situation."
"If she thinks that is the kind of behaviour that will reassure people that the Labour Party is ready for government, she has a lot to learn."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid we are going to have a Mediterranean lunchtime, but all the same, each and every one of you who asks for the floor will be able to speak."
"At this point I would like to apologize to the interpreters."
"We are abusing their services."
"I am sure they will continue to work with us, but I do want to apologize to them."
"Mrs Green has the floor on a point of personal explanation."
"Mr President, I was named and abused by Mr Spencer and I am entitled to respond to that."
"If he is telling me that he never at any stage engages in politics in this House, I am mightily surprised."
"Last night we had a discussion with the Renault workers."
"It is appropriate that we should acknowledge the fact that these people were here."
"Let us face it: what is wrong with actually being able to come face to face with people who are being thrown out of work?"
"I do not know whether Mr Spencer finds some embarrassment in the fact that the British Conservatives voted against the resolution."
"Perhaps that is the basis of his problem: he was confronted with people who are losing their jobs and who saw that he and his Members were voting against the resolution."
"Well, I am sorry if he is embarrassed, but he knows very well that there are often people in the Gallery from industry who are actively encouraged and supported by Members from that side of the House and people who come from all other lobbies."
"Is that not the same sort of thing?"
"Why is it when it is trade unionists whose jobs are on the line that this is somehow an embarrassment or difficult?"
"Thank you, Mrs Green, but I have no way of closing this debate today while people are still asking for the floor."
"Mr Spencer is asking for the floor again."
"I would ask him not to make personal allusions or we will never finish."
"Mr Spencer has the floor for a point of order."
"Mr President, it is not a question of playing politics in this House, it is of seeking improperly to influence a vote, using a piece of street theatre, which I know Mrs Green will come to regret."
"That is my last word on the exercise."
"But it was Mrs Green who initiated this shambles."
"Mr President, I think that attempts to improve matters often make them worse."
"There are a number of us here waiting to give explanations of vote."
"I think that rather than continuing with a debate which should not be taking place, it would be a good idea to proceed with the explanations of vote."
"You are right, Mr Bourlanges."
"This report continues the debate on the use of genetic engineering, a matter that arouses conflicting feelings."
"Our opinion is that the directive now being discussed is too vague in raising the political issue and is instead extremely technically orientated, concentrating on detail and creating a misleading picture."
"The question concerned, which after all is somewhat ill-fated, requires clarity and order, not least so that citizens are able to follow the debate."
"We have nevertheless decided to support the report including most of its proposed amendments and can only regret the vagueness with which the report has been put forward."
"In recent decades a new threat has appeared on earth, the uncontrolled and unthinking interference in complex systems which nature itself took hundreds of millions of years to perfect."
"In the name of scientific progress and the fight against disease, people are trying to intervene in the genetic codes perhaps of all living creatures, including human beings."
"Nobody can guarantee that the number of possible diseases that can be dealt with by genetic interventions will be larger than the unforeseen new ones that emerge from laboratory teratogenesis."
"The possible consequences from mutated species are neither foreseeable nor immediately apparent."
"They will become apparent as the result of the disasters they create."
"There is a very serious risk that genetically modified organisms will become the pollution of the future, a pollution with the ability to reproduce, migrate, transform, multiply, and worst of all, antagonise the natural species that have neither the time nor the ability to resist and create defence mechanisms, since natural development takes thousands of years, while artificial development takes only months."
"The accidents from the military and peaceful applications from nuclear energy will look like harmless fireworks compared with the invisible and silent conquest of entire continents by the higher neogenetic order."
"On the other hand, it is very difficult and dangerous to suppress and control what the human mind has already discovered."
"It is not our purpose to reject new discoveries and technologies absolutely and out of hand, but to demand uncompromisingly that technological development should not go against nature, part of which is mankind, but that they should be compatible with it."
"It is dangerous, in the name of ensuring the operation of the internal market and the smooth function and improvement of competition, to ignore the probable consequences and promote procedures and legal frameworks essentially concerned only with the multiplication of economic activities, the creation of a market and the securing of competitive investments, which allow dangerous margins for deviation from the control mechanisms and provide no guarantee of respect for ethical imperatives."
"In that spirit, we believe that the Council Directive on genetically modified organisms should be reviewed throughout."
"It is essential to set up a pan-European scientific body with the participation of citizens, to assess the appropriateness of programmes, assess risks and benefits, establish strict regulations and maximum safety conditions, and monitor compliance with them."
"It is urgently necessary to enlighten public opinion completely objectively concerning the potentials and use of genetic engineering, so that these issues, which are so important for the future of mankind, may be understood, seen in the correct perspective, and so that their consequences may be appreciated."
"I very much fear that what has been attempted so far, mainly by large multi-national companies in the food sector, is focused on the reassurance of public opinion, the elimination of risk, and the creation of a climate of acceptance."
"In many respects, the proposals by Mr Trakatellis are an improvement on the existing proposal for a directive, and they have the feature of requiring more restrictive legislation in this sector."
"It is a good thing for the precautionary principle to be applied and for a general assessment of the classification of the activities in question to be carried out."
"However, I cannot support the proposal because of the amended legal basis."
"The Committee on the Environment is proposing the use of Article 100a as the legal basis, whereas the Commission's proposal is based on Article 130s. It is being said that this amendment of the directive is not in fact a matter of environmental protection, but of harmonizing the rules in this sector."
"I do not agree."
"Research into the use of GMMs has many possibilities, but these activities must take place under conditions which safeguard human health and the environment as far as possible in future."
"It is thus absolutely essential for the individual Member States to be able to make their legal requirements stricter at national level, as allowed by Article 130s."
"I am therefore unable to vote in favour of using Article 100a in this case - the only thing that would be achieved by this is that Parliament would gain more responsibility."
"Unless a different legal basis is applied, this means that individual Member States will lose the right to maintain stricter legal requirements, and that is not appropriate."
"Mr President, I have supported this report today as, like many people, I am concerned that genetically altered organisms are already in the food on our supermarket shelves."
"In the light of the recent spate of food safety scares, we need as much information as possible about the scientific progress of genetic modification techniques."
"Who is altering which plants, animals and foods?"
"What are the potential benefits or dangers for human beings and the wider environment?"
"These are the kind of questions which people need answers to."
"So I welcome the report's emphasis on preventing threats to people and the environment, rather than just limiting them."
"The report also rightly points out the need to strengthen health and safety measures in this area of science."
"The supply of information to the public is also rightly stressed."
"I do not doubt that this area of scientific development offers potential benefits to us all, but like every concerned consumer I want the maximum information possible so that I can make up my own mind."
"Genetic modification is a complex field, but that is not an excuse for keeping people in the dark about its implications for their lives."
"Soulier report (A4-0065/97)"
"Mr President, I must first congratulate my colleague André Soulier on his excellent report, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"The European Parliament had already delivered its opinion on 16 April 1996, on the basis of a first report by André Soulier and approved a multiannual programme intended to promote international co-operation in the energy sector."
"Today, we should place on record our amazement at the attitude of the Council, which amended Article 8 on commitology, and decided to consult Parliament again."
"The result of this change of method was not only to create a delay but also to introduce a substantial change, since the initial budget of ECU 10 million has been reduced to ECU 7 million for 1997."
"I entirely approve the position taken by the rapporteur, who considers that the sum voted through by Parliament and the Council should not be reduced."
"However, in order that the SYNERGY programme should not be further delayed, and pending an in-depth debate on the subject, I am in favour of my colleague's report."
"Arias Cañete report (A4-0061/97)"
"The Swedish Social Democrats strongly object to the rapporteur's proposal that the subsidy granted to squid suppliers in the Canaries should not have a time limit imposed upon it."
"The group has therefore chosen to reject the report."
"Cunha report (A4-0013/97)"
"The fishing agreement ought to be designed so as to benefit the parties and to guarantee ecological balance."
"Several of the fishing agreements with third world countries are expensive for the Community and at the same time too much of the catch is not taken by local fishermen."
"The Swedish Social Democrats are therefore cautious about this fishing agreement and are of the opinion that this and similar agreements should be paid for by the fishermen who will benefit from the fishing rights thus negotiated."
"The Greens have voted against these fishing agreements for two reasons."
"First, we feel that the basis on which these agreements are negotiated is not acceptable."
"Such important matters as scientific assessment of the impact of fishing on the target and non-target species, control and surveillance of fishing activities, coherence with the development and environmental policies of the European Union and impact of the landing provisions on local markets are given insufficient attention in EU fisheries agreements with developing countries."
"Second, we share with many of our colleagues a resentment against the procedure, which presents Parliament with a fait accompli for each agreement."
"We are asked our opinion long after the negotiations have concluded and the boats have begun fishing."
"We protest this situation with a vote against the two agreements."
"Faced with declining fish stocks in its own waters and overcapacity in its fishing fleet, the EU has chosen to buy itself fishing rights in third countries."
"We need to ensure that we have sustainable fisheries in EU waters, but the same applies - and even more so - in the developing countries, where fish are one of the few resources to which the poorest people have access."
"Small-scale fishermen from African countries who are engaged in inshore fishing have expressed their concern at the effect of EU vessels fishing in their waters."
"It takes longer to fill a boat with fish, and they are forced further and further out to sea in vessels which are not really suitable for the purpose."
"The question is whether the EU is actually in the process of exporting the EU fleet's ruthless exploitation of fish stocks to the waters of third countries."
"It is alarming that whereas other ACP countries are reducing the EU's fishing of shrimps and prawns, Angola has kept it at the same level."
"For bottom and surface longliners, the fishing opportunities have been increased."
"And new species have been included."
"Is this because Angola is simply not following the general trend?"
"Or is it because the fisheries agreement between Angola and the EU does not take sufficient account of the real state of fish stocks and, more generally, of the developments in the fisheries sector in Angola?"
"It is also a matter for criticism that the opinion of the Committee on Development has not been taken into consideration."
"Here I am thinking in particular of the committee's insistence that such agreements should ensure mutual benefits for the parties, and that a certain percentage of the catches should be landed in the country of origin."
"It is a good thing that the budget for the development of the fisheries sector in Angola has been increased."
"But here too, there are questions to be asked."
"There is no specific information on how these resources are to be used."
"Without this, we cannot be sure that they are being used to develop a sustainable fisheries sector in Angola."
"I shall therefore abstain from voting, because the Committee on Fisheries has taken only very little account of the opinion of the Committee on Development, despite the fact that Angola is a developing country."
"And I believe that all fisheries agreements with developing countries should include a binding code of conduct."
"Macartney report (A4-0385/96)"
"The fishing agreement ought to be designed so as to benefit the parties and to guarantee an ecological balance."
"Several of the fishing agreements with third world countries are expensive for the Community and at the same time too much of the catch is not taken by local fishermen."
"The Swedish Social Democrats are therefore uncertain about this fishing agreement and are of the opinion that this and similar agreements should be paid for by the fishermen who will benefit from the fishing rights negotiated."
"Waddington report (A4-0056/97)"
"Through the medium of Mrs Waddington's excellent report, I congratulate the European Commission on the presentation of the White Paper."
"It is true that the modernization of our education and training systems will enable our European society to meet the challenges of the future (the information society, for example)."
"Also, in my capacity as a local councillor, I am sensitive to the action that the European Union might take."
"By way of example, in January 1996, we set up for my town of Istres the third plan entitled 'information technology - schools' ."
"This project, which places a strong emphasis on multimedia, marks a significant step forward in terms of the number and power of the software packages made available to teachers and pupils, and the opportunities for accessing them."
"So, at the beginning of the school year in September 1996, we conducted a successful experiment involving linking head teachers to the town's central server, on which is installed the database on children attending school; this aspect of the information technology plan also helped the main parties concerned - school services, head teachers and the inspector - to have better control of events at the sensitive period at the start of the school year."
"If it is desired to 'change up' and connect to the Internet, it is certain that the local authorities alone will not be able to bear the financial burden of such a project."
"The European Union's activities should be at this level, focusing on the allocation of substantial financial resources."
"I hope that the Commission's action plan really will take account of the needs of local authorities and will not be confined to aid for projects which small or medium-sized communities would not be able to implement within a reasonable time."
"The Danish social democrats voted in favour of the Waddington report on the Commission's White Paper which, as we know, deals with general education and vocational training."
"A number of criticisms are made of the White Paper in the report, for example that the Commission focuses exclusively on young people in its analysis and does not take account of the ageing of the population in Europe."
"The report also expresses the fear that the gap between 'those who know and those who do not know' will become wider."
"To prevent this, there will be a much greater need in future to focus on the concept of 'lifelong learning' ."
"The report therefore seeks initiatives from the Commission to increase the population's opportunities for further training both within firms and in the education system itself."
"The Danish social democrats take a positive view of the debate introduced by the Commission's White Paper and the Waddington report."
"However, they would stress that, like the rapporteur, they are critical of implementation of the White Paper's proposals for establishing 'second chance' schools at EU level for groups which are especially vulnerable to exclusion from the information society."
"We believe that adopting educational policy measures is a national matter."
"This is an area which is covered by the principle of subsidiarity."
"Lindqvist (ELDR), Gahrton, Holm, Schörling (V), in writing."
"(SV) We have voted for the report - Teaching and learning - towards the learning society as it contains favourable proposals and constructive criticism of the Commission's White Paper on education."
"We cannot support the proposal in the report (items 49 and 55) which says partly that we should combine education and vocational training within a relevant EU policy and partly urges the Commission to prepare detailed action plans for education."
"This action should be reserved for Member States."
"Is Europe fit for the 21st century?"
"Have those in positions of political, economic and social responsibility understood how we can hold our own in international competition?"
"Or have calls for flexibility and mobility, further training and foreign-language skills been falling on deaf ears?"
"In her excellent report, in which many amendments proposed by our PPE Group were included, Sue Waddington presents an opinion on a Commission White Paper which totally omits the social aspects of education."
"While the interests of young people are at the heart of the White Paper, the educational needs of women, older people and the marginalized do not feature."
"We need an educational offensive - on the one hand to enable us to compete in the world and on the other hand for the personal development of the individual."
"The consequences are:"
"1.For the EU: The resources for LEONARDO and SOCRATES must be augmented."
"In view of the need for budgetary discipline, phased annual increments make good sense.2.For the Member States: The depletion of research and development budgets must be stopped."
"Short-term policies must give way to strategic thinking and action.3.For businesses: Anyone who only pursues cost-saving strategies is squandering his future prospects."
"If businesses are to identify market niches and improve their products, they need motivated staff who benefit from appropriate further training inside and outside their place of work.4.For schools: There must be an end to narrow specialization."
"With a broad basic curriculum and with a grounding in abstract reasoning, young people will be able to engage in several different occupations in the course of their lives."
"European policies must be based on the undivided responsibility of the Member States for developing the substance of education policy."
"At the same time, however, Europe should supplement and support national measures."
"To that extent I welcome the announcement of proposals for plans of action designed to capitalize on the SOCRATES and LEONARDO programmes."
"The following action is needed in the domains of general and vocational education:"
"In view of the rapidly changing economic and technological environment, the acquisition of new knowledge should be encouraged.-Schools and businesses should be brought closer together.-A campaign should be waged to eliminate social exclusion. The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment of the European Parliament was right to be sceptical about the model of separate second-chance schools."
"In the discussions I referred time and again to the danger that this could create 'ghetto schools' . There are in fact already refined systems for assisting disadvantaged pupils in many Member States."
"The foremost task in economic, social and education policy is to fight unemployment at both national and European levels. What is certainly true is that the jobs shortage is only one side of the coin; another reason for unemployment is a lack of vocational qualifications."
"Educational exchanges between countries can serve to underline the importance of a close link between professional experience and training received in school."
"This applies not only to initial training but also to more advanced levels."
"Nothing could be further from the truth than the phrase that is often heard after final apprenticeship examinations in Germany and Austria, ' I've finished my training' ."
"On the contrary, the situation now - especially in our modern technological society - is one of lifelong learning."
"According to Mrs Waddington, the social partners have a crucial role to play in providing access to lifelong learning."
"The importance of their function is also emphasized by the LEONARDO programme."
"Europe the business location does not only need the latest high-tech machines; it also needs employees who can operate them."
"People at the age of 40 must not be weeded out, written off like old machinery and consigned to the dole queue."
"The LEONARDO programme should promote model pay agreements in which the fruits of economic progress are not used exclusively for material investments and pay increases but also for the continuing vocational training of employees, for investments in human capital."
"I voted for the Waddington report because it is a step towards the implementation of the positions and demands I have outlined above."
"The White Paper on Education and Training has been generally welcomed and has attracted largely favourable comments."
"I too believe that it represents an important stimulus for the education debate that is necessary at European and national level."
"I am not entirely happy, however, with the title of the White Paper."
"The use of the term 'kognitive Gesellschaft ' for 'learning society' in the German version is imprecise as well as inadequate, because general education must not be purely about cognition but must also comprise emotional, social and ethical learning processes."
"We must not lose sight of the aim of instilling values."
"For that reason I moved that the subtitle be amended to 'Teaching and learning - an ethically defensible way towards a knowledge-orientated society' , but that, unfortunately, was not adopted by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media."
"Be that as it may, I am pleased that another of my amendments was incorporated into the opinion of the Committee on Culture and is also reflected in Mrs Waddington's report - albeit in less emphatic form than I should have wished."
"It is about the importance of pre-school education for all, and especially for disadvantaged children, as a means of enhancing equality of opportunity and hence of preventing social exclusion."
"The nursery school, as the initial stage in the education system, must be the focus of far greater attention than has hitherto been devoted to it in most European countries."
"The findings of brain research show that a large number of skills and inclinations are established during the first six years of human life."
"The earliest possible introduction to general education, with special emphasis on artistic elements and on exposure to foreign languages in the context of games, promotes creativity and lays the foundations for a broad educational spectrum."
"This type of pre-school education can also prevent social exclusion, since it ensures that all children are given an appetite for learning through fun and games even before they begin primary school."
"This makes me hopeful that the Commission's 'second-chance schools' scheme, which - contrary to the wishes of the Member States - has already been launched, will become increasingly superfluous as the target of integrating all young people into the mainstream system comes closer to fulfilment."
"I agree with Mrs Waddington that, instead of 'second-chance schools' being set up as separate institutions, the conventional education system ought to be enhanced so that it is capable of offering a sufficiently wide range of courses and qualifications and of guaranteeing a global system which offers opportunities for everyone."
"I also believe that the role of teachers in the information society must assume far greater importance than is accorded them in the White Paper."
"Many teachers still regard the use of modern information technology as unnecessary, as something of a 'gimmick' that can be used on a voluntary basis, a passing fad that will not assume any great significance in years to come."
"They often feel uneasy at the prospect of all the new demands these innovations will bring."
"It is obvious that the role of teachers will change considerably with the introduction of these new technological developments. Although teachers will not entirely lose their conventional role as 'founts of knowledge' , they will certainly have to see themselves as more than this; they must teach individual pupils how to select, understand and use the data offered to them."
"Part of teacher training must therefore be focused on the increased use of new technology, which must also be the subject of continuous in-service training."
"In addition, the White Paper must place stronger emphasis on the key function of parents and the family, who must be drawn into the whole process of meeting these new educational demands."
"As the main representatives of our society, they must ultimately accept and support the new developments, though without losing sight of the important task of inculcating values."
"That is why I advocate a system of intensive training for parents."
"Finally, I should like to add a few words about the aspect of acquiring foreign languages."
"It is desirable, of course, that language training should be promoted, but I nevertheless consider it unrealistic to set our sights on a situation in which everyone speaks at least two foreign languages."
"I am intrigued by the Italian approach of primarily supporting the passive command of a language."
"That would lead to greater understanding between nationals of different Member States without the need for them to acquire fluency in the other language."
"It is unquestionably true that passive mastery of a language is far easier to achieve than active mastery."
"I find this approach interesting and worth pursuing in future discussions on the subject of language learning."
"On the whole, I am in agreement with the proposals in the White Paper, but I do believe that tangible measures will have to follow soon."
"I also welcome the report by Mrs Waddington, who addressed many other important issues."
"Cloning raises deep ethical, philosophical and practical questions concerning the use and abuse of genetic engineering and the commercialization of human genetic research."
"The cloning of human beings, whether experimentally, in the context of fertility treatment, pre-implantation diagnosis, tissue transplantation or for any other purpose whatsoever, cannot under any circumstances be justified and must be banned."
"Until a consensus is reached in our society as to whether cloning techniques should be permitted at all, cloning of humans and animals for all purposes should be banned in the EU."
"The patentability of such techniques and the resulting biological substances must now be prohibited and the proposed directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions amended accordingly."
"There must be an immediate withdrawal of all EU funding for research or development, whether provided directly or indirectly, for cloning techniques in animals and/or humans and the publication of a list of all such projects which have received EU funds."
"Mass production of animals through cloning techniques inevitably leads to the narrowing of genetic diversity of domestic animals, undermines the ecological basis of food production and debases the ethic of husbandry of these animals."
"The cloning of domestic animals leads to a new level of rationalization of livestock production, further stimulates the industrialization of agriculture and undermines any of the current attempts to reorient the CAP towards sustainable agriculture."
"We must convene a citizens' conference in each Member State to consider these questions and we must have a Human Genetics Commission to monitor and advise on all future developments."
"As a Green Deputy I was unable to support the compromise resolution which made no mention of animal cloning."
"In a debate provoked by Dolly the sheep, it is unbelievable that the other groups chose to omit any reference whatever to animals and settled for a weaker version of the resolution passed unanimously by this House in 1993 on human cloning."
"As politicians, we have a responsibility to address the difficult issues as well as the easy ones."
"The interrelationship between human and animal cloning is evident and as the previously insurmountable barriers between the species becomes invisible, we need to have the courage to call a halt to cloning all animals, not just human ones."
"The economic instruments which drive the research agenda include the protection afforded by patient law."
"If we are to ban cloning, then we must give practical effect to that ban by including a comparable ban in the patent directive."
"On the structure of an ethical review, I think we have got the emphasis completely wrong."
"It should not be a matter of which committee of experts is more expert than the other."
"It should be a matter of broad public consultation and debate in order to establish consensus in our societies as to the future direction and application of new reproductive technologies."
"The citizens should inform the administrators, not the other way round."
"Amendments to meet these objections have been rejected here today and I have abstained in protest."
"The new research findings from Scotland are frightening."
"Our opinion of this is totally clear: We cannot accept the cloning of either humans or animals."
"For us the ethical aspects carry great weight and we demand a total ban not just on the cloning of humans but also the cloning of animals."
"Cloning of animal tissue is totally contrary to our view on animals and how we should treat animals."
"The cloning of animals intended for slaughter leads to a further rationalisation of animal production, more far-reaching industrialisation of agriculture and also undermines our aim to change agricultural production in order to achieve an ecologically sound agriculture."
"It is important to establish that reseach projects within the EU should involve research into cloning."
"If this proved to be the case, these projects should be terminated immediately and all funding repaid to the EU."
"As a Green deputy, I was unable to support the compromise resolution which made no proper mention of animal cloning."
"In a debate provoked by Dolly the sheep, it is unbelievable that the other groups chose to omit any reference whatever to animals and settled for a weaker version of the resolution passed unanimously by this House in 1993 on human cloning."
"As politicians, we have a responsibility to address the difficult issues as well as the easy ones."
"The interrelationship between human and animal cloning is evident and as the previously insurmountable barriers between the species become invisible, we need to have the courage to call a halt to cloning all animals, not just human ones."
"The economic instruments which drive the research agenda include the protection afforded by patent law."
"If we are to ban cloning, then we must give practical effect to that ban by including a comparable ban in the patent directive."
"On the structure of an ethical review, I think we have got the emphasis completely wrong."
"It should not be a matter of which committee of experts is more expert than the other."
"It should be a matter of broad public consultation and debate in order to establish consensus in our societies as to the future direction and application of new reproductive technologies."
"The citizens should inform the administrators, not the other way round."
"Dolly, the world's first clone of an adult animal, may be a photogenic sheep, who looks well on the front pages of newspapers."
"But behind the nice photographs lurks a sinister threat to genetic diversity, the most fundamental principle of nature."
"Animal cloning should be viewed in the context of the BSE crisis and the negative effects of industrialized agriculture."
"Cloning would encourage excessive inbreeding and could lead to a rise in mental and physical disorders among livestock."
"How are consumers going to be shielded from the consequences of genetic pollution in the food chain?"
"Dr Ian Wilmut, the scientist at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute responsible for Dolly, has stated that there was nothing to stop the techniques he used being applied to human embryos."
"The idea that humans should be cloned would seem more akin to Hitler's thinking about the Aryan race than any responsible application of scientific progress."
"Cloning of animals also raises serious ethical issues about the cruelty which humans inflict on animals in the name of science."
"Later this week the European Parliament will debate a report about the Commission's failure to agree plans to phase out animal tests on cosmetics."
"There seems to be no political will on the part of EU leaders to stamp out the unnecessary suffering of animals and cloning will only lead to further experiments on animals and greater suffering for them."
"Cloning is the biggest problem currently facing the European Parliament, not so much because identical animals can be reproduced, which is necessary for the good of mankind that is always seeking a way of feeding itself, but because man himself is in serious danger, man who is unique and unrepeatable."
"Commissioner Cresson assured us that ethical and moral principles would be respected."
"However, we have to clarify what ethical and moral mean."
"Sometimes, if not frequently, it is the majority in the European Parliament that decides what ethics and morals are."
"Moreover, Mrs Cresson assured us that the Commission was consulting experts on the question of cloning, including high-level experts."
"But we need to quantify the experience of these experts and check where and in what environment they acquired it; we need to know where they come from and how they acquired their expertise, what their concept of ethics and morality is, whether they are from the left or the right or somewhere else."
"Only if we receive replies to these questions can we be sure of what the Commission tells us."
"I will vote in favour if I see genuine respect for ethical principles, real ethical principles, respect for the natural order, in which man is regarded as unique and unrepeatable, in which there are clear rules and definite norms that do not distort the created world."
"As a Green deputy I am afraid I cannot support this motion for a compromise resolution."
"I should gladly have supported any declaration that was at least as rigorous as our decision of 1993 in condemning the coordinated irresponsibility of industrialists, scientists and politicians which has now been demonstrated in the cloning of animals."
"We must not wait until the first wave of attacks has passed before we set about protecting the dignity of mankind."
"Human dignity is already under threat when animals are reduced to mere carriers of biological material, to the living meat factories extolled by Mr Pradier."
"With ideas like that, it will not be long until people are also categorized on the basis of their utility, with the superior beings gathered into the fold and allowed to live their lives in a world governed by the insane ethics of the possible and the inferior beings treated as walking sources of organs for spare-part surgery - an idea that might sound familiar to you."
"These are no Green delusions along the lines of Huxley's Brave New World but ideas expressed in the Bioethics Convention and reflected in the views presented there on the merits and demerits of human beings."
"That is why I personally feel very strongly that the European Parliament must emphatically and consistently oppose any attempt to erode this ethical position and must stand together against the cloning of any living being whatsoever and against any research to that end."
"On the scale of fundamental values, liberty is at the heart of any ethical debate."
"That is why, in health matters, the consent of the patient is an absolute prerequisite for any treatment affecting him."
"But if circumstances dictate that his consent cannot be obtained, then the consent of his parents or guardian may be obtained instead, at least if the expected results of the treatment are sufficiently clear and probable for this power to be delegated."
"On the other hand, if the treatment offers no benefit to the patient, it must be prohibited, because the starting point here is the principle that the consent is refused since it cannot even be obtained."
"That is the case with human procreation by cloning, whatever may be the method used."
"After all, when it comes to medical assistance with procreation, there is already a particularly serious ethical objection raised by the technique of micro-injecting spermatozoa into an ovum, since it involves a choice, a deliberate selection of reproductive cells."
"In the cloning of human beings, whether by segmentation of the egg or by transgenic technology, as was the case with Dolly the ewe, an absolute prohibition must be maintained."
"After all, the genetic characteristics of the new human being would be totally predetermined."
"It would be impossible to imagine a more comprehensive assault on his liberty."
"Insufficient thought has been given to this fundamental characteristic of human procreation: the fact that natural fertilization is totally indeterminate apart from the single voluntary act of the parents, which is their act of sexual union."
"This indeterminate nature of fertilization is the strongest original defence of human liberty."
"It has been partly set aside by medical assistance with procreation."
"What society has felt to be tolerable in order to remedy the infertility of a couple is already, in itself, a violation of this protection of human liberty."
"That violation must not go further."
"It should also be emphasized that both medical assistance with procreation and cloning methods confirm that the fertilized egg is indeed a human being."
"Contrary to the conclusions which some people have seen fit to draw from the spontaneous segmentation of the egg which produces identical twins, the uniqueness of the original egg which then gives rise to the existence of two human beings does not prove that that egg is not a human being."
"It is a human 'strain' , which then gives rise to two human beings, each with a different personality though with the same genetic material."
"But the difference between identical twins resulting from spontaneous natural segmentation and identical twins resulting from artificially induced segmentation is precisely that the former are indeterminate while the latter are under human control."
"The frontier which separates these two events is the same frontier that separates the sphere of human freedom from that of total slavery."
"The prohibition of cloning must, in any human society, be as fundamental a prohibition as the prohibition of incest."
"The main debate on the social consequences of scientific research established the need for social control over science. That may raise a conflict between freedom of research and other social values, but no-one should be scandalized."
"Science is not just an intellectual explanation of nature."
"Science is part of the praxis and its economic and social consequences in today's world are immense."
"They also represent power."
"These external consequences are the theoretical legitimation of regulating science by law."
"The regulation of scientific activity implies its integration into the social framework generally."
"Far from being restricted, freedom of research finds its fulfilment under the law. Only the law can reliably ensure the principle of freedom of research."
"Parliaments are responsible for good order in society and cannot tolerate the development of any scientific and technical activity without the necessary mechanisms being in place to evaluate risk and deal with undesirable consequences."
"If restrictions have to be imposed, that is an imperative of the democratic state."
"The social impact of genetics and public anxiety about uncontrolled advances underlie regulatory action at national, European Union and world level."
"So it is essential for the European Parliament to make a statement at this time, to reaffirm the right of each individual to receive a genetic heritage which has not been manipulated, to ban the cloning of human beings and to call for criminal legislation against any attempt to violate that law."
"That is essential if human dignity is to be genuinely protected."
"Having said that, it is important to forestall confusion about the current debate on control of techniques and cloning."
"A careful distinction must be made between cloning human beings and cloning cells and animals, which is an essential tool in biomedical research."
"Every ethical and legal safeguard must be put in place so that the essential rights and values of our society are preserved at all times, but we have no right to paralyse scientific progress when it is helping people fulfil their destiny as human beings."
"The equivocation demonstrated by many Members here on the cloning issue evidently stems from two (historically linked) fallacies:"
"The first of these is the ontological fallacy, which reduces reality to objects ; these are then contrasted with subjects , which are regarded as something quite different and inexplicable."
"This in turn makes the idea of identity a virtual impossibility, reducing it to the objective category of sameness ."
"Leibniz's metaphysical principle of the identitas indiscernibilium paves the way for an indifference observable in the domain of engineering science, an attitude of 'What I cannot tell apart, I have no hesitation in calling identical.' At some point, this 'undermined' identity is then quite conveniently repudiated, and the individual becomes the victim of his own technical reproducibility."
"The second is the ethical fallacy of absolving us humans from any type of responsibility for our fellow creatures, which are regarded as mere 'things' or indeed 'machines' , from any bonds of sympathy we might feel towards them."
"That engenders an attitude of systematic denial of responsibility for anything extraneous to ourselves, an egocentric withdrawal from the full implications of our own practice."
"That also throws the door wide open to misanthropic practices. Anyone who artificially defines us humans as something entirely detached from the community of living beings, of 'sentient beings' , to quote the succinct English expression, is capable of making other, no less artificial distinctions, for instance between mere humans and 'superhumans' or between 'subhumans' and 'proper' people..."
"Renault factory"
"Mr President, my explanation of vote comes at an appropriate time following the serious incidents and manipulations that have just taken place in this Chamber."
"The decision by Renault to close an industrial site at Vilvoorde should have been an occasion for careful consideration of the chain of causes and apparently irresistible forces that drove this reputable company to act in such a manner."
"Instead, all we were vouchsafed here today was a deluge of wrong diagnosis, hypocrisy and rabble-rousing."
"I have heard speakers saying that the only solution was to integrate the social protocol into the Treaty and establish a social Europe where decisions would be taken by majority voting."
"Yet social directives in themselves cannot save jobs when purchasers are finding products too expensive."
"In this respect, the European Parliament seems to me to be nourishing somewhat irrational notions of economics."
"I was also sorry to hear from certain quarters in this House, including some on the Right, calls for the demand to be supported by the restarting of the Structural Funds, a solution which amounts to stripping the tax-payer to dress the consumer, and even calls for job-sharing, a solution which again usually amounts to stripping the tax-payer, as always, but this time in order to dress the worker."
"I also heard speakers on the left casting doubt on efforts at budgetary restructuring, probably with the implication that it was necessary to be in a position to subsidize Renault in order to retain jobs."
"Unfortunately, that idea would merely take us further into the cul-de-sac."
"If we really want to make the human dimension Europe's priority concern, we have to pose the problem differently."
"The real situation is that although Renault is no doubt a victim of its own mistakes, it is also, like so many other enterprises, a victim of the global policy of free trade to which the Union has so recklessly opened its doors."
"The public are well aware of that, just as they are well aware that the single currency will call for even harsher adjustments and will thus increase the power of the steam-roller of globalization."
"For all these reasons the public are well aware, without needing to be told, of the responsibilities of Brussels which, throughout this debate, this House has made every effort to conceal."
"Mr President, I am bound to say that the fury of the socialists reminds me of Oscar Wilde's phrase about the rage of Caliban seeing his own face in the glass."
"After all, why are the socialists so vehement about this business unless it is because the Renault management was brought in by a socialist government, because it is made up of socialists, and because it is undertaking - extremely clumsily, I must say - institutional responsibilities entrusted to it?"
"I think the main issue here is the desire of the socialists to escape their own responsibilities."
"I voted against the motion."
"It did contain some very good things, but I voted against, because I believe we are making a mistake that mirrors the mistake made by Renault."
"We are rightly accusing that company of having misunderstood its role and the provisions of the law in acting as it has acted."
"But we are stepping outside our ground when we presume to give it advice and tell it that one particular strategic situation must be preferred to another."
"We are not paying the bills, so we must not make the decisions."
"Mr President, the Renault workers were in the gallery earlier, but they could well have been preceded by the miners, because the coal mines have also been closed and coal is to be brought in from Australia and Vietnam."
"They could also have been preceded by those workers in the steelworks whose blast furnaces have been quenched to enable steel to come in from Thailand."
"And they could have been preceded by the textile workers, because the European textile industry has been shut down so that textiles can be brought in from SouthEast Asia."
"And how hypocritical it all is, because if Vilvoorde is being closed it is because of Japanese transplants - five Japanese factories in the United Kingdom - because there are Japanese transplants in Spain and in Germany, because there are Korean cars."
"So, clearly, the structural funds have been used - that is to say that the European tax-payer has paid to create unemployment in the car industry, just as he paid for Hoover, which was relocated to Scotland and left France."
"As for reality, Ford understood what reality meant when it paid its workers so much."
"If the car industry is being closed down, the reason is that no one is buying cars, and if no one is buying cars, the reason is that there are 20 million unemployed, and if there are 20 million unemployed, the reason is that free trade in Europe has put them out of work."
"The motion for a resolution is a signal of solidarity with workers now being threatened by the closure of this factory."
"Just over a year ago we had a debate on an identical case of a decision to cut staff in readiness to close down a factory and move a production line away from Setubal. This was a decision taken by Renault."
"The same Renault factory, which enjoys Community aid and is closing production units built in the first place in order to receive them."
"This case demonstrates the existence of double standards in the Commission: the strictest rigour in order to apply liberalising competition rules; but no rigour in order to have European social rules complied with (rules on collectives dismissals and European company boards)."
"It also dramatically confirms the fact that a social Europe comes behind the Europe of the market and currency."
"The strong reaction by European socialists means that we do not go along with policies which entail firing workers against Europe and breaking the social consensus which is the very foundation of the European Union."
"Fortunately Renault workers in different countries have understood that their fight to face up to 'globalised' capital has to be united on an international scale and that the solution is not by withdrawing behind national frontiers."
"Unreservedly supporting their fight for the right to work, we also wish to say that it is identified with the fight for a social Europe and a policy based on active participation and in the popular fight."
"Having due regard to the quite appalling conditions under which Parliament voted on the motion for a resolution regarding the closure of the Renault works at Vilvoorde, we felt we should not take part in the vote."
"We would have preferred this vote to be taken in circumstances appropriate to the serious nature of the problem."
"To our very deep regret, that was not the case."
"The USA and the Far East are benefiting from the additional difficulties which European business is experiencing due to the closing down of the Renault car factory in Belgium."
"Many company boards are now discussing whether to move planned investments outside Europe."
"Renault should have followed the rules and consulted its employees before deciding to shut down the factory."
"However, the resolution from the European Parliament takes the matter even further."
"The claims and the condemnations will bring further difficulties for companies and consequently reduce their willingness to invest."
"The European Parliament aims to improve social conditions and employment, but the methods used are doing exactly the opposite."
"Employment in Europe will never benefit from companies being prevented from adjusting their position to face up to new competition.."
"We should instead be facilitating new company start-ups and attracting new foreign investment in Europe."
"Increased competitiveness, rather than more regulations, will make it possible to avoid 'the European model' collapsing socially."
"Renault is a State-owned company which has left it too late for any necessary changes."
"The fact that a multinational company like Renault has been subsidised by the EU highlights the drawbacks of those company subsidies from the EU which the EU itself actively encourages on a large scale through their own Structural Funds."
"The method is certainly deplorable, as Mr Chirac and Mr Juppé have asserted - it was the least they could say - but the substance of the affair is much more serious, and there are lessons to be learned for the future of Europe, if there is to be a future."
"Although I would remind opponents of the European Union and of Maastricht that Europe is not responsible for this intolerable situation, it is demonstrating its limitations and its inability to prevent the situation, just as it demonstrated its inability to prevent the relocations of undertakings from one Member State to another."
"Of course we must support the Belgian and French employees of Renault, and I do support them."
"But we must also provide support to the European car industry, and fight for a social Europe which prohibits such actions by management."
"The way to achieve this is through new European powers, new directives, stronger unionization of Europe and the mobilization of all Europeans who want different European policies and reject unbridled free trade."
"For this reason, although I unreservedly support the motion, I say that it is not enough."
"There are political responsibilities to be accepted."
"It is illogical to deplore the closure of a Renault works while accepting total liberalization elsewhere."
"Enough crocodile tears!"
"The resolution adopted a moment ago on the closure of the Renault factory in Vilvorde is a most important document in relation to European social policy."
"It is important because it goes beyond the case in point and reflects the relationship between European Union and industrial policy."
"The resolution does not deny either the problem of competitiveness or the need for restructuring, but firmly calls for respect for the rules."
"In fact, this restructuring and arbitrary closure contribute not only to rising unemployment but also to creating an economic insecurity that may have a serious impact on the growth of consumption, social conflict and, in short, economic growth in general in the European Union."
"It is important because it condemns the use of dismissals alone to resolve the crisis without patiently seeking alternative solutions, which is inconsistent with our attempt to construct a Europe that is more attentive to the problems of its citizens."
"It is important because it points out that the closure of large companies has a very adverse effect on the entire environment they have created and on the local area in which they operate."
"It is important, above all, because it blocks any multilateral decision-making and does not involve social consultation, which is typical of the unbridled capitalism that is breaking up the European social model."
"But this resolution is also important because everything that is said and written about Renault also applies to all the other identical or very similar situations that have occurred in Europe, even if they do not all come before the European Parliament."
"To give just one example: hundreds of workers in Monza are facing the same dramatic situation because Philips is moving its plants elsewhere."
"We are now in the process of negotiation and we hope that this very strong resolution will also help resolve the difficulties facing other workers in Europe."
"First, I must strongly condemn the methods employed by the Renault company, whose abrupt decision shows a scandalous disregard for the human aspect of the crisis affecting the company."
"I also acknowledge that the attitude of the management has been contemptuous towards the workforce, whose feelings of anger and confusion I understand and share."
"However, I also deplore the fact that the European Commission has not succeeded in providing for situations like this, and that the industrial policy pursued by the European Union has been incapable of dealing with the economic and social consequences of the necessary restructuring of certain large undertakings, especially those in the motor industry which have been so seriously hit by the crisis."
"In order to prevent any recurrence of this kind of situation, I hope that the European Union will in future take more effective action and encourage and support solutions which are less expensive in human terms."
"The EU has over a long period of time given priority to matters relating to the economy, trade, markets and competition."
"The time has come to push other questions higher up on the agenda, e.g. social and employment issues."
"To prioritise these matters is not the same thing as decisions being made by a supranational majority."
"On the contrary, these issues should be dealt with by Member States."
"The EU can for example set targets for employment while the measures to reach such a target are developed and carried out at the national level."
"The closure of the Vilvoorde site is just one more tragedy in a long list of works that have been closed down."
"Not only that, but this is a very high-performance unit, which has just been modernized."
"It all amounts to an intolerable economic and human waste."
"How can anyone fail to understand the absolute necessity of a European Union strategy of industrial policy?"
"Economic cohesion and social cohesion are indispensable and must go hand in hand."
"The European Parliament has been fighting for this for years."
"It is the globalization of markets - and not the integration of Europe! - that is forcing companies to make choices, to give notice of restructuring, to conclude alliances with third countries."
"To defend a make, know-how, jobs?"
"You might think so...."
"And yet the descent into the red, following years of profits, acts as a compass for the company concerned at the expense of the economic and social life of towns or even whole regions in France, Belgium and Spain."
"Information and consultation are first and foremost an expression of respect for another individual, for his work and for his rights."
"Back in the 1980s, the European Parliament had considered this question in the context of the social Europe that was to be constructed."
"There was much reluctance among most of the governments of the Member States!"
"We had to wait until September 1994 before the directive on European works councils became official!"
"Renault anticipated the European law and set up its own European works council in 1993."
"Do we have to remind Renault, which long seemed to be a jewel in the crown of the industry and of social progress, what that council implied? Article 1 of its constitution reads:"
"' The council of the European Renault group shall be a structure for information and dialogue relating to the strategic orientations of the group in Europe, in the economic, financial and social fields, and to major developments at European Union subsidiaries in so far as they have an impact at European level.'"
"Dialogue and consultation would have made alternative solutions possible."
"That is why our Parliament is calling for a study of the possibility of reducing working hours in accordance with the Rocard report, which was approved by our Parliament."
"Continuing training measures will also have to be proposed."
"Last week's Europe-wide strike is a real gesture of awareness by the workforce in favour of social Europe."
"The solidarity of the French and Spanish workers with their Belgian colleagues is something new!"
"I have always believed that a social Europe could not simply be constructed on a 'top-down' basis through regulations and laws."
"Are we seeing the start of a new balance of power between the European unions and the transnational companies?"
"I wish to express my deep solidarity with the thousands of Renault workers who were completely excluded from their management's tragic decisions, and with all those employed by the subcontracting companies which would then have to face the dreadful economic consequences of this closure."
"We have voted in favour of the resolution opposing the shutting down of the Renault factory in Vilvoorde."
"The resolution is an important statement by the European Parliament against an employer who has been shown to be ruthless and brutal to its employees."
"We identify ourselves with the Renault employees' fight for their right to work."
"As regards the resolution, we do not agree with the proposal to make the social protocol a part of the Treaty as that only would strengthen the supranational development of the European Union."
"Social rights can be guaranteed and made obligatory at interstate level, which is preferable."
"I deliberately took no part in this vote, to demonstrate my disagreement in principle with this kind of text."
"It annoys me that this House sees fit to adopt resolutions on any topical subject."
"While I would not go so far as to call it interference, I do think the subjects covered in these motions are really inappropriate."
"Of course I keenly deplore these lost jobs, and the methods employed by the company."
"And I hope that the European Parliament will not adopt resolutions of this kind in future, resolutions which simply record the facts and pass judgement on them. I hope that instead it will contribute to an effective industrial and social policy which will make it possible to avoid situations like this, which unfortunately bear witness to the serious crisis through which some sectors of industry are now passing."
"I should like to say something about the principles on which the independence of our proceedings are based, Madam President."
"At the end of the previous sitting we had a very long series of points of order."
"I shall not raise them again, of course."
"A good number of them referred to the independence of Parliament's proceedings and the fact that no influence of any kind should be exerted on them."
"I would now like to remind you of another principle, citing what the French call the principle of secularity, and what one might call in any language the neutrality of public institutions with respect to religious influences."
"On leaving the sitting just now, at about 2 p.m., I found - not for the first time - a religious choir performing in the entrance to the European Parliament."
"A talented choir, but a religious one."
"I am not disputing their talent or artistic quality, just..."
"(The President cut of the speaker)"
"Mr Hory, I do not know what happened there."
"We have a very full agenda, and we must press on with it."
"Perhaps you can let the Bureau have something in writing."
"But what you are doing just now goes beyond the Rules of Procedure."
"I am afraid I must rule you out of order."
"Madam President, I am citing the Rules of Procedure."
"Yes, I know you said which point was at issue, and that is clear."
"But if you wish to give more information than you have just done, then please do it in writing."
"We shall then take note of it, but we shall not have any further discussion on that point now!"
"Community Transit System (continuation)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on"
"the report (A4-0053/97) on the Community transit system by Mr Kellett-Bowman, on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry into the Community transit system, -the draft recommendation (A4-0054/97) on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System on the report of the Committee of Inquiry on the Community transit system."
"Madam President, as one of those who took part in the work of the Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System, I too must compliment Mr Tomlinson and Mr Kellet-Bowman on the way in which they did their job."
"I think that this report satisfied a need which was felt on all sides."
"I was struck by the willingness of customs services and forwarding agents to take part in the various discussions we held."
"I wonder if it might not be a good idea to see whether we could not put in place some form of structure which would allow these two groups to meet and discuss regularly under the auspices, for example, of the European Commission."
"The goodwill is there and I think we should make use of it."
"As regards the report itself: I find it so comprehensive that it is hard to know what to add."
"There is no doubt in my mind that if we have European rules, they need to be overseen at European level."
"So I think ultimately we shall have to have some form of European customs administration or other."
"I say ultimately, because it is unlikely to be possible for the time being."
"First there has to be co-operation, under the guidance of the European Commission."
"I think the role of UCLAF must be strengthened and the European Commission might also consider, though this is not mentioned in the report, the extent to which co-operation with Europol might be improved."
"I remember during the 1989 election campaign, when we were looking to complete the single market, that everyone was talking about strengthening customs checks at the Community's external frontiers."
"As we have seen, quite the opposite has happened."
"One of the first things to be done is to strengthen the external borders and I too am very much in favour of more checks by flying quads, of checking wherever checking is possible, throughout Europe."
"Greater use of computer methods, certainly."
"Special emphasis has been given to Switzerland."
"It is a weak link in the system."
"I think we should pay particular attention to Recommendation 29 which says that the Commission should produce an annual report on co-operation with Switzerland in the area of justice and all the rest of it."
"We now have this report."
"I think the real work is only now beginning."
"So I look forward with interest to the report which Commissioner Monti has promised us by the end of April."
"I think we can then embark on the long job of strengthening customs controls in Europe which lies ahead."
"Madam President, Mr Kellet-Bowman and Mr Tomlinson have already covered the substance of the report most excellently this morning so I am left with the slight problem that there is little else to add."
"One needs just to read the report."
"That is essential, because then the context becomes clear."
"But I have a couple of points to make."
"So far very little attention has been paid to the issue of the 100 % guarantee for sensitive goods."
"And one think which the report tells us is that the system for transporting sensitive goods by road has jammed up completely because of this 100 % guarantee and that these goods are now looking for other ways round, including smuggling."
"So I should like to hear a little more from the Commission about the prompt courses of action which might be taken."
"Listening to Commissioner Monti this morning, I had the feeling that he was rather dismissive of the problem of Switzerland."
"Because I do not think that we have solved it with our co-operation agreement between the customs administrations."
"Switzerland is a far more serious problem."
"It is of course too absurd to see professional butter smugglers on German television, standing proudly in their gardens telling ZDF how they do it, when we can do nothing at all to stop them."
"So we shall have to be rather tough in our negotiations with the Swiss, given their missed opportunity for honorary membership, on this question of those who protect the fraudsters operating on Community territory or with the territory of the European Union."
"The Dutch presidency was not represented at our previous debate on the Inquiry."
"It seems to be the case again this time too."
"I am doubly pleased because I think that when it comes to another section of this report, namely the need to improve investigation and prosecution, this is an area for the IGC."
"Without wanting powers in respect of investigation and prosecution to lie exclusively at European level, it is vital that Member States should agree on ways of making the European Union function as a kind of clearing house both for investigation, and thus the collection of information, and for prosecution."
"I have already heard it suggested in Dutch circles, by the Justice Minister I think, that there should be a European magistrate attached to Europol."
"I believe this kind of idea needs to be taken forward as a way of resolving the problems entailed in transit fraud."
"It seems to me, Madam President, and I hope this will be possible at the IGC, that we must devote all our energies to this whole problem, because it has not been addressed with sufficient vigour so far."
"Madam President, in the short time available to me I should like to point to the European Parliament's achievements in the context of the Committee of Inquiry's operations."
"And first of all, of course, to say that it has justified the idea of those who thought of the idea and undertook the responsibility of setting up a Committee of Inquiry in the European Parliament."
"Madam President, I must say that those achievements are:"
"Firstly, that the Committee of Inquiry established the groundrules, mainly procedurally, concerning how Committees of Inquiry ought to function."
"This Committee of Inquiry solved many procedural issues and in essence interpreted the Inter-institutional Agreement in the best possible way."
"Another achievement is that it succeeded in upgrading the problem of the transit system from a purely technocratic issue to a political issue, as indeed it is."
"I must say that if the Committee of Inquiry had not intervened, the impasse in which the European Union's technocrats had become trapped, would have persisted and led to a collapse of the system."
"We were literally able to save the system."
"A further achievement is that as a Committee of Inquiry, we were able to extract political commitments."
"This means that the Commission - and later, I think, the Council - have for example committed themselves not to extend the system until its computerization has been completed and unless the necessary reforms are carried out at the same time."
"Finally, I should say that not only did we secure political commitments but, in parallel, we have been able to differentiate the existing policy."
"I must tell you that we were faced by the following phenomenon: on the one hand, we had those mixed committees or groups between Member States and Commission officials concerning customs issues, which always agreed among themselves, but on the other hand, when we received answers to questionnaires from the 15 Member States, we found profound disagreements between the Member States, in flagrant contradiction with what the representatives of those countries had said and declared in Brussels in those mixed committees and working groups."
"In other words, the system was totally unreliable."
"I now hope that the Committee's conclusions will demonstrate that."
"Let me finish with two comments: first, the subject of Switzerland."
"Secondly, Recommendation No 23, with which we call for an extension of responsibility to the guarantee system."
"Guarantees cannot possibly be given on the basis of any 'freight forwarder's' 'word of honour' ."
"The carriers too must be involved, as well as the owners of the goods transported."
"Madame President, this is a good report that is being presented, the result of thorough and extensive work."
"We have learnt a lot about how the internal market, through deception and fraud, has become a profitable market for organised crime and especially how Switzerland is being in this context."
"Both legal and illegal economic players have taken full advantage of the internal market."
"The European Union and Member States have lost several billion ECU in VAT, duties and excise to the benefit of the organised criminals."
"As mentioned earlier by Mr Tomlinson: if a mere 1 per cent of the transits are fraudulent then 4.5 billion ECU will be lost to us, or in the case of 2 per cent, up to 9 billion ECU will be lost to us."
"The Commission must be criticised for being passive for so long."
"We have not reacted promptly to the increased number of frauds resulting from an out-of-date system."
"The collaboration between national Customs Departments must operate as if they were one and the same authority."
"So far, this has not been the case."
"The Commission must in agreement with Member States introduce a common policy for physical control applicable throughout the European Union, not just at the border points and there must be limits on journey times, as well as route restrictions."
"These regulations must be applied consistently by Customs Departments in the Member States."
"The first step is to computerise the outdated 1968 transit system."
"A computer system is however not one-hundredper-cent safe against tampering."
"The Commission must therefore also utilise other high level technologies such as for example optical cards."
"These are based on laser, cannot be erased and are able to store an enormous amount of data."
"They are of high quality, durable and can be connected to all types of computers."
"Criminals are well organised and exploit all of the system's loopholes and are at present one step ahead of Member States and the European Union."
"Together with the Member States it is now high time for the Commission to accept the implications of the free market."
"All the loopholes in the regulations of the European Union must be plugged."
"An effective physical control system at all borders as well as selective controls throughout the European Union must be introduced."
"New technology is a must."
"The Customs Departments in Member States must cooperate as if they were one and the same authority."
"Organised crime cannot be allowed to flourish any longer."
"It is time for the European Union and Member States to act."
"The Commission and Member States must actively carry out the recommendations made in the report."
"Madam President, the elimination of internal frontiers resulting from the single European market as of 1992 marked the take-off of the Community transit problem."
"In parallel with the vast and undeniable benefits derived from free movement since 1993, criminal organizations and unscrupulous economic operators have begun to find loopholes in the system and take advantage of the virtual absence of frontier controls."
"The high fraud figures, involving loss of fiscal income, are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of existing fraud. This is seriously depleting Community coffers and also means potential losses for law-abiding businesses."
"What is more, business, national authorities and the European Commission continue to contradict each other about the total figures for fraud, demonstrating yet again the depth of confusion and the urgent need for serious reform of the Community transit system."
"An illustration of that confusion is the extension of the Community transit system to the Visegrad countries."
"I want to put on record here that that decision was taken administratively, and not politically as such an important decision should have been."
"And the extension of the transit system to the Visegrad countries is a clear example of the need to deepen rather than widen."
"Computerization must be the first objective in the context of reform of the system, with over 18 million annual transit operations to be handled."
"It is clear from every point of view that the current system of despatching documents from one customs service to another is archaic, produces enormous delay and facilitates forgery of those documents and the stamps that accompany them."
"I must not fail to recognize here the giant strides made by various countries, including Spain, in the process of computerizing the system."
"The reform of Community transit ought to simplify operations for businesses as well as find mechanisms for customs and legal cooperation especially in terms of detection of fraud, imposition and implementation of sanctions, and control of discounts and exemptions."
"To conclude, I want to mention that many witnesses at the temporary committee of inquiry on the Community transit system talked about Switzerland or the Isle of Man."
"I want to talk about tax havens like Gibraltar as well."
"The Rock authorities are so lax that it has become a territory that encourages the problem we are dealing with here through money-laundering."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report presented to the House by the Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry, Mr Tomlinson, should not have had the title 'On transit fraud' ."
"It would be better named 'Report on self-delusion' ."
"The self-delusion in question is that we think we have succeeded in setting up the internal market."
"However, Mr President, the word 'internal' contrasts one area with another, external area, from which it is supposedly distinguished by some effective dividing line."
"In the case of the internal market, the dividing line is the single list of tariffs."
"But it is not sufficient for a single tariff list to exist."
"It must also be applied in an effective way."
"And the effectiveness of its application must be judged with reference to carriers acting in bad faith, because those acting in good faith will comply with the law through their own volition."
"If we ask any smuggler of Marlboro cigarettes what difference he sees between the market in Detroit and our own internal market - and such surveys in depth have been carried out by our committee - he would answer that the only difference perhaps is that in America he pays some taxes, while in Europe he pays no tax at all."
"The report has also sketched out the anatomy of the reasons for that situation."
"The explosion of fraud is due to fragmentation of the Community's customs services."
"Responsibility for compliance with the tariff list rests with 15 different customs services."
"Among those services we have removed a large part from the frontiers they had learned to guard, and in that way, we deprived them of part of their mission."
"However, we have not asked them to guard a real Community whole, we have not given them a true Community mission, we have not given them a sense of Community purpose, nor a Community conscience, nor even a service organised at Community level, which would of course settle the issue of a Community conscience."
"It is hardly surprising that chaos has ensued."
"Until we create a common customs service, let us not be surprised that smugglers move freely through our internal market."
"And that, I think, is the main message of the report presented to you."
"Correct and logical proposals for the reform of transit will not solve the problem if we continue trying to implement them within the framework of this fragmented customs service."
"Faced with this situation - which does not just apply to customs, since the situation is more general - many countries have decided that specially reinforced cooperation is needed between them."
"However, before having recourse to that last resort, would it not be right to consider where matters might have matured to the point when we might be able to establish a cooperation common to all?"
"And this, before we have recourse to reinforced cooperation, which is simply a euphemism for the hard core, to succeed where we can."
"What would be more logical than to have a common customs service covering a real, common, integral Community?"
"Madam President, Mrs Green said she thought it rather poor that so few people were present here at the start of this debate."
"I find it rather good that we can now work in an atmosphere of calm."
"Because what we saw here a short while ago was anything but calm."
"So I prefer to have Parliament as it is now."
"I think the Committee of Inquiry has been a very good thing."
"I myself am terribly alarmed."
"I am not a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and when you find yourself in the middle of all this without being a member of that Committee, it give you quite a fright to see what bad shape the transit system is actually in."
"If you had wanted to dream up a system offering maximum opportunities for fraud, this is the system you would have thought up, I think. I cannot account for it otherwise."
"The sums involved are staggering, as the report tells us."
"The Dutch Government has admitted that in the Netherlands alone there are outstanding tax and import duty arrears to a total of one billion guilders."
"A second point I wanted to emphasize was the question of the 10 % which Member States are allowed to retain for the purposes of setting up an efficient customs system."
"Most Member States retain more."
"The Netherlands fortunately does not, but nevertheless three-quarters of the entire customs and excise service is paid by Europe, a point which the Finance Ministry conveniently forgets to mention, though it is always quick enough to mention the sums it has to pay out to Europe."
"I think our Inquiry has shown up another potential problem, namely the danger that under the single market Member States may lose out on revenue, thereby depleting the tax basis so that as a result even more tax has to be drawn from that ready source of revenue, income tax."
"And in the context of jobs and the labour market that is the last thing we want."
"It is unfortunate that co-operation by the customs administrations is so poor."
"Many honourable members have already mentioned this."
"Likewise the case of those countries which cause us truly enormous problems, and here I fully agree with Mr Dankert who said that Commissioner Monti rather shrugged them off, I refer to Switzerland, the Isle of Man, Cyprus and Gibraltar too, countries which provide shelter on a large scale and refuse to co-operate in any way whatsoever even though they know that the European Union is being defrauded of tax and customs duties on a huge scale."
"Something has to be done about this."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, our committee of inquiry has proved that the European Parliament intends to fulfil to the letter its mandate to defend the interests of the taxpayers, and our task now will be to ensure that we actually put into effect the results of the excellent work performed over these last 15 months, a task that has to be undertaken together with the Commission and the Member States."
"But it must be remembered that, at a time when budgets are being consolidated in the Member States, our fellow citizens are suffering under so-called savings packages and that nobody can expect them to go on enduring cuts in pensions, in social security payments, in education, etc., while this Union and its Member States leave the door open to this type of fraud racket and look on as billions in tax revenue are lost."
"Another consequence for us will have to be that we begin at long last to formulate our policies along with those affected by them."
"We established that the Member States have cut thousands of jobs in the customs services."
"It is perfectly plain that those who remain there feel frustrated."
"At the same time we must take on board their experiences of this imperfect transit system."
"We shall have to speak at some time during the next few months, Commissioners, about our position on the system of preferences."
"That cannot only be a foreign-policy decision; we also have to know how to implement such a system, how to control it."
"We still remember well several customs people telling us that the various regulations of the common agricultural policy are virtually an invitation to fraudsters."
"Here too the Commission will have to make appropriate proposals."
"You will find that we, as Members of Parliament and of this committee of inquiry, will be on your side as you undertake this work."
"Madam President, I am pleased that I have been able to participate in the work of this temporary Committee of Inquiry; indeed, of having played a small part in bringing it into being."
"It was some two years ago, in the early months of 1995 that I collected the signatures of 25 % of the Members of this House to call for a Committee of Inquiry into the problems of Community fraud."
"I took that initiative because my constituents certainly do take seriously fraud against the Community, as Mrs Green said this morning."
"I remember an interview I had with former President Hänsch, when little seemed to be happening as a result of that request, and he said we should only use those powers if we were sure they would be successful."
"I can now say to the President they have indeed been successful."
"I pay tribute to the chairman of the committee and the rapporteur."
"That success has already prompted change in Community transit practice by the Commission, the customs services, transporters and freight forwarders themselves."
"It has even caused the smugglers to change as they have reverted to old-fashioned smuggling rather than Community transit fraud."
"But further work needs to be done."
"The Committee on Budgetary Control must keep hold of this."
"I have little doubt that Mrs Theato will see that will happen."
"It is simply disgraceful that the system is not yet computerized."
"There is not a bistro in this city where a cash card cannot be linked by remote link to a central computer."
"We must give customs officers at least as much modern technology as we give the average French bistro."
"The temporary Committee of Inquiry has exercised its powers as it did into BSE as an important new power of Parliament."
"These two committees have treated their role differently but in my opinion both demonstrate the value of the new procedure."
"I am pleased to see that the Council of Ministers has attended our debate and I thank them for that."
"On the conclusions: the Committee of Inquiry was right to hold back from proposing a single customs service."
"Just because the cooperation currently is not adequate, it does not follow that a single service would have worked better."
"The message, however, is clear to national customs services: we benefit from the single market, we want cross-Community trade to grow, and we want the customs services to cooperate, as it says: to operate as if they were one."
"That is not a bad aim for the customs services."
"It is not a bad aim for Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to express my thanks to Mr Perry, because of course it was his initiative that led to the appointment of this parliamentary committee of inquiry."
"The first committee of inquiry worked hard, and its work is starting to bear fruit."
"If you keep in touch with the media, in the Swiss, the Austrian, the Spanish media, across the whole of Europe, you will learn about cases that were once more likely to be swept under the carpet."
"Cigarette-smuggling, the smuggling of vegetables, livestock and meat, are on the agenda, and if we assume that a container of cigarettes can yield a profit of one million ECU, a container of alcohol can fetch ECU 400 000, a container of butter or meat ECU 45 000, or a container of sugar 12 000, it becomes apparent that smuggling is certainly a lucrative business."
"Individual States and the European Community are defrauded of tax revenues and excise duties, but honest dealers also suffer - the ones who pay their taxes as a matter of course and who end up having to pay higher taxes because the fraudsters have spared themselves that expense."
"And of course the insurance institutions also come off worse, which results in higher premiums."
"It is the European consumer who foots the bill."
"The European Parliament is a protector of the European consumer, and that is why it was necessary for the committee of inquiry to subject this whole issue to intensive scrutiny."
"It is also the case that the Community transit system entails expenditure, especially for those Member States whose territory adjoins the eastern border of the EU and which therefore have to assume a disproportionate share of the cost of customs controls."
"Consideration should be given to a compensatory payment to these countries from the Community budget."
"On the other hand we also concluded that the European Commission needs to engage in new activities, that the focus must be on ways of making these activities efficient, on potential streamlining measures, and I believe this would be of real benefit to the European Community purse."
"But another key point is surely the question of training."
"We urgently need the customs academy that was referred to, and it would be logical to establish that academy at a border, where the customs people, the types of officer who will be the trainees' superiors in practice, can provide training in customs clearance procedures."
"It is also important that a forgery-proof basic document should be issued, one which can also be copied, that the stamping process should be based on the latest high-tech methods, and that the paramount aim should be to organize considerably simpler, faster, more efficient, more transparent and far cheaper procedures - far cheaper for business and for the Community."
"Madam President, I too thank the rapporteur for his excellent work, together with the committee and its chairman."
"I must also say that from the Commission's initial replies it seems to appreciate that work and to have given an important undertaking."
"I want to emphasize one particular aspect raised in recommendations 14-20, judicial cooperation, because there is a very close link between the proposals on this and the more general strategy to combat fraud, a fight we know must be waged and where we are sadly making slow progress."
"I believe we must look at things as they are."
"We cannot try to combat fraud properly with palliatives or cumbersome instruments such as those we normally adopt within the third pillar, including conventions."
"The recommendations also refer to reciprocal recognition of proof."
"This aspect which seems to me to be raised in point 16 is directly related to the construction of a European legal area which will enable the judiciary to cooperate directly, unlike the present situation; as you know and as the appeal judges of Geneva whom we received here in the European Parliament recently noted, today the average number of replies to applications is between 2, 3 and 6 %."
"A judge who asks a foreign colleague for proof of criminal acts does not receive replies in more than 10 % of cases."
"Because we cannot tolerate all this, I believe that when we come to revise the Treaty we must set out a specific legal basis which will provide for this kind of judicial cooperation and lay down the conditions for a legal area confined for the present to the question of fraud, given that fraud undeniably involves large sums of money and comes under the competence of the Union."
"I would therefore call for these recommendations to be flanked by a strategy for putting the renewed fight against fraud at the top of the third pillar during the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Madam President, I want to congratulate Mr Kellett-Bowman, Mr Tomlinson, the committee, and indeed the staff who have worked so hard on this particular report."
"As other speakers have said, it does show Parliament at its most hard-working and efficient."
"I endorse the recommendations in the report and I think the report clearly shows that cigarettes offer the fraudster a huge mark-up between the duty-free price and the actual sale price right throughout the European Union."
"Illegal trade in cigarettes in my own city of Dublin accounts for 10 % of the total market."
"That is a huge figure, 4 % nationally, 10 % in Dublin."
"We should reflect also on the fact that it is not only organized crime that prospers: cheap cigarettes on the black market can help the manufacturer expand its market share at the expense of rivals."
"It is a very depressing feature of the availability of cheaper cigarettes that it encourages young people to smoke - and especially young females now who are beginning to smoke."
"Finally, I would appeal to those people who buy black-market cigarettes to remember that they are putting money into the hands of ruthless criminals who are possibly also engaged in laundering money from drugs."
"Madam President, the problem of fraud in the evasion of customs duties is one of the great unresolved challenges facing the European Union."
"This form of fraud costs the EU billions annually."
"It is as evident in my country of Ireland as in any other EU Member State."
"As has been said by the previous speaker, on some of the main shopping streets of Dublin illegal tobacco is openly sold, and this represents a considerable loss to the Irish exchequer."
"But it is also a source of frustration and anger for law-abiding citizens."
"I hope that this report represents the first stage in a concerted battle against this type of fraud."
"The wide-ranging recommendations contained in the report should be implemented, and soon."
"However, the most crucial ingredient in tackling this fraud is political will."
"The present situation, with 15 different Member States implementing 15 different customs regimes, is not conducive to success."
"It is now vital that the EU establish a framework for customs services effectively functioning as if they were one."
"This point is explicitly recognized by the Committee of Inquiry."
"It is now up to the Member States' governments to take the initiative provided by this report, and I urge the Dutch presidency to examine this issue as a matter of some urgency."
"The other vital ingredient, of course, is resources, and the excellent proposals contained in this report will not become a reality without adequate financing."
"Again, this is a serious matter for consideration by the governments of the Member States, and finance for these measures would be a good investment on the part of the EU."
"The initial expenditure required to tackle this fraud would be more than compensated for by the gains in revenue by the Member States."
"There is a key role for EUROPOL in the implementation of this report."
"There is no doubt in my mind that the same individuals involved in this trade are also involved in drugs and other such activities."
"Striking a blow against transit fraud would also represent a positive step against organized crime, which is one of the greatest problems facing the European Union."
"Madam President, the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into fraud in the Community transit system has investigated thoroughly and produced a very readable report."
"My compliments to it for this."
"It emerges very clearly from the report that when the single market was being put in place neither the Member States nor the Commission had the slightest idea of the opportunities for fraud it created for those whose intentions were dishonest."
"The fact that customs administrations were cut back instead of measures being taken to offset the disappearance of the internal borders speaks volumes here."
"I am happy to endorse many of the recommendations which the report makes for measures to counter customs fraud."
"But I emphatically distance myself from the call for a Community customs service as referred to explicitly in the Treaty and implicitly in the recommendations."
"In this regard I support the minority opinion at the end of this report, which recommends primarily that co-operation by Member States should be intensified."
"I also disagree with the report's recommendation that UCLAF should be converted into a European fraud detection agency."
"It is striking that the Committee of Inquiry says that failure to set up a Community customs administration is a violation of the subsidiarity principle."
"But that principle applies only to policy areas in which the Union shares powers with the Member States."
"Justice affairs and investigation are not part of them."
"Nor must they be."
"They represent vital functions of the sovereign national states which make up the Union."
"All things considered I shall vote in favour of the draft recommendations because they include several good ones and because ultimately a European customs administration is not in fact included."
"I have listened with great interest to the debate which the House has just held on the report of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Community transit system."
"May I start by complimenting you and congratulating you on completing this report."
"I am grateful to the Committee of Inquiry for this most important investigation."
"The Committee was the first to get down to work since the European Parliament secured the right of inquiry under the Maastricht Treaty and my particular thanks are due to Chairman Tomlinson and not least to reporter Kellet-Bowman."
"Speaking personally, I should like to extend my tribute to Parliament as a whole."
"I think it was a good choice of subject here."
"Secondly, the timing was right, thirdly the job was tackled in a practical manner and, fourthly and very importantly, useful information has been gathered from society itself."
"I think that this should be the norm in future inquiries."
"I am glad that a precedent has been set."
"The fact that the report you have debated broadly involved all the parties concerned and that the views of the business world were widely canvassed as well, will undoubtedly have been helpful in this analysis of the problems which have beset this sector for ages now."
"This involvement also reflects the importance which Parliament attaches to the link between governments, business and industry and ordinary people in Europe."
"More generally, the efforts of the Committee of Inquiry have once again made it plain that Parliament too wishes significantly to boost efforts to tackle fraud involving EC budget funds."
"The Council too, together with the Commission and European Court of Auditors of course, is committed to this."
"High priority must be given to countering fraud and to the better management and scrutiny of Community resources."
"After all, fraud and the poor management and waste of these resources undermine Europe's credibility in the eyes of its citizens."
"Measures against these things are of paramount importance."
"For this precise reason I repeat that I welcome this Inquiry."
"Transit fraud involves a number of aspects."
"On the one hand the very basis of the single market is threatened and particularly the free movement of goods."
"This is crucially important to prosperity in Europe."
"On the other hand, and the report points this up as well, there are complex problems in customs co-operation which play into the hands of the fraudsters."
"Please understand if I refrain for the moment from commenting on the substance of these on behalf of the Council."
"The report has not been discussed by the Council so any comments on it by myself would be premature."
"What I would say is that in the recent past, partly as a result of the Committee of Inquiry's activities, much has already been done at both Community and national level to combat transit fraud."
"In 1995 the Council adopted a resolution calling for computerization of the transit system by 1998."
"And agreement has recently been reached on a customs cooperation treaty between the European Union and Switzerland."
"This opens the way to solving part of this problem."
"I should also say that since the European Council in Dublin the high-level group on organized crime has been set up. This will shortly be reporting and will shed considerable light on these matters."
"It has addressed the strengthening of Europol's role in this kind of matter and the question of contact magistrates and justice cooperation which Mr Dankert mentioned."
"I will of course brief my colleagues on today's debate."
"It goes without saying that the Council will give close consideration to the report and its recommendations and will attach its own conclusions."
"The presidency will endeavour to get the report placed on the agenda as soon as possible."
"The same goes for any proposals which the Committee may wish to make."
"At the end of the current presidency a progress report will be given on these activities which I shall ensure are pursued with the utmost vigour."
"Measures against fraud are a top priority."
"The European citizen is after all entitled to powerful and efficient protection of the funds in Europe's coffers."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Council, I have listened with great interest to the statements on Mr Kellett-Bowman's report and on behalf of the Commission I want to sincerely thank all the speakers for their important political contribution to the debate."
"It is clear that at this point the debate is looking towards the implementation of the reforms of the transit system and, more generally, the reform of the customs policy."
"First of all, it has emerged very clearly that the transit problems are not technical, sectoral questions but represent a political problem that involves the entire customs system; secondly, the functioning and very credibility of the single market, the core of European integration, are at stake here; thirdly, a problem of this scale, with such major implications, calls for global solutions that combine all the planning, prevention, management, monitoring and control measures in a unitary strategy."
"The completion of the single market depends on this reform and on a range of changes to customs policy and, I would add, to the policy on duties."
"These aspects must and will take up their rightful place in the action plan on the single market which the Commission will be presenting to the European Council in Amsterdam."
"It is also clear from Mr Kellett-Bowman's report and from the debate to which we have all listened with great interest that it is rather artificial to draw a distinction between the first and the third pillar and increasingly difficult to defend doing so."
"We need effective measures at European Union level in order to protect the interests of the European tax-payers and the European citizens."
"Investigation into fraud is most important, as some speakers have pointed out, but prevention is equally important and the Commission intends to confront this challenge head on, together with the 15 Member States."
"Let me emphasize that the Commission is prepared to assume its responsibilities."
"Parliament has clearly demonstrated its commitment in this matter; I hope the Council and the Member States will do the same - and we have just heard an important statement from the President of the Council - by making their political contribution and rapidly adopting the proposals put before them."
"Finally, let me give warm thanks for the words of appreciation addressed to the European Commission, which I would also like to extend to our services, who have worked very hard with me."
"For the rest, we will all continue to cooperate fully with the European Parliament."
"Let me once again congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Kellett-Bowman, and the chairman, Mr Tomlinson."
"Madam President, I just wish to address a word of thanks to both the Dutch presidency and the Commission and add a sentence with a question to each of them to take away with them."
"First, to the Commission, because it has reminded us that there may well be additional costs involved if it follows the recommendations - and I heard it from both Commissioners."
"I just ask them to ensure that the Commission, as a collegiate body, accepts its responsibility for including those costs in the preliminary draft budget for 1998 and not to leave it to Parliament to do its job for it."
"Second, to the Council: I noted very clearly and welcomed very much that the Dutch presidency said it would draw its conclusions and will produce a report."
"I should like to ask the Dutch presidency to ensure that that report is formally and officially communicated to Parliament so that it can be taken into account in the continuous monitoring of the follow-up."
"With those two questions, I thank both the Commission and the Council for their active participation in this debate."
"Thank you, Mr Tomlinson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Albania"
"The next item is the situation in Albania, with Council and Commission statements followed by a debate."
"Madam President, partly in reply to oral questions to the Council from MEPs Ahlquist and Bianco, I am happy to report in detail on the alarming situation which has arisen in Albania and the steps which the European Union has taken so far as a result of it."
"To enable us to understand the situation, let me outline briefly the background to the present crisis."
"To begin with, the political and economic reforms in Albania which followed the upheavals of 1990-1992 proceeded smoothly, but in the run-up to the parliamentary elections of May/June 1996 the pace of the reform programme slowed."
"Fiscal and monetary policy became less rigorous, leading to an excessively large budget deficit and a rise in inflation."
"Consequently Albania no longer met the criteria of the International Monetary Fund and new tranches of the structural adjustment loans provided by the international financial organizations were frozen last year."
"During the 1996 parliamentary elections the OSCE observers identified irregularities which favoured the Democratic Party of President Berisha."
"The Government of the Prime Minister, who has now resigned, was thus very short on legitimacy and credibility."
"The present political and economic crisis prompted by so-called pyramid investment schemes has to be seen against this broader background."
"These pyramid schemes began a few years ago when Albanian workers living abroad transferred their earnings back into the country, a country which did not have a properly functioning banking system."
"Most of these schemes involve little if any economic activity and are purely speculative."
"Most of the Albanian population invested in them."
"They put in not only their ordinary savings, but often sold their houses, livestock and so on."
"The total amount invested in pyramid schemes is not known, but the International Monetary Fund puts it at about one and a half billion dollars or 40-60 % of Albania's current gross domestic product."
"When these schemes collapse in a country which is still extremely poor, the economic and social consequences are thus enormous."
"It is feared that hyperinflation and massive poverty may result."
"There are also major political repercussions, especially as the present Government ignored the warnings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank and some members of the Government may also have been involved in the pyramid schemes."
"Confrontations in the country quickly became acute after the beginning of the crisis at the end of 1996."
"Between Government and opposition parties, between the north and south of the country and between Government and people."
"The public is demanding that the Government compensate them for their losses."
"The Government cannot do so."
"Government and opposition parties accuse each other of seeking to make political capital out of the crisis."
"Particularly in the south of the country where the socialist party, the erstwhile communists, traditionally have their power base and where the pyramid funds have since gone bust, the tensions are at fever pitch."
"Countless citizens have looted weapons from the army and police."
"There have been killings and woundings."
"It is feared that sizeable numbers of refugees will flood into Greece and Italy and that the tension may spill over to the Albanian population in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Kosovo."
"Constant talks are going on between the European Union embassies and Albania about foreign nationals living there."
"Unless foreigners have pressing reasons to remain in Albania they are being advised to leave the country until further notice."
"As regards measures by the European Union, I can tell you this."
"The European Union held consultations about these alarming developments at a relatively early stage."
"This prompted the decision of the General Affairs Council on 24/25 February to send a high-level official joint mission of the presidency of the European Union and the Commission."
"This mission took place on 27/28 February."
"In talks with its opposite numbers in Tirana it particularly stressed the need to refrain from violence and to respect democracy."
"All political forces in Albania were also urged to resolve the crisis through dialogue."
"In talks with President Berisha, Prime Minister Meksi and Minister Sheru and the leaders of various opposition parties, the mission also found the attitudes of both Government and opposition to be extremely inflexible."
"Since then, following that mission, the situation in Albania has worsened further."
"The Meksi Government offered its resignation on 1 March, on 2 March a state of emergency was declared, on 3 March President Berisha got himself re-elected by parliament for a new five-year term."
"Press freedom has been curtailed by extensive censorship."
"The work of journalists, both Albanian and foreign, has been made impossible."
"In the light of this further worsening of the situation the European Union has sought, through closer consultation with all the parties involved, to help control the political conflict and create conditions for stability so that the country can resume its process of reform."
"Given the special position of a number of Member States of the Union, the Council President, Mr van Mierlo, accompanied by the European Commission, held consultations in Rome and Athens on 6 March on the situation in Albania and then went on to Tirana for talks with President Berisha and members of the Albanian opposition."
"Shortly before the EU presidency arrived in Tirana President Berisha and the political parties agreed on a statement."
"This pledged support for the restoration of public order and called for people to surrender looted weapons within 48 hours."
"The President promised an amnesty to citizens who obeyed this call and had not committed any crime."
"Military operations would also be halted against those in control in a number of towns in the south."
"The President would, on the basis of as broad a consensus as possible, start consultations for a new government and a new prime minister."
"Lastly, a committee would be set up to ensure transparency in respect of pyramid schemes."
"The parties to the statement announced their intention of holding the dialogue in public."
"During the visit by the Council President meetings were held with President Berisha and representatives of six political parties."
"Mr van Mierlo also met twice with his Albanian counterpart Sheru."
"In all these talks he deprecated all forms of violence and pressed for human rights to be upheld."
"In his talks with President Berisha the EU President emphasized the need to restore freedom of the press, including access for all parties to state television."
"Given the present Government's lack of legitimacy and inadequate democratic credentials, Mr van Mierlo told President Berisha that if order was to be restored a parallel course had to be set offering the prospect of a new parliament and a government with sufficient support."
"To this end democratic requirements had to be met such as a new constitution and a new electoral law."
"An interim government, as broadly based as possible, should ensure these developments and restore order to the economy."
"The EU presidency urged the President to announce elections quickly, to be held at a time acceptable to all parties."
"The OSCE would have to be closely involved in this process of democratization."
"The President was then urged to hold prompt consultations with the personal representative of the OSCE President-in-Office, former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitsky, who was due to visit Tirana on 8 March, the day after the visit of the EU presidency."
"In addition to these parallel lines leading, on the one hand, to the restoration of public order and, on the other hand, to the opening of perspectives for democracy, the problem of pyramid investments needs to be settled."
"Cooperation with the IMF and World Bank would seem appropriate here."
"The presidency urged this course of action too."
"In talks with members of the opposition the EU presidency took this same line."
"They were made aware of their heavy responsibility to prevent further violence and were asked to use all their influence to prevent further violence in the south and to ensure that weapons were surrendered."
"The presidency also endorsed the recommendation of the Council of Europe, which had a parliamentary mission visiting Tirana at the same time; this urged the opposition, out of respect for the principles of democracy, to take their seats in the Albanian parliament and take part in its work."
"To conclude: unsurprisingly, the views of President Berisha and the opposition were very different."
"President Berisha was unwilling to yield to violence and thought that the calling of elections at gunpoint would set an undesirable precedent."
"He thus saw no reason for concessions until such time as weapons had been surrendered."
"The opposition, however, believed that by handing in its weapons the south would put itself completely at the mercy of President Berisha's Government which it considered undemocratic."
"Without extensive concessions beforehand the people would not accept this."
"They also denied having enough influence in the south to persuade the people not to use violence."
"Given these diametrically opposed positions, it follows that the significance of the aforementioned joint statement of 6 March by all the political parties was not clear."
"The presidency told the Government and opposition parties that the European Union was prepared to provide further support for economic and democratic development in Albania, as long as the country made it possible for the EU to do so by restoring order and making internal changes."
"If necessary the Union could also provide emergency aid, but I would make the point that Albania has already been receiving considerable aid since 1992, per head of population actually the highest amount given to any country in Central and Eastern Europe."
"The presidency hopes that the progress made in recent days can be consolidated."
"President Berisha has indicated his agreement to a government of national unity and early elections and has in the meantime appointed a member of the opposition to form a broad coalition government."
"This is an important step towards a more lasting solution."
"And I welcome the efforts being made by the Italian Government to foster dialogue between the Albanian Government and the opposition further."
"The presidency will liaise closely with its colleagues in the EU and the OSCE to monitor the situation and where possible to take further steps to end this serious and unstable situation."
"Madam President, the Council President has given a detailed and clear account, so the Commission can be brief."
"Naturally I endorse Mr Patijn's words and, as you heard, the Commission was part of the missions to Tirana."
"I think I can say that this debate is most timely."
"Now that a compromise has been reached between the Berisha Government, between President Berisha and the opposition, partly at the prompting of the Council presidency of the European Union, of OSCE missions headed by former Chancellor Vranitsky and missions from the Council of Europe, it is vital now that pressure is brought to bear to ensure that this agreement is indeed adhered to rigorously, both by President Berisha and the opposition parties."
"The agreement provides for a transitional government of national unity which is being formed now and subsequently for measures to prepare for general elections in June."
"Madam President, I strongly urge the European Parliament to pass a resolution calling on all the parties to act on this hard-won compromise and to adhere strictly to its terms."
"And I have my reasons."
"We have in the meantime spoken to members of the opposition who have the feeling at present that the rebellion cannot be suppressed unless President Berisha resigns."
"That would be a direct breach of the agreed compromise."
"Consequently, whatever one may think about the legitimacy of the Berisha Government, or what it has or has not done in the past year, whatever one thinks about the precise motives of the various parties making up the opposition, all of which together concluded this compromise with President Berisha, one thing is certain: if this compromise is not complied with, anarchy will reign in Albania and the rebellion will indeed be uncontrollable."
"It is thus for President Berisha and for the opposition to urge the rebels to lay down their arms and re-open the way to normal democratic relations."
"If that does not happen, we fear that the future looks black for Albania, and the only ones to suffer will be the people of Albania itself."
"Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, I cannot but endorse your appeal for support in your endeavours, at least on behalf of my own group, although I am sure I speak for every other group too."
"I also agree with you that all parties must now signal their determination to make this compromise succeed."
"To that end, it must be made perfectly clear both to President Berisha and to the other parties what will happen if it does not succeed."
"I assume you have the full backing of Parliament on this point."
"Now is certainly not the time for criticism or for asking whether the signs could or could not have been read in time."
"But I should like to state briefly that some factors must make us think, must make us wonder why we are suddenly faced with this desolation in the Balkans."
"All of us - I say 'us' deliberately, for I do not wish this to be perceived as referring to a handful of people - have relied very heavily on one person."
"In other areas of European security policy too, it sometimes happens that, when our interlocutor is a person at the head of the State, a person we can trust, we believe that this is enough to make things happen."
"Albania has proved that this is not the case."
"I was in Albania myself."
"I also spoke to President Berisha."
"We really have allowed undiluted capitalism - I might almost say exploitive capitalism - to develop after the dictatorship, in the wake of the most inhuman system seen in Europe in recent times."
"The so-called freedom under exploitive capitalism - perhaps even in conjunction with the political system - has ultimately impoverished very many people."
"I therefore believe it is time to pursue a preventive policy here."
"If I consider the explosive situation that could develop if a spark were to fly towards the neighbouring region of Kosovo, which will also be the subject of a resolution here, Mrs Pack having been there with a delegation a short time ago, it is not only legitimate but also absolutely essential to initiate political intervention and to try and guarantee human rights - which is precisely what have been unable to do in recent years in Albania, as elsewhere - and prevent the emergence of huge floods of refugees."
"We are all aware of the suffering this causes, and we all know from our own countries how people's basic attitudes can become a problem when unnecessary influxes of refugees occur."
"That is why I believe you have decided on the proper course of action, and we can continue with political intervention if we pursue it vigorously with the support of the entire European continent."
"Albania is ablaze and Kosovo is in turmoil."
"If the spark flies, there may be nothing left to save."
"Let us extinguish the flames of crisis in Albania before it is too late."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Albania is extremely difficult, as we have just heard."
"Unfortunately, many Western press reports from that country have done nothing to clarify the situation but have confined themselves to laying the blame on President Berisha and his Government."
"Let me say, however, that the source of the troubles in southern Albania is not political, but lies in the collapse of the pyramid investment schemes and in President Berisha's attempt last autumn to put an end to Mafia activities, especially in the southern part of Albania."
"Many speculators and crooks who were defrauding ordinary people saw their financial success evaporate and exploited the misery of these people for their own ends."
"Sadly, the opposition, consisting largely of old Communists - whom not even their political soul mates in the Socialist International would accept as members - also used this situation for the political purposes they had failed to achieve through the ballot box."
"I do not share the opinion of the Council representative that everything went wrong last year."
"The fact that the local elections in September produced the same results as the elections in March shows how the outcome of the March election is to be judged."
"I am not speaking of the irregularities, which were eradicated, and I believe you should also take account of that."
"For these reasons, when you speak of the Berisha Administration, you must proceed on the assumption that it is a legitimate government."
"The proclamation of the state of emergency has to be understood, or so I believe, in the light of the despotism to which the people of the south have been subjected."
"Which Western Government would stand by and let that happen in its own country?"
"May I say to the representative of the Council that the dismantling of a legitimate Government with Western assistance is, I believe, unprecedented."
"When similar things were happening in Russia, not one of you would have dreamed of cutting Mr Yeltsin adrift."
"The idea that the old faces of Communism, who bear responsibility for the lack of democratic traditions, are now supposed to establish democratic conditions under pressure from abroad is grotesque."
"The Berisha Government has made considerable progress towards democracy and a market economy, as this Parliament unanimously acknowledged last autumn."
"It is therefore wrong to lay the whole blame at President Berisha's door."
"We know full well that he is not without fault."
"But the reasons for the terrorism and anarchy in the south are to be found elsewhere."
"It must also be said that we have scarcely any conception here of the antagonism which has existed for hundreds of years between various regions and is now erupting into open hostility."
"The arrangement that has now been concluded between President Berisha and the opposition parties must be implemented by both sides, and so I cannot accept being approached today by anyone asking me to help ensure that Mr Berisha leaves the country and receives asylum somewhere or other."
"I do not believe that this is the proper way to honour an agreement."
"The European Union must help to create democratic structures, to promote education and training, to establish market structures backed up by a genuine system of social protection and to promote investment and thus create jobs."
"Should the arrangement that has now been reached by President Berisha and the opposition fail to take the heat out of the situation, which I must sadly assume, since the origin of the crisis is not political - a fact we are trying to demonstrate here - an international task force will have to be sent in to restore peace."
"There is one point on which I am in full agreement with the Council representative: I too am in favour of a thorough examination of the occurrences in Albania."
"The rising is spreading and moving northwards. On the television we all see people bearing arms - yesterday on the television I saw young children with weapons - and moving around all over the country."
"These are very threatening things. At the same time, the government seems increasingly unable to control the situation."
"I do not agree with Mrs Pack. The economic scandal was a reason, but one that was the tip of the iceberg."
"The crisis was older than that, the situation was explosive even without it, and we too bear some responsibility."
"Sometimes, when I look at some of the Union's policies, I get the impression that we are like those parents who think their duty is done when they have filled their children's pockets with money."
"They themselves are never there, and they never supervise what that money is used for."
"That is what we have done with Albania, to which we granted aid - and very rightly so - and which we must continue to aid if it is to emerge from the present crisis."
"But we must maintain a presence and know what happens to the aid we give."
"On the other hand, we supported President Berisha, sometimes provocatively so, under the impression - which is something I do not understand at all - that he, as he says, was not formerly a communist."
"But President Berisha has not appeared out of nowhere!"
"The situation in all those countries is peculiar."
"We supported him without warning him about certain consequences of his acts, and the results they would have - and we have seen those results."
"Now, the chaos is threatening to spread all around. We all know very well how problematic the area is."
"We know what is happening in the countries neighbouring Albania, and we know that two of them, which are Member States of the European Union, Greece and Italy, could be facing direct problems. Indeed, Greece shares a common boundary with Albania."
"What must happen now?"
"We must help, of course, we must talk with all the political powers in the country, because otherwise developments could surprise us greatly."
"And this, as the Commissioner said, in a spirit of compromise."
"But we must at long last work out a long-term policy and maintain a presence, not just keep paying out."
"Madam President, it would take too long - and we do not have the time - to examine the distant causes of the extremely serious and devastating crisis that has hit Albania, the decades of economic weakness and total lack of democratic or even basic structures."
"The situation we are confronting is clearly extremely difficult: there is a danger that outbreaks of violence could spread to neighbouring Kosovo, with the risk of mass migrations towards Greece, Italy and other European Union countries."
"But it would take too long to go into all this again."
"I believe that today Parliament has something to say to the Council and the Commission."
"In our view the relations that have been established are correct and timely and the line taken by the Council and the Commission over the past weeks of worsening crisis is a positive one that deserves Parliament's support."
"This line involves three demands, that are also set out in the document to be submitted to Parliament tomorrow for its consideration: firstly, a government of national unity, and it seems to me that this has been achieved with the appointment by the President of the Republic of a prime minister from the opposition; secondly, the holding of new elections; thirdly, the undertaking given by the European Union, and by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, to give financial aid to Albania, subject to full respect for freedom of the press, the reestablishment of democratic rights and economic normalization measures in that country."
"We believe these three points are fundamental."
"Of course certain countries, such as Greece and Italy, play a particular role, but we want to emphasize that they must do so in the framework of the European Union's policies."
"Madam President, the events taking place in Albania do not come as a bolt from the blue."
"In our opinion, at least, they are the result of the policy exercised towards Albania and its people by the governments of some Member States and by the European Union's bodies."
"They are the result of the many-sided aid and support given to Mr Berisha's antipopulist and autarchic regime."
"The elections marked by violence and irregularities, the despoiling of the peoples' savings and the country's very economy by the unscrupulous Berisha regime, have not only received no condemnation by the United States and the European Union, but on the contrary, I think they have even had and still have substantive support and approval."
"Some of us here, therefore, share responsibility for the explosion of the Albanian people."
"Despite this, we are still unable to draw the necessary conclusions and we continue along the same slippery path, trying to solve the problem by suppressing the popular rising and by comprehensive and all-round aid to Mr Berisha."
"We cannot understand that in Albania there is now a new reality imposed by the people's rebellion, which is already finding political expression."
"Madam President, Albania's people are up in arms and are calling for two things: Mr Berisha's departure and the return of their money."
"If the European Union really wants to show solidarity towards the Albanian people, it must adopt and demand promotion of the following four points, which have already been stated with related amendments:"
"First, the Berisha regime must come to an end."
"The electoral process must establish a new President and a new Parliament."
"Second, the people rebelling in the South must be represented in the political processes, through their political representatives."
"Third, the leader of the Socialist Party and all political detainees must be set free immediately."
"Fourth, generous military and economic aid must be provided at once, aiming both to compensate the citizens and to strengthen Albania's economy."
"Finally, I would like to express my complete opposition to any plan for the intervention of international military forces in Albania, a thing which could lead to unforeseen situations all over the Balkan area."
"Madam President, we are facing a truly dramatic situation, with the risk of civil war in Albania, a risk caused not only by the collapse of the pyramid investment schemes that we discussed last month too, but also by the reactions of a government, Berisha's government, which has little by little proved to be more a regime than a government, reacting with authoritarian measures to the popular demonstrations by the Albanians and ending with intimidation of the opposition press, a government whose representative, Berisha, no longer represents the people, as we saw from those demonstrations, and which had already shown signs of lack of democracy when we condemned the elections that were held in a manner that was anything but democratic."
"Despite all this, he found nothing better to do than to have himself re-elected President of the Republic for another five-year term."
"In face of this situation we must not forget either that a month ago we as the European Parliament had expressed our serious concern: the day after those elections, which were rigged, we expressed our deep concern about the consequences this could have, consequences which would, to say the least, prejudice the democratic dialogue between majority and opposition."
"As early as 8 February 1994, the Member who preceded me in this Parliamentary seat, Alexander Langer, stated that Albania was not yet a normal democratic state, that ordinary democratic life was not yet fully developed, and called on all the European Union institutions to confront this situation, for if we are not able to confront a situation such as the Albanian one, how can we hope to confront all the problems of Eastern Europe as a whole?"
"For these reasons, the European Union, the Council and the Commission must undertake to promote a new détente based on the formation of a new government, on new elections held under the aegis of the OSCE; we also propose the appointment of a special Council envoy for south-eastern Europe to monitor the situation and to represent the European Union there on a permanent basis."
"As has been said, if this crisis widens, it could have disastrous consequences for Kosovo, for Macedonia, and ignite the entire Balkan area."
"Clearly, Parliament cannot fail to support and approve of the attempts to reach a political settlement to the civil tensions presently afflicting Albania."
"The Group of the European Radical Alliance therefore supports the process of national reconciliation agreed upon by the various political forces in Albania; however, this process seems as yet to have failed to convince the Albanian public, which has risen up against the outrage perpetrated against it by the so-called pyramid saving scheme, a demonstration of all the worst excesses of a free economy."
"Furthermore, we have learned that within the last few hours the anti-government insurgents have apparently begun to march on Tirana."
"Might we take this opportunity to question the relevance and validity of European Union policy, which has already been found lacking on several occasions in this region?"
"We had felt that the collapse of communism would automatically lead to democracy."
"The reality is that it is the hardest possible way of learning democracy, amid all the after-effects of communism."
"We had also believed that all anti-communists would necessarily be democrats."
"The reality is that we had so ruthlessly abandoned half of Europe to its fate for forty-five years that the only anticommunists whose voices could still be heard were, in some cases, the wilder variety of liberal economists or adherents of some form of ethnic or religious obscurantism, or even autocrats - unrepentant former communists in many cases."
"Today, there are three political conclusions we can draw from the Albanian crisis."
"The first, emphasized by Mrs Daskalaki, is that we must stop allocating European aid without worrying about the use made of it in societies that are ill prepared for liberalization."
"The second is that we should as a matter of urgency establish a European military force capable of intervening, at least, in crisis situations arising within Europe."
"The third, more general, is that we should stop bickering and push ahead with the enlargement of the Union without which Europe will remain an amputee, cut off from half of itself, and that in order to achieve that we must encourage regional regroupings instead of imposing a totally unbalanced procedure of dialogue on weak and isolated nations."
"Madam President, once again, sadly, the European Union has bungled, as it has done in so many cases."
"The mistake it makes is always the same: unable to find a united and effective political line rapidly, the Union hopes to make up for its political deficit by opening its purse, but money alone does not help resolve problems and sometimes even exacerbates them."
"It happened in Bosnia, in Mostar, in Zaire, and it is happening in Albania today."
"In October, when the first signs of the Albanian crisis emerged very clearly, Europe responded with: ' let's give Albania some money' , i.e., give it to the Berisha regime, closing its eyes to the obvious abuses and electoral rigging by the president."
"Since then, in the space of a little more than four months some ECU 500m have poured into Albania, the most generous per capita aid the European Union has given."
"It hoped that this injection of funds would stem the tide of the crisis, whereas it actually precipitated it; when the crisis worsened a fortnight ago, the European Union merely mouthed words and did not even manage to convene the summit of the foreign ministers of the 15 called for by Greece and Italy."
"A week after the start of the insurrection, a technical committee met - note that this was a meeting not of ministers but of ordinary officials of the EU Member States - to identify a common line of action for the Political Committee."
"At present the Council seems to be flying a little higher; what I have said represents a further condemnation of the lack of a common foreign policy; in its absence, we cannot talk of Europe or of integration."
"Madam President, the President-in-Office told us that we have granted vast amounts of aid to Albania and indeed over the past five years we have given that country 450 million ECU."
"The question is, what good did that do to the Albanian people, and of course to us."
"I think I can tell you: it created a savage and barbarous capitalism in that country, which has incited its citizens to rebellion."
"And secondly, we created an autarchic and anti-democratic system."
"Furthermore, between 1992 and the present day, there has been an orgy of arms and drugs smuggling in that country."
"We also know about the economic structures that were created, the pyramid."
"Over that period, those five years, we devoted very little time to what should have engaged our attention, namely unemployment, the flight of hundreds of citizens to neighbouring countries, and of course, we did nothing about the elections in May 1996."
"We Socialists at that time called for the elections to be repeated. Unfortunately, you took no heed of us."
"And without any reason, we accepted that law about genocide, which excluded dozens of opposition politicians."
"Even today, we still tolerate the imprisonment of Fatos Nano."
"I think we should call for the immediate release of the only person who could probably still restrain those who have rebelled."
"The events in Albania have shown us how difficult things are in Balkan Europe."
"And I think there is one positive factor: the Presidency has acted correctly."
"It listened to the countries with experience and a prolonged presence in the area - Greece and Italy - and operated effectively."
"I think the Commission's actions have also been positive."
"However, we must persist."
"The problem is indeed a political one."
"If Mr Berisha really loves his country, he will have to let others in his party and from the other parties govern that country, and he ought to leave calmly and quietly so that the Albanian people can solve their own problems."
"Madam President, I must say that the slogan we all ought to adopt, not just Parliament but the Council and the Commission as well, is 'not another Bosnia' ."
"The experience, the bitter experience we all have from the way we handled matters there should lead us to act differently from the way we acted in Bosnia."
"I listened carefully to what the President-in-Office of the Council said, and of course all that is correct and we agree, but he proposed nothing specific."
"My question, to which I would appreciate an answer, is this: is there a mechanism?"
"In other words, has the Council decided to create a mechanism for the solution of the crisis, which is now being applied and has specific mandates to take decisions on subjects related to the solution of the crisis in Albania at a political level?"
"And is the same thing happening on the part of the Commission, which manages the economic aspects and of course includes a Commissioner who has proved that he knows how to deal with external issues?"
"That is the kind of information we want, because here in Parliament, as tomorrow's vote will I hope show, at this stage we are avoiding the adoption of positions and any criticism of either side, considering that the situation in Albania is so fluid that the most important thing is to be able to maintain some level of political dialogue."
"I call upon the Council not to rest easy on any of these matters."
"It cannot be left to Italy and Greece to solve that problem."
"The Council must create a framework within which those two countries can operate - as Mr La Malfa too said earlier - the Commission, and above all the Council must address the issue."
"Inactivity must cease, the Ministers must be convened, to create a group that will work on a solution to the crisis and will remain constantly vigilant and make its presence felt in Albania."
"Parliament will I hope decide to send to Albania the Delegation on Relations with South-Eastern Countries for an on-the-spot investigation to keep the European Parliament informed."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the dramatic events of the past seven weeks, during which Albania has been sliding ever deeper towards breakdown and chaos, as a result of the economic disaster caused by the swindle perpetrated by the finance companies more than ten years ago, which has put thousands of families into penury, are being observed with great attention and concern by the international community and in particular the neighbouring states, Greece and Italy, which risk an influx of waves of refugees whose circumstances could be exploited by criminals."
"Mrs Pack is right to call on us not to make hasty or partisan judgments, such as some I have heard in this Chamber."
"President Sali Berisha agreed with the opposition on guidelines for a political solution and managed to achieve an agreement on setting up a government of national reconciliation made up of all the political forces and working towards national peace; at the time, the opening of a dialogue was greeted with shouts of joy and of rage by the rebel towns."
"Under the agreement, the president called on the parliament to pass a new law granting a general amnesty to all civilians or soldiers who took part in the revolt following the collapse of the finance companies, provided they handed in their weapons, and announced new elections within two months, monitored by international organizations, as already happened in the last administrative elections, which were proved to have been fair."
"He also called for financial aid for reviving the economy and humanitarian aid for the hardest-hit parts of Albania."
"In Valona there is currently no light or water and living conditions, especially from the health point of view, give cause for concern."
"In the light of all this it is therefore necessary to make the utmost effort to approach this delicate problem in a balanced, calm and unbiased manner in order to resolve the situation and continue the process towards further democratization, paying particular attention to the cultural integration of this important part of the Mediterranean basin."
"Madam President, it is great to hear that a transitional government has been agreed, that elections will be held within two months thanks to European pressure, but despite this the news reported by the media is not exactly good."
"I am afraid that civil war is imminent and I wonder how the Council and Commission and indeed all of us can prevent that."
"Anyway, I am glad that the Council President laid it on the line to President Berisha last weekend."
"Berisha's authoritarian and undemocratic behaviour is one of the reasons for this crisis."
"The Council President was right to warn him against using force and quite properly urged him to respect press freedom and democracy, an admonition which he will probably ignore, as observers expressly complained he did at the time of the elections."
"Madam President, the Union is a big neighbour of Albania and its biggest provider of aid."
"Per head of population it is the Albanians who have expected and received the most from Europe."
"I am curious to know how these promises for the future will stop the Albanian Government and the Albanians themselves from cutting each others' throats so that we end up with a situation of a little country with big poverty."
"The Union must remind all the parties where their responsibilities lie, must show military restraint and point towards democracy."
"Let us hope this is not the last time we get to talk about Albania, but that next time we do so on a positive note."
"Madam President, I listened both to the President-in-Office and the Commissioner, and I hope that all they told us will take place and progress in the best possible way."
"I would just like to express once more three minor reservations, because if I remember rightly, we had the same debate about the Bosnian situation."
"Firstly, are you taking account of the complete split that exists at this time in Albania between the central political scene and its machinations, and the armed insurgents devoid of leadership?"
"Today, Commissioner, as we speak, they are just 40 km from Tirana."
"Secondly, are you aware of Mr Berisha's complete untrustworthiness within and outside the country, in economic matters, and in every respect?"
"He shares the blame for the pyramids. He did nothing to stop the pyramids, as you told us."
"He shares complicity in the highest degree."
"How can you contemplate any sort of agreement with him?"
"And thirdly, unless there is some promise on our part, not from the Albanian regime which is completely untrustworthy, that those who lost their money in the robbery of the century - 35-40 % of Albania's national income - will get back at least their starting capital, do not expect any optimistic outcome in Albania."
"Madam President, I too regard it as a notable success of the European Union's recent initiative that the majority and the opposition have accepted the path proposed to them, the path of agreement, of national reconciliation in two important points: a more united government and the announcement of new elections."
"At the same time I consider it regrettable that the Dutch presidency, in its recent statement of position, did not refer to Parliament's February resolution which foresaw the risks of the situation in Albania and pointed the way forward by agreement."
"Let me add that, unfortunately, the agreement on the formation of the new government was reached with some delay, in a situation in which the two parties no longer control the country; we must be aware of this because otherwise we run the risk of discussing an imaginary situation."
"This aspect must therefore be firmly underlined and brought to the attention of the Commission and the Member State governments."
"We must realise that there are not just two forces in play in Albania now, but that there is a third force, the rebels, weapons in hand, whose violent action we have rightly condemned and must continue to condemn."
"However we know that this force, which will be difficult to silence by the agreement, does not regard as sufficient the two points of the agreement between the majority and the opposition to which we referred; it also demands the disappearance of Berisha from the scene."
"So new complications can still develop in this situation."
"We must not think we have reached a definitive political solution."
"We have merely opened the way for a possible political solution which, among others, must be pursued immediately so that the government can be formed rapidly."
"Further steps will have to taken towards effective stabilization."
"I believe that the European Union must intervene directly and play a major mediating role, seeking also to make contact with the third force in play, the armed rebels, in order to persuade through negotiation to lay down their arms."
"Throughout this phase we must of course coordinate economic action with political action."
"As Mr La Malfa said, economic action and political conditions must go hand in hand."
"I also believe that the Albanian question should lead us to reflect on the limits of monetarism, which was quite clearly and evidently a fiasco here, and to realise the need for political action to re-establish a Europe that is political and not just monetary."
"Madam President, I too believe that this Parliament must not turn away from the essential question, which is to restore a minimum of authority in Albania so that order can be restored in a situation of crisis that risks sparking off a dangerous civil war."
"I agree with Mr Occhetto that there is a third force in play. At present the rebels control 13 towns and have occupied a quarter of Albania and they are in possession of a large quantity of arms, so that Albania risks becoming a large arms depot without any guards, as one member of the opposition put it."
"The situation risks going beyond the control of both Berisha and the national coalition government."
"So I cannot agree with Mr Occhetto when he says that the disappearance of Berisha from the scene could ease the situation."
"Let me draw your attention to a comment made by a member of the opposition, namely that at this moment Berisha is essential to the restoration of a minimum of law and order, which would otherwise become more difficult, and that the weapons stolen by the nine thousand rebels in the north could lead to a risk of civil war between north and south, along the lines of ancient linguistic and tribal divisions."
"So what is needed is to bring all the components together."
"I agree with the proposal by Commissioner van den Broek to try to create a minimum of legality, starting from the agreement reached between Berisha and the new opposition government and the job entrusted to a representative of the Socialist Party who, coming from the south, could try to finalize this agreement."
"The European Union and the Council must take all the appropriate measures; in this context I note that the WEU, when it met in Athens, expressed its own practical position on the question."
"As the President said, we must not only observe events but act with far more determination to achieve at least the minimum objective of avoiding the present serious risk of civil war and the breakup of Albania."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Council, I believe that what has been greeted as a success for Europe, the very fragile truce achieved in Tirana, is nothing of the kind."
"Indeed, the European institutions should cry mea culpa for their inertia up until today, leaving aside the disbursement of a whole range of economic aid, which was in many ways useless and at times schizophrenic: first we abandoned Albania politically, then we elected Berisha a national and international hero, then we dropped him on the grounds of fraud and undue pressure during the elections."
"Today we should not be surprised to see the situation suddenly worsen: the factions are out of control, out of any kind of control, either by Berisha or by his opponents."
"I therefore believe that at this point Europe must assume its responsibilities for the future, especially for what was not done in Albania."
"We should not be surprised if the various situations in the Balkans worsen politically and then degenerate into civil war."
"That is why it is so very important for Europe to say mea culpa and to conduct itself in a different manner."
"Let us follow the example of those who invest in peace, in stability and in human rights!"
"Madam President, in my view the compromise reached is, at this point, the only instrument that could put an end to the violence."
"I therefore join in the Commission's appeal to Parliament - and will do so in the resolution tomorrow - to press for its implementation."
"It is true that the riots have not ended: in reality there is no truce, there is simply an agreement that needs to be implemented and there is the risk of Kosovo becoming embroiled."
"I agree with Mr Occhetto that we need to take direct measures for the south of Albania, as the Italian government is endeavouring to do through the presence of our ambassador in the south."
"I believe that Europe therefore has every reason to attend to this aspect, in order to put an end to the riots and help the country hold new elections."
"In my view the European Parliament's main task is to bring about the announcement of new, orderly elections. We all know these would be the first orderly elections given that - and we too are guilty here - we supported a government and a president although we knew the election had been rigged; we decided on this approach, this support, in the name of monetarism and financial commitments."
"We made mistakes, yes, but we must not make new ones: we must therefore encourage orderly elections."
"Let us see whether, with the direct support of certain governments - I am thinking of the Greek and Italian governments - and a major commitment by the European Union, we manage to make the necessary contribution, for otherwise, as has been said, there is a risk of civil war."
"Madam President, the Members who spoke before me have indicated that the situation in Albania has gone completely out of control."
"An undemocratic regime, combined with unscrupulous economic exploitation, has reduced the entire population of that country to destitution."
"Although it is impossible not to sympathize with these people, and although their sense of despair is more than understandable, any resort to arms must be clearly and roundly condemned."
"Civil war would be no solution in this situation."
"It would only further exacerbate the crisis."
"A way out of this dilemma must be found now."
"The escalation of violence has to be halted."
"It is good that the first move has been made to resolve this crisis together so that democracy can finally be given a chance in Albania too."
"The creation of an all-party coalition and the announcement of democratic elections are first steps along this path."
"We very much hope that all parties will now comply with the agreement, but these are all only first steps."
"What is more important is that the new Government that is subsequently elected and the new Parliament should also make it their duty to implement democratic and economic reforms."
"It is obvious that people in Albania will only be prepared to lay down their arms if they are offered a democratic and prosperous future."
"The European Union bears responsibility not only for the development of Albania but also for the development of the entire region."
"It is regrettable that in recent years almost every time we in the European Parliament have spoken about developments in the Balkans it has been in connection with crises."
"Although we have concluded cooperation agreements with many countries in the region and even association agreements with some of them, and although we are trying, through the PHARE programme, to give active support to the reform processes in those countries, developments there have repeatedly taken us by surprise."
"As this debate draws to a close, the request I should therefore like to make to the Commission is that in future we, that is the Council, the Commission and Parliament, discuss how democratic and economic reforms in those countries can be better and more effectively supported and how we can target the PHARE programme more selectively."
"I believe we can help the population more effectively in that way than by merely appearing as firefighters whenever there is a crisis."
"Madam President, we face a situation of the utmost gravity."
"Neither President Berisha nor his government are blameless in the existing situation."
"As you know, the OSCE/ODIHR report criticized the recent elections."
"Everyone agrees the failure of the investment pyramid-schemes has been a tragic occurrence for numerous Albanians who have lost their life savings."
"The government has allowed this to happen."
"But we must get this matter into perspective."
"There are still in the country numerous individuals who are members of the Hoxha regime."
"There is strong evidence that in the south of the country there are links with the Albanian mafia, with their drug smuggling operations to Italy and elsewhere."
"I remind you that one of the main reasons behind the problems arising in the town of Vlorë was the impounding of 100 high-powered speedboats, many used in trans-Adriatic smuggling operations."
"The EU must show understanding of the situation."
"More than ever there is a need for a cohesive approach amongst all Member State governments and international organizations to this problem."
"President Berisha has shown some belated wisdom in bringing an all-party coalition government, and now a socialist prime minister, into office."
"He needs to be supported, not castigated, but he, for his part, must be helped to recapture the confidence of the Albanian people by showing absolute respect for the law and the constitution, enforcement of human rights and the holding of fair elections."
"These should be carefully monitored with assistance from the European Parliament amongst others and the media, too, should be supervised by the European Institute for the Media."
"The implications of civil war and escalating violence are of immense and imminent proportions, not just because of Albania itself, but because Albania is a powder keg."
"In Kosovo, already a tense situation, over 80 % of the population are of Albanian origin."
"In Macedonia a substantial minority are Albanian."
"Both these countries could become involved."
"Neighbouring Greece can be sucked into the problem."
"Madam President, to conclude: we need to see a cohesive, balanced and strong approach to the plight of Albania."
"Disunity, delay and weakness can set the Balkans alight."
"This must not happen."
"We cannot allow another Bosnia through lack of resolve: we must set up a crisis mechanism; we must have a single body for dealing with the situation."
"We hope to see action upon these things."
"Madam President, the European Union's policy in Albania, with its support for Berisha, was a mistake."
"If the Council had heeded the European Parliament when Fatos Nano was arrested and had done something about that, if it had listened to the European Parliament after the irregular elections, if it had taken note of the European Parliament's resolution last month and acted immediately, or even if it had kept its distance from the Berisha regime like the United States, things would perhaps have been better today."
"This legitimacy of the Berisha regime cannot now continue."
"The President-in-Office of the Council cannot come here and say 'yes, we are calling for new free elections, because the previous ones for the Albanian Parliament were not free' , and then accept a President who was elected by that illegal Parliament under conditions of martial law."
"And that is not all."
"Mr Berisha must go, and the sooner the better, because that is the basic demand of all those who live in the South of the country and because it could bring an end to the process of civil conflict and unrest in Albania."
"With this in mind, I call upon the President-in-Office, if he wishes to be constructive, to say 'yes, the Dutch government is prepared to give all the necessary guarantees and immediate political asylum to Mr Berisha, so that the situation in Albania can be unblocked' ."
"And one more question: are the Council and the Commission going to raise with the present Albanian government the issue of freedom for the political detainees, and especially Fatos Nano?"
"I would like an answer from Mr Van der Broek."
"Following my detailed statement I will repeat that the presidency and the Council are monitoring the situation in Albania hour by hour."
"In so doing we call on the EU embassies in Tirana and we maintain very close contacts with the governments of the European Union Countries most directly affected, in Rome and Athens."
"At the same time we are continuing unrelentingly with our initiatives vis a vis the Berisha Government and the other political parties."
"Our parallel objective is the restoration of public order in the immediate future and that can only be done if we pursue our second objective: the credibility of the Government must be restored by means of democratic reforms and elections within a period of a few months."
"It is primarily in the interests of the Albanian people that total anarchy should not take over in Albania."
"Secondly, it is important for the region as a whole that this most unfortunate situation should not produce a ripple effect."
"In answer to the previous speaker's specific question about political prisoners, I can confirm that the subject was raised by the Council President during his visit to Tirana."
"Madam President, I am happy to echo the words of the Council presidency and would add that in Albania the fuse is smouldering."
"The explosive situation there is a threat not only to Albania's own people but also to her neighbours and the whole of the region."
"So I think we have to ask ourselves whether it is not time to consider how far President Berisha and the previous Government and indeed the opposition parties or others are responsible for the serious acts of violence we have seen."
"Whether it is not time to consider and to press, collectively and with one voice, for the advice which we ourselves gave to the President and opposition parties that they should form a government of national unity and announce elections, whether it is not time to insist forcefully that the political compromise reached should be carried out as it stands."
"Since that is the only chance which the people of Albania will in fact have in the short term of having a democratic say in how their future should be and also of coming to terms with the past."
"Lastly, Madam President, surely we must see to it that the parties to the compromise, the parties which signed up to this agreement, not only carry it out rigorously and faithfully, but also that each of them calls on the rebels to lay down their arms and put an end to the violence, expressing their opposition via the ballot box rather than the gun."
"If Council, Commission and European Parliament can send that powerful message a last chance will perhaps remain."
"If it does not work we shall have nothing to reproach ourselves with, but it seems to me that efforts to undermine the compromise which we ourselves recommended does no service to the credibility of the European Union."
"Madam President, a number of speakers have referred to the coup d'etat developing in Albania."
"A number of organizations - the OSCE, the European Union, the Council of Europe - have been to Tirana and have engaged the government in discussions."
"What concerns me if there is a developing crisis that may have an effect on other countries, is that there should be some mechanism for crisis management between these organizations and including defence organizations like NATO and WEU."
"Can the Council confirm that at the meeting on Saturday of foreign ministers this point of crisis management and coordination - contingency planning - will be on the agenda in case the situation gets worse?"
"Albania does not feature as such on the agenda for the informal meeting of foreign ministers, but it will certainly be discussed."
"Given the current situation I think the ministers will be forced to consider it."
"I can neither confirm nor deny that military preparations have been made by NATO, the Western European Union or any other organization."
"I do not think it helps to clarify the position of the European Union countries if I speculate on military intervention in a civil war."
"That seems to me one of the last priorities which we in Europe should have."
"Madam President, I just want to remind the President-in-Office of one question. He could answer me with one word."
"I asked him whether the Presidency has taken or is taking an interest in the release of all the political detainees, including the leader of the largest opposition party, the Socialist Party, Mr Fatos Nano."
"I would like an answer from the President-in-Office as before, particularly about Mr Fatos Nano."
"I thought I had already covered the honourable member's question."
"The matter was raised by Mr van Mierlo during his visit to Tirana."
"This gentleman, Mr Fatos Nano, was also expressly discussed."
"The debate is closed."
"I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled on the basis of Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Welcome"
"On behalf of Parliament, I welcome a delegation of Members of Parliament from ten Mediterranean States which are signatory to the Barcelona Convention."
"We welcome them."
"I am sure you would also want me to say to them on your behalf how much importance our Parliament attaches to increased co-operation with the Mediterranean countries."
"We know that this offers us a prospect of stability and peace, and this Parliament is devoting as much effort to consolidating its relations with the States of the southern Mediterranean seaboard as it is to strengthening its relations with the eastern States."
"We are well aware that peace depends on this balance."
"Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!"
"(Applause)"
"Follow-up to the Barcelona Conference"
"The next item is the report (A4-0027/97) by Mr Sakellariou, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the joint report by the Presidency of the Council and the Commission on Mediterranean policy - follow-up to the Barcelona Conference (7987/96 - C4-0414/96)."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, just under 16 months after the Barcelona Conference of 27 and 28 November 1995 and a good month before the follow-up conference in Malta, we are to debate in the House today a report which seeks to evaluate the results of the first Barcelona Conference and to put forward new proposals and requirements for the follow-up conference, which will be held in Malta this time."
"I should like to start, Madam President, by saying how delighted I am that today's debate is taking place in the presence of our fellow parliamentarians from the Mediterranean countries with which we founded this special EuroMediterranean partnership in Barcelona."
"I believe we are experiencing the start of a special form of parliamentary cooperation that can enrich the Barcelona process and generate fresh momentum to the quest for peace, security, economic development and understanding between our cultures for the benefit of our peoples on every side of the Mediterranean."
"I bid a warm welcome to our colleagues in the gallery."
"In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and in the Committee on External Economic Relations, as well as in almost every relevant delegation and joint committee, we have been holding detailed discussions on the various aspects of our Mediterranean policy."
"I have received a wealth of suggestions and support from other Members. I should like to thank my colleague and friend, Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos, whose name stands for many others and whose opinion on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations provided very valuable additions to the report before us."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the results of Barcelona, in the form of the unanimously adopted Barcelona Declaration and programme of activities, but also the results of the work that has been carried out since the conference, are particularly encouraging."
"Especially in the domain of the political and security dialogue, which has become one of the main pillars of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, impressive results has been achieved."
"A list of confidence-building measures has been drawn up and a plan of action devised, which serves to guide the work of the competent departments of the Commission."
"But I believe that the core element in this domain is the formulation of a Euro-Mediterranean charter for peace and stability, through which dialogue and crisis-prevention are to be institutionalized."
"That is precisely what this Parliament is seeking too."
"For this reason I believe that, in our debates in the European Parliament as well as in our dialogue in the framework of the parliamentary Euro-Mediterranean forum, this charter should serve as a focal point."
"A whole series of other valuable proposals in this domain are on the table."
"It is the joint responsibility of Parliament, the Governments and, of course, the Commission as well to ensure that laudable declarations of intent are turned into specific practical policies, serving to promote peace and security for all nations of the region."
"From the huge catalogue of tasks for the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, I should like to refer in particular to one point that I personally believe to be extremely important."
"Migration has always played a prominent role in cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Mediterranean."
"That will not change in the future either."
"But the increasing economic disparities between the countries which people are leaving and those to which they are migrating, compounded by unresolved employment and social problems in the latter, have resulted in a combination of cheap populism and crass racism from intolerant die-hards, which has given rise to increasing discrimination against immigrants."
"The position of the European Parliament against racism and xenophobia is not only well known but also exemplary."
"It should serve as the basis for a policy of non-discrimination within the scope of the new partnership."
"We need a contractual framework for regulated immigration, and we must formulate together - a task which I regard as eminently suitable for a parliamentary Euro-Mediterranean forum - a charter of immigrants' rights, in which the differing interests of a governmental and humanitarian nature would be harmonized."
"I shall conclude now by taking the liberty of switching to Spanish, in order to address Vice-President Marín in his own language:"
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission, Manuel Marín, for his support and his personal commitment to Mediterranean policy."
"Your staff and you yourself have always given us inestimable support."
"I hope this fruitful cooperation will continue and indeed increase in the future."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I look forward to the debate on my report and thank you for your attention."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Sakellariou on a very comprehensive report."
"I would also like to join with him in the congratulations to Commissioner Marín for the efforts he has made in relation to this subject."
"Also we must not forget the initiative taken by the Spanish presidency which got the Barcelona Conference off the ground."
"Clearly in the situation following the fall of the Berlin Wall, where we are looking at security in a broader framework of political, economic and social stability, the Mediterranean initiative is of vital importance if we are to maintain and build the security of the region."
"However, there are a number of observations I should like to make."
"Firstly, there is no doubt, despite all the efforts contained in the Mediterranean process, that unless we guarantee the peace process in the Middle East, everything we do will be undermined."
"So we must keep the importance of that peace process very much in our minds."
"Secondly, it is important that Member States of the European Union show their commitment to this process by ratifying the association agreements which have already been agreed; and I underline the importance of Amendment No 14 which Mr Sakellariou tabled."
"Thirdly, what governments can do is by its nature limited."
"The key to success in this initiative will come if we attract private finance."
"It is therefore incumbent on the recipient countries - if I can call them that - to ensure that there is a proper legal and political framework to attract capital."
"In particular, we must ensure respect for intellectual property rights, appropriate tax regimes, effective competition policy and maximum transparency in the relationship between public and private institutions."
"For our own part, we must place much emphasis in the assistance we are giving on ensuring that the proper framework is established, in particular in relation to banking and the finance sectors."
"Fourthly, we must intensify the dialogue on human rights."
"This is not a bolt-on addition."
"It is the essential requirement of modern economic expansion."
"Freedom is both a political concept and an economic one which is vital for the development of the region."
"Fifthly, we must intensify the cooperation on water supplies."
"That represents a great challenge but also a great opportunity, and I will be interested to hear the Commission's response to Mr Sakellariou's suggestion of a European Mediterranean water agency, which seems to me to go beyond the Declaration of Marseilles of November of last year."
"Sixthly, we must intensify regional cooperation in order to ensure that countries are working very closely together so that they become very much inter-related."
"Finally, it is important that we develop greater mutual understanding."
"We need to explain what the European Union is trying to achieve with the single currency project and with enlargement to Central and Eastern Europe."
"We also have to explain to our citizens what we are trying to achieve with the Mediterranean project because, as Mr Sakellariou has already indicated, there are many misunderstandings about our aims."
"Therefore we need to increase publicity about the objectives of the European Union."
"Madam President, I wish to join colleagues in welcoming this report and congratulating Mr Sakellariou."
"I took the opportunity of looking at the list of speakers in this debate and I see that the overwhelming majority are from southern Member States."
"I wish to say, therefore, that the success of the Barcelona process is not just important to the south of Europe, but to all of Europe."
"My own country has been fascinated by developments in Mediterranean policy for many centuries."
"This is a process in which the whole of Europe is engaged with the whole of the Mediterranean."
"Secondly, I wish to echo those who have supported the parliamentary dimension of this process."
"It is right that we should honour and welcome the work done by ministers, Commissioners and civil servants."
"But if this process is to be a success, it has to be a meeting of minds and a meeting of peoples, and that needs to involve the parliaments of the states."
"In the next two days we will try, with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy and our distinguished guests, to work out what the framework of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Forum would look like."
"Finally, I welcome what might be called the holistic approach of the Barcelona process - its multidimensional nature."
"The problems of the Mediterranean demonstrate, more dramatically than perhaps anywhere else, that foreign affairs is not just a series of unconnected and unpredictable crises."
"Those things which we call politics, which we call foreign affairs, respond to underlying trends."
"We know that demographic, environmental and economic issues interrelate to produce the political problems and the migratory flows to which Mr Sakellariou referred."
"They build on the complexity of the historic cultural legacy of many millennia of interaction in the Mediterranean."
"It is perhaps dangerous for a politician to advise other politicians to study history, because we all have our favourite national historians."
"However, I recommend that anyone involved in this process should study the work of that great French historian Braudel and his classic study on the Mediterranean at the time of Philip II."
"There they will see clearly laid out the interrelated system of culture and economics that is and always has been the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, I warmly thank Mr Sakellariou for his good work. His report fully recognizes the strategic importance of the Mediterranean."
"I too welcome our friends and colleagues from countries on the other shore of the Mediterranean."
"I believe that it is absolutely essential to shift the balance of European policy towards the south because the Mediterranean area is particularly vulnerable to the emergence of a new wall of incomprehension between north and south, between the Christian and the Muslim world, between the rich and the poor world."
"This has to be avoided and in this context the Barcelona process is most important, as is partnership with the countries on the other shore of the Mediterranean."
"I also agree with Mr Dimitrakopoulos when he says that genuine Islam must not be regarded as fanaticism or intolerance but is to be regarded as a culture, based on tolerance and respect for the opinions of others."
"If we are to make progress along the road towards political partnership, I believe there are several important preconditions, among them the fact that Europe must become a unitary political interlocutor that is able in some way to bear its great burden of freedom and democracy, as reflected in the Convention on Human Rights, the Court of Justice, the principles of the rule of law and democracy, pluralism and tolerance."
"I am concerned about an economic aspect."
"Although a champion of the free market and economic liberalization, I believe that in the case of agricultural products we cannot move from protectionism and international agreements of a dirigiste nature to the liberalization of trade."
"That would be extremely detrimental to Europe and in particular to the European countries bordering the Mediterranean."
"Mr President, the follow-up to the Barcelona Conference has to be the next step in the dynamic process of rapprochement between Europe and its neighbours around the Mediterranean Sea."
"But the prevailing climate is not calculated to raise expectations overmuch."
"The Middle Eastern peace process is in trouble, and that in turn affects the Barcelona process."
"The aspirations voiced in Mr Sakellariou's report are very laudable, but I maintain that they are not very realistic."
"We have to move forward step by step with concrete plans and not lapse into fine speeches."
"Regrettably, our Group thinks that many of the proposed amendments to the Sakellariou report go too far."
"Of course this House must give a lead and ultimately the OSCE model must be practicable and the Euro-Mediterranean stability pact has to be an interesting idea."
"But first of all we should concentrate on rounding off the bilateral agreements with our partners."
"And the Barcelona process is useless unless we are consistent."
"For example, the recent statement by a number of senior Christian Democrats that the Union is a Christian community, so that Turkey, for example, cannot join, will have hit a nerve throughout the Mediterranean region."
"And I totally repudiate that statement."
"The Union does not judge people by that kind of outdated criteria and we must insist on respect for human rights and democracy and make it clear to Turkey, for example, what criteria she must meet if she is to join."
"Those criteria are valid both for Turkey and for a number of other countries in the region."
"Mr President, supporting the Barcelona process today means deepening it, in the first instance politically, where Europe must build genuinely autonomous regional security with its Mediterranean partners, by reducing to the maximum the presence of powers alien to the area - remembering the United States bases and fleet - and by making promotion of democracy and respect for human rights the fundamental aim - remembering Turkey, Algeria and Morocco. We must also implement measures to promote trust, stability and conventional and nuclear disarmament, which calls for a regional organization based on similar principles and procedures to the OSCE."
"Security in the Mediterranean will be impossible without adequately solving a number of open conflicts, completing the Middle East peace process, self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, and reunification of Cyprus."
"Barcelona cannot go against itself."
"The Union must sponsor economic and commercial integration in the region, but not on the basis of free trade at all costs, which ends up destroying the quality of life of the working classes or financial support to International Monetary Fund adjustment plans, but, on the contrary, promoting models of sustainable development from which to reduce problems like debt, promoting gender equality and youth employment, combatting the deep causes of migratory flows, which must not and cannot be tackled by policing or restrictive and quasi-xenophobic frontier policies, and restoring an extraordinarily degraded environment."
"All that should be present in the Barcelona process and sponsored in the next meeting in Malta together with three other measures: promotion of cultural understanding between the north and south coasts, introduction of mechanisms to involve the public, and the creation of a permanent interparliamentary forum with powers of consultation and proposal."
"If all that is fulfilled, the Union will be laying the foundations of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in which all participate, which is essential for its own stability and which is not perceived as a mere strategy to gain market quotas or impose neo-colonial ideas."
"Mr President, I want to point out that many of us had expected rather more of the Barcelona Conference, such as a shift of balance southwards of European Union policy, which is all too often aimed rather more towards the eastern countries."
"Perhaps one of the limitations of the Barcelona Conference is that it demonstrates the absence of a genuine European foreign policy."
"In fact it has been concerned mainly with creating a large free trade area without constructing a solid and durable system of wider and more structured forms of regional association."
"The causes lie in the fact that participation in the system is limited only to 12 African coastal states, excluding Libya, Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia, that the aim is to promote the free movement of goods while in fact hindering the movement of persons, and that there is no genuine democratic dialogue between all the components of civil society on both shores of the Mediterranean."
"However, the Barcelona Conference was a first step, which we cannot dismiss, towards the necessary approach to relations between the Mediterranean countries."
"For that reason we Greens endorse the report by Mr Sakellariou and congratulate him on his excellent work."
"In particular, we regard as most important the call on the Commission to draw up a special report on the human rights situation in the 12 non-EU signatory states and the proposal on the establishment of a European civil peace corps in order to strengthen humanitarian action, achieve a peaceful resolution of conflicts, prevent the outbreak of new conflicts and provide the requisite confidence-building measures."
"This is a proposal the Greens have always put forward."
"We also propose a discussion on disarmament, on the need for arms limitation, the need to establish a nuclear-free zone in the Mediterranean region."
"We agree on the need to develop the MEDA programme in a positive way and to aim at debt cancellation, linked to compliance with the principles of the declaration, with a view to promoting sustainable development and to achieving that aim by means of renewable energy sources and energy savings."
"So we hope the European Parliament will be adequately represented in Malta and that all the non-governmental organizations will be present at a civil forum financed by the European Union."
"Mr President, the Barcelona Conference marked a major turning point in the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean pole."
"That in no way reduces the necessity to conduct a regular review of progress in the working areas that have been opened up, to ensure that the spirit of Barcelona endures."
"And, as Mr Sakellariou's excellent report recommends, it is important that the European Union should move further down the road to Euro-Mediterranean co-operation."
"As far as my group is concerned, it seems to us fundamental to strengthen trade relations while adopting the objective of reducing the trade balance deficit."
"Furthermore, sustainable development of these regions presupposes sound management of resources, and especially of water."
"Politically, we would like to see some relaxation of the common policies of conflict prevention, and greater attention paid to the subject of human rights."
"Nevertheless, the spirit of Barcelona will only be fully realized if culture is given the importance that was attached to it at the time of the Conference, as a catalyst and as a means for bringing peoples closer together and combating intolerance and racism."
"That is why my group will be supporting the amendments designed to strengthen cultural exchanges, the role of civilian society and the heritage conservation policies."
"Mr President, the Sakellariou report has the merit of emphasizing the priority importance which we should now attach to establishing close co-operation with all the Mediterranean seaboard States."
"For Europe, in the aftermath of the cold war, the Mediterranean horizon has become the horizon of security."
"The two essential factors for that security, as inseparable as the two sides of a coin, are the economic development of the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, and the control of migration flows."
"This latter consideration is not only an essential precondition for the internal security of the European States but also the mainspring of our partners' development."
"They must be able to rely on motivated human resources, on a trained elite which has a greater, more public-spirited interest in the development of its own country than in the illusory attractions of an expatriate existence."
"It should be a constant concern of our co-operation, and of its necessary renewal, to prevent encouraging this brain drain."
"Mr Sakellariou proposes the creation of a co-prosperity zone in the Mediterranean."
"That is indeed the path of genuine co-development which we should be taking, in order to ensure that the Mediterranean can one day become a zone of lasting stability."
"For that purpose, we hold trump cards which others do not."
"The long tradition of friendly and co-operative relations between some of our countries is a precious asset to the entire Union."
"After the unfortunate failure of an initial ambitious attempt at a Euro-Arab dialogue, a new dynamic is seeking to become established on the basis of the Barcelona Declaration."
"We must succeed this time, by asserting Europe's Mediterranean priority clearly, resolutely, lastingly and realistically."
"Mr President, the thousand Mediterraneans of Brodel, the old and new civilizations on the African and the European coast that have existed through the course of time, distrustful of one another and sometimes even inimical, have created the foundations for a common future through the Barcelona Conference."
"It produced a final declaration, the fruit of that strange North-South summit that advocated global cooperation, to be implemented at three levels: a more intensive political dialogue, the development of economic cooperation, more attention to the social, cultural and human dimension."
"Now, a few months later, we have to criticize the inadequacy of the European initiatives."
"The time has come to translate into action the lofty intentions of the final Declaration of the Barcelona Conference."
"In our view, the Council must convene regular follow-up conferences, in an attempt to identify the most appropriate measures to be taken, and must look into innovative formulas aimed primarily at debt cancellation, but also formulas for conversion, which does not mean cancellation but means converting reduced debts into expenditure devoted to development, to training programmes, to the requisite adjustment of the legal framework so as to make it into a comprehensive and consistent whole under the agreements."
"A future Euro-Mediterranean stability pact could include, among others, a contractual commitment to acknowledge and respect the territorial integrity of all the Mediterranean partner states and a clause on establishing a nuclearfree zone throughout the Mediterranean basin."
"Mr President, first of all I want to welcome our friends from the Euro-Mediterranean parliaments and say that this has been a great achievement. Commissioner Marín, you know how strongly Parliament advocated this policy."
"It could be said in general that the Euro-Mediterranean policy has already produced a result because it has affirmed and legitimized the European Union's political role in the Mediterranean and improved our relations with the countries on its shores."
"Today we are here to celebrate this fact, regarding it as an acquis : now we have to see how we can move forward."
"Of course, the practical implementation of this policy involves greater difficulties than its establishment."
"We have been aware in recent times of the difficulties and delays: there were delays in the definition of the MEDA regulation; we still need to define the charter of what is known as the stability pact which we hope will come into being in Malta, in response to a proposal - and this is important - from the ARE group; we wanted to have the Commission's indicative regional programme in April and, finally, we need to make every effort to incorporate finance, firms and trade associations in the Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"We know there is an obstacle, namely the instability in the Middle East: but we have always emphasized the objective links that exist between establishing the Mediterranean policy and the peace process in the Middle East."
"We must speed up the establishment of relations between the civil societies. We can establish relations between institutions up to a certain point, but then we need relations between socieities."
"They need to establish closer contacts among themselves; we have to find ways of achieving this, including new ways, we have to invent them. Of course this will be difficult, but we must do so because this will lead to more rapid and more frequent direct relations."
"If we are to involve the societies in this process it is important that we look into means of setting up a permanent, although not cumbersome inter-parliamentary structure."
"We need enormous progress in decentralized cooperation, which will encourage relations between areas and regions and activate the wealth of our cultures, our people, whose operational, entrepreneurial capacity will be enhanced by direct contact."
"What we must do now is to encourage this direct contact: any instrument, any ideas on this will be welcome and you, Commissioner Marín, will always have our support along this road."
"Mr President, first of all I too would like to congratulate Mr Sakellariou on the excellent report he has presented."
"Euro-Mediterranean partnership is based mainly on three fundamental pillars: the political and security pillar, the economic and financial one and the social, cultural and human one."
"At present the state of the art of these three pillars is generally speaking satisfactory, nevertheless in each of the three cases, problems are apparent which, if not resolved, could jeopardize everything."
"As regards the first, political and security pillar, we cannot deny that between the Barcelona Conference and now there have been more military encounters between member countries of the partnership and that their attempts to successfully conclude their respective peace processes have stalled."
"Although there is no provision for any link between the peace process and partnership, these problems could end up weakening it."
"The European Union must therefore have greater influence in the Mediterranean region and assume a political role which, considering the importance of its financial role, should be a wide-ranging one."
"On the second, economic and financial pillar, the progress made is increasingly evident."
"However, we have to note with disappointment the difficulties encountered in the administration of the MEDA programmes, which have forced the Commission to freeze them temporarily following the weighty report by the Court of Auditors."
"Turning finally to the third, social, cultural and human pillar, it has to be said that this has been subject to considerable delays, both because of the difficulties with the MEDA programme and because of our Parliament's delays, since it has not yet created the forum which should become the ideal meeting place for EuroMediterranean civil society."
"In the time between the Malta Conference and Barcelona III, the European Parliament must therefore seek to institutionalize a permanent dialogue between the various civil societies in order to avoid the risk of constructing a Euro-Mediterranean edifice without foundations, without the fundamental and reciprocal awareness and confidence that is needed between two societies that are still suspicious of each other and different."
"I am therefore happy to welcome the colleagues from Mediterranean third countries who have come here and the proposal to set up a first meeting between the members of our and their parliaments."
"I also urge you strongly to ensure that this does not remain an isolated event but is the forerunner of an institutionalized and regular dialogue."
"Mr President, I too extend a warm welcome to our colleagues from the Mediterranean region."
"What we have to do now is take the Barcelona initiative forward in practice and Mr Sakellariou's report provides a particularly good starting point."
"Since the beginning of this stability policy I have had one complaint."
"Only the countries of the south are making any effort here, and happily Mr Spencer has the same impression, so things will have to change."
"Perhaps under the Dutch presidency there will be a change of emphasis at the followup conference in Malta."
"In any case I hope that considerable attention will be given to asylum, migration, drug trafficking and organized crime."
"But, Mr President, Mr Titley put it best of all."
"There will only be stability and security in this region if human rights are respected."
"I am glad that all members of the Foreign Affairs Committee are prepared to consider my proposal that we should adopt the OSCE's model for monitoring human rights in the region."
"That would, one hopes, take us some way forward."
"Because unless there is a move towards democracy and above all reciprocal integration on the part of these countries, well, there will be no stability in that region without progress in that area."
"Regarding reciprocal co-operation, Mr President, I regret that one of our newest partners under the interim agreement, the Palestinian authority, has, at least if the media reports are true, just issued an invitation to the United States, the European Union and the Arab countries to attend talks in Gaza which exclude their Israeli peace partner."
"If that is true it is not consistent with the spirit of the Barcelona Treaty, but I hope these reports are not true."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree with the fundamental points of Mr Sakellariou's report and my group's support of it, expressed by Mr Bertens, and also with the very positive evaluation of Vice-President Marín's work and results."
"I agree on the significance of the establishment of a European Union Mediterranean policy in Barcelona in November 1995, under the Spanish Presidency."
"But on the other hand I have rather more reservations about certain economic aspects."
"Mr Bertens spoke more about political aspects and I want to refer more to economic aspects, given that, for one thing, the delay in approving and subsequently implementing the MEDA regulation has slowed down other projects and dampened the expectations established at Barcelona."
"Secondly, I must stress the need to develop projects which really contribute to economic development and meet expectations - above all economic expectations - in the area and which, as has already been said here, are encountering some reticence as regards finance."
"That reticence must be overcome at the London meeting - an important meeting, to my mind, although I do not think it has been mentioned so far - and finally, as Mr Sakellariou said, much easier access to such projects must be extended to small and medium sized companies."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Sakellariou because in his report he deals coherently with the three basic pillars of the Barcelona statement and also proposes alternatives to solve the problems which may be generated by political cooperation, cooperation in security, economics and finance, and cultural, social and human cooperation."
"However, Mr President, since we are totally at one with the soul and spirit of the Barcelona Conference and perhaps to add another angle to this debate, I want to draw attention here to the great sacrifice and far from beneficial consequences that blindly strengthening Euro-Mediterranean cooperation involves for the industrial sectors of objective 1 regions."
"The majority of these regions are in the Mediterranean basin and have industries similar to those of the third countries."
"I particularly want to highlight the damage that strengthening free trade under Euro-Mediterranean cooperation will cause to the Union's agriculture and textile industry if we fail to recognize that the least favoured regions in the Union itself will be seriously prejudiced and face more difficulties than they already do in achieving the desired level of development."
"There is also the added risk that the security and stability of existing agreements with third countries in the Mediterranean basin will be seriously prejudiced."
"Mr President, as the Barcelona Conference confirmed, Europe is part of the Mediterranean Basin and the Mediterranean Sea is, for all the countries surrounding it, an inland sea - a sea that belongs to us all."
"So we need to learn to work together, all of us who have lived together."
"We must therefore have joint projects in economic development, research, energy programmes and environmental protection."
"Together, we must guarantee our common security, fight for peace and equip ourselves with specific means for doing so, as the Sakellariou report proposes, through a charter."
"Together, we must defend human rights and combat racism, intolerance and all forms of fundamentalism."
"We also need - jointly, again - to further the advance of democracy where it is insufficiently established and defend it where it exists, with all due respect for our differences, naturally."
"Finally, Europe has a duty to reduce the debt of its Mediterranean partners."
"That will be a strong, specific signal which they are all expecting from us."
"In conclusion, as chairman of the Europe-Israel delegation, I offer my warm congratulations to Mr Sakellariou for the quality of his work and the excellence of his report."
"I also call upon the whole European Parliament and European Union to understand that our future, in every area, will depend on our dealings with the southern countries in general, and the Mediterranean seaboard States in particular."
"We have done some good work so far, but we must bear in mind that there is a great deal still to be done."
"Mr President, I think that for the first time following the Barcelona Conference it has become possible to establish an authentic policy for the Mediterranean in global and organic terms."
"However, there are several essential conditions for achieving this objective."
"The first is to accompany the partnership with genuine technical support measures in order to attain the objectives that have been set. It is extremely important not to seek to impose a policy from above but to reach appropriate agreements with the individual countries on establishing the specific policies of the three pillar defined in Barcelona."
"I cannot go into all the aspects in the time available and will confine myself to one observation."
"I have in my hands the calendar of events produced by the Commission. There are undoubtedly deadlines in regard to matters of major importance, but which mainly concern questions of security; that is correct since the objective of peace and stability is an important one."
"The economic aspect is also extremely important. But there are still very serious weaknesses as regards the entire question of cultural activities, which is also an essential aspect if we want to resolve, not by imposing solutions but through genuine development, matters relating to the closer integration of the Mediterranean countries and if we want to create a stronger sense of identity among all the countries by means of cultural initiatives of which, however paradoxical, there are only two: the usual customary attention to the audiovisual media, given the importance of television, but also, which is perhaps very important, the awareness of the programmes to be transmitted given that this signifies genuine policy-making."
"From this point of view, I too want to praise Mr Sakellariou's report, without disregarding the important contribution made by Mr Dimitrakopoulos."
"Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by welcoming the delegation of representatives from the Mediterranean countries to the gallery and then turn briefly to the economic aspects of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership."
"Following the individual meetings in Bologna, Naples, Brussels, Rome, Trieste and Marseilles, it became clear that there was a wide-ranging need for training, for technological transfer and partnership between undertakings with a view to Mediterranean cooperation."
"Our experience with the MEDA projects has also taught that a genuine development programme depends on the involvement not only of the governments but also of civil society, of the production and service undertakings, the trade associations, the medical centres and the universities."
"This approach needs major resources, which we fortunately now have under the MEDA programme."
"It is urgently necessary for the Commission to define and organize the management of the programmes."
"We know that many Mediterranean third countries are requesting aid in order to improve their infrastructure: water, energy, transport and telecommunications."
"It is urgently necessary for the Commission to set up the Euro-Mediterranean water agency, for it to promote cooperation in energy in the framework of the Energy Charter and for the network of the Innovation Relay Centre which is being extended to the central and eastern European countries through the Fellow members Innovation Relay Centers also to cover the countries on the other shore of the Mediterranean."
"Let me also ask the Commission to carry forward the initiative for a satellite link-up of multimedia communications, integrating Mediterranean services and applications and building bridges across the Mediterranean in, for instance, the area of transport safety, territorial and environmental surveillance, tele-medicine and distance learning."
"I hope that the workshop on the spatial applications of the Euro-Mediterranean region to be held in Cairo on 26-27 May will help to emphasize the importance and usefulness of these technologies and lead to practical initiatives."
"Mr President, I want to begin my speech by congratulating Mr Sakellariou on encapsulating Euro-Mediterranean policy in a report which I regard as most opportune, taking stock of our efforts so far and establishing lines of action."
"I also want to record that when we speak of Euro-Mediterranean policy we need to be able to face up to our responsibilities; the work we lost for budgetary reasons last year could have converted our commitments into reality."
"That must be taken into account, if we want to preach by example."
"As regards lines of action, I think the stress laid on shaping the Mediterranean as a multilateral area is very important. We are not just planning the establishment of a free trade area, but also the construction of an area of peace and prosperity fundamentally founded on experience based on common values and on upholding democracy and respect for human rights, within a structure on the lines with the former Helsinki Conference, later the OSCE, leading to stability in and participation by all the countries in the area."
"On the economic side - although I have to be brief - I do believe it is important to stress not only participation by the public - provided for, at the time, in the MEDA Regulation - but especially the effort to provide backbone and organization which has to be made in the majority of the Mediterranean countries so as to be able to consolidate their own structures as societies."
"Finally, Mr President, I think that the great objective of our Euro-Mediterranean policy must be to replace fear, mistrust and conflict with a policy which really makes the Mediterranean Mare Nostrum ."
"Mr President, I too would like to welcome our Mediterranean friends and colleagues, and also sincerely to congratulate Yannis Sakellariou on his work."
"The Barcelona Conference confirmed the European Union's interest in the Mediterranean and the great importance of that area for the whole of Europe and its development."
"Europe has understood that peaceful coexistence in the area cannot exist unless the great problems faced by non-Community countries in the Mediterranean Basin are addressed, problems which essentially amount to democracy and development."
"It is therefore in the European Union's interest, and at the same time its obligation, to help those countries on the basis of an equal relationship, and with respect for their cultural characteristics."
"We must not forget that the Mediterranean is an area in which different cultures and different religions meet."
"We consider it to be a very positive fact that great emphasis is placed on respect for human rights and the protection of minorities, because those are among the basic problems of those countries."
"The issue of peaceful co-existence in the area relies on respect for territorial integrity and on the inviolability of frontiers, and is an essential prerequisite for partnership relations to develop between the European Union and the countries of the South."
"For this, we consider it essential to create a mechanism to guarantee compliance with those principles, because, unfortunately, there are countries that took part in the Barcelona Conference but which are failing to comply with what was agreed, and so continually creating tensions and persisting, in contravention of all international law and order, with the occupation of a large section of an independent state."
"I think it is very important to pay particular attention to the subject of migration."
"Most of the immigrants are in the Community and come from Mediterranean countries."
"Besides the necessity to find solutions which will address that issue, we must also understand that the problem cannot be solved in the host countries, but in the countries of origin."
"It is for that reason that the European Union must help the development of those countries, so that the flow of migration can be stemmed."
"Mr President, first I want to congratulate Mr Sakellariou and everyone here. Secondly - and I believe it is just to do so - I want to congratulate the European Commission on its achievements this year and particularly the Euro-Mediterranean policy."
"Mr Spencer spoke in this Chamber of the need for all the countries of the Union to feel that Euro-Mediterranean policy belongs to them."
"I am optimistic about that."
"The involvement of the British Government at the London Conference is an example."
"But I think we must also try to make progress, looking to the future, in the sense that all the other policies of the European Union should also incorporate the spirit of the Euro-Mediterranean Conference."
"I do not need to go to the Commission, I do not need to speak about European policies in support of this, I only need to stay in this House and see the papers we produce."
"We will not be able to maintain credibility much longer if, alongside reports like Mr Sakellariou's - reports which use terms like partnership or cooperation - we will find words like 'danger' in speaking of questions relating to agriculture, security or frontiers."
"The immigration issue and Member States' policy on it is particularly flagrant, compared with what we say in the section on cooperation in the social, cultural and human areas of the Euro-Mediterranean agreement."
"I also want to say that the ECU 64, 000 million earned by exports in 1995, producing a positive balance of ECU 18, 000 million, speaks for itself in answer to some of the questions raised in this House on the problems Euro-Mediterranean policy may cause to certain European regions."
"I think we ought to avoid that kind of comment as much as possible, and make clear what is really happening."
"I want to end by referring to a subject I am already weary of - the Islamic danger."
"I just want to mention one specific case: a Pakistani woman has taken her father to court because he would not let her marry the man she loved."
"Conflicts like that have often arisen in the European Union, but I do not know of anyone going to court to resolve them."
"Mr President, looking at the Sakellariou report and its well-intentioned proposals from a northern or north-eastern perspective, I feel that there are some very interesting dissimilarities between our case, the Baltic Sea region, and the Mediterranean."
"One of them - and that is my concern here - is that too many Mediterranean countries have a long way to go before the body politic is free from the influence of religion or, as I would personally put it, religious superstition."
"The Protestant tradition in the north makes separation of religion and political power easy."
"We note the conflict between some government circles in Turkey and the army, the latter representing Atatürk's idea of a lay society."
"We should also note that even among countries living in some sort of fragile peace there is no widespread acceptance of peace and what it means."
"Here the question of the media comes in."
"The little I have seen of the media coverage in the non-EU countries along the Mediterranean showing events in other countries along the same shores is often distorted and one-sided and does not contribute to an understanding of the cultural and political diversity of the area."
"I see a possibility for the EU to exercise moral power and pressure on the countries in question, which is probably the intent behind many of the good proposals in the report by Mr Sakellariou."
"At best, the EU's financial contribution is small if you, for instance, compare it with US payments to some countries, especially Israel and Egypt."
"Sometimes power comes with money, but not always."
"The report supports an enhanced EU presence in the area."
"The intentions are good."
"Nowhere is there mention of the fact that US involvement has been crucial and will be crucial in the foreseeable future."
"I hope that this will change."
"It also depends on the will of the people along the Mediterranean."
"How is this will expressed in a dictatorship?"
"Mr President, I too believe that Mr Sakellariou's report is important because it allows our Parliament to review the need for major advances in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership policy decided in Barcelona."
"It is true that some important progress has already been made, but it will be vital in Malta to move ahead with the charter for peace, stability and the full implementation of the cooperation provided for in the MEDA and the EIB regulations."
"This is a fundamental strategy for the European Union and must be regarded as such so that attention can be directed towards the south, beginning with the near south, and the processes of peace, stability and mutual understanding can be strengthened."
"That is why I say that it is vital to set up a parliamentary forum, an institutional meeting place between the European Parliament and the parliamentary assemblies of the Mediterranean third countries."
"We must admit that there are delays, but we will rapidly assume our responsibilities; this is our duty and we must do it as soon as possible."
"Lastly, let me draw attention to a few points."
"It is true that we must create the conditions for more balanced trade between the European Union and Mediterranean third countries and promote the growth of intra-regional trade between the third countries in the Mediterranean basin; but as Mr Bianco said, we must also emphasize the importance of cultural dialogue, of cultural awareness, of the common features of the Mediterranean basin and of the differences, with a view to mutual respect and recognition, which is the basis of understanding and tolerance."
"The value of such a dialogue was emphasized during an important meeting in Italy between writers and intellectuals from the Mediterranean EU countries."
"I believe that culture and politics do not come second but in a sense come first and create the right conditions for development, for Euro-partnership, for economic partnership."
"We must never forget that!"
"Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"Let me first of all congratulate Mr Sakellariou, not only on the quality of the report we are discussing today, but also on his firm and unswerving support of the Mediterranean policy since its beginnings."
"I would also like to thank him for his kind words, but he will forgive me for not being equal to his command of languages - I cannot do so in German, but I do thank him very sincerely."
"I am grateful for the comments made by both Mr Spencer and Mr Titley to the effect that European Union Mediterranean policy cannot and should not be a matter or concern or interest only to the Member States in the south of Europe."
"As you know, the Commission has always insisted that Mediterranean policy is a European policy of interest to every Member State and just as it seems to me absurd that Mediterranean policy should be an issue only for Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and France, I also think it is wrong to regard the policy on the countries of central or eastern Europe as of interest only to the Benelux countries or the Germans."
"And in fact, the major review we are carrying out presupposes continuous and increasing consolidation of the idea that Mediterranean policy really is a policy for everyone and must be understood as such by all the Member States."
"It is very interesting to have this report, Mr Sakellariou, on the eve of the second Euro-Mediterranean Conference which will take place in La Valetta in April."
"Much remains to be done."
"And the Commission endorses its content and the contributions made by the various groups in large part."
"But I want to highlight one thing: it is hard to grasp the distance we have covered - and this is the main thing I want to say - since the Barcelona Conference was held in November 1995."
"Our sights are now set on the Malta Conference, when the Commission proposes to ratify the principles established in Barcelona and deepen them, rather than inaugurate new paths of cooperation."
"Because our main objective is the definitive consolidation of the Barcelona process."
"I think patience and a sense of history are needed."
"Barcelona is only a baby."
"Barcelona is one and a half years old."
"The problems of the Mediterranean are enormous and some of them are serious and intense."
"So this policy must of necessity be a long term policy and like all long term policies it must gather momentum, taking increasingly firm steps."
"Consequently, the Commission's fundamental strategy for the Malta meeting will be to consolidate what we are doing year by year, so that this long term policy goes on producing results."
"Peace, stability, shared prosperity, and establishing a dialogue between cultures and civilizations, continue to be interdependent elements and they can only progress, as all of you have pointed out - and I am delighted at the consensus - to the extent that the three Barcelona objectives go hand in hand."
"I will try to explain the current position very briefly: in the first pillar, we have an option - Mr Sakellariou mentions this in his report - to take action which makes it possible to recreate a certain common view of security problems in the Mediterranean."
"The charter is a part of the future because a set of objectives is finally being established."
"That is already a step forward."
"In La Valetta we will certainly be discussing whether the aim is modest or ambitious."
"I think it is a sufficient because a year and a half ago it was unthinkable - given the events that have occurred, for example, in the peace negotiations in the Middle East - that it would be possible at least to draw up a EuroMediterranean charter on peace, stability and security."
"We have a basis, ideas which you have introduced in the political and security areas, for working on much more substantial issues, with the aim of establishing a kind of Mediterranean OSCE or security plan."
"I think these are ideas worth considering but of course they need to be deepened and include a specific timetable."
"On the political and security side, the Commission endorses your report."
"We have been able to introduce a certain degree of new dynamism and a number of points suggest that we are at least on the right road: the list of measures with guarantees that have already been approved, the communications network between the 27 countries, the Institute of Foreign Policy network, the draft mechanism for prevention of natural disasters, and the action plan for political and security dialogue which is already being debated."
"So at least the foundations of dialogue are being laid pretty solidly."
"The second pillar, or the second part of Barcelona, consists of economic policy and the association agreements."
"Perhaps that is the most brilliant part - I do not say that for my benefit, but for the benefit of my Directorate General - because in a year and a half we have already succeeded in negotiating and signing four association agreements: with Morocco, Tunisia, Israel and, recently, the Palestine National Authority, and we can certainly conclude the agreements with Egypt, Libya, Jordan and the Lebanon before La Valetta."
"In just a year and a half we will have succeeded in concluding seven free trade association agreements, a rate of progress of two association agreements per quarter and you know how difficult it is to reach final decisions in our Council of Ministers, so that is a result which should fill us with satisfaction."
"Earlier Mr Gasòliba mentioned a series of elements which need to be deepened."
"But from Barcelona to La Valetta, our work has been fundamentally geared to consolidating the network of association agreements, because this is the platform, the legal, economic and financial basis, viewed from the free trade perspective, which will allow us to continue consolidating the various aspects of cooperation."
"I repeat, this is a long term process."
"We cannot expect the classic problems in the Mediterranean to disappear as if by magic between Barcelona and La Valetta, in barely a year and a half."
"But there is already a significant network of agreements which will allow us to continue our work."
"I shall end, Mr President, because time is running out."
"But I promise to send you the text of my speech so that you can read what I was going to say on the third pillar of the Barcelona Agreement, covering the cultural, regional and social aspects, negative interdependency, drugs, terrorism, fundamentalism and uncontrolled immigration."
"Much remains to be done."
"The European Parliament has extended an invitation to the representatives of the associated Mediterranean countries and it is my intention that the foreign ministers should definitely confirm the creation of the European Parliamentary Forum in La Valetta."
"I believe that forum will be created after you have held that meeting here is Strasbourg."
"And I want to conclude by telling you once again that there is no budgetary problem. We have a budget for the forum."
"So I want to ask you and those who have been invited to join the Commission in convincing all the foreign ministers, all 27, that this forum must be consolidated."
"And if that comes into being it will be another step towards establishing a political debate between parliamentary representatives of both sides in the longer term, and I believe that continues to be very necessary."
"Thank you, I have gone on too long, but on the plus side I think I have at least given you a broad outline the results this Euro-Mediterranean policy is producing."
"Thank you, Mr Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"Progress of the Intergovernmental Conference"
"The next item is the oral question (B4-0018/97/rev. O-0030/97/rev.) by Mr De Giovanni, on behalf of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, to the Commission, on the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Mr President, Parliament is expressing serious concern about the progress of the negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We have the impression there is an impasse and a rather serious situation."
"We also know that we have reached a very delicate point in the history of European integration, on the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome which was celebrated this morning, and that we have been faced, especially since 1989, with problems on an entirely new scale."
"We have reached a kind of moment of truth: we are either on the eve of substantial progress or on the eve of possible regression."
"We need only think of two fundamental issues, such as enlargement and monetary union."
"What will happen in relation to these two major questions if we do not transform the institutions?"
"So the Intergovernmental Conference has a historic responsibility; but the impression we get is that the negotiations have not yet produced any outcome, three months before they finally come to an end."
"Is that true?"
"I am asking the Commission."
"How does the Commission intend to put pressure on the governments?"
"These are specific questions which we are putting to the European Commission today."
"The European Parliament is trying to do its part and to lay emphasis on certain problems."
"In its resolution it highlights three essential questions."
"It states emphatically that the prerogatives of Parliament are the real cornerstone of the democratic legitimacy of the Union. Parliament is concerned about this."
"I have the impression that this process could come to a halt, could indeed backtrack, because there does not seem to be any real balance between closer integration, the development of the Union's policies and competences and Parliament's own power of legislation and control."
"Increasingly large grey areas are appearing within which committees carry out tasks that could also tend in a negative direction."
"So we call resolutely for co-decision to be extended to the entire legislative area, for the European Parliament to have control functions, for widening and extending qualified majority voting, for transparent legislation."
"The second question is the creation of an area of freedom, justice and security, i.e., the establishment of European citizenship and the extension of non-discrimination, that is to say the construction of a genuine European civil society."
"But is this possible without any real integration of the important areas of home affairs and justice?"
"Parliament believes it is not, otherwise everything will remain subject to government negotiation."
"But can we have a thousand Schengens?"
"Obviously not!"
"So here we call for the involvement of the Community institutions, a specific role for the European Parliament, a specific role for the Court of Justice."
"Lastly, the Pandora's Box of closer cooperation, which is becoming the real issue at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"How so?"
"We have the impression that this cooperation is becoming a pretext for an Intergovernmental Conference that is not able to resolve the major issues before it."
"We need only remember that if the majority question were resolved, it would scarcely be necessary any more to call for closer cooperation."
"Parliament can see the risks inherent in this prospect: the possible destruction of the balance between states, of cohesion, the possible seeds of fragmentation of the Union, of the very fabric of Europe."
"That is why Parliament is sounding the alarm and sending a vital political message to the states, to the governments, to the Commission: where closer cooperation is necessary it must occur within the Treaty and not outside the Treaty, with the guarantees of the Community institutions and procedures."
"And it may become possible under the Treaty, but on specific conditions, some of which we cite in the resolution: unified institutional systems, the maintenance and development of the acquis communautaire , respect for the principle of the equality of all states and citizens, respect for the principle of solidarity and cohesion."
"Lastly, what does unified systems mean?"
"As my final point let me take the indivisibility of the European Parliament and its powers."
"We must point out - as I pointed out to those governments that referred to the possible division of Parliament - that the European Parliament is a parliament of the people and not of the states and must therefore remain indivisible."
"As such it will be the guarantee that even if situations arise that are temporarily different, this will not affect the unity of the European project."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, forty years of the European Community represent both a historic success and a present obligation for us."
"European integration is built on continuity and change."
"If the Intergovernmental Conference is to achieve satisfactory results, the European Parliament, in accordance with the Dublin Document, must now formulate its position on controversial issues during the current negotiations and before the treaty is drafted in May."
"Firstly, the European Union needs majority voting in the Council and, of course, parliamentary codecision for the whole range of ordinary legislation."
"That is the key issue of the reforms, because the effectiveness of the Union depends on it."
"Secondly, the EU also needs certain exceptions from the precept of concerted action, but only as a last resort, as a means of avoiding sustained obstruction."
"This is also - regrettably, I might add - an unavoidable condition of our capacity for enlargement."
"Thirdly, the EU needs team spirit, cooperation and movement - not flexibility; although that enigmatic term sounds good, it means nothing and leaves unbounded scope for interpretation."
"That dilutes the acquis communautaire and leads to a Europe à la carte ."
"We must consider critically, and in some respects anxiously, the current state of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference, precisely because we want to make the Amsterdam summit a success."
"We need that success, because 40 years of a European Community based on supranationality and solidarity could not, for example, prevent the Renault affair."
"We all had to experience the brutality with which economic power was unleashed here against people's jobs and against the European welfare state."
"We cannot continue to run along behind the decisions of multinational companies and suchlike; we have to pursue better policies, active policies."
"That is exactly what the citizens of this Union expect of us."
"It is also the very basis of democracy in Europe in the 21st century."
"Mr President, this is a crucial time, as the Commissioner has said."
"In a few months' time this Intergovernmental Conference will reach a conclusion and the Dutch Presidency is committed to presenting its draft at the beginning of May, just a month and a half away."
"That is why, Mr President, we in the Committee on Institutional Affairs thought it was the right time to consider the issues on the conference table through the questions put to the Commission by the chairman, Mr De Giovanni."
"And I want to add that, in the draft resolution we passed in the Committee on Institutional Affairs by a large majority and which the House will vote on tomorrow, we sought to uphold two things: continuity and consistency with previous resolutions of the European Parliament."
"Continuity, because the European Parliament has expressed its position on all the questions of this Intergovernmental Conference in the Bourlanges-Martin and Dury-Maij-Weggen reports and in the Dublin Resolution, which analysed the Irish Presidency's document."
"Our intention was to concentrate on various major issues which have arisen as the debates in the Intergovernmental Conference have progressed."
"One of the issues on the table at the moment is the third pillar."
"I think citizens in all our countries feel security is threatened, and - I think this is enormously positive - they feel that Europe should also take responsibility for this area which so closely affects their lives."
"I also want to say, Mr President, that expectations about 'communitarization' of the various sectors of the third pillar have currently dimmed a little."
"I think the resolution Parliament is going to approve leaves matters very much in line with previous resolutions. It fully clarifies where Parliament stands on the areas to be 'communitarized' , first of all, and secondly, where there is enhanced cooperation, what conditions must be assembled to bring matters to a conclusion."
"We are going to include terrorism as an objective for 'communitarization' in an amendment my group has presented, Mr President."
"Enhanced cooperation is the second main section dealt with in that resolution."
"Before getting into the detail, we are going to defend the philosophy of this Parliament, which is the extension of qualified majority in the Council and co-decision in Parliament."
"I am sorry the Council is not here, but I would like someone to tell me why this Parliament has only been granted co-decision in certain sectors."
"What is the conceptual, philosophical, and political reason why Parliament does not have co-decision in all sectors?"
"I do not think there is one, Mr President, and we will therefore continue to reiterate our demands."
"In the second place, enhanced cooperation should not be the 'gadget' of this conference."
"Enhanced cooperation does not solve the problems."
"Enhanced cooperation - let it be clearly stated - is just a necessary instrument to avoid progress being blocked by a Member State which is causing deadlock."
"If that did not happen there would be no need for enhanced cooperation."
"And I shall end, Mr President, by saying briefly that our resolution establishes the conditions under which enhanced cooperation will be possible."
"I am sure subsequent speakers will address other aspects of this resolution, which I hope will be approved tomorrow by a large majority."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, when the Intergovernmental Conference on the revision of the Treaty began in Turin on 29 March last year, the participants assigned it three tasks: to equip the Union with efficient institutions with a view to enlargement, to provide Europe with a genuine ambition in the fields of diplomacy and defence, and to improve the organization of the third pillar - justice and internal affairs."
"The intention was that all this work would take us into the Europe of the 21st century, a closer-knit, more democratic, more mutually supportive Europe."
"Without prejudging the results, a year after the IGC began, recent events have shown on more than one occasion the limitations of the Union's present architecture with, for example, the failure of the Commission in the BSE tragedy and the inability of the Union to respond to the sufferings of the Renault workforce at Vilvoorde."
"It is on this last point, like Mr Schäfer, that I would like to alert the Commission and the Council."
"Over and above these three challenges which the IGC is to meet, is it not time to construct a social Europe, time to discuss calmly the tragedies brought about by unemployment, and, better still, time to try to prevent them or mitigate them?"
"Are we going to wait until our 18 million fellow citizens who are out of work are called upon to come and demonstrate their discontent in this House to force us to vote under pressure?"
"Confronted with the globalization of trade and the technology explosion, are we simply going to offer the men and women who make up our Union's population this desperate choice between insecurity and unemployment?"
"The Eurobarometer poll of February 1997 showed that the fight against unemployment was regarded as a priority by all our fellow citizens, and should be the main objective of the IGC."
"Ladies and gentlemen, are we finally going to give Europe the means to follow a third road - the road of employment and social justice?"
"Yes, the time has come to define a genuine European social model, as President Chirac said at the opening of the IGC."
"Finally, harsh and even painful though it may be, the present situation does give us an opportunity to realign the IGC, with a view to constructing a Union that works for mankind, and avoiding the temptation simply to clean up our institutions, necessary though that may be."
"Mr President, Commissioner, as you were saying a moment ago the Intergovernmental Conference has embarked on its final phase."
"I have the impression that, even more than at the start of the Conference, public opinion has been traumatized by human tragedies such as the closure of the Renault works at Vilvoorde, and that it will not tolerate timid advances that have no positive effect on the functioning of the institutions - that fail in other words to provide the necessary solutions to meet the anxieties and allay the scepticism of Europe's citizens."
"As things stand today, there is no doubt that it is within the third pillar that the most significant advances seem to be occurring."
"It is true that there are public expectations regarding security, the fight against drugs and against organized crime."
"Our motion emphasizes the requirements in this area."
"But the Council would be wrong to think that that would be enough."
"Inadequate advances in the areas of the first and second pillars will set the seal on the failure of the conference, and the European Parliament will have the duty of relaying that disappointment."
"As Mr De Giovanni has recalled, Parliament has indeed consistently shown and demonstrated in all its resolutions the concept it had of the development of the institutions, now, and especially, in the context of enlargement."
"In the first pillar, we have called for qualified majority voting to be made general in the Council for all legislative acts, together with the extension of the co-decision procedure and the lowering of the majority threshold."
"Where has the Intergovernmental Conference got to with the second pillar, Commissioner?"
"We should be glad to know about that."
"Enhanced co-operation can only be a last resort solution, in the event of a deadlock, a possibility which must be considered."
"Our resolution clearly shows that."
"This morning we commemorated the fortieth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome."
"Those who were involved in that historic moment for our ancient continent had ambitious aims and, above all, the political will to achieve them."
"Despite the difficulties, they held to their course and they did so in a spirit of solidarity."
"Ambition and political courage - that is what I wish for today's participants."
"Mr President, the solution recommended by Mr De Giovanni is designed to strengthen the unity of the institutions and to democratize them."
"He is quite right, and I approve."
"However, one major problem has not been dealt with."
"In the absence of any common social and economic policy, economic and monetary union will not work."
"The mad cow crisis has shown the need for a common public health policy; the Vilvoorde case has shown the need for a common industrial policy; the transit problem has shown the need for a common fiscal policy."
"Tomorrow, we shall need a common banking policy, etc. But the present institutions of monetary union will not allow these policies to be evolved, and the Intergovernmental Conference has excluded them from its agenda."
"In conclusion, I see two alternatives. Either we succeed in developing, beginning during this present Conference and continuing afterwards, a genuine common institutional framework for economic and monetary union and the first pillar, with the capability to move forward together; or we will have to make up our minds to advance, with deep regret, by the path of intergovernmental co-operation, reinforced in the first pillar."
"That is what I have emphasized in an amendment which I commend to the House."
"Mr President, by means of the amendments proposed to the part-session, the members of the Green Party would like to reinforce the text of the resolution in areas which we believe are fundamental and which also ought to be fundamental to the IGC, i.e. democracy, openness, freedom and human rights and mobility for the people."
"For us, democracy is to respect each other and each others' differences."
"We must lead the way for the new Member States to be respected and not impose religious or cultural restrictions but be open and democratic."
"We strongly oppose the proposal from the Dutch presidency to alter the anti-discrimination clause and to remove matters concerning sexual preference, age and disability."
"In order to guarantee a democratic foundation for membership of the Union, we believe there must be a withdrawal clause."
"Such a clause should give information on how one withdraws from the Union and how much it would cost."
"Furthermore, it is also necessary to change Clause 23 to specify that a civil foreign policy within the framework of an pan-European security system is needed and that all decisions should be unanimous."
"Unfortunately, I have to exceed my time by saying that I am dissatisfied with how this resolution has been dealt with by the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"The matter has been dealt with far too quickly."
"We have been given proposed amendments, texts and oral amendments sitting down."
"We have simply not had a chance to look at these proposals properly."
"I would therefore like to caution against the incredible speed with which decisions are made in the European Union."
"How can citizens participate in the discussions and understand all the new terms being used?"
"Please take note of my warning and do not do what the Committee on Institutional Affairs did a while ago!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I must join in the protests of Mr Méndez de Vigo at the absence of the Council which, although not officially obliged to be present, knows, through its officials, that the policies and decisions of this Parliament are determined in this Chamber and that therefore if it is interested in hearing them, it should do so here."
"In regard to the resolution as a whole on which our group will be voting - hoping it will obtain the consensus desired by so many other colleagues - I want to concentrate on the question of closer cooperation and address an appeal and an invitation to Commissioner Oreja to examine the content of the resolution that is before us for our approval tomorrow and the content of what has emerged from the activities of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, and not only in relation to the indivisibility of Parliament; that is a question raised by the Dutch presidency with solutions that are pretty fanciful and which I hope will soon be reviewed as regards the Commission's role."
"I know that the Commission per se would be inclined to give up its role of guardian, of pillar of defence of the structure of the Treaties, of the Union and of what the Treaty requires of it. But we regard closer cooperation as an internal instrument of the Treaty system and therefore the moment one or other country blocks a process of integration, the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has to put forward an initiative, since we cannot leave this task solely to the Member States."
"That is why I am glad Parliament is moving in this direction and I hope this will assist the Commission in its deliberations."
"Mr President, the forty years that have passed since the Treaty of Rome was signed can be divided into two periods in terms of the evolution of public opinion."
"Until the early 1980s, the communities were becoming established and the institutions were finding a degree of balance, with the Luxembourg compromise and the creation of the European Council."
"During that period, Europe was working to achieve recognition, and it gradually came to be regarded in a favourable light by its citizens."
"But, since the mid-1980s, it would seem that the trend has been reversed: the institutions have lost their equilibrium, the democratic deficit has been increasing and, above all, confidence has been eroded."
"Many of us have seen it in our own countries, and it is certainly true in France: if there is public controversy today on unemployment, immigration, insecurity or free trade, the European Union is instantly perceived as a source of threat, not of hope."
"This astounding reversal of opinion needs to be studied seriously; its causes must be analysed if we hope to get back on course."
"For my group, the essential cause is the way Europe adopts objectives which are very far removed from what the public expects."
"And this gap itself arises from a lack of national control over the European institutions, a lack which is far from accidental but is an integral part of a system which has specifically adopted the objective of bypassing national sovereignty and is now, as it were, being hoist with its own petard."
"On this fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, the Intergovernmental Conference must see it as its task to re-establish the conditions that will enable the Union to regain the confidence of its citizens."
"That is why my group is not associating itself with the motion for a resolution on behalf of the Institutional Affairs Committee which is being put to the vote, because it is too supportive of the fad for communitization at all costs and majority voting which, in the past, has helped to strengthen the European authorities while weakening the nation States."
"That is also, Mr President, why my group has tabled a counter-motion based on the principle of strengthening national control over the European Union and developing the flexibility needed to adapt the Union better to the needs of its citizens."
"I have received two motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 40(5)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr De Giovanni's excellent resolution gives me an opportunity to introduce an important point into this debate, relating to something which could seriously jeopardize European development."
"As a consequence of the pressure to achieve rapid economic integration, the development of this Union necessarily implies security cooperation and the need for closer cooperation in the domain of internal security."
"The freedom of movement we all desire for Union citizens as well as third-country nationals in the European Community is discussed in depth in the context of Community law but also as an area of intergovernmental cooperation, for freedom of movement goes hand in hand with certain aspects of internal security."
"These aspects of internal security, reflected in Europol, in the European information system, in the convention on the crossing of external frontiers and in the Schengen information system we discussed yesterday, all entail close cooperation among Member States in areas in which the Community, though operating on an intergovernmental basis, still encroaches very systematically on civil liberties."
"I need scarcely mention here that I personally, along with many of my fellow Members, would prefer this to happen within the framework of Community law and under the control and legislative jurisdiction of the European Parliament."
"Be that as it may, the fact that this is not the case, while at the same time responsibility for these processes is increasingly being removed from the national Parliaments too, carries the implicit danger that a democratic deficit will emerge in the realm of the third pillar and will be accurately identified as such by the EU public, thereby further eroding confidence in the democratic legitimacy of European action."
"That is why it is extremely pertinent that the resolution contains a reference to the particular need for action in the domain of the third pillar and the implementation of Article 7a of the Treaty on European Union."
"Mr President, forty years after the Treaty of Rome was signed, we are now debating its third review in an atmosphere which is, unfortunately, melancholic."
"In principle, the European Union's general report should fill us with satisfaction and optimism. But the impasses ahead of us in the negotiations justify pessimism and concern."
"President De Giovanni gave a good account of the more general reasons for our concerns."
"I fully agree with them, and without circumlocution I should add that I fear the crisis ahead of us."
"The most probable result of Amsterdam or Luxembourg is still at this time, in my view, a minor embellishment of the Treaties and not any decisive progress."
"To these general concerns, I should add the more particular ones felt by the representatives of the smaller countries."
"It is not enough to reiterate the principles that have held sway during these 40 years and have brought us so many successes: unity of our institutional system, preservation of the Community's achievements, the principle of equality, the principle of social cohesion, and the maintenance of balance."
"We must also respect and reinforce those principles, and never depart or turn aside from them, as the Commission itself did recently, with its proposals concerning its own composition."
"I say to Mr Marcellino Oreja that one cannot have equality between Commissioners of first and second rank in the name of a supposedly more effective Commission."
"Such a structure is not more democratic."
"That is not how to maintain balance and we cannot accept it, nor of course propose it to the parliaments and citizens of our countries."
"Mr President, I believe that Europe can only get ahead by demonstrating consistency with the principles sometimes threatened by the interests of certain major players."
"We will continue to fight for that."
"We want it, but at this time I do not know how much we can hope for it."
"Mr President, we are today celebrating the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome."
"Addressing this hemicycle, I have in mind the idea that in forty years it should have been possible to do more for European construction and do it better."
"This is my maiden speech and I felt that I should be ill at ease with the meaning behind that thought."
"I should like you to know that I, too, am concerned with the effectiveness of the European Union."
"But should we sacrifice peace, security, freedom, democracy and solidarity to efficiency?"
"Should we sacrifice, for the sake of urgency, the most noble objectives which have led us from the signing of the Treaty of Rome to this point?"
"The old adage 'More haste, less speed' still holds."
"I think that one of the reasons for Europe's success comes from the solidity with which it has been built, on a great deal of work, tough negotiations and genuine consensuses, in other words it has been achieved because people have taken things slowly, and there was no attempt to impose anything, there was always a concern to convince states voluntarily to adhere to ideals."
"When we pass votes so that in the year 2057 our descendants can commemorate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, I too would like to go along with that vote."
"But I would like to honour those who before us thought of Europe, who acted in order to transform it and who entrusted us with the task of continuing it, and this means fair recognition of the fact that taking things slowly has always been the reason for its success."
"Therefore today we must make sure that we can explain what we want, where we are coming from and where we are going as well as how to do it."
"Citizens of the Member States of the European Union have that right: and we who legitimately represent them here must carry out our duty."
"Madam President, allow me to explain briefly what disturbs me about this debate."
"Many Members are behaving as if we were awaiting a latter-day Pentecostal miracle in Amsterdam, whereas it is perfectly plain that this Intergovernmental Conference is unlikely to reach agreement on any major political issues, neither on fundamental rights nor on the composition of the Commission nor on flexibility nor on new provisions for majority voting."
"Everywhere there are conflicts and total disunity."
"Yet at the same time everyone describes unity as the prerequisite for our launching the enlargement negotiations."
"It is therefore very important that the European Parliament should not become bogged down in details but should address the main issues in its resolutions."
"That is one point."
"The second is this: I expect the Commission to adopt a more positive approach."
"What we have heard the Commissioner saying today is not enough, namely that he expects a conclusion in Amsterdam but does not know how it will materialize."
"How can things go on like this?"
"The third is that it is vital for us to ensure and insist that our national Parliaments exert pressure on their governments."
"That is absolutely critical, because it will be too late otherwise, and we shall be jeopardizing not only the existing Union but also enlargement and the European project in its entirety."
"There is no more time to lose!"
"Mr President, it strikes me when reading the proposed resolution that I live in two different realities: a political reality in Sweden and on the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"At home, I have never met a voter who for example demands a uniform voting system."
"I have also never met anyone requiring Union citizenship or a statutory majority in matters concerning criminal law."
"I do on the other hand encounter constant criticism about the lack of true democracy in the European Union."
"The greatest problem of the European Union is not the Third Pillar or flexibility but the lack of a democratic legitimacy."
"This is why it is so serious that the Intergovernmental Conference does not appear to be doing enough in this area."
"There do not seem to be any public meetings in the Council of Ministers which otherwise is a matter of course in a democracy or of transparency in the legislative assembly."
"The wording about the principle of public access to official records looks to be very feeble."
"The authority of the Commission which is subject to very weak parliamentary democratic control seems to be very much on the increase."
"This is a step towards a diminished level of authority for democratic national parliaments and towards stronger supranationality."
"We are heading towards a 'new Maastricht' and a new confrontation."
"Finally, I would like to say that I share my colleague Mrs Schörling's criticism of the way this resolution has been dealt with."
"An obvious example is that we do not even have access to the proposed amendments when discussing the matter."
"This is one thing we ought to be thinking of when requesting more authority, i.e. to find a working method that really functions democratically in Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, rarely in the history of the EU has the gulf between the dream and reality been so painfully obvious as it is today."
"With the celebratory speeches for the fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome still ringing in our ears, all we have to study are the confidential proposals of the Irish Presidency."
"I wonder whether the Europe of freedom, justice and peace has anything at all to do with the Europe that is being envisaged and worked for at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The truth is that the European Parliament is discussing its n th resolution, and I fear that the Intergovernmental Conference will consider this n th resolution to be just as irrelevant as all the others or at best an inconvenience."
"Perhaps there is food for thought in the fact that the presidency of the Council has not even found it worth the effort to attend a debate of such central importance in this Parliament today."
"It is not a matter of turning the prayer wheel over and over again; what we must do is to reflect on the political instruments with which, in the final weeks and months before the crucial meetings of the Intergovernmental Conference, this Parliament can actually step up its pressure on the Conference to a far higher level."
"By instruments of pressure I mean drastic measures, ranging from a vote of censure on the Commission for not heeding the voice of Parliament on this matter to blocking the budget for a European Union that we cannot regard as the Europe we owe to our people."
"Mr President, in my brief speech I would like to draw the attention of the Commissioner, Marcelino Oreja, as a doctor of law, a professor of international law, a diplomat, a former minister of foreign affairs, a former Secretary General of the Council of Europe and today a highly effective commissioner, to an issue he is well aware of."
"This morning we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome."
"As many previous speakers have said, and as the Commissioner knows, the Treaty of Rome - and the Treaties of the Communities, born of the Treaties of Paris and Rome - are distinguished for establishing an innovation in international law: the creation of supranational communities, in which relations between the States are not governed by traditional international law."
"At this moment, I fear that the Council of Ministers is on the point of making a great discovery - we would describe it in Spain as 'belated discovery of the Mediterranean' ."
"There are people who suddenly discover things which have been there all the time."
"Well, the Council is on the point of discovering international law."
"In other words, a Community based on Community law is about to be transformed into a Community under international law, like the United Nations Organization."
"Not to speak for too long, and as the Commissioner will be present at the Council negotiations, I would like to give him a little advice. He should remind the Council how this Parliament operates."
"Because I was quite struck by the Council's proposal that only Members of Parliament from the countries involved in flexibility should participate."
"That means if Mr Haarder, for example, is in the Chair and an issue comes up where neither England nor Finland nor Greece are part of a flexibility arrangement, Mr Haarder, who is now chairing the sitting, will have to identify each Member one by one, call the ushers and expel those Members from the Chamber one by one so that the procedure can go forward."
"But another flexibility arrangement comes up next, which includes England, Sweden and Finland, but not Portugal, Spain and Germany, so again the President will have to call on each of those Members to leave and recall the others."
"That will be highly entertaining and we will have great fun with it, but as I said before, I am afraid the rediscovery of international law by the Council will kill off this Community we founded 40 years ago."
"Mr President, the Dutch presidency has removed age, handicap and sexual orientation from the anti-discrimination article."
"That is a disgrace."
"The presidency is suggesting that the existing provisions are enough for measures against discrimination and that is a load of hogwash."
"The Commission has, after all, been complaining for a long time about the lack of a legal basis so I should like to know what Mr Oreja thinks about that."
"It seems as if the presidency is really afraid that an article with no direct effect but requiring unanimity may be too expensive and here it is not money but rather decency which is important."
"Equal rights for the elderly, the handicapped, gays and lesbians is an elementary cultural norm which should find a place in our new Treaty."
"Article 119 on equal treatment for men and women, the Irish formula, equal pay for work of an equal value is, as we know, to be scrapped."
"Does that cost too much as well?"
"There is not a single parliament anywhere which knows what to do about this proposed article."
"It shows that Europe seems increasingly set to become a cosy ministerial talk-shop."
"Where is the Dutch commitment to greater democracy?"
"I feel desperately let down."
"Mr President, it is not surprising the Council is afraid to show its face considering the proposals it has made, because the Dutch Presidency has achieved something quite difficult: it has made things worse and shown us that things always can get worse."
"The proposals it has presented are a definite step backwards."
"Perhaps it is a tactic and the intention is to make us happy to go back to the bad position we were in before, because the situation now is worse."
"We are definitely worse off today than we were yesterday and we are going to be even worse off tomorrow, on both institutional matters and political and social matters."
"Besides, the most serious backsliding is precisely in the two areas of most concern to the citizens of Europe: women's rights and the democratic deficit."
"There is a fear of consolidating, or giving powers to, the most responsible, most democratic, most representative institution in Europe, which is the European Parliament, but there is no fear of empowering the officials and bureaucrats who are populating the Europe of today, a Europe which is pure democratic deficit."
"Democratic control is the question in Europe today, and the question tomorrow will be what control there is over the European Central Bank and its vast accumulation of power."
"Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, Mr President of the European Parliament, we are going to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome just by saying 'more democracy for Europe' ."
"Mr President, today should really be a day of great celebration, because the Rome Treaties produced many good things."
"We should be grateful to the founding fathers of Europe, men like Schuman, De Gasperi and Adenauer, for having shown timely statesmanship, vision and courage."
"A vision of how, after two world wars, Europe could move forward in peace and prosperity."
"And the courage to take the necessary steps to that end."
"Mr President, it is not a day for celebration."
"Many present-day heads of government, and the Dutch presidency too, do not have the courage or vision needed to achieve the necessary break-throughs at the IGC."
"I can name three respects in which things are not going too well."
"There is the issue of equal treatment, the issue of flexibility and the third pillar."
"Starting with equal treatment, which Mrs van Dijk already mentioned."
"We expressly asked for a broad article on equal treatment and anti-discrimination to be included in the Treaty."
"It now appears that on a number of counts the elderly, the handicapped, sexual orientation, the presidency is backing off."
"We find that unacceptable and I can assure you that Parliament and our Group will shortly be testing the Treaty on this point."
"The second point is flexibility."
"We are increasingly worried about this."
"We are forced to conclude that flexibility is increasingly being used as an excuse for the failure of solutions in other areas."
"Not only foreign policy, but internal security and environment policy as well."
"And when that happens, flexibility will not be a positive alternative, but an excuse and a weakness which will destroy the Union."
"The resolution now before us thus imposes a number of tough conditions on this flexibility, the most important of which is the need to exercise democratic scrutiny."
"And the fact that the Dutch presidency does not see fit to subject the farm budget to democratic scrutiny is doubtless an ominous sign."
"Flexibility without such democratic accountability is unacceptable to us too."
"And then there is the fight against international crime."
"If this area is not included under the first pillar, and so far we have seen no official documents suggesting that it is to be, and if decisions are not taken by qualified majority, then we shall not solve this problem in Europe."
"It means quite simply that we shall not be able to control drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings and the arms trade, and that Europol will remain weak and toothless."
"The Dutch presidency is failing to give a lead here because it wants to keep drugs out of the third pillar or out of the first chapter of the Treaty."
"But this shows us really that thanks to coffee-shop opinion in the Netherlands the internal pillar is being held hostage to international crime."
"Mr President, the lights for the IGC are not at green."
"They are not even at orange."
"They are red."
"And red is the colour of shame."
"The shame of a Council which cannot do what was done in the fifties, namely show courage and vision."
"Things are looking bad for the IGC."
"We shall wait and see, but I hope things improve, otherwise we shall have some fierce criticisms to make afterwards."
"Mr President, when in 1986 the Single Act was concluded, Altiero Spinelli stated in this chamber, with his great political and moral authority, that the mountain had given birth to a mouse."
"What would he say today if he had to make a statement about the Intergovernmental Conference?"
"The obvious political inability to tackle the problems linked to enlargement and the lack of definition as to progress towards the single currency, through an effective deepening of political and social integration in Europe, has led the governments to turn into decisive subjects internal security and strengthen co-operation."
"It is without doubt that the increase in crime and popular insecurity linked to the unification of the European area calls for an ability to make joint responses which are also efficient, whose lack at the moment is a serious factor in the lack of prestige and the rejection of the European Union itself."
"The Intergovernmental Conference has to respond to this in democratic terms."
"Strengthened co-operation is being presented as a means of making progress towards European construction by overcoming the resistance of certain countries."
"But how can we understand strengthened co-operation without first of all having guarantees in the Treaty of extending qualified majority voting, specifically to prevent blockages which stem from the right to veto?"
"In the face of known proposals, it only makes sense to demand that we enshrine strengthened co-operation so that it cannot lead to an à la carte Europe and so that it guarantees institutional political unity, equality between the Member States and economic and social cohesion."
"At the moment there are no guarantees of this, however."
"On the contrary, we must beware of the possibility of this being enshrined into a genuine system of 'directoires' , which we should only reject and fight."
"The worrying tendency of the proposals coming out of the IGC to regress to methods of intergovernmental decision with reductions in the European Parliament's own powers, would only worsen the democratic deficit and the deficit of citizenship which exist at the moment in Europe."
"Mr President, in backing this motion for a resolution we wish, above all, to oppose, for the sake of democracy and solidarity in the European Union, the plans for breaking up the Union by these most unwise proposals."
"Mr President, when we commemorate a truly historic event like the signing of the Treaty of Rome, I do not believe we should concentrate entirely on reliving a past act, however honourable it might be."
"I believe, Mr President, we should draw out the essence, the principles and the values of a fundamental act which changed the face of our continent, interpreting them and examining them as the key to the future, particularly in terms of stimulus for the years ahead."
"I think the lesson to be drawn from this commemoration is as clear as day."
"I think a view of Europe firmly based on the tangible, the material, is a legitimate view of the project."
"But against this balance sheet view, this view based on the notion of net contributor or net beneficiary, I believe the time has come to revisit the values which inspired the founding fathers of Europe, ideas of peace, concord, understanding and solidarity."
"And they must all be understood a little in the light of circumstances and our own time, because the European Union of today was once a common market."
"That position has been superseded, Mr President, and we have moved on from the concept of consumer to the concept of citizen, and from the concept of Common Market to the concept of Parliament, alongside the Commission, giving decisive impetus to the project of integrating Europe, which is now at a key point in its timetable."
"Europe must be roused from its lethargy and move in the right direction, and that can only be done by combining pragmatism with a vision of the future."
"I think that is the message that needs to be sent to the Intergovernmental Conference: put figures at the service of ideals, stop concentrating shortsightedly on the coming elections rather than on the coming generations and let everyone seek their own best interests in the common interest."
"Mr President, I am grateful to Commissioner Oreja for being with us, because we have to ask the Commission a question in order to give our opinion to the Council, which is not represented here."
"What can we say to the Council except that it is guilty of hypocrisy, that the problem today is to secure the advance of democracy, and that the objective of the national governments is, as it were, to force the Intergovernmental Conference to withdraw."
"Basically, if they could abolish the European Parliament they would be more than happy."
"Not only that, but they would not have to contribute a token presence once a month."
"Let me give three examples."
"First, during the previous part-session, we adopted a resolution on human rights and the Debré law."
"President Chirac took umbrage and, as a consequence, the French Government has been wondering in the National Assembly how it can muzzle the European Parliament and prevent it from delivering any future opinions on human rights and the third pillar."
"Secondly, we have for several months been refusing to approve the agreement with Turkey because of the human rights situation there."
"The Council has become annoyed at this attitude, so that the conclusions of Dublin propose that Parliament's right of assent should be limited to the association and enlargement agreements, depriving us of any power over agreements which have budgetary implications, and impairing the right of co-decision."
"Why?"
"Because we are a nuisance."
"Thirdly, we are told that progress is being made in the area of the third pillar."
"Well and good, but in practice the European Parliament is being sidelined in favour of the national parliaments."
"Well, national parliaments have a much more partial view of affairs."
"Not only that, they can be manipulated, because they depend on government majority systems."
"And why is the European Parliament not to be allowed a say?"
"Because it is a nuisance!"
"In these circumstances, my questions will be addressed not to the Commission, since we are in agreement, but to the Council."
"I shall ask the Council: what are you really defending in the interests of advancing democracy?"
"Tell us frankly what your intentions are with regard to the European Parliament."
"Yes, we are a nuisance, and no we are not a conservative parliament. But that is the price of democracy."
"Thank you, Mr President. The technical quality of the European anthem this morning was appalling."
"We must ensure that the European project does not suffer the same fate as our anthem."
"We need to enliven our act."
"Although we have good reason today to celebrate forty years of the Treaty of Rome, which have brought peace and at least relative prosperity to a large part of Europe and to the people there, we also have reason to worry about the future of Europe."
"The main subjects on which we consider the state of negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference to be absolutely unsatisfactory have been referred to on several occasions today."
"Without genuine institutional reform we shall be placing the European project in jeopardy."
"Majority voting must become the norm, and in future there must be no more European legislation without the exercise of full codecision rights by the European Parliament."
"If no breakthrough is achieved on either of these two questions during the remaining three months, the Intergovernmental Conference will not have been a success."
"This in turn will put the start of accession talks with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe at risk."
"As an Austrian, I firmly believe that there is a place in this united Europe for our Eastern neighbours too."
"But to that end we must create a Union that is able and willing to accommodate these new member countries."
"We must not jeopardize the work of the past forty years."
"In the remaining months we really must do all that is humanly possible to work out sound and sustainable solutions, especially to the major institutional problems, which the Council has so far been desperately anxious to avoid."
"On a point of order, Mr President, before Mr Oreja answers: numerous colleagues have commented on the fact that the Council is not present here."
"To my mind the fact that we are embarking here on a debate formally entitled ʼQuestions to the Commission' should never be a reason for the Council to think that it need not attend."
"That really reflects a failure to understand Parliament's procedures."
"The Dutch presidency should appreciate that."
"As I understand it, there is to be an oral amendment to the resolution tomorrow."
"I think it would be a good idea for us to establish that the Dutch presidency and other presidencies too should attend all the important debates in this Parliament."
"I wanted to say that before Mr Oreja begins his reply."
"Mr President, I want to thank all those who have spoken here today."
"Their words are of immense importance to me in the work I have to do on behalf of the Commission at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"There is something I want to tell you because I have noticed a mood of pessimism in many of the speeches we have heard here."
"I want to say that the Conference has not yet entered the final stage, which is the negotiation stage, and you know from experience what the previous conferences were like."
"You remember the 1985 Conference and the 1991 Conference so you are perfectly aware that we did not really get into the negotiating stage until the final straight."
"There has been no real negotiating so far. We only began to approach negotiation a few weeks ago."
"Up to now there have been monologues, hardly even dialogues and, of course, what there has not been is real negotiation."
"Negotiation is starting now because now we have documents for discussion."
"Consequently what I do want to tell you is that the role of Parliament is very important at a time like this."
"I think you can have a decisive impact if you do everything possible to set out your positions clearly and as you know, the great majority of them are shared by the Commission."
"For example I do not remember a single discrepancy between us in the speeches of your representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference."
"And after those speeches I have always made clear the degree of consensus that exists."
"So I do think this is the really decisive moment."
"We are on the eve of 25 March, but we are also on the eve, in practice, of the Amsterdam European Council."
"This is a decisive moment and we will see what happens."
"I really have nothing to reply to because there have not been any questions to the Commission as such, and that is evidence of the great consensus between us."
"Some issues have been raised, for instance Mr Dell'Alba's point, also made by Professor Medina - professor and master, I am delighted to acknowledge that here - about the European Parliament's participation in enhanced cooperation."
"You know the Commission's position."
"It is the same as Parliament's."
"We do not believe the unity of Parliament can be broken. That would not make sense and that is the position we have expressed, both in our report and, very particularly, in the speeches I have made in the Intergovernmental Conference."
"I also want to say a word on Mr Anastassopoulos' reference to the role of the Commission."
"'Know thyself' is probably the most difficult precept."
"But in the end, only the Commission has said what it thinks of itself, after expressing its view on the other institutions."
"I want to comment on Mr Anastassopoulos' remark about first and second class commissioners in the Commission."
"I do not entirely agree."
"There are no first and second class commissioners, there are commissioners who have an assigned portfolio and there may be commissioners who do not have an assigned portfolio, which does not mean that their remit is less important."
"Forgive me if I share a personal confidence: I remember that when I started the negotiations for Spain's membership of the European Communities, a central role in that College of Commissioners was played by Commissioner Natali, who was responsible for all enlargement issues, but he did not have a portfolio."
"So what I regard as important is having a good balance. Now, as long as there is a proper allocation of responsibilities to those commissioners who have been assigned a portfolio, I do not think holding or not holding a portfolio necessarily implies first or second class commissioners."
"I think we have tried to strengthen something we consider essential: the legitimacy of the Commission."
"And in this connection, we have made clear the European Parliament's role in the election of the President and in the recognition or investiture of the College of Commissioners."
"I think that is essential."
"And I can tell you that personally, as a member of the previous College of Commissioners, I now feel that I have greater legitimacy, not least because of the hearings that were held here with the various members of the Commission prior to the final investiture."
"That all strengthens legitimacy and I think that is very positive."
"And finally, I also want to reply to Mr Frischenschlager's point about there being no agreement in the conference and that it was not enough for the Commission to say we were hopeful without saying how agreement would be reached."
"I venture to say that there may not be agreement on the Commission's issues but first, the Commission has a report covering its views on every issue, and second, we are continuously making our views known and I have made it clear exactly what our thinking is as regards common foreign and security policy, and what we think about the role of Parliament and the role of the Commission in the third pillar. We are making these points daily and I frequently do so in the Committee on Institutional Affairs."
"But in any case, I want to tell you that I have been greatly enriched by this meeting, by being here and receiving encouragement from Parliament, and by the essential feeling that Parliament is the cornerstone at this time because it represents the people."
"So I want to appeal to Parliament at this critical and significant time, on the eve of 25 March, and above all on the eve of the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, to keep us continuously in touch with Parliament's thinking so that we can move forward in the right direction."
"Mr President, I am sorry to prolong matters, but I put a very specific question to the Commissioner."
"I have not had an answer to it and I would like one."
"I asked him what the Commission thinks about the Council's position that anti-discrimination safeguards for the elderly, the handicapped and gays must be covered in the current package of social measures, when I thought the Commission had always said that there was not as yet any legal basis for that."
"So I should like to hear from the Commission whether it thinks that this position of the Dutch presidency is indeed correct or whether it cannot do anything about it."
"I had in fact made a note of that but I overlooked it amongst all these papers."
"This is an open question."
"The principle of non-discrimination has been accepted in relation to this matter and should appear in the treaty, which represents a step forward because, for me - and this is the position of the Commission - a central idea is that everything affecting citizenship - and citizenship is human rights - must be governed by non-discrimination."
"Two criteria have been applied to the list of what we understand as non-discrimination. One generates a long list of what non-discrimination covers, and the other gives a generic description."
"As regards actual description, one of the questions which some members of the Intergovernmental Conference have raised is whether or not this means - specifically in relation to people with disabilities - recognition of a legal basis and, as a presumption of that, whether there would be common policies."
"That is not the intention of other members of the conference."
"So it is an open question, and the issue will be looked at again in April. At the moment we can make no progress, specifically because the Dutch Presidency has not taken a final view on the matter."
"Mrs van Dijk can be sure that I will take careful note of what she wants - I think I feel very close to the positions she herself maintains - and I hope I will be able to give her an answer here, in this House, or in the Committee on Institutional Affairs, when this matter is back on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference in April."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.55 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"
"Budget guidelines for 1998"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following reports:"
"A4-0080/97 by Mr Tillich, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on budget guidelines for 1998 - Section III; -A4-0079/97 by Mr Tomlinson, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on budget guidelines for 1998 - Other sections."
"Mr President, I should like to begin by sincerely thanking the relevant committees of the House for their cooperation in producing the guidelines, and I am also grateful to the Commission, which is represented here today, and indeed to the Dutch presidency, for the climate of openness in which the negotiations on the guidelines have so far been conducted."
"I believe that these will form a sound basis for proceeding with the discussions on the 1998 budget."
"The budget of the European Union for 1998 - just like the 1997 budget - has to be efficient and transparent, but it must also be focused exclusively on programmes and projects which represent added value at European level."
"The aim must be to contribute to job creation and social and economic development in the Union, and at the same time to support the Member States in their efforts to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union."
"Most importantly, the Commission should improve its forecasting of agricultural expenditure - subject to monitoring by Parliament - and the Commission's preliminary draft budget should already reflect the impact of agricultural prices."
"In my view, the call from some Member States for zero growth is unrealistic."
"The European Parliament will approve a moderate increase, but only if the outstanding problems - the creation of a reserve under the agriculture guideline, the absence of legal bases, the question of second and third pillar expenditure and Parliament's right to be consulted, and the classification of expenditure - can be resolved in a way that is acceptable to the House."
"Parliament is also calling on the Intergovernmental Conference not to alter the budgetary rules of the Union in any way that would tend to restrict the budgetary powers of the House."
"As general rapporteur, I am proposing the following priorities for 1998: combating unemployment by focusing European resources on investment and job creation; using innovative credit arrangements to support small and medium-sized enterprises which are creating viable jobs for the future; beginning the process of preparing applicant countries for accession to the European Union; developing a suitable instrument to facilitate the inclusion of these countries in all the policies of the Union, while at the same time initiating a process of adjustment to EU policies to take account of the specific problems which enlargement poses for the Member States; supporting existing youth and education programmes which have a clear multiplier effect; and getting the cultural programmes moving once again."
"I have some further observations on the individual categories."
"Category 1 holds the key to achieving the success that the Council is seeking with the 1998 budget."
"The Commission and the Council must appreciate that with an overall budget increase of 3 % - leaving the Structural Funds untouched, in line with the decisions taken in Edinburgh - and zero growth in the other categories, they will still have to find ECU 2.3 billion from agricultural spending if they wish to move towards zero growth."
"Fair enough: we await their proposals."
"As regards the greening of agricultural policy, I would point out that this simply means incorporating the protection of the environment into all areas of Union policy, as proposed by the House and implemented by the Commission."
"I would therefore suggest that the two committees concerned - the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment - should reach agreement over the coming months on how this is to be achieved."
"Turning to category 4, the priority which I am proposing in my capacity as general rapporteur is as follows: the most important element will be the creation of a pre-accession instrument that will provide for structural changes in the Commission's services in 1998 and a programme for the pre-accession phase, as well as the requirements which will then emerge."
"We expect the Commission to bring forward appropriate proposals to this effect in time for the first reading."
"As regards the poor utilization rates of the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes, we are talking here about EU taxpayers' money."
"If no takers can be found in the recipient countries for what is on offer, there are reasons for that situation."
"With regard to category 5, we need better administrative management."
"The cumbersome Eurocracy must become an efficient authority at the service of European citizens and businesses."
"I would ask you to support the guidelines when we vote tomorrow."
"Mr President, the guidelines motion for the 1998 budgetary procedure for the other institutions is very clear."
"In the general framework that is set out in paragraphs 1-44 it makes it quite clear that the circumstances that we are facing are not austerity, but they are not encouraging of anything approaching profligacy."
"They are adequate without encouraging any degree of excess."
"We talk very clearly there about the need to honour our interinstitutional agreements to keep below the ceilings of the financial perspective and we point out that the suggested 3 % increase in appropriations should not constitute a target to be reached, but a guideline not to be exceeded."
"There is very clear reference in the report to human resources which, without going through it all, points out that there has, in fact, been a 23 % increase in staff appropriations over the last 10 years."
"Some of that has been related to posts linked to enlargement, but the most important paragraph is paragraph 10, which points out quite clearly that the Committee on Budgets commends to this House the view that as in 1997, no new posts should be created in 1998 for the other institutions overall."
"It does, however, point out the special circumstances that confront the Court of Auditors."
"The Court of Auditors has had the responsibility laid on it by the Maastricht Treaty to produce the statement of assurance."
"In order to get the necessary staff working on that, the normal, value-formoney audit work has suffered and that needs to be taken into account by this part of the budget authority."
"Under human resources it specifically underlines the need for each appointing authority to justify each proposed upgrading of post so that we do not just get global proposals, but a justification relating to them."
"Paragraph 12 refers to the minimum recourse to external consultants."
"I should make one point quite clearly to the House: this does not say do not use them, but only use them where their expertise is specifically necessary to complement the work of Parliament."
"I turn to the part of the report that deals with appropriations for property and supplies."
"I particularly draw the House's attention to paragraph 15 in which we reaffirm the European Parliament's policy of property acquisitions in as short a time as possible, consistent with other budgetary demands."
"This really is intended to be an endorsement of the existing position of Parliament's Bureau's where they are talking about purchase over a period of 10 years."
"It goes on to recommend this as an appropriate policy for other institutions and urges interinstitutional cooperation to this end to be accelerated."
"I now turn to the part of the report dealing with information technology and information policy."
"Of course this is a report that covers all institutions, but as we are mainly parliamentarians here, I take a parliamentary example."
"Information technology produces good, bad and indifferent."
"I visited today Parliament's web-site."
"On the positive side I discovered, for example, that the report of the Committee of Inquiry on transit fraud that was presented this morning is already available on the Internet in five languages: English, Dutch, Swedish, French and German - very positive."
"On the negative side, while still visiting the parliamentary web-site, I went to look at work in progress in parliamentary committees and I came up with the remarkable fact that no documents were found."
"It shows that our information policy is a somewhat mixed bag."
"There are very clear recommendations about the need to get consistent standards in our information policy, in our information technology policy, and not only in relation to them, but in relation to those imaginative projects which are so imaginative that not all Members of the House fully understand them, such as the Epicentre."
"So there are very clear guidelines there."
"I commend the report to the House."
"It was overwhelmingly supported in committee and forms the basis of aspirations to deal with the other institutions' budgets in a single reading."
"The only thing that might possibly stand in the way of that is property policy."
"The key to the solution is in the hands of our absent friends, our friends from the Council who have chosen not to be with us here this evening."
"Mr President, Parliament's Agriculture Committee expects to co-operate well with the Committee on budgets."
"We think that both parties gain from good co-operation and we have every confidence that Mr Tillich will ensure that it really is good this year."
"Looking more closely at the farm proposals we see that agriculture has been experiencing zero growth for many years now."
"There is perhaps an explanation for this: the agriculture guideline is not in itself a reason to spend money, it represents a ceiling, unlike the structural funds which do specify how much has to be spent each year."
"I think it is hard to explain to the man in the street and above all the man in the street in Europe that spending on the structural funds has to rise this year by 8 %, when there is still a whole pile of about 30 billion which has not been spent."
"What is the logic of that? Even if it was agreed in Edinburgh in 1992?"
"To me one of the most difficult features of the farm budget is that the income supplements per hectare are not being maintained."
"If more income support is really to replace price support as the future policy of the Union, that policy must be credible, and it will not be if we move the goalposts half way through."
"So I think, and the resolution says this, that we need to have a thorough discussion in the budgetary authority concerning category B1."
"What exactly is compulsory expenditure and what is non-compulsory expenditure?"
"Compulsory expenditure is that used to support prices and incomes and non-compulsory expenditure is used for other things, ideally covered by category B2, for example, which as I said just now is already overfunded."
"We are keen to have this debate, Mr President."
"Mr President, the fishing industry, as you know, is one of strategic importance for the seaboard regions of the entire European Union, where it represents an often irreplaceable source of jobs and economic development in these particularly sensitive zones."
"Even though the Common Fisheries Policy does too often adopt an approach which is more remedial than positive, it nevertheless plays a not insignificant role in these sensitive regions, to the benefit of fishing communities."
"This Common Fisheries Policy can be broken down into a number of aspects which are closely connected to each other although they appear on different budget lines."
"That is why, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I hope the rapporteur will be able to preserve the overall cohesion of our budget, which represents an indissoluble whole."
"How can the technical resources of the CFP be deployed if the financial resources are lacking for the control system?"
"How is a reasonable orientation plan to be implemented if the Structural Funds are not preserved?"
"That was the argument with which I approached the chairman of the Committee on Budgets and yourself, and I thank you for having already taken into account, even if only partially, the requests I made."
"Finally, regarding the fisheries agreements, I would remind you that, during the May part-session, we were asked to vote upon the Crampton report on the development of international fisheries agreements."
"Those agreements are a source of employment for a very large number of structurally sensitive maritime regions."
"I would also remind you that these fisheries agreements assist the development and stability of a number of less favoured States where fisheries can represent an important resource, and that those States include a number of our ACP partners."
"I would therefore ask the rapporteur to retain intact the line of credits corresponding to these important agreements."
"Mr President, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy I wish to make two points - one on research and one on energy."
"As far as research and development is concerned, there is a consensus amongst both the scientific and the industrial communities that research funded by the EU has a real multiplier effect, that it adds value."
"It is therefore all the more disappointing that the Council of Ministers is being so unambitious in its proposed funding for research. As you are well aware, we were expecting to have the fourth framework programme enhanced by a sum of about ECU 700m."
"Indeed this was exactly the sort of sum that was needed in order to enhance the research of the EU. Instead of that the Council comes up with a miserly suggestion of ECU 100m, ECU 35m of which they propose to spend on a new crisis need: that of BSE."
"It seems to us that ECU 100m is totally inadequate for increasing the competitiveness of the industries in the European Union and hence employment."
"The United States and Japan indeed spend far more than the European Union on research."
"My second point is on energy."
"The European Union entered into obligations both at Rio and in Berlin to contribute to combating climate change through measures such as energy efficiency and renewable energy."
"The problem here is the long-standing and widespread problem of a lack of legal base."
"The Commission is doing its best, I know, to adopt a framework wherein these programmes can be included."
"I hope that this will be done in time for adequate funding to be made available in the 1998 budget."
"Mr President, as the previous speaker has done, I should like to congratulate both our rapporteurs here this evening."
"My comments will focus principally on Mr Tillich's report and the Commission report on the Commission budget for 1998."
"However, I would like to say that Mr Tomlinson has done an excellent job in his report."
"We all know that he is a forward-looking man, rather like Batman visiting his website, and we like to know that he is well ahead of us in these information technologies and making sure that Parliament will be well provided."
"Turning to Mr Tillich's report, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur."
"It provides succinct guidelines so we are giving a clear message to the Commission and the Council this evening."
"It is a pity that the Council is not here."
"It does not augur well for the rest of our dialogue."
"We understand that the presidency does not take quite so much interest in such a day-to-day process as the annual budget procedure is now becoming."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, I should like to clarify our position as a group."
"In the 1997 budget we focused on maintaining our commitments under the inter-institutional agreement, which we did not wish to see disappear then, nor do we wish to see it disappear during this budget procedure."
"Our second plank was to go for zero, or almost zero, growth in the 1997 budget, as the European Union is preparing for the single currency."
"The position this year will be somewhat altered in so far as the way the Council is prepared to enter into dialogue with the Parliament as part of the budgetary authority is concerned."
"That leads me to make three specific points regarding the preparations for the 1998 budget."
"Firstly, we want to see outstanding items resolved and we encourage the Commission and the Dutch presidency to focus on the item of the legal basis in particular."
"This has been trailing for some time and we think it should now be fully resolved before the first reading of the 1998 budget."
"Equally, we wish to make sure that the demands of Parliament vis-à-vis the Intergovernmental Conference, in particular the example of obligatory and non-obligatory expenditure, are taken up within the Intergovernmental Conference and that we reach a satisfactory solution on it."
"Secondly, when it comes to specific priorities, the guidelines are extremely clear."
"They give four priority areas."
"The Group of the European People's Party would like to make sure that those projects which have a multiplier effect, giving real value for EU money, are not dismissed simply because the Commission or the Council in its input into the guidelines would like to see certain projects which are dear to Parliament dismissed."
"We want to make sure that we get value for money and we will insist that there is clarity in the way in which the analysis is done on the particular lines."
"We will examine the Commission's report on that."
"Finally, the most important part of this budget - and I think my group will share this view - is the pre-accession strategy."
"Terry Wynn has rightly drawn attention to that in paragraphs 27 and 28."
"At the dawn of new challenges for the European Union, we know there will be reports coming from the Commission later this year on what kind of strategy we should be following for enlargement of the European Union over the next decade."
"It is surely in the 1998 budget that we need to take account of that as a first step."
"Mr President, as you see, you have eventually given me the floor spontaneously, and, personally, I welcome that."
"The subject is an important one."
"As too often happens, it is not one to arouse the enthusiasm of the multitude, because all we see here are the same faces as usual: the members of the Committee on Budgets, Commissioner Liikanen and the administrators of the Committee on Budgets."
"But, as all these people have eventually come to know me quite well, I feel sure that none of them will demand my exclusion, and that I shall be able to express my group's opinion, seriously and calmly, on the budgetary guidelines and on the reports by Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, whom I congratulate on their efforts."
"These budgetary guidelines have to be seen in the new economic context: a context where the markets are taking account of the forthcoming introduction of the single currency."
"In particular, I have no doubt that the pressures on Europe's currencies, which have enriched speculators in recent years, were largely related to the uncertainty felt by the market about the coming of the single currency."
"The lowering of interest rates, the return of savers to Europe's stock exchanges, the collapse of the relationship of the monetary investment companies with variable capital and the recovery of the dollar are all signs that economic activity in Europe is returning to normal and favourable omens for a recovery of growth - the one essential condition for new job creation."
"That is why our group supports paragraph 1 of the section entitled 'General comments' in Mr Tillich's report, and I myself attach particular importance to the following phrase of that paragraph: ' to support the Member States in their efforts to meet the convergence criteria' ."
"I think something needs to be added to that, to set in motion the ideas put forward just now by Mr Wynn when he said that we want the best budget achievable: the best budget achievable is not the biggest budget achievable but the budget in which best use is made of the appropriations."
"And I believe the problem of increasing the volume of the budget for 1998 is not the crucial problem - the crucial problem is knowing when we shall finally see implementation rates that are maximum implementation rates."
"This is why we naturally support the four priorities defined by the Committee on Budgets, because one of those four priorities seems to me to be of the utmost importance."
"I refer to the exploitation of the job creation potential of the SMEs, because the hope of a recovery of growth is the one essential condition for new job creation."
"On agriculture, our group is still firmly committed to the principle of compulsory expenditure, and I say yet again: the agricultural budget is not a budget, it is an instrument of market regulation which should be thought about in economic terms and not in budgetary terms."
"That, by the way, is one of the reasons why I find myself so frequently disagreeing with Mr Brinkhorst, though that didn't stop me supporting, at the meeting of the Committee on Budgets, his amendment which is now the subject of paragraph 4 of the Tillich report, because I believe that the opening of a genuine dialogue with the Council will be one of the essential conditions for the success of our budget."
"I take this opportunity to say that, once again, I am shocked that the Council is not represented at this debate."
"Regarding the utilization of the appropriations, it is clear that the considerable shortfall in take-up of the PHARE and TACIS appropriations should make us seriously consider redeploying those appropriations which are not used."
"I think it is unacceptable to find ourselves with ECU three billion that have not been used and are going to be returned to the exchequers of the Member States at a time when we are facing desperate situations in other sectors."
"I do of course support the stepping-up of efforts and the additional financing for mine clearance in the former Yugoslavia, because I believe that the only way to induce refugees to return to the former Yugoslavia is to rebuild, and that it is impossible to rebuild any housing until the mines have been cleared."
"I shall be much briefer about Mr Tomlinson's report, confining myself to a very short comment on the appropriations for property and supplies."
"Our situation with regard to property is an unnatural one."
"The rental system for a Parliament which, at least in the minds of its founders, is intended to last forever should not lead to the enrichment of the property promoters who carry out the transactions."
"Especially as regards the incredible affair of the basement floors of the 'Caprice des dieux' , I trust we shall reach a satisfactory solution before the end of the year."
"We shall also be asking tomorrow for a separate vote on the end of paragraph 16 of Mr Tomlinson's report."
"Our group cannot accept a secret accord between the President of the European Parliament and the Luxembourg Government."
"Mr President, as rapporteur for last year's budget I would like, first of all, to wish my successor, Mr Tillich, every success and my old friend, Mr Tomlinson because 1998 is again a crucial year, perhaps not so much in financial terms but for what this budget contributes to progress on the institutional dialogue."
"As a European and a Dutchman I am sad to see that the Council presidency is again absent as it was during the BSE debate."
"I would like to ask Mr Liikanen what he expects of the dialogue."
"The 1998 budget is only going to be a success if outstanding questions not resolved in the 1997 budget are resolved."
"These points have been made by others."
"I would simply like to strengthen this point by saying that if we cannot resolve them, clearly we are going to enter into a confrontational phase."
"Secondly, 1998 is very important because it will show whether or not budgetary powers which actually exist will be taken away."
"Again this depends on the absent presidency."
"Pillar II and pillar III will become very important in the future not so much in monetary terms, but in terms of accountability and democratic control."
"Priorities have been established and I am very happy that we have fewer priorities this year than we had in the first instance last year."
"I am happy that all colleagues participated in this point."
"I would also like to stress the aspect of the pre-accession."
"We are living in a phase where very soon Europe will be much more than the 15 countries that we have now."
"Therefore it is necessary to redevelop instruments not only for the new countries joining, but for existing countries."
"My group will plead for something like PIMs for countries which, at the present time in the European Union, need to reorient themselves because they will be under special pressure."
"It cannot be an excuse to delay the adhesion of new countries but it will very much facilitate what at the present time cannot yet be done."
"Finally, agriculture remains important."
"The ad hoc procedure last year was a failure because of interinstitutional issues - I hope we can resolve this - and also because of extra-institutional issues."
"Again I would like to ask the Commission what it expects the absent Council to do on this point?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteur, Mr Tillich, is steering the House in the right general direction with the priorities he has identified."
"In practice, however, one has to ask exactly how unemployment is to be tackled and preparations made for enlargement to the east, and how these things will be costed."
"To my mind, this also begs the question of how these two priorities relate to one another. I believe that they are very closely related, because the Europe that we live in is already an entity, even if the rate of progress towards accession varies in the ten countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"We have a part to play in shaping the process of structural change which is taking place throughout Eastern Europe - a process intensified and accelerated by the prospect of accession to the EU - just as we are involved in the structural change that our Member States must undergo in dealing with an industrial policy which has to some extent run its course."
"Surely it follows, therefore, that we should take a joint approach to the challenges which are involved in this process of structural change in Eastern and Western Europe, and learn from one another?"
"The lessons of our current structural policy could usefully be applied in Eastern Europe, and vice versa."
"That is why, as well as the pre-accession instrument which the rapporteur has provided for in category 4, I am proposing a specific structural instrument in a new, additional category 2a."
"This would also serve to emphasize the gradual budgetary transition from external to internal policy as regards the applicant countries."
"At the same time, by creating a negative reserve, we would produce a technically neat solution which does not affect the present obligations to the Member States."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first let me encourage the President in relation to the surmenage we have imposed on him today;"
"Mr President, you have my full solidarity! I also welcome the Secretary-General who is in the gallery for the first time, I believe, at this night sitting on two reports."
"Of course I must also praise the two rapporteurs."
"However, I must express some concern about the Tillich report, and in part also about the Tomlinson report."
"In relation to the Tillich report, improved by the amendments, I have one major anxiety which I want to share with you in my brief speaking time."
"I think it is inconceivable for Parliament to tackle the budgetary procedure in a rigorous manner and in the context of a zero-growth budget without regard for the outcome of the Amsterdam Conference and what might happen if, please God, the European Union finds means of responding concretely to the challenges which we have discussed so often and so seriously: unemployment, etc."
"This timid approach to things, saying that as from March we do not intend to increase the Community budget by a penny, do not intend to increase the staffing by a single post, while the other institutions are to acquire more powers by virtue of the Amsterdam Conference - the Commission could have more powers, the Union as such could acquire responsibility for new policies - this timidity which forces us to calculate, as though this were our priority, the number of annual leave cases where the place of origin is outside the European Union - I certainly do not regard this as an encouraging start."
"In particular, Mr President, I am referring to a question that was central to our discussions during the last term and to which Parliament devoted much energy, to the point of nearly deciding on a motion of censure on President Santer and the entire Commission. Not a word is said in the report about the priority we attached to this question and which the Commission is prepared to support at our incentive, namely the need to carry out more rigorous controls on the quality of human food to ensure that we have a health and food policy that is concrete and controlled by the Commission."
"Not a word on all that, Mr Tillich!"
"I have here some amendments which I hope you will examine with attention."
"We had a joint amendment which was inexplicably rejected."
"I really hope Parliament restores it so as to introduce a minimum of logic into the subject of our debate."
"As for food aid and humanitarian aid to third countries, we have discussed the extent to which the lines would be taken up and utilized; we have already pointed to the cases where cuts need to be made."
"They are budget lines - B7-210, B7-212, B7-217, B7-219 - which have utilization rates of 180, 160, 152 %; well, what are we saying to this?"
"'Estime important d'évaluer l'efficacité de la politique de l'aide humanitaire.'"
"Qu'est-ce qu'on doit évaluer?"
"In fact we must encourage this policy and make it work."
"I have tabled an amendment on that too, which I hope will be adopted."
"Thank you, Mr Dell'Alba."
"Thank you both for your intervention and for your words of encouragement, but please rest assured that this Presidency has great staying power."
"If you wish to test it out, you may do so on Friday morning, when I shall still be in the chair."
"However, I should say that, generally speaking, when honourable members comply with the Rules of Procedure - as they usually do - presiding over a sitting is not a chore, but a pleasure."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Tillich, having acquainted myself with Mr Tillich's report I took the liberty of comparing his proposal with that put forward by the Commission regarding the 1997-98 farm product 'price' package."
"The sum was easily done: a 3 % increase in the general budget, a 0.5 % increase in the agricultural budget, an 8 % increase in the Structural Funds."
"In a word, a cut in the agricultural budget relative to the guideline, on the pretext of non-utilization of the sums appropriated to the EAGGF for several years, and an increase for the Structural Funds even though it is common knowledge that we do not use 70 % of the sums appropriated."
"A case of double standards that requires an explanation."
"Your proposal for agriculture, coupled with the Commission's, puts us - and will put us - in serious difficulties before the 1999 international negotiations."
"If these proposals are accepted as they stand, Europe will be committing a serious strategic error by reducing these payments for the major crops."
"Allow me to remind you that, even as we debate the matter, the exact opposite is happening in the United States."
"Their new legislation provides cereal growers, until the year 2000, with a level of subsidies at least equivalent to what it was previously."
"So our competitors are going to step up their farming activities and gain market shares."
"We, as usual, are going to do the opposite and we - or rather you - are going to bear the responsibility."
"In the light of this situation, our group proposes two simple amendments whose common objective is to safeguard the future of our agriculture."
"First, the European Union must keep its promises to our farmers, and secondly the Maastricht convergence criteria must not be used as an alibi."
"Considering the weakness of the Commission's proposals, it is therefore necessary to retain the principle of compulsory expenditure for all the agricultural lines."
"I cannot believe, Mr Tillich, that on this fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome you failed to take account of the great success of this Common Agricultural Policy by condemning it."
"Mr President, although I am opposed to the Government of my country, I find the position of the Council of Ministers more logical than those of the Commission and this Parliament."
"The proposed 3 % increase in expenditure seems to me excessive."
"In every European country the equivalent expenditure - in other words the investment or intervention expenditure - is not increasing."
"It is stable or even declining."
"Consequently, genuine austerity would not be to increase expenditure by 3 % but, at the very least, to leave it unchanged."
"The only acceptable rate of growth for European taxation and European public spending is zero."
"That would be a strong signal to the tax-paying citizen."
"A brief digression: in the southern French towns where the electorate has voted for mayors belonging to my political party, the National Front, local taxation will fall in 1997."
"That is something that is extremely well received by public opinion and by the taxpayers."
"It is an extremely strong signal."
"Parliament would do well to follow that example, the more so since the increases proposed to us are essentially being justified by the 8 % increase in the Structural Funds."
"That increase is unrealistic."
"It is unrealistic because everyone knows, and indeed everyone is saying, that there is a wide gap between the appropriations committed and the appropriations taken up."
"Providing for excessive expenditure, over and above what can possibly be used, is quite obviously a source of waste."
"Everywhere where appropriations are too high - which is the case with the Structural Funds - there is the danger of waste, the danger of clientage."
"The justification offered for this expenditure on the Structural Funds, and on other lines, especially social policy, is the justification of employment - the struggle against unemployment."
"Unfortunately, the Structural Funds do not create jobs."
"They move jobs. They put jobs on wheels, trundling them around Europe from one place to another but without ever creating new ones."
"What could create jobs in Europe is different trade policy, different relations with the rest of the world, but not the Structural Funds."
"Incidentally, we had an example this morning - I am sorry to go back to this - the Renault business."
"What happened?"
"The European Union allocated a number of Structural Fund appropriations to the States of southern Europe, specifically Portugal and Spain."
"It was obvious for Renault to build factories there, factories which produced cars more cheaply than other factories further north."
"The Structural Funds contributed to this job creation in southern Europe."
"And yet, in this case too, what we have is not expansion but regression: the trade-off is the closure of the Vilvoorde factory, which will probably persuade Europe, through the Structural Funds, to make appropriations in order to compensate for the job losses."
"In a word, the Structural Funds do not create jobs - at the most, they move them."
"The social policies for combating unemployment are ineffective, or at best they try to make unemployment more bearable."
"That is no way to improve the situation in Europe."
"Mr President, firstly I would like to congratulate the two rapporteurs who are in the chamber on their reports, but I will concentrate on Mr Tillich's report and, owing to the lack of time available, will deal with only a small number of aspects."
"We refer to this report as 'Guidelines' , i.e. its aim is to guide the Council, to provide a course to be followed, to inform the Council that these are Parliament's priorities."
"The Council would be wise to bear this in mind for its first reading."
"The first piece of advice for the Council is that there are still a number of disputes outstanding which are of great significance for Parliament."
"We would like to resolve these matters once and for all, together, and they include the matter of the legal basis for many budget lines, particularly those lines about which European citizens are extremely sensitive."
"Mention should also be made of the problem of classifying expenditure. This is an important topic given that the European Parliament is one of the branches of the budget authority."
"The next piece of advice from the European Parliament to the Council is that this House is very clear about where its policy priorities lie, about where emphasis should be placed, and the most important matter is the fight against unemployment."
"No one should be in any doubt that unemployment is a real domestic tragedy for whomever is affected by it."
"I would like to end by expressing a wish - please would the Council read the verbatim proceedings of this debate, so that it knows what has been going on, since it has not deemed it necessary to attend."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mr Tillich on his excellent report and also because, in this exercise, he has continued to make use of the formula of cooperation between the various parliamentary committees, inaugurated in the budget for 1997, which is proof of the openness and cooperative mood of the Committee on Budgets."
"A result of this openness has been that no fewer than eleven parliamentary committees other than the Committee on Budgets have formulated amendments to these budget guidelines: 39 of the 134 amendments tabled come from these committees, despite this not having been an easy task."
"The translation of the report was available on 25 February and the period available for submitting amendments ended on 4 March - there was barely time to react, especially since the ordinary parliamentary committees do not receive the privileged treatment in terms of time periods, translation, availability of rooms and permission for meetings which the Committee on Budgets has."
"I would like to concentrate on the amendments tabled by the Committee on Regional Policy - although not all were accepted in their entirety, many were incorporated into Mr Tillich's report, either directly or via compromise amendments. Others no longer needed immediate approval in the light of the report's final text."
"The original wording of paragraph three of the report caused the Committee on Regional Policy much concern, since it accepted from the commencement of the budget procedure not only an average increase below the ceiling fixed in the financial perspectives but also wanted to apply that reduction equally to all expenditure categories, which meant that not only would expenditure within Category 2 be cut back but, also, in this exercise, the reduction would impinge on commitment appropriations. This signifies ignorance of the fact that the amount allotted to the Structural Funds, referred to in the financial perspectives, not only constitutes a simple authorization but also an expenditure target, as derives from Article 12, paragraph two, of the Framework Regulations of the Structural Funds."
"We are therefore grateful that the Committee on Budgets has amended that paragraph three in the terms given in the compromise amendment tabled by Mr Tillich, including within the demands presented to the Council respect for the compromises established in the Framework Regulations of the Structural Funds."
"It is our belief that the budget authority must not compromise either growth or employment."
"For the same reasons, our committee was concerned by the original wording of paragraph 12 of the report and we believe that Mr Christodoulou's amendment 72, which amended the said paragraph, is more appropriate, since it firstly points to the need to continue the structural policy, in accordance with the Edinburgh agreements, and also expresses its concern about the percentage of payments made, asking the Commission to issue a detailed report and submit proposals aimed at rationalizing and improving the effectiveness of these policies."
"Overall, we think this is a reasonable report and I would like to conclude by congratulating Mr Tillich once again on his having written a report which makes the requirements of budgetary austerity imposed by Economic and Monetary Union compatible with continuity of economic and social cohesion."
"(FI ) Mr President, the reports under discussion create a good basis for the preparation of next year's budget, and I should like to congratulate Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson on their reports."
"The primary objective of next year's budget has been defined as the prevention of unemployment."
"It occupies both the first and second places on the list of priorities."
"Unemployment is a terrible scourge in Europe."
"There are already nearly 20 million unemployed and unfortunately no end to the growth in unemployment is in sight."
"Neither is it possible to talk of European cohesion if our citizens consider that the European Union is not capable of reducing unemployment."
"Still less can we speak of cohesion when there is a lurking suspicion that the European Union's policy itself increases unemployment."
"Thus the fight against unemployment must be seen to be a particularly central task for the EU as a whole."
"In the creation of new jobs, small and medium-sized enterprises occupy a key position."
"It is therefore right and proper that the budget's second priority area is improving the operating conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The structural funds have a key role to play in strengthening business activity."
"The concern expressed in the report about the large discrepancy between commitments and payments in the structural funds is partly justified."
"There is no point in committing funds if they are not used."
"Over the last five years almost 20 % remained unused."
"Mr President, subject to these comments I still have great hopes of next year's draft budget."
"Mr President, my group cannot settle for the report before us as adopted by the Committee on Budgets."
"I particularly regret the fact that the necessary rigour that this 1998 budget should show has virtually disappeared in the report."
"At a time when the Member States are being asked to make substantial efforts to reduce their budget deficits, to reduce their public spending, and in some cases to increase taxation too, it is wrong to have this kind of increase in expenditure in the European Community's budget, following the increases contained in the 1996 and 1997 budgets."
"The Commission must be told that we want to subject ourselves to the same climate of austerity as is being imposed on all the Member States, and that climate must prevail in every sector of Community spending."
"I also regret the fact that the principle of subsidiarity, which had rightly been invoked by the rapporteur, has disappeared at the budget review stage."
"I do of course support the comments made by my colleagues Mr des Places and Mr Souchet regarding support for farmers' incomes."
"I should like to add two further points that explain my group's hostility to the report."
"The first relates to information policy."
"The report says in its opening paragraphs that the necessary effort must be made on behalf of information policy."
"Here again, in an austerity context it would be appropriate not to spend too much on selling the citizens of the various countries of Europe what is going to look increasingly like pure propaganda."
"Finally, Mr President, we are also unable to support paragraph 37, which refers to the establishment of a genuine European Foreign Service."
"Mr President, this morning when we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome President Santer said that an economic Europe calls for a social Europe."
"In the Tillich report, the European Parliament emphasizes the importance of employment, regarding it as the absolute priority, the importance of the social dimension of the European Union and the major contribution that Community funding makes to achieving social objectives."
"So I consider it essential for adequate funds to continue to be earmarked for the various social policy activities financed by the Union."
"I too am very displeased at the absence of the Council, with whom we want to reach agreement on the legal bases."
"Frankly, I consider this attitude incomprehensible and also as unnecessarily inflexible vis à vis Parliament in particular."
"I also believe it is fundamental not only to sustain our training policy but also to include in the financing of this chapter the objectives listed in the White Paper on education and training."
"Today Parliament voted on a report that specifically evaluated the White Paper."
"I would ask the Commission to continue with the work it began in 1996 on monitoring the utilization of the European Social Fund and establishing more systematic relations with the Member States in this area."
"This work showed that there was an improvement in the rates of utilization and demonstrated that the criticisms - like those voiced here tonight - about the under-utilization of the Structural Funds and the Social Fund are in fact unjust: we must examine and check where the problems are and tackle them, to ensure that the available resources are used in full and in the best possible way."
"Mr President, at this stage it is most important that we should have a clear view with regard to the agriculture budget of what the contribution of the European Parliament must be to this important section of the budget."
"I think we realize already that the farm budget is now debated far more intensively than in previous years."
"Above all in the Committee on Agriculture."
"Only very close co-operation between the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Budgets can ensure that we play our proper part as Parliament and improve the quality of the budget as a whole."
"The need here is for greater transparency, more realistic spending estimates and consequently the best possible use of the funds which are available for non-farm budget items."
"This first report of Mr Tillich's inspires confidence."
"I hope he will demonstrate the requisite inventiveness and flexibility so that the committees concerned can agree a common view and enable the European Parliament to do likewise."
"Moving on to the substance."
"For the first time we have proposals, prompted by the agriculture budget, to change the income supplements in order to meet the spending criteria."
"But those criteria have first been looked at unilaterally by the Council."
"The agriculture guideline appears not to have played any part at all here."
"More strangely still, the proposed reductions in income supplements are to be permanent, whilst the reason for them is somewhat exceptional in nature, namely the BSE crisis."
"I think that this way of operating farm policy is not conducive to creating confidence amongst the producers concerned."
"They are entitled to serious and in-depth consideration of the system on which they depend for their livelihood and control of which has passed almost totally to the European institutions."
"Mr President, firstly allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Tillich, for his flexibility when discussing his document in committee, a place where there are not only contrasting ideological and regional views but also the contrasting views of the Council and of the Commission."
"It is therefore obvious that it will be difficult for the House to exert an influence if the rapporteur's principal concern is not to achieve broad consensus on the document in question."
"For the sake of such consensus I think it right that the idea of the budget having to draw inspiration from subsidiarity should have been discarded, when it is precisely the budget which is the instrument implementing Community policies, not the instrument determining subsidiarity."
"I am in total agreement with the priorities the rapporteur sets out in point five of his report, provided we do not forget the amounts set in Turin."
"Referring to point 2, therefore, however logical it may appear that the level of commitment appropriations should be established as a function of actual forecasts, I believe there will be less conflict if we keep to the Edinburgh agreements."
"It would be something else again for us to conclude that the Financial Regulations have to be revised again in order automatically to render the commitments not used by the beneficiaries null and void."
"Mr Tillich, it is difficult for us, via an annual budget, to attempt to condition programmes which have already been approved - utilizing EAGGF expenditure is not the best way to influence the environment."
"Perhaps the big question mark which remains regarding this budget relates to PHARE, TACIS and MEDA."
"How can we be more realistic - which is what we want to be - without breaking with the amounts agreed at the Cannes European Council?"
"Mr President, I want to thank Mr Tillich for his report and congratulate him on trying so hard to represent almost everybody's point of view."
"In his general remarks he makes the point about helping the national governments to achieve the Maastricht criteria."
"I have to say that this is unrealistic."
"We spend 1.22 % of the GDP of the Community."
"National governments spend 46 %."
"Whether we go up or down a percentage point or two will not in any perceptible way affect the ability of any national government to achieve the Maastricht standards."
"Yet in spite of the smallness of the budget that we spend there are, generally, quite a number of voices talking about reducing spending."
"I think this is unrealistic."
"Mr Tillich makes the point about his four priorities, which Mr Fabra Vallés referred to and supported."
"I support too small- and medium-sized industries, unemployment, youth and culture."
"These are important."
"But we have already committed 80 % of the budget in agriculture and structural funds."
"If we are to make any meaningful contribution to the policies proposed as priorities then we have to have at least some expansion in the amount of resources available to us."
"In the area of agriculture Mr Tillich does not say much."
"But he does imply that by changing the regulations we can save money."
"This certainly would be bad faith and bad politics because the reform of the common agricultural policy in 1992 was intended to take us up to the next round of GATT agreements."
"We should look forward to the day when we will be able to increase productivity and improve farm incomes to reduce agricultural spending."
"I sincerely hope we will."
"Nevertheless, for the moment it must remain."
"We worry too much."
"It was a six-year programme."
"It is more important that it be well spent than that it be all spent."
"Mr President, the European Parliament has tonight debated its priorities for the 1998 general budget."
"The role of the Commission at this stage is to listen."
"The institutions will have a first discussion of their positions in the trialogue on budget priorities on 9 April this year."
"The Commission adopted its budget orientations for 1998 at the end of January."
"It is the second time that the Commission has done so."
"This procedure is one of the first innovations to strengthen financial management in the Commission and it has fulfilled the expectations."
"On substance the Commission decided to continue to pursue the approach of budgetary rigour which it started with the 1997 budget and which was subsequently strengthened further by the budget authority."
"The first reason to maintain a rigorous orientation is the same as last year."
"The Member States are continuing their often painful efforts to get their public finances in order in the run-up to economic and monetary union."
"Of course the Community budget is not big but it must, within its limits, encourage and facilitate these efforts."
"There is also a second reason which is gradually becoming more important."
"As the next round of enlargement approaches, the Community's finances have to be prepared."
"This has implications both for the level of spending and for the Community structural programmes."
"These questions will be discussed in more detail after the Intergovernmental Conference but a smooth transition to an enlarged Community will only be possible if the remaining time is used for the required adjustments."
"In its budgetary orientation debate the Commission also decided on a new method to re-establish budgetary rigour."
"In fact, the traditional approach of following the financial perspectives with some small margins would not be appropriate for 1998."
"It would in fact lead to growth rates of 10 % or even more for the Community budget."
"Compare this to an expected growth of less than 3 % in the Member States."
"It would be simply impossible to explain such budgetary generosity at Community level to the citizens and taxpayers of Europe."
"The Commission has therefore adopted a new approach to reflect on a justifiable overall growth rate first and then to discuss the priorities within such a framework."
"For 1998 it has decided to aim at limiting an increase to as close as possible to 3 %."
"I noticed from Mr Tillich's draft report that the Commission and Parliament agree on the need to support the Member States in their efforts to meet the convergence criteria."
"The discussions on the appropriate growth for the 1998 budget should not be overshadowed by preconditions which are, or could be, beyond reach."
"Mr Brinkhorst asked me a question about the willingness of the Dutch presidency to contribute to a mutual understanding of these issues."
"I cannot comment on the results but I have to say that the Dutch presidency has shown a lot of interest in the budgetary issues."
"The best sign of that is that the budgetary issues will be discussed at two Ecofin Councils even though the presidency is not here at present."
"(Interjection from Mr Tomlinson) I must say to Mr Tomlinson that this morning there was another important report in this Parliament which was closely and intently followed by the presidency."
"The Commission objective of 3 % is not only inspired by the expected developments in the Member States."
"It also appears to be a reasonable compromise between the imperative of rigour and respect for the existing commitments of the Union."
"At the level of the financial perspectives this concerns in particular the commitment appropriations for structural funds."
"The decisions of Edinburgh imply a growth rate of some 8 % compared to 1997."
"That is quite high in the current circumstances."
"However, unless there is an agreement in the Council and Parliament that the inter-institutional agreement should be modified - and I take it from the draft Tillich report that Parliament will not be party to such an agreement - the Commission will respect the spending objectives for commitment appropriations in Category 2."
"As far as payments are concerned, any over-budgeting must certainly be avoided."
"While it is difficult to meet an overall target of 3 %, if 8 % growth is accepted for one-third of the budget, it is not impossible."
"But it requires a very small growth of expenditure in the other categories."
"Of course this does not exclude the reinforcement of a few particular priorities if other activities are reduced or some phased out."
"The Commission has not taken a position on the balance between the categories but it is obvious that a rigorous outcome can only be acceptable if all the institutions live up to their responsibilities for different parts of the budget."
"Thus the Commission adopted a proposal last week for the agricultural price package for 1997 and 1998 which is compatible with its overall budgetary strategy if - and this is crucial - the Commission proposals concerning adjustments in the cereal sector or equivalent savings are adopted."
"With regard to Category 4, the Commission is working on a review of PHARE in the direction envisaged by the rapporteur and this issue was also raised by Mr Wynn and Mr Elles."
"I hope the Commission will be able to discuss the matter next week or in two weeks at the latest."
"As far as its own House is concerned, the Commission has decided to propose another year of zero growth for its staff, except for enlargement and it has agreed on new quantified initiatives to redeploy its human resources to priority activities."
"In closing I would like to express my best wishes to the rapporteurs, Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Samland, for a successful budgetary procedure for 1998."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"North/South cooperation to combat drugs"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A4-0059/97), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation on North/South cooperation in the campaign against drugs and drug addiction (C4-0630/96-95/0167(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr Liese)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, between 40 and 50 million people throughout the world are dependent on illegal drugs."
"And that statistic conceals a host of grim individual stories."
"There are many causes of drug dependency and drug dealing, and that is why an integrated approach is needed if we are to combat the problem."
"One aspect which is frequently overlooked is the fact that development policy can also make a major contribution, and has to do so if the drugs problem is to be tackled successfully."
"Poverty and underdevelopment are direct causes of illegal drug cultivation in the developing countries."
"If no legal alternatives are available, it is easy for the mafia to step in."
"Another problem that we often overlook is the fact that the drug trade and the large sums of money that it brings into a country lead to an artificial overvaluation of the currency."
"This means that those who make their living from legal produce are doubly penalized, because their earning ability is reduced."
"Once again, it does not pay to be honest."
"In order to solve the drugs problem, therefore, some of the resources of development cooperation must also be brought into play."
"The committee was unanimous in supporting this concept, and I should like to thank everyone who helped with the report."
"In particular, I am grateful for the cooperation from the Commission, and for the efforts of my colleagues who collaborated on this report."
"We managed not to complicate the issue of development policy with ideological arguments."
"We did not engage in any debate on the principles involved in liberalizing drugs policy, because such a debate would have had little focus and would not really have solved any of the problems."
"What, then, are the central concerns of the report and of the Committee on Development and Cooperation?"
"We wish to see the expression of a political will to get to grips with drugs in those countries with which we cooperate: in particular, national legislation on money laundering must be put in place and suitably monitored."
"We wish to see a high degree of respect for human rights, and a recognition of the key role that women play in the process of alternative development."
"We also support the Commission's initiative of cooperating with the United Nations in the fight against drugs."
"As rapporteur, my main concern - shared by the committee - was to put the concept of alternative development at the top of the agenda."
"Alternative development means giving people the chance to earn their living by cultivating legal produce, so that they no longer have to depend on illegal drug crops."
"This may sound simple, but in practice it is very complicated."
"The idea is not merely to replace coca or poppy fields with something else: we need an integrated concept."
"Training must be available, marketing structures for other produce must exist, and there must be a means of transporting that produce."
"Only when all this is in place will the concept of alternative development actually work."
"Last year, I had the opportunity of seeing for myself a number of United Nations projects in Colombia which are also partly co-financed by the Community."
"I was very impressed to see that it was possible to replace quite extensive acreages of illegal crops with legal ones and, in doing so, to offer people hope for the future."
"But here too it is essential, first of all, that the rule of law should operate in the country at least to a minimum extent, and that those involved in the illegal drug trade should be penalized at some point."
"The Council accepted a good deal of the report at first reading."
"In particular, I think we should note that, after some initial problems, it stopped quibbling over the legal basis and recognized that Parliament had a right to be consulted."
"Unfortunately, however, we did not reach agreement on every point, and that is why we are once again seeking clarification on the question of alternative development in particular."
"Not only do we wish to see alternative development funded from this budget line; we are also calling for a systematic examination of the Community's other financial instruments and the European Development Fund to see if they can help to support the concept of alternative development."
"The fact is that we must take a more committed approach in this area."
"Of course, this also means that, far from cutting back on development aid, the fight against drugs is a further reason for increasing it."
"If we fail to do so, the European Council statements on combating drugs will have little credibility."
"Mr President, let me first compliment the rapporteur, Mr Liese, on the excellent work he has done over the past months and on succeeding, with the cooperation of all of us, in getting the Committee on Development and Cooperation to express a unanimous view for the second time running."
"The development of cooperation in fighting drugs and drug addiction is an objective that Parliament set itself a long time ago and does indeed represent the search for an intelligent response to a problem that affects the life of millions of people in the world, in both northern and southern societies, which pollutes political, social and economic relations at international level and which is today the main source and principal means of support of the most profitable forms of international crime."
"In the field of combating drugs and the spread of drugs, development cooperation also acts as an important example of international solidarity and cooperation with third countries and is an intelligent, preventive and more effective method of confronting and resolving problems that directly affect our societies."
"There are three fundamental objectives which the Community institutions have set themselves with this proposed regulation: firstly, to reduce the impact of drugs production as a factor of stimulating demand for the consumption of these drugs; secondly, to reduce the power of the mafia and the cartels, by cutting the ground from under their feet and reducing their sources of supply; thirdly, to reduce the central economic position of drug production in large areas of the developing countries."
"We must seek an intelligent solution because we have to form an alliance with the people of the south for whom the production and trade in drugs is often the only or main means of subsistence."
"From that point of view, reference has rightly been made to the central role played by education to increase the awareness of the populations concerned, but even more important is to associate development and anti-poverty policies in the efforts to combat the production of drugs."
"It was rightly pointed out that it is not enough simply to tackle the direct problem of replacement crops: action is needed within the organization of society in order to combat the power of the mafia, by strengthening the role of women and formulating alternative development projects based on the economic recovery of productive systems and, more generally, on social improvements."
"After Parliament's first reading, the Council accepted some of the approved amendments."
"However, we note that some questions have remained on the sidelines, in particular the key role of women, the social and environmental implications of the activities relating to human rights, and sound management."
"That is why our group will vote for the 23 amendments approved by the Committee on Development."
"Mr President, I read this Council of the European Union common position through with great interest."
"I see there an extremely impressive range of activities which are planned."
"We are actually going to try and help the developing countries!"
"This is very laudable because, after all, we are exporting synthetic drugs to these countries, and for once we are not blaming them for exporting to us."
"But then I know, because I have had something to do with drugs, and I have recently been talking to Mr Gelbard, a Secretary in the State Department in the United States, they have spent US$1, 000m on crop eradication in Bolivia."
"They have not yet touched Peru because they have not had much cooperation."
"And then I see that all this great work which is to take place from 1998 to the year 2000 is going to cost ECU 30m. I just ask you to compare the US$1, 000m which has been spent by the United States on crop eradication in one country, with the ECU 30m which is going to be spent over the period 1998 to 2000 under all these plans which are so well drawn up, so carefully thought through."
"What are we doing?"
"Are we serious?"
"I cannot believe we are serious if we are spending that sort of money."
"I have no more to say."
"Mr President, in congratulating Mr Liese on the quality of his report I would like to concentrate on the three amendments which I, once again, put forward with his support."
"First, Amendment No 3: the need to avoid contradictions between the EU policy to combat the drugs trade and those of the World Bank and the other financial institutions."
"Alternative development opportunities for producers of drug-linked crops in developing countries are too often jeopardized by unfavourable macro-economic policies imposed directly or indirectly on those countries."
"Peasant farmers find it increasingly difficult to produce other crops competitively for export under prevailing conditions of structural adjustment."
"Our regulation should make reference to this and require the Commission to work with the Member States, within the international institutions, to reduce these."
"Second, Amendment No 4, which seeks to ensure that criteria for deciding a country's eligibility for EU support and for evaluation of the projects will be defined in dialogue between the Community and partner governments or organizations."
"It is extremely important that the EU does not follow the example of the United States which, in some countries, has unilaterally made drug control assistance conditional on the attainment of crop eradication targets."
"Not only is the long-term value of forceable eradication questionable, but eradication driven by conditionality is provoking serious social instability in countries such as Bolivia and Colombia."
"Third, Amendment No 5, which seeks to give priority to enabling small peasant producers to take advantage of EU trade preferences."
"It is the small-scale rural sector, including those cultivating drug-linked crops, that should be the object of our development assistance in this field, and hence should be the object of the regulation."
"All of us in this Parliament are united in our determination to combat the drugs trade."
"But this regulation should recognize the practical measures which are required if the EU's policy of joint responsibility for the drugs problem is to be realized: respect for genuine cultural differences, an anti-poverty focus and a framework of fair trade can succeed where repressive measures have failed."
"In our regulation let us commit ourselves to these objectives."
", Vice-President of the Commission."
"(ES) Thank you Mr President, and good evening to everyone sharing this solitude."
"Many thanks, Mr Liese, for your report - you may rest assured that the Commission has made the campaign against drugs one of its priorities."
"The use, production and illegal trafficking of drugs are, together with money laundering, problems which a large number of countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia have to deal with."
"The illegal production of drugs is tending to become internationalized - this is no secret, and you state this in your report - and it is no longer just a few developing countries which are cultivating and converting coca crops, opium poppies or cannabis in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East or Asia."
"Industrialized countries and other developing countries have, unfortunately, also begun to produce so-called designer drugs, or synthetic drugs."
"In addition, illegal drugs use has now become a public-health problem for a growing number of developing countries, not just for rich nations."
"This globalization is very closely linked to the profits which can be derived from drug-related activities. It is well known that such profits are huge."
"However, money laundering is not the privilege of the industrialized countries with advanced banking systems, but goes on everywhere to a certain extent, from East to West and from North to South."
"The European Union, as you will know - to reply to one of Mr Howitt's concerns - has distanced itself from certification policies as practised by the United States and we have incorporated the principle of shared responsibility, both in our policy position in Vienna and in the future position to be adopted by the European Union at the forthcoming General Assembly of the United Nations on the subject of drugs."
"Shared responsibility in the sense that although a great deal of the responsibility lies with the producer countries - that fact cannot be denied - there is also a great deal of responsibility on the part of the consumer countries, and it is our belief that only by assuming the principle of shared responsibility - co-responsibility - will it be possible to set up the bases for an international dialogue which will enable us to eradicate this plague."
"We do not believe - you are quite right - that unilateral certification measures will achieve positive objectives in the campaign to combat drugs."
"There is one absolutely elementary question, mentioned by Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, who is well versed in drugrelated problems since he has in the past prepared several reports for this House."
"This budget line is really very modest as a specific line intended to combat the drug problem."
"However, we should not forget that, principally in the Mediterranean - specifically in the case of Morocco - or in Latin America - Bolivia and Peru - a considerable part of the cooperation programmes currently being implemented is essentially aimed at promoting alternative crops."
"Allow me to pass on some information about Bolivia: alternative crops in the Chaparé region in Bolivia are being financed by the European Union."
"The United States has made no contribution whatsoever."
"A degree of care should be taken when presenting such impressive figures in the campaign against drug trafficking, since a distinction must be made between development cooperation funded by military sources and development cooperation funded by the forces of law and order."
"To be sure, if, in its report, the European Commission were to include all the national budgets of the 15 Member States - all the expenditure for Scotland Yard, the French Gendarmerie , the German police, the Spanish Guardia Civil and Italian customs officers - the amount spent by the European Union to combat the drugs problem would also be an impressive figure."
"However, this matter has to be viewed from different standpoints."
"It will not come as news to anyone that this specific budget line could hardly be more modest."
"Yet, let me give you all a warning: the European Parliament, namely you yourselves, in the 1996 financial perspectives decided to reduce the already modest sum of ECU 11 million by one million."
"As a consequence, it is difficult to ask the Commission for an explanation of why you decided to further reduce the already modestly funded budget line."
"However, I say again, a large part of development cooperation programmes targets such problems."
"Naturally, there are problems such as the safeguarding of human rights and global poverty-alleviation policy - in this respect we can accept the European Parliament's recommendation - and I am pleased, Mr Liese, that you are pleased with the Commission at least this evening - you cannot imagine how happy we at the Commission are that this House is pleased with us, because it has not happened very often - and I am also pleased that we are in a position to accept virtually 90 % of your amendments, although a few do cause us some problems."
"Some of these are basic matters, such as Amendment 4; another would be Amendment 21, particularly given internal Commission organization."
"We always prefer logically to present budget-line implementation at the end of the year and not in the first 6 months, because, generally speaking, the Commission identifies projects in January, February and March, and approves them in April, May and June, for implementation from October, November and December onwards."
"As a consequence, from our viewpoint, working at the end of the year corresponds to the logic of internal work organization."
"As for Amendment 3, you will be aware that the Commission is not, as such, an integral part of international institutions."
"This role falls to the European Union which is generally represented by our honourable Council of Ministers."
"Anyway, thank you."
"This report is valuable and offers guidance, but I still have misgivings about its lack of a global character, particularly in budgetary terms, as such a character would lend credibility to this interesting drugs-related policy."
"Thank you, Mr Commissioner."
"Do allow me to congratulate you on your excellent pronunciation of Catalan and also for having pointed to what you referred to as, if I have understood correctly, ' shared solitude' . However, since we are discussing such an important subject this evening we will have to trust that a careful reading of the Verbatim report of proceedings will make up for non-attendance."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Population policies in developing countries"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A4-0057/97), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a Council Regulation on aid for population policies and programmes in the developing countries (C4-0631/96-95/0166(SYN)) (Rapporteur: Mr Nordmann)."
", rapporteur. (FR) Mr President, I hope that population matters will produce the same positive feelings in Parliament and the Commission as everything that has been said on drugs."
"In the hope of creating those feelings, I shall not go back to basics because Parliament has already declared on several occasions that it favours support for population policies in the developing countries - support provided by the Union which respects the humanistic values of individual freedom of choice while at the same time serving as a vector for the better development of health services."
"This is the philosophy Parliament has tried to institute, and it is the same philosophy that underlies the proposal for a regulation under consideration."
"At second reading, we might share the sense of satisfaction Mr Liese referred to earlier at what we might call a statistical level, because I believe that 26 of the 40 amendments tabled at first reading were retained in the common position."
"It should also be noted that those amendments which were not retained relate primarily to the formulation or relative flexibility of the action framework and that the Committee on Development did not see fit to assert a kind of proprietorial vanity regarding some of them."
"The first of the amendments on which we should like to insist concerns a reminder of certain financial commitments entered into on behalf of the Union, especially at the Cairo conference in 1994."
"The Union had announced its intention, between now and the year 2000, of increasing its financial aid to population policies in the developing countries to ECU 300 million."
"Although the Commission did not submit any financial memoranda at first reading, the sums set down by the Council fall terribly far short of what had been announced, hence one of our amendments recalling that commitment."
"That being so, not everything has been said, and not everything will be said at voting time, and of course we will have to have a budgetary strategy for monitoring this matter."
"The second amendment, which is something of a formality, relates to the problems of commitology."
"The Council having declared itself in favour of a regulatory committee, our own committee, conventionally, asks that responsibility for verification and monitoring of the policy be entrusted to an advisory committee."
"There remain a number of amendments which were tabled by Mr Liese, rightly I believe, in so far as they reintroduce points adopted at first reading."
"They also reintroduce provisions which were not retained by the Committee on Development."
"That is why, irrespective of the validity of Mr Liese's position and the respect one may feel for it, I, in my capacity as rapporteur, shall have to vote against these amendments."
"Once again, they relate to very slight differences of standpoint, with the exception perhaps of Amendment No 8, the adoption of which, as such, would be likely to raise practical problems of implementation in certain difficult or urgent cases."
"However, setting aside the debate which this amendment might cause, I think I can conclude by saying, Mr President, that we should close this procedure with the same sense of satisfaction as in the previous debate."
"Mr President, population growth is a problem for the development of many countries."
"However, it is by no means the only cause of poverty, and my group is convinced that it is not the main cause of poverty in the developing countries."
"Population growth should not, therefore, be used as an excuse for refusing essential aid and trade preferences."
"Nonetheless, the fact remains that population growth must be vigorously tackled."
"Solutions must be found which take account of the people concerned."
"Personal experience has convinced me that it is not the case that families, and particularly women, are happy with large numbers of children."
"It is the women who are seeking information about birth control, and they are also seeking practical help."
"I think it is right that the European Union should offer that information and practical help."
"Of course, we all realize that this means more than just distributing condoms."
"An integrated approach is needed, and education - particularly for women - is also a key to tackling population problems effectively."
"Our group has a special concern which has already emerged in the debate: we are particularly anxious that unwanted pregnancies should be avoided."
"On the other hand, because we are dealing here with a budget line for population policies and demography, we also wish to see the decision of the Cairo Conference being implemented."
"In other words, abortion should not be a means of birth control."
"If we are talking here about demography, as opposed to general humanitarian aid, then this is not the place for argument about abortion under medically unsatisfactory conditions, because we are dealing here simply with population policy."
"The fact is that we cannot agree on the question of abortion, nor are we going to reach agreement, whether in Parliament or in the European Union."
"And our amendments are not designed to produce a European Union view on abortion."
"Of course we must take the Cairo Conference seriously, in so far as what we are dealing with here is population policy."
"I should therefore be grateful if the other groups could signal their willingness to accept Amendments Nos 3, 4 and 5 in particular."
"These amendments were tabled by other groups at first reading: Amendment No 5, in particular, came from the Socialist Group."
"The point here is that no support should be given to countries or organizations that use compulsory abortion and infanticide as means of controlling the population."
"In my view, there can be no serious argument against such an amendment."
"Therefore, I would ask once again for your support on this point."
"Mr President, in tackling this problem I should also like to say that the demographic problem, although it is not the single cause of the problems of developing countries, is nonetheless a problem which cannot be overlooked."
"Consequently it seems to me that the conclusions of the Cairo Conference are perfectly appropriate conclusions and they should be defended by all of us, including the final consequences, namely concerning abortion, which at the conference in Cairo undeniably was presented as a process which must not be looked upon as a form of contraception, deserves our support."
"In any case, the demographic problem affecting developing countries is a problem which calls for a very serious effort in terms of training and prevention."
"There is a set of policies which ought to be developed and, consequently, we must very seriously bank on public health policies and also the development at the appropriate level of policies on sex education, which are compatible with any positive approach to this problem."
"In the perspective of the positions set out by Mr Nordmann, these seem to me to be extremely correct."
"On the one hand, we must consider that the Union's undertaking concerning the strengthening of aid to democratic programmes in developing countries up to 300, 000 million escudos by the year 2000 is fundamental as a minimum contribution for developing these questions, and also the questions of comitology seemed to me to be extremely well dealt with by the rapporteur."
"We must concentrate on committees such as the FED, MED and ELA, because it is by means of information, hearing and continuous consultation that this problem can be dealt with in a proper and positive way by the European Union and be developing countries themselves."
"Mr President, we consider it extremely important that, as part of these measures, the European Union should fulfil the commitments it entered into at the Cairo conference on population and development, and do so on a scale that will effectively enable the provision of widespread access to family planning in the developing countries."
"On that basis, my group will back the report which has been tabled, and we hope that it will be adopted in a form which does not entail a one-sided view of the world."
"I cannot conceal the fact that we had a controversial vote in the Committee on Development on certain amendments which have now been tabled again in plenary."
"We share the concern of the PPE Group that developing countries should be equally entitled to participate in tendering, and to that extent there is no disagreement here."
"However, we wish to make it quite clear that our group is not prepared to support those amendments that seek to promote a very one-sided view of the world."
"It remains to be seen how the House will vote."
"I should like to return to the question of the UN conference in Cairo, since we believe that this conference represented a significant step forward in terms of opinion forming, and contributed to raising awareness and making people realize that we have to achieve slower population growth if we are to avoid the unfortunate situation that exists in many developing countries, where improved economic growth is outpaced and eaten up by population growth."
"There is no disagreement on the fact that compulsory measures should have no part to play here, but on the other hand we believe that we should not lay down too many preconditions which involve interfering in the internal affairs of other countries."
"Ultimately, what we are dealing with is an extremely wide range of attitudes among people of different cultures, and it is not for us to lay down more preconditions than are absolutely necessary."
"One piece of progress in Cairo which, as a feminist politician, I should particularly like to mention was the agreement by the conference that women themselves can decide freely how many children they want, and when they want to have them."
"This consideration also conditions our view of the report, and we should like to see it adopted in that spirit."
", Vice-President of the Commission."
"(ES) Thank you, Mr President. Thank you very much, Mr Nordmann, for your report which sets this evening's debate against an atmosphere of mutual understanding between the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament regarding a matter as important as demography, covering both population aspects as well as health and production worldwide."
"In global terms, the Commission's priority objectives which, I believe, are largely shared by the European Parliament and the Council, are three in number. Firstly, enabling women, men and adolescents to come to a decision freely and with full knowledge of the facts about the number of children they have and the timing of any births; secondly, contributing to the creation of a socio-cultural, economic and educational environment which makes it possible to exercise this option fully, especially in the case of women and adolescents, through the condemnation and eradication of any form of sexual violence, mutilation and abuse affecting their health and dignity."
"As something of a response to Mr Liese's concerns, the European Community particularly endorses the position on abortion, adopted at the Cairo Conference, condemning its use as a method of contraception."
"Thirdly, we wish to make a contribution to developing or reforming health systems in order to increase access to them and the quality of reproductive-health care provided in the case of men and women, including adolescents of both sexes, thereby significantly reducing the level of risk to the health of women and children."
"The Commission's initial proposal has been altered considerably - Mr Nordmann is right - by the incorporation of many of the amendments proposed by this House on first reading."
"I would therefore like to offer my thanks for your collaboration on this specific aspect."
"I would like to make the following comments on the amendments endorsed by the Committee on Development and Cooperation: the Commission is in favour of Amendment 2, which relates to the use of Committees; as regards Amendment 1, on increasing Community financial support for population policies and measures by ECU 300 million by 2000, the Commission - I have to point this out to you - will not be in a position to introduce this possibility on purely technical grounds, since the Regulation - or the legal base of the Regulation we are discussing this evening - will enable a legal base to be attributed to a budget line, aimed at demographic matters, which also consists of a very modest sum: barely ECU 8 million, aimed at financing pilot projects."
"Now I would like to comment further on the discussion I had with Sir Jack Stewart-Clark concerning the money spent on combating drugs."
"Population policy does not come under solely that particular budget line, because if you take together all the policies we implement - Latin America, Africa, Mediterranean and Asia - and what is done under bilateral programmes with various States receiving our aid, the sum of ECU 300 million is exceeded with interest."
"Yet again, as happens with the Community budget, we come up against the form that matters should take: if we were to look at population policy-related expenditure contained in the Lomé Convention, in Latin America, the Mediterranean and Asia, you may rest assured that ECU 300 million would be exceeded."
"If an attempt were made to set up a budget line of over ECU 300 million applying only to population matters, we will have the same problem as we have with the 'drugs' line."
"A choice has to be made, and I believe that we are confronted more with a problem of presentation, of how the Community budget is spent, than with a dispute over figures with the Committee on Development and Cooperation."
"Next, there is a series of amendments - numbers 3 and 4 - with which we have problems on a number of objective grounds."
"Amendments 5 and 8 we regard as unnecessary because the criteria relating to these amendments are already sufficiently contained in the recitals of the common position."
"However, I would like to give you an example of something that is being done in the population field, namely the three most recent decisions we have taken under the terms of a bilateral cooperation project, to demonstrate that we are well above ECU 300 million."
"The first piece of evidence is this: the ECU 200 million subsidy for the family welfare programme in India, to support the implementation of a new series of policies to be centred on family planning and also on global harmonization of reproductive-health measures."
"In India alone, in terms of family welfare, we are already spending ECU 200 million. The 'Asia' initiative on reproductive health - ECU 25 million - which we recently signed with Dr Nafis Sadik from the United Nations Population Fund last month relates to an innovative programme for working essentially in Asia."
"To finish, a further bilateral example: in the Philippines, there is an ECU 19 million mother-andchild programme which will help to reduce the risks facing pregnant women and women in labour or who have just given birth, thereby reducing maternal mortality rates."
"I wanted to mention these examples - India, ECU 200 million; United Nations family-planning programme in Asia, ECU 25 million; and the most recent decision regarding the Philippines, ECU 19 million - to demonstrate that if we add together all we are doing on various bilateral cooperation programmes, the Committee on Development and Cooperation should have no trouble in confirming that, in this specific case, we are meeting its requirements - our presentation, however, is, of course, different."
"Thank you, Mr Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Fourth framework programme in research, technological development and demonstration (1994-1998)"
"The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A4-0084/97), on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Decision adapting for the second time Decision 1110/94/EC on the European Community fourth framework programme of activities in the field of research, technological development and demonstration (1994-1998) (C4-0041/97-96/0034(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Linkohr)."
"Mr President, on Monday the Committee on Research adopted my report by a substantial majority - two members abstained, while the others voted in favour."
"Our message is relatively simple."
"We take the view that the funding should be increased by ECU 200 million, as opposed to ECU 100 m; that funding for all the programmes - with the exception of research into BSE, which has already been treated very generously - should be doubled; and that an additional ECU 33 m should be provided for research into renewable energy sources and water."
"As regards the amendments, all I have to say is that no amendments were received on Monday, but clearly a whole series of amendments has now been tabled."
"Speaking as rapporteur, I have to recommend that we reject them, because while I have every sympathy with some of the amendments, I am representing the view of the committee."
"Moreover, the substance of many of these amendments is already included or at least implicit in the report."
"The conflict which lies ahead of us is not, however, about the amendments."
"It is simply about money, and I would strongly urge the House that it should demonstrate the maximum degree of solidarity in adopting the report if we are to have a chance of success in the Conciliation Committee."
"I am relatively confident because the Committee on Budgets is behind us, which means that we can expect some genuinely tough negotiation."
"On the substance of the report, I find it somewhat disconcerting that the Council took so long to reach a decision in the first place, and that it could not then see its way to providing a further ECU 100 m."
"I would remind you that the ECU 100 m in question is not an additional sum of taxpayers' money: it is a sum which Parliament made available from savings in other areas, and we shall be able to save a further ECU 100 m in the new budget."
"So the money is there."
"ECU 100 m is already in the reserve, in any case, although it can only be paid out when there is a legal basis for doing so."
"I would remind you here of a point that has often been made, and is rightly referred to time and again by the Commission: Europe's competitiveness is, unfortunately, declining rather than increasing."
"This assessment is no less accurate for being constantly repeated."
"Declining competitiveness is what lies behind the loss of a great many jobs in Europe."
"Part of the reason why we spent so much time this morning discussing Renault's problems and the related difficulties is the fact that Europe has given away its competitive edge - and done so knowingly."
"Nonetheless, I hope that this debate and, in particular, our disagreement with the Council of Ministers will at least send out a small signal."
"I know that ECU 100 m or ECU 200 m is only a fraction of Europe's annual spending on research, but it could serve to point the way ahead."
"Unfortunately, there is no lobby for research."
"Researchers themselves are above taking to the streets, and they do not count, as far as the political parties are concerned, because there are not enough of them."
"The researchers have to rely on Parliament, therefore, and I hope that we shall achieve a substantial majority on this issue."
"If Parliament approves the report, as I hope it will, then I also hope that we shall move into the conciliation procedure as quickly as possible and waste no time in coming to a decision, so that notices can appear in the Official Journal."
"The fact is that if the procedure is not concluded in time, even the best decisions will be useless because it will be too late to pay out the money."
"I would therefore ask the many Members who are present here to give this report their backing."
"Mr President, first I should like to congratulate Mr Linkohr, not least for his patience in this apparently never-ending saga of the refinancing of the fourth framework programme."
"Speed is now essential."
"Months are slipping past; brain-power is being wasted."
"So we hope this decision will be taken speedily and implemented."
"I regret very much the apparent absence of the Council of Ministers, although I may be wrong, from this important debate."
"The main priority of the European Union is jobs."
"One way, though certainly not the only way, of creating jobs is to make ourselves more competitive through research and development."
"We have problems in society which research and development will also help with."
"And the European Union adds value."
"This is the view of academics and industrialists."
"There is a multiplier effect."
"Therefore it is all the more bizarre that the Council of Ministers and the Member States that compose it wish to repatriate money where it does not have that added value."
"We are disappointed at the cut from the expected ECU 700m, which of course led to the drawing up of proposals, down to a paltry ECU 100m, over one-third of which is to be spent on BSE."
"We in the Committee on Energy, Research and Technology wish to express our very warm thanks to the Committee on Budgets for its support."
"It is forward-looking."
"It has made research and development one of its priorities and has found more money to be spent on research and development."
"It is the committee that found it."
"It expects some sort of recognition for its efforts from the Council and the Commission."
"Turning briefly to the content of Mr Linkohr's report and the way in which we expect that money to be spent - and remember this is co-decision - some of the European Parliament's priorities are reflected in Mr Linkohr's report: our wish for landmines to be investigated, for inter-modal transport, educational multimedia and, in particular, renewable energy - and I must make it clear that the Committee on Budgets made it a condition that a proportion of that extra money would be spent on renewable energy."
"I am told by medical researchers that the amount to be spent on BSE is unrealistically high."
"However, in the interests of the speedy adoption of this report, we will go along with this."
"But, we do not propose to double that amount when we double from ECU 100m to ECU 200m. This is a sensible report."
"Let us all support it and get it through quickly."
"Mr President, as a group we shall support this report, although we have certain qualms about doing so."
"Incidentally, I should like to say that the rapporteur has my admiration for the work that he has done."
"He has my admiration not least because he was involved in a conciliation procedure two years ago, the outcome of which was ECU 700 million in a reserve - in other words 5 %."
"Without wishing to belittle Parliament's powers of codecision - and nothing could be further from my aim - I have to say that this begs the question of whether the entire procedure is justified by such an outcome."
"One thing really amazes me in all this."
"We wish to invest in the future - today we had workers from Renault here, and we have problems with the miners in Germany - but what are we doing?"
"In the very areas that have a bearing on the future - research, development and possibilities for industrial conversion - we are trying to save money!"
"I would not mind if the money saved at European level was in fact being spent effectively on research at national level."
"But there, I have to say, I have my doubts!"
"In any event, I am convinced that for the future of our research policy, we must find a form of financing which does not entail debating budgetary changes in the middle of the framework programme."
"I was involved in the process four years ago: it was not satisfactory then, and it is not satisfactory now."
"Secondly, I have some reservations concerning the Commission's role in all this, and I have already spoken about these."
"Just how seriously are we to take proposals that begin by providing for task forces with ECU 700 m of funding - for which a great deal of pressure was exerted - if those proposals can subsequently be changed at the stroke of a pen?"
"What happened to the package when it emerged that we were to receive not ECU 700 m, but only ECU 100 m?"
"Looking now at the list and the allocation of resources, I honestly have to ask what difference two million here or there will make."
"What has become of our package?"
"Having a package also implies finding the courage to state what we do not want - and we did not manage to do that."
"For myself and my group, all this is a learning process."
"I am convinced that for the fifth framework programme, we need a different type of cooperation."
"Perhaps we also need different structures, and in any event I shall do my best to ensure that we cooperate positively."
"It is with some degree of resignation that I will now conclude and offer the rapporteur my full support."
"However, this is not the way to prepare for the future."
"Mr President, the common position presented to the Council is a step backwards compared with Parliament's first reading."
"At this historic moment, when the importance of research is increasing day by day, I believe it is wrong not to give more coherent funding to this programme, which would enable the European Union to improve and develop coordinated research, so that the Member States can act together in the common interest."
"We note that the European Union is finding it increasingly necessary to compete with the United States and Japan and the emerging economies, where research funding is and always will be more consistent and more conspicuous."
"The increase proposed by the Council gives more precedence to its own financial priorities without taking account of the proposals made by the European Parliament in the 1997 budgetary procedure, when it decided to set up an ECU 100m reserve for research."
"That reserve would indeed make it possible to increase the framework programme funds by at least ECU 200m."
"So the Council's attitude has in fact made the efforts of Parliament futile."
"With such financial premises I think it is worth noting, as Mr Linkohr has done, that the increase of ECU 200m would, among others, have made it possible to earmark some of the funds for renewable energy sources, which are also important for the Mediterranean area."
"It is in this area that Mr Malerba and I tabled an amendment, underlining the importance of a new form of renewable and non-pollutant electrochemical energy, what are called combustion cells."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the common position 35 % of the ECU 100m are allocated to research on BSE, vaccines and viral diseases."
"This is indeed extremely important to public health and the future of the European Union; however, as other rapporteurs have pointed out, perhaps that 35 % is being allocated at the cost of other important areas."
"Finally, I hope the Council will do the necessary to amend its own common position and that negotiations will begin as soon as possible to remedy this situation."
"Mr President, my compliments to Mr Linkohr on the work he has done so far on the topping up of funds for the fourth framework programme."
"Mr President, my Group is unhappy that the original increase of 700 million ECU for the fourth framework programme has been cut by the Council to just 100 million. This is because the BSE affair has caused the Financial Perspective to be exceeded and because the Council refuses to modify the Financial Perspective."
"But, Mr President, Parliament now finds itself lumbered with the problems which the Commission and Council themselves brought about by failing to react to the BSE crisis in time."
"Thanks to Mrs Cresson's proposal Parliament is also faced with a fait accompli since just 35 MECU of the Council's paltry 100 MECU are being set aside."
"Once again for BSE, rather than the 15 million ECU which Parliament had proposed."
"My Group is not in agreement with that."
"Only if the Council is willing to increase the budget to 200 million ECU will 35 million ECU for BSE be acceptable as a proportion."
"If the Council will not do this my Group, using the criteria of the Committee on Budgets, will again seek to have 100 million ECU set aside for research prior to the 1998 budget."
"The Council must understand once and for all that it is the European Parliament which has the last word on research spending under the budget procedure."
"Mr President, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left supports the recommendation made by Mr Linkohr on supplementary financing for the fourth framework programme."
"However, there are three points we would like to highlight: firstly the cut in the amount of financing, which is a retreat from the commitment the European Union must make to research into the development of a competitive society and the creation of jobs."
"Secondly, we are concerned at the surreptitious introduction of the concept of 'Task Forces' as a vertical philosophy as opposed to the horizontal philosophy of successive framework programmes, and it introduces what I believe is a worrying new aspect into preparations for the fifth framework programme."
"Thirdly, it makes reference to the need to embark upon research into the welfare of the elderly, a problem which will be of crucial importance to Europe's population in the future, and we therefore recommend that the amount earmarked for research into BSE be reduced by a similar amount, as there is no justification for so much funding to be allocated to this area."
"Mr President, a lack of curiosity is an indication that a person is growing old."
"And a society which does not engage in organized research is on the way to decline."
"But obviously, one also has to ask what people are curious about, and what is being researched. It requires no great leap of the imagination to envisage people who are curious about extremely destructive - even self-destructive - things, and unfortunately that is an analogy which applies to our European societies."
"If we look at what the package actually contains, there is aeronautics, fingerprint technologies and industrial engineering with a view to economizing on water use: that accounts for ECU 60 million already, by my calculations."
"BSE research as a whole accounts for ECU 34.5 m, and a closer look reveals that this is intended mainly for animal experiments which are expected to yield results in about ten years' time."
"That is not where the BSE problem lies: the problem is that we need to change our agricultural policy and stop feeding animals on animalbased meal."
"Looking too at the research that is to be undertaken into information and communication technologies, one sometimes gains the impression that it is all about preparing for escape into virtual reality, as opposed to investigating the interface between social processes and technological change, and all the possible options and objectives which this entails."
"In the programme as a whole, ECU 147 m is devoted to research on socio-economic issues, and this in a society which is undergoing radical social and environmental change."
"Something is seriously amiss here."
"Considering the problems that confront us, the priorities are wrong."
"Mr Linkohr has made a few adjustments: in particular, the ECU 33 m for non-nuclear energy is clearly a positive change, but it is not enough to convince us of the value of the concept."
"After all, this is a retreat from the position at first reading, and the situation that we are forever bemoaning - the fact that Europe has lost or deliberately given away its competitive edge - is actually connected with the need to develop a sense of curiosity about the social, technological and scientific problems that we face."
"So far, that is not what we are talking about here."
"We shall abstain."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I address you this evening on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, a task which is all the more pleasurable in that today, for once, we have heard nothing but good of that committee."
"That was a point worth emphasizing, and it is a pity there are not more of us here to hear a tribute which was as unusual as it was well deserved."
"As the rapporteur pointed out, and as other honourable Members have also pointed out, it was indeed the Committee on Budgets which, in the course of the 1997 budgetary procedure, managed to snatch the hundred million with which the Commission is making us a proposal today."
"I should add that this business of the refinancing of the fourth framework programme combines a broken promise with a sorry display of weakness."
"The broken promise was broken by the Council, because, in the course of the negotiations on the fourth framework programme which we conducted with Rolf Linkohr and a few other colleagues, the Council did indeed undertake to provide 700 million of refinancing."
"And now it has not done so, pleading that 'Ecofin doesn't want to revise the financial perspectives' ."
"What a climb-down by this council of research ministers!"
"And what a display of weakness by the Commission which, having come up with an ambitious initial proposal - and all credit to you for it, Commissioner - based on 700 million suddenly caved in completely after what was said at the subsequent Ecofin Council in Florence: ' no 700 million, we'll try to find you something' ."
"In fact, the Commission didn't find anything."
"It was Parliament that found the 100 million, and will find another 100 million in the 1998 procedure."
"That is why I call upon the Commission to support the proposals by Rolf Linkohr and the European Parliament."
"Because we are going to have another 100 million in 1998."
"That makes 200 million."
"So I call upon the Commission, here and now, to support Parliament."
"Mr President, I commend the rapporteur for his report."
"I congratulate him on raising the ante to ECU 200m and for pursuing his own aim on the subject of land mines."
"This will make some of my constituents happy although they fear that most of it will go to consultants and there may not be so very much to show by way of practical results."
"I have to note that the original figure of ECU 700m was cut back by the Council."
"I am not surprised that they applied a tight rein to this figure because, it has to be said, the Commission and Parliament were not able to put forward a clear signal of a coherent set of priorities."
"It seems to me that a fluctuating number of taskforces on a variety of topics rather smacked of people looking around for ways of spending money, instead of coming forward with a carefully reasoned programme of action to complement the fourth framework programme."
"So I commend the rapporteur but I hope, as my colleague, Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl has said, that we can learn from this process when we address the fifth framework programme."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to thank the Members of the Committee on Research, and especially the rapporteur, Mr Linkohr, for all their work."
"As he always does, Mr Linkohr has made a balanced and constructive reply to the Council's common position."
"That reply focuses on the essential thing: the total appropriation for the financial supplement and its allocation."
"It is clear that this will raise problems for the Council, which had difficulty in reaching agreement on the content of the supplement."
"As the rapporteur also points out in his explanatory statement, it took the Council over six months, after the European Parliament's first reading, to achieve the necessary unanimity to adopt a common position."
"That shows, once again, that although co-decision is useful because of the constructive exchanges to which it leads, the Council's unanimity rule is at odds with the desire to make the Union's research policy effective and able to react to events."
"Solving this problem is not the least of the issues facing the Intergovernmental Conference."
"After all, the debate on the supplement has gone on all too long."
"The sums at issue are not such as to upset the balance of the budget."
"Various projects are having to wait, projects whose importance is common knowledge such as TSE and educational multimedia."
"In many respects, then, it seems important to me that we should send a positive political signal to the scientific and industrial world."
"Despite these circumstances, there are prospects that Parliament and the Council will be able to resolve their differences."
"All parties will have to contribute to that."
"The Commission will be unsparing in its efforts to achieve an acceptable compromise."
"And, indeed, the foundations for such a compromise are beginning to become apparent."
"The Council has accepted research into the detection and destruction of antipersonnel mines as a priority subject."
"It has thus adopted an essential amendment from the European Parliament's first reading."
"Mr Linkohr, for his part, does not dispute the importance of intensifying research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, or TSE."
"This is an urgent measure, as Mr Medina Ortega's report on behalf of the Committee of Inquiry emphasized."
"It is encouraging that it has been supported by both Parliament and the Council, both in principle and as regards the total appropriations, based on the analysis submitted by the Commission in its action plan last November."
"It is in the hope of encouraging a compromise between the European Parliament and the Council in the coming weeks that the Commission does not, at this stage, wish to endorse the amendments proposed by Mr Linkohr, although I do have a great deal of sympathy for their tenor."
"In this context, incidentally, the Commission expects to allow, in its provisional draft budget for 1998, a sufficient margin to enable the budgetary authority to go beyond the ECU 100 million already shown in the 1997 budget."
"I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Committee on Budgets and Mr Desama for their invaluable assistance."
"Finally, a word about the timetable."
"The fourth framework programme, for which the financial supplement is intended, will finish next year."
"The fifth framework programme is already in preparation, and the Commission expects to submit its formal proposal next month."
"We therefore need to finalize the financial supplement quickly to make it operational and to prevent any interference with the discussion of the fifth framework programme."
"The European Parliament's speedy conclusion of its second reading has set a good example, and I thank Parliament for it."
"Thank you, Mrs Cresson."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at noon."
"And now, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have some good news for you."
"Today's sitting is now at an end, so, with your permission, I would like to thank all our colleagues and you yourselves for what Mr Chichester has referred to as an even-tempered debate which has nonetheless been significant and which for me personally, I must confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, has been very encouraging."
"Many thanks to you all, therefore, and good night."
"(The sitting was closed at 11.45 p.m.)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the last sitting have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, I refer to page 14."
"I was not the only Member to speak at that particular stage of the day, but I did put a very specific question."
"I should like the reply to be equally specific."
"I asked on what basis the people in the gallery had been given access to it."
"Since then, like everyone else, I have seen television footage which enabled me to confirm that none of those concerned was carrying a visitor's pass."
"Am I going to get a reply?"
"If so, when?"
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, I remember that, it happens that I was present, like most of us, when you made your request."
"I cannot give you an answer at this time."
"The meeting of the Conference of Presidents of the political groups is to take place this afternoon, and I will remind it of your request, so that you can be answered."
"I will be very brief."
"I am not here to talk about workers who have tried to defend their livelihoods."
"I am here to address a question of someone who stole from the workers."
"Yesterday I raised the question of Robert Maxwell's infamous picture in the outside gallery."
"I sought assurances at that time that the President and Quaestors would investigate the matter."
"Can you advise this House why Robert Maxwell's picture still remains outside this Chamber?"
"A known crook still has his picture in the frame outside the Chamber!"
"Mr Falconer, the subject has already been drawn to the Quaestors' attention so that they can take the necessary action."
"Mr President, I have a request in connection with yesterday's disturbance in the gallery."
"I would ask you to have the film taken of the incident examined."
"I have heard that the film shows two things: firstly, that a group of these people sang the 'Internationale' with raised fists - I myself heard singing, but I could not tell exactly what was being sung; and, secondly, that someone gave a speech to the camera calling for a different kind of Europe."
"It should be checked whether this is true or not."
"I hope that it is not true!"
"Mr von Habsburg, I confess that it surprises me to hear that you, with all your knowledge, have not heard of the Internationale!"
"But we all learn new things now and then."
"Mr President, I would just like to support what Mr von Habsburg has said."
"We raised a number of points with the President-in-Office yesterday to ask why, Rule 101(3) having been broken, our guests in the tribune were not escorted out of the Chamber so that we could have continued the vote in peace."
"I would request a reply."
"When do you think that reply might be?"
"Mrs McIntosh, your question will be answered after the meeting of the Conference of Presidents of the political groups this afternoon."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"Yesterday one of our colleagues was named and asked to leave the Chamber."
"That action was not carried through."
"Could the Bureau, which is meeting now and will meet later this week, please now give us the status of Parliament's rules about colleagues being named and asked to leave the Chamber?"
"If colleagues do not leave the Chamber, what status do the rules of this Parliament have any more?"
"Mrs Crawley, I am quite sure that the Bureau, as well as the Conference of Presidents of the political groups, will this afternoon look into the situation that arose yesterday and we will see what conclusions they reach."
"Yes, Mr President, but don't worry, I shall be brief."
"I would simply like to tell Mrs Crawley that the point she raises will be considered in conjunction with Mrs McIntosh's point regarding the non-application of Rule 101(3), since the two points go together."
"Also, I would like to inform the House of another point that has come to my notice."
"Regarding the deplorable - worse than deplorable - events of yesterday, I have learned that one of the European Parliament's buses, registered in Luxembourg, was chartered by a political group to fetch those who were in the gallery yesterday from Entzheim airport."
"In view of this, I should like that information to be verified, and I should like to be informed who authorized the bus passengers to organize a demonstration inside this House."
"Mr Pasty, there will be a meeting this afternoon and I think you will have the opportunity to put other questions as well."
"My point is along the same lines as Mr Pasty's."
"In reply to Mrs Crawley, since the Minutes record that the President demanded that the gallery be cleared, I should also like to know why that instruction was not followed."
"What should be done in such cases?"
"Mr President, I think it is very important that we take the rules and procedures very seriously indeed and it is helpful when Members here who have information can clarify positions."
"But is it really proper that this Assembly should be listening to concerns and seeking and getting information from people like Mr Pasty, who is a well-known cheat and double-voter in this plenary and is again wasting our time on matters of procedure?"
"I would not like us to continue with remarks of that kind, and I ask you to refrain from making personal comments under any circumstances."
"Mr President, the only way to sort out all these problems properly is to set up a committee of inquiry, because yesterday's problem struck deeply at the dignity of Members of Parliament and it is a recurrent problem."
"So I formally ask for a committee of inquiry to be opened to investigate exactly what has happened."
"The Conference of Presidents of the political groups will be meeting this afternoon. I am quite sure the Bureau too will discuss these matters."
"(Parliament approved the Minutes)"
"Agreements with Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan"
"The next item is the joint debate on four recommendations, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy:"
"by Mrs Hoff (A4-0026/97), on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part (COM(96)135-5872/96 - C4-0320/96-96/0092(AVC)), -by Mr La Malfa (A4-0024/97), on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Armenia, of the other part (COM(96)136-5871/96 - C4-0319/96-96/0093(AVC)), -by Mr Lambrias (A4-0025/97), on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Azerbaijan on the other part (COM(96)137-5870/96 - C4-0318/96-96/0094(AVC)), -by Mrs Lalumière (A4-0069/97), on the proposal for a Council and Commission Decision on the conclusion of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Kazakhstan on the other part (7804/95 - C4-0344/95 and C4-0360/95-94/0221(AVC)), and on six reports on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations:"
"by Mr Kittelmann (A4/0081/97), on economic and commercial aspects of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Georgia, of the other part, -by Mr Kittelmann (A4-0038/97), on the proposal for a Council Decision on the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part (COM(96)322-8890/96 - C4-0566/96-96/0180(CNS)), -by Mr Kittelmann (A4-0031/97), on economic and commercial aspects of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Armenia, of the other part, replacing the trade and cooperation agreement with the USSR, on which official contractual relations are currently based, -by Mr Kittelmann (A4-0064/97), on the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion by the European Community of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related measures between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Armenia, of the other part (COM(96)321-8891/96 - C4-0686/96-96/0179(CNS)), -by Mr Schwaiger (A4-0082/97), on economic and commercial aspects of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Azerbaijan, of the other part, and-by Mr Chesa (A4-0099/94), on the economic and trade aspects of the Partnership Agreement between the EU and Kazakhstan."
"Mr President, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Georgia was signed on 22 April 1996, in the presence of the President of Georgia, Mr Shevardnadze."
"In the Union's view, this partnership constitutes a long-term commitment - as it says in the agreement - to bring together the people of the European Union and Georgia in the course of the generation to come."
"Naturally, this should also serve to integrate Georgia into the international economic and political system."
"This agreement includes a section containing economic and commercial provisions, but also a very important political chapter."
"The political section stresses that cooperation between the two partners is to be based on the recognition of common values."
"It is therefore extremely important that respect for democracy and human rights has been laid down as a fundamental condition for cooperation between the two parties."
"In the case of Georgia in particular, it should be acknowledged that since independence, and especially since the political unrest of 1993, important advances have been made in the process of democratic reform."
"In political terms, therefore, Georgia now enjoys civil peace."
"The only black mark continues to be the lack of political solutions to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia crises, which would allow Georgia to regain its territorial integrity and to resolve the refugee problem."
"The European Union and the OSCE must therefore redouble their efforts to bring about a peaceful settlement of these conflicts."
"In economic terms, it should be pointed out that following the collapse of communism in the former Soviet Union, production in Georgia suffered serious setbacks."
"Between 1991 and 1994, its GDP fell to around a third of the 1991 level. During the same period, the country suffered inflation rates of up to 15 000 % per annum."
"With the restoration of peace and the establishment of the democratic political system, however, the process of economic reform began to take hold."
"Hence in 1996, Georgia's GDP grew by some 15 %, and inflation was kept down to around 25 %."
"The new PCA will align Georgia's economy more closely with that of the European Union, and this will be of tremendous importance to the country's future development."
"Naturally, it is to be expected that trade between the EU and Georgia will increase substantially as a result of this agreement, but the Union has also committed itself to making a financial and technical contribution to the process of economic reconstruction and reform, and to the pursuit of sustainable development in Georgia."
"Over and above this, however, investment by European companies in Georgia will continue to increase."
"Also, because of its geographical position, Georgia will be able to act as a bridgehead for trade between the European Union and the other Transcaucasian and Central Asian countries."
"The consolidation of Georgia is therefore essential not only for its own benefit, but also in the regional context, where Georgia is an important stabilizing factor."
"It should be noted that a number of projects for the construction or rehabilitation of oil pipelines, railways and other transport infrastructure have already been drawn up."
"In this context too, the agreement is extremely important."
"Given that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will strengthen Georgia both politically and economically and thereby consolidate its independence, I would recommend to Parliament, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, that it should give its assent to this agreement."
"It can be sure that in doing so, it will add a new, long-term dimension to relations between the European Union and Georgia, a country which is rich in tradition."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Hoff has largely foreshadowed what I wish to say."
"The Committee on External Economic Relations also recommends that Parliament should give its assent to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Interim Agreement with Georgia which are now before the House."
"In discussing countries such as Georgia here - and in due course Armenia and Azerbaijan - we must all try to resist the temptation to treat these countries as a single problem."
"Transcaucasia is a region, and we are of course dealing here with three independent, sovereign states which are extremely sensitive and which must be distinguished from each other in terms of their problems."
"I say this because I frequently see people adopting a judgmental attitude in our parliamentary debates, offering unsolicited advice and suggestions which are not always helpful."
"If we are to assess the situation in Georgia properly, we must bear in mind - as Mrs Hoff also said - that it is not always easy for the people of Georgia to comprehend the transition from a communist system to a democratic society, since the former Soviet Union provided Georgia with massive economic support because of its geographical position."
"By comparison with other regions, the situation in Georgia was relatively good, so that the collapse of communism and the quest for new structures and the new democratic possibilities opened up by a market economy was accompanied by some particularly serious problems."
"Of course, Georgia's relationship with Russia is still an important factor, above all for psychological reasons."
"Even today, the 'big brother' of the past sometimes cannot resist meddling in areas that are none of its business."
"If we wish to understand the situation in Georgia, we must also take account of the Abkhazian minority, which held an unduly prominent position in the 1970s, compared with the Georgian majority."
"One of the areas in which the European Union is able to provide fundamental help is the development of democratic institutions throughout Georgia. And it is already doing so."
"In the process, it must of course keep sight of the close link between cooperation and respect for human rights."
"The work carried out by the UN, the OSCE and the European Union has already had a stabilizing effect and will contribute to the emergence of sound conditions in Georgia in the long term - sound conditions in the sense that the attitude of individual citizens to achievement and personal success will help to consolidate the country's democratic structures."
"We must always remind ourselves of the fact that providing these countries with effective economic aid is essential to make their democratic structures viable."
"What we are now witnessing in Albania and elsewhere is the result of economic failure."
"People and political parties that are still inexperienced in terms of democracy are dependent on economic success."
"The importance of this Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Interim Agreement lies in the fact that we are helping Georgia in good time!"
"It is especially important for us to bear in mind that Georgia is currently making great efforts to obtain both financial and security-related support from Russia, France and Germany, as well as from the World Bank; that a sound legal environment for the privatization of state-run undertakings has been created; that the privatization of the agricultural sector is making rapid progress; and that by the end of 1996, some 90 % of the privatization of small businesses had been completed."
"All this has meant that many of the problems in Georgia have been eased, and it is now up to us to give political support."
"If we can do so, I am sure that our political will in respect of this country will bear fruit, because we need to help the people there to help themselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the transition from the communist political systems to democratic political institutions and market economies is presenting enormous and evident difficulties."
"These difficulties have been significant in every country from the Soviet sphere."
"Some of the central European countries - Poland, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak Republics, etc. which had a national political tradition and relatively developed market economies, in a sense, have nevertheless experienced great difficulties. But for them the process of liberation from the Soviet system has been a kind of return to the national identity."
"This has not been the case for the countries which actually belonged to the Soviet Union, for example Transcaucasus, which we are discussing this morning."
"Many of these countries have reached independence without having had a history as a nation, or a specific and recent history as a nation. Countries like Georgia and Armenia have a very ancient cultural tradition, but have not rediscovered their identity since 1989."
"We have to understand the enormous difficulties these countries face as they set about constructing a market economy and a state for the first time."
"Mrs Hoff and Mr Kittelmann have mentioned, in connection with Georgia, that Europe has a strategic interest, both from the geo-political point of view and from the economic point of view, in stabilizing and assisting the development of those countries."
"So it is right to sign cooperation and partnership agreements, and I refer here to the excellent report by Mrs Carrère d'Encausse on all the countries in this area which provides our Parliament with a framework for their problems."
"Of these three countries, Armenia perhaps has the greatest problems because of its lack of natural resources, unlike Azerbaijan which has oil resources, and because of its geographic location, locked in an enclave with no outlet to the sea. To make matters worse its relations with Turkey have been extremely difficult for centuries and were made more acute at the beginning of this century - as Members know, Turkey still blocks trade and relations with Armenia even today, and we hope this block will be lifted."
"In this whole framework our cooperation agreement is very important. Armenia's leaders are not the same as in Soviet days."
"Of course there have been positive developments and there have been problems."
"When Parliament monitored the 1995 elections, we observed certain violations, like the exclusion of one important party from the political battle. Unfortunately we were forced to recognize similar and possibly more serious problems in the 1996 presidential elections which were accompanied by numerous reservations from the observers and by numerous protests from the opposition forces."
"I hope Parliament will give its assent today to these important agreements which relate not only to economics, but above all to political dialogue through which Europe and Parliament can carefully monitor the development of political rights, civil rights, freedom of information, and so on, to establish an ongoing relationship which can promote the evolution of increasingly solid democratic institutions, increasingly rooted in the conscience of those countries."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I therefore hope our Parliament will give assent today to the cooperation and partnership agreement with the Republic of Armenia."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on External Economic Relations is also asking Parliament to give its assent to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Interim Agreement with Armenia."
"In recent years, the political background to Armenia's economic situation has unfortunately deteriorated badly."
"The break-up of the Soviet Union, in which the Armenian economy held a privileged position - receiving a disproportionate amount of support in comparison with the other Soviet republics, for political and geographical reasons - and which provided Armenia with both its supplies of raw materials and its clientele, had a drastic impact."
"The war with Azerbaijan and the resulting destruction led to shortages and extreme isolation."
"Since the decision was taken to switch to a market economy and to introduce private enterprise, however, the situation of the Armenian people has steadily improved."
"It is important to note that as a result of these combined factors - these upheavals - Armenian society is in a relatively unstable situation, in which the country's democratic structures are still fragile and there are sometimes revolts against certain changes and innovations, with consequent mistrust on the part of potential investors."
"Basically, we must remind ourselves that Armenia's democratic structures are still developing, and that, partly because of the poor economic situation, it is hard for the democratic parties to formulate common goals - something we are able to do in our democracies as a result of tens or hundreds of years of practice."
"We must be fair in our assessment of Armenia."
"This country needs our help."
"However, we also need to focus on Armenia's particular situation."
"Here too, excessive lecturing is unhelpful."
"On the contrary, we must try to encourage Armenia's development, showing tolerance and solidarity."
"Obviously, the energy crisis has also contributed to Armenia's extremely difficult economic situation."
"The economic blockade and the existence of a decrepit and poorly motivated bureaucracy - the usual communist inefficiency of the past, one might say - are also seriously hampering development."
"The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is still on the agenda."
"It has sapped Armenia's strength and is still having a detrimental effect on the country's development and political stability."
"It is to be hoped that the current ceasefire will eventually lead to a settlement of the conflict, although this is not yet in sight. Of course, this is also causing serious problems for the country's economic situation."
"If the positive economic trend which is now emerging stays on course; if the move towards democracy, which is becoming more stable, can continue; if we can turn our promises of help into practical assistance; if the international aid organizations can boost the increased self-confidence of this small country of Armenia through their presence on the ground; if, in the course of dealing with the multitude of other problems which the European Union is required to solve, we can remember that this is a country which is particularly dependent on our help, then we shall make an important contribution."
"We must fulfil our commitments and give our assent to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which has important financial implications for the Union, but which in terms of Armenia's problems is no more than a drop in the ocean."
"In conclusion, I would urge the House to make use of this Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to encourage the country's political leadership and democratic forces not to abandon the path of democracy, despite the problems which are facing them."
"That is the most important contribution that we can make to Armenia's development."
"Mr President, in recommending the expression of a favourable opinion on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Azerbaijan, I hasten to make it clear that I far from agree with the principles of the policy of unhesitating self-interest usually known as 'Realpolitik' ."
"On the contrary, I continue to believe that the pursuit even of manifest mutual economic interests should be discontinued when it disregards flagrantly inhuman situations and contributes to the perpetuation of illiberal regimes."
"Azerbaijan certainly has many problems for a variety of reasons."
"In no way can it be considered to respond to the standards of our own values and principles."
"The open wound of Nagorny-Karabach in Azerbaijan, the situation of the refugees, and the economic situation in one of the potentially richer countries owing to its oil production, disappointed our ad hoc delegation when it went there and found that democratic processes in that country are quite deficient."
"Yet, the Committee on Foreign Affairs supports the agreement on partnership relations, based on the reasonable hope that despite the continuing weaknesses, despite the unsolved problem of Nagorny-Karabach - though there is an international effort to solve it, the Minsk Group, even if no ultimate solution has yet been achieved -, and since, fortunately, Azerbaijan has ceased its policy of violent repression, we can make progress."
"Our incentive is the conviction that even if Azerbaijan is in a more difficult situation than the other two Trans-Caucasian countries, Georgia and Armenia, we ourselves, as Mrs Carrère d'Encausse very rightly said, ought to take an overall view of the problem and be consistent in the policy we ought to apply towards those three countries in a strategically and economically important area at the periphery of Europe."
"That is exactly the aim of the agreement signed a year ago in Luxembourg, and it is high time to implement that agreement if we really aspire to many-sided improvements in Azerbaijan and cooperation between the three troubled Trans-Caucasian countries."
"For that reason, the Committee on Foreign Affairs unanimously declares its favourable opinion to the Commission and the Council, and recommends the same to the Member States, because the Union's Member States also have to ratify this agreement."
"However, we remain and must remain constantly vigilant concerning developments in this strategically so interesting area of the Trans-Caucasus, until the gradual and progressive normalization of relations and until true democracy prevails in that country."
"With this in mind, the Committee on Foreign Affairs expresses its favourable opinion."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Azerbaijan is a potentially wealthy country."
"The oil reserves in the Caspian Sea are greater than those of Saudi Arabia, and the country's industrial, agricultural and services sectors offer good opportunities for development."
"However, the consequences of the war, the environmental damage caused by irresponsible oil extraction in the Soviet Union in past decades, and the unresolved problem of a million refugees from the war are all placing a heavy burden on Azerbaijan."
"Azerbaijan is almost on the doorstep of the European Union's proposed enlargement to the east, and in a few years' time may well only be separated from the EU by the Black Sea and the Caucasus."
"European investment is extremely welcome in Azerbaijan, and is particularly sought after by the oil industry, the transport sector and the burgeoning construction industry."
"Azerbaijan is now increasingly taking steps to create a favourable environment for such investment."
"A crucial precondition for overcoming the economic crisis, however, is the planning and extension of transport links via Georgia to the European Union, as well as infrastructure networks for oil and oil products."
"All the options in this respect must be viewed in terms of their economic efficiency and environmental impact."
"As we have already heard in some detail, the starting-point for the EU's partnership and cooperation agreements with the three Transcaucasian republics - Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia - is the need for regional cooperation and development."
"In short, their purpose is to frame a comprehensive regional approach which, from the European Union's point of view, combines the economic and financial aspects, includes the substantial humanitarian aid that is being provided, and does not neglect the opportunities for political dialogue now available to us."
"It is above all through increased cooperation between Azerbaijan and Georgia - and also Armenia, if it so wishes - that the vast oil resources of the Caspian Sea can be exploited for exporting to the European Union and the rest of the world, as well as for local processing."
"Only then will the door to economic relations with Europe genuinely be open."
"At the same time, however, regional economic cooperation can help to reduce the political tensions in the area."
"It is therefore only by making efforts to link up with the trans-European networks and other transport, energy and communications infrastructure that cooperation with Europe can be made possible."
"In political terms, the point is to help stabilize these three states, which are now of course, as former members of the Soviet Union, in the process of fundamentally reorganizing their societies, economies and political decision-making structures."
"As a peaceful partner and working together with Russia and Turkey - not against them - the European Union can achieve something."
"The Black Sea and the Bosporus are the main lines of communication here."
"Europe is too far away to be able to play the leading political role in the region."
"And, naturally, it has no wish to do so."
"However, it is in great demand as an honest broker to bring about economic progress and peaceful cooperation."
"With France now holding the presidency of the Minsk Group of the OSCE, Europe has an excellent opportunity to work towards the rapid establishment of peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan in and around Nagorno-Karabakh."
"It is of paramount importance in this context to remove the legacy of the war."
"The blockade on Armenia must be lifted - as has already been said - the occupying forces must be withdrawn, and the autonomy and right to selfdetermination of the majority population in the disputed enclave must be guaranteed."
"The refugees must be enabled to return home or, if this is not possible, they must be settled in new areas."
"New housing, jobs and social services for a total of 1.3 million people in Azerbaijan, Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh must be created."
"In the process, the European Union must pay particular attention to the need to build homes for multi-ethnic families."
"In the framework of the Fizuli pilot programme, the towns and villages around Fizuli, which have been completely destroyed, must be rebuilt with European Union aid, as a matter of priority."
"A new infrastructure axis based on the extension of transport links and energy and communications networks must be developed."
"The Union's support should be earmarked in particular for the Traceca programme, which addresses all these needs together."
"Mr President, the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy supports this agreement with Armenia for a number of reasons."
"Firstly, Armenia is the country which has suffered most from the break-up of the Soviet Union."
"Secondly, it has still not recovered from the great earthquake of 1988. And, thirdly, it has suffered enormously from the prolonged conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh."
"However, we fail to understand why the agreement makes no attempt to find a solution to the problem of the Medzamor nuclear power plant, which according to the US Department of Energy Intelligence is one of the most dangerous reactors in the world."
"Everyone knows that."
"The Commission itself says in the annex to the agreement that the EU cannot accept the decision to reopen this plant."
"Nobody disputes the fact that Armenia has to obtain its power from somewhere. We all know that."
"But the simple reason why there is currently no solution to this problem is that Armenia's neighbours are systematically blocking its gas supply. The Union must therefore take steps to ensure that Armenia's gas supply is restored, but it cannot simply turn a blind eye, as it were, to the Medzamor nuclear plant being recommissioned."
"That is unacceptable, since it is widely recognized that Medzamor represents a greater danger to us all than Chernobyl."
"We have a twofold task, therefore: ensuring that Armenia's gas supply is restored, and that Medzamor is shut down."
"That is what our committee wishes to see."
"Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz, I deliberately allowed you to overrun your time quite considerably."
"Of course, in this Chamber I have often maintained that a speaking time of one minute is not enough to allow a proper expression of views by any Member, and that is the only point on which I, personally, am prepared to deviate from the effort I otherwise make to stick strictly to the limits."
"Mr President, I have provided the opinion for the Committee on Budgets on the agreement with Azerbaijan."
"The subject of my opinion was the effects on the European budget of this agreement."
"It appears, at first sight, that the effects would be fairly minimal."
"These effects would come through loss of revenue, through the increased imports from that region or if they affected our food supplies through agricultural exports or the cost of export refunds."
"While the Commission has not given us information related to the budgetary costs, it seems that these will be very small."
"We have to consider that Azerbaijan has 7.5 million people."
"Their economy had been deteriorating for four or five years up until last year, GDP was dropping by 15 % to 20 % annually and stands today at around $400-500 per capita."
"Quite obviously a country in that economic situation is not going to be in a position to do very much trade."
"Apparently more than half of their exports are to the former Soviet Union and Iran, and about 20 % imports and exports to the European Union."
"Their total imports are about $1.5b and exports something less than that."
"Obviously this country is in a very weak trading position and is going to have very little effect on the finances apart from the direct transfers provided for in the TACIS Programme, which is a different subject from the one that I am dealing with."
"The Budget Committee very much welcomes this agreement and hopes that it will serve to improve the political and economic situation; that it will develop to a point where it will contribute much to the economic and political welfare of Azerbaijan."
"We also hope it will be fruitful from our point of view."
"Exceptionally, I will also allow Mr Chesa to speak."
"Today we began quite a bit earlier and I am afraid some Members were not aware of that."
"However, I would ask the speakers at least not to be late, because I am not disposed to let them speak whenever they turn up in the House."
"Mr President, we are concerned this morning with the fourth Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the Transcaucasian States."
"The nature of such agreements has undergone a radical change, since they are now concerned with partnership and co-operation rather than with mere trade relations."
"The present partnership agreement with Kazakhstan, concluded for an initial period of ten years, provides for the institution of a political dialogue and cultural cooperation, together with important agreements relating to the economic and trade sectors."
"With regard to trade, the parties mutually agree on most-favoured-nation treatment in all matters connected with customs duties, provisions relating to customs clearance, transit, warehouses and transhipment, and methods of payment and payment transfers."
"The rules governing the sale, purchase, transport, distribution and use of goods on domestic markets naturally take account of the limits imposed by GATT to aid developing countries and the new situation as regards relations between the Kazakh Republic and neighbouring States."
"With regard to economic co-operation, the agreement relates to the following sectors: economic and social development, human resources development, support for enterprises (including privatization, investment and development of financial services), agriculture and food, energy and civil nuclear safety, transport, tourism, environmental protection and regional co-operation."
"Thus, Kazakhstan and the European Union are undertaking to work closely together on the basis of common values, with the Union thus providing support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of these new independent States, with a view to helping safeguard peace and stability in Europe."
"Mr President, before the Commissioner leaves, I should like to ask a question as Chairman of the European Parliament's Delegation on relations with the three Caucasian Republics."
"What the Commissioner told us is very significant and important, and we all agree with it."
"My question is this: since that area is so important for the European Union, why is there a Commission delegation only in Georgia?"
"Why is the European Union, in the form of official delegations, absent from Azerbaijan and Armenia, when countries such as my own, Greece, has embassies there?"
"I listened to the question very carefully, and I can only say that I entirely agree with Mr Alavanos that the reasons preventing us from having representations in all the new independent republics of the former Soviet Union are entirely financial and logistical."
"I am very pleased that we have been able to open a delegation in Tbilisi in Georgia, and we would like to do the same in other countries which we regard as important, as we have explained in talks with the Committee on Budgets."
"There are currently no plans, I think, to expand the number of delegations."
"I hope there will be further possibilities next year, but then there will also be competition from other former Soviet republics."
"We already have an office in Alma-Ata in Kazakhstan, but not in Uzbekistan, for example, which has specifically asked to have one."
"We are doing our best."
"Mr President, I just have one question, because this is something that was decided on by the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy."
"Do you not think, Commissioner, that every penny we invest in the Medzamor nuclear power plant through the TACIS programme is a penny wasted, because it simply cannot be made safer?"
"It was brought back into operation because Armenia's gas supply was cut off by its neighbours."
"Would it not be better for us to concentrate our efforts on ensuring that the country's gas supply is restored?"
"Then the Medzamor plant - which is situated in an earthquake zone, moreover - could be shut down again."
"Would it not be better to devote our time and money to that, rather than to patching up something which cannot be patched up?"
"Is there a timetable for the decommissioning of this nuclear plant, Commissioner?"
"To start with the last question, according to the timetable which the Armenian Government is following, the plant is due to close in 2007."
"We think this is too late and have urged them to consider an earlier date, and my answer to Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz is that we must try everything we can."
"If the plant cannot be closed as quickly as we would like, then we can always try to ensure further improvements in its nuclear safety."
"But I know that the basic problem with this reactor is that it is situated in a fault area where earthquakes and the like can occur, and this is something which it is difficult for the TACIS programme to deal with."
"So as I said, we shall do everything we can to limit the risk, including trying to bring the closure date forward and giving consideration to alternative energy programmes."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, speaking in my capacity as vice-chairman of the Transcaucasian delegation, I should like to offer my sincere thanks and congratulations to all the rapporteurs for their reports."
"They further highlight the great importance of these PCAs for the efforts of the countries concerned to develop and consolidate their economies and new democratic structures."
"However, in Transcaucasia as elsewhere, democracy must mean that everything possible is done to safeguard social peace."
"This means that every citizen must have a roof over his head, enough to eat and a job."
"Above all, he must be able to express his opinions freely."
"And this leads me to the issue that I wish to draw to everyone's attention once again today: respect for the right of freedom of expression and for human rights."
"In Georgia, there is hardly any problem in this context."
"It is indeed a pleasure to talk with our young colleagues in the Georgian Parliament about their work, about the situation in Georgia and our relations with each other."
"We are all constantly amazed at the rapid progress Georgia has made in the development and consolidation of its democratic structures."
"There are problems in other areas, though, and especially in the two other Transcaucasian states."
"In Azerbaijan, although oil production is promising a rapid economic upturn, very few people are able to participate in democracy."
"Clan thinking and the resultant clan rule are conditioning the development of both democracy and the economy."
"The country is governed autocratically, and the government parties and President Aliyev not only determine the broad lines of policy in a dictatorial way, but also decide as they see fit on the scope which the already weak opposition parties have for taking action."
"The European Parliament cannot simply leave the monitoring of respect for human rights to the Helsinki committees and Amnesty International."
"Their work is invaluable, but we too have a responsibility in this context."
"The Armenian Government is exploiting the conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh to justify the suppression of the opposition."
"For this purpose, President Ter-Petrossian is invoking former Soviet laws under which he himself was imprisoned during the Gorbachev era."
"Now he is using those same laws to ban a large number of opposition parties."
"We are thus repeatedly seeing trials in Armenia which can be described without hesitation as political."
"This also applies to some extent to the so-called 'Dro Trial' , where a group was found guilty of committing acts of terrorism, and sentenced accordingly."
"Quite wrongly, however, an attempt was previously made to link this group to our socialist sister party, Dashnaksutyun."
"It was even claimed that the 'Dro Group' had acted on the orders of Dashnaksutyun."
"Thankfully, that accusation was rejected as false and unsustainable by Armenia's Supreme Court, and Dashnaksutyun has now been fully rehabilitated."
"However, I would question the degree of reinstatement of Dashnaksutyun and of the associations and organizations affiliated to it."
"There is another trial, however, which has not yet been concluded, the so-called '31 Trial' ."
"This involves 31 wellknown opposition politicians, all of whom took part in a large demonstration to protest against vote rigging in the presidential elections in Armenia in September last year."
"Although the organizers of the demonstration have now been freed, thanks to international pressure, the trial against these 31 politicians is continuing."
"According to reports by Amnesty International, they are still being held in prison under inhumane conditions."
"Armenia's political, economic and military dependence on Russia is also a cause for concern."
"Russia supplies Armenia with many essential goods, and maintains army and air force bases in the country, including on the border with Turkey."
"Of course, I sympathize with the fact that Armenia is doing everything it can to improve its economic situation."
"It was not without reason that, in its resolution of 17 January 1997, the European Parliament called on Turkey and Azerbaijan to relax their economic blockade on Armenia."
"Nevertheless, I wish to stress once again that economic hardship cannot serve as a pretext for undemocratic behaviour."
"In adopting the Carrère d'Encausse report in January, we made our position on the Transcaucasian republics quite clear."
"We wish the economic development of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to take place within the framework of a social market economy and with respect for the environment and human rights."
"That is what I wished to emphasize again today."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, the early years of the newly independent Transcaucasian republics were marked by wars, the persistence of the communist old guard and control by the Kremlin."
"Only now are Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan gradually managing to find their feet economically and politically."
"However, lasting development will only be possible when the ethnic conflicts that are essentially a legacy of the Soviet era are resolved."
"At least there is no longer fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan - the guns have fallen silent."
"It is undoubtedly the case that Moscow originally stirred up this conflict so that it could appear later as a peacemaker and gain influence in the region."
"The plan worked: today, Russia is again the leading power in Transcaucasia, Turkey has had to swiftly abandon its ambitions in the area, and Armenia is in any case more dependent on Russian support than its fellow Transcaucasian republics."
"As we know, normal relations between Armenia and Turkey do not exist."
"Turkey is supporting the linguistically and ethnically related Azeris in the war over Nagorno-Karabakh, and has closed its border crossings with Armenia."
"And for the time being, they remain closed."
"The conflict over this enclave is undoubtedly Armenia's most serious domestic, international and financial problem."
"In terms of regional politics, it is part of the international poker game for the oil resources in the Caspian Sea."
"On the plus side, however, one should mention that Armenia has an ethnically very homogeneous population of 3.7 million inhabitants, who can work together to develop the country."
"In any event, Armenia is more ethnically homogeneous than any of its neighbours in the region."
"Although it is geographically part of the Near East, the people of Armenia - and of Georgia, incidentally - feel themselves to be European at heart."
"The region's religious connection with the East is also alien to the Armenians: Christianity is the dominant religion in the country, in the form of either the Armenian or the Orthodox Church."
"Like Belarus, Armenia used to play a special, technically-oriented role in the former Soviet Union. This applies to the chemical and textile-processing industries in particular, and that is undoubtedly also a point which must be taken into account in our cooperation with this country."
"The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Armenia will serve to underpin the existing close cooperation with the European institutions."
"One objective of the agreement is the progressive integration of Armenia into the open international system."
"This applies to both the political and the economic sectors."
"Through this agreement, the European Union will help Armenia to consolidate its sovereignty, thereby contributing to the stability of the region."
"Mr President, I would like to say that the three Caucasian Republics are the gateway between Asia and Europe, where ancient civilizations come together. They are now the point of contact and the dividing line between Christianity and Islam."
"They are countries with a burdensome past, which are undergoing intense regional conflicts."
"From that standpoint, as all the speakers and Commissioner Van den Broek have rightly said, what they need is a steady, consistent and dynamic political approach on the part of the European Union."
"Here, we must be careful, especially we in the European Parliament."
"I would like to congratulate all the rapporteurs. However, we should take note that this multiplicity of reports, this competition between the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on External Economic Relations has resulted in the fact that Parliament itself is required to take a series of mutually contradictory decisions, with the result that our intervention and presence is not convincing, not consistent and steady, and that some of us here appear in the eyes of third parties to be friends of Azerbaijan and enemies of Armenia, some as friends of Russia and enemies of Georgia, and vice-versa."
"That is a weakness which we are repeating today, and I think we ought to be very careful about it."
"Along with the weakness I have mentioned, we should note the absence, for budgetary reasons, of European offices from that region, which has enormous potential but is also a simmering volcano."
"In my opinion, it is wrong that all the multinational companies have offices in Azerbaijan, and countries that can do little, like Greece, have embassies in Azerbaijan and Armenia, while the European Union is absent when it wants to intervene in a meaningful way."
"The Commissioner told us - and this is very important - that the European Union is the main provider of financial aid in that area."
"I, however, cannot help thinking about Albania."
"We must not forget that Albania was the country that received a great deal of finance, and look at its situation now."
"Consequently, I think that besides financial aid there must be intervention on behalf of democracy and especially some intervention to solve the regional conflicts, particularly today when the Minsk initiative seems to have become dormant."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, you have primarily been talking in terms of the importance of the Transcaucasian region for Europe."
"That precisely describes the character of the PCAs, which are theoretically based on partnership, but clearly tend to favour the Member States of the Union and their interests in the region."
"Questions such as the progress of democratic development, the civil rights situation, the development of a free and democratic system of justice, the ability to cope with the flood of refugees in the region, and the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan are becoming increasingly incidental."
"But an equal partnership means one in which the whole population is able to participate."
"The European Union must above all contribute to the stability and development of the region, and not simply display its interest in exploiting the region's oil reserves and establishing a secure corridor for the pipelines."
"The region urgently needs peace, so that investment can take place and infrastructure can be built and interconnected."
"This means firstly that the OSCE agreement must contribute to the reduction of the region's military capacity, since only then will a comprehensive strategy bring results."
"The PCAs will be an important building block in this process, as long as they are implemented in a balanced way, for mutual benefit and in real partnership, and are actually geared to the region's needs."
"The prospects for this are very varied."
"In Georgia, we are seeing the first signs that the political situation is stabilizing."
"The country's second government is taking care not to reignite the conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although there is still no institutional solution."
"The situation between the warring parties of Armenia and Azerbaijan is quite different."
"There is a front line in that conflict which crosses Azerbaijan."
"It is heavily populated by troops on both sides, and a part of Azerbaijani territory is occupied by Armenian troops from Karabakh."
"The border is the front line, not the internationally recognized frontier, and it would take a single spark to cause the fighting to flare up again."
"The OSCE's demand for the stepping-up of the process of achieving a peaceful settlement in accordance with its principles, including the key requirement of the creation of an autonomous region enjoying the maximum degree of self-government within Azerbaijan's internationally recognized borders, was not accepted by Armenia."
"However, the Irish presidency endorsed the OSCE's statement and all its demands."
"Since then, the sensitive talks on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh have ground to a halt."
"This means that around a million refugees who have already been living in tents, mud huts and goods trucks for five years will have to continue to endure this situation indefinitely."
"The UN's demand for repatriation of all refugees is not feasible for the foreseeable future."
"If Europe is assuming that safe third countries will be found for these refugees in the present situation, it is simply deluding itself."
"The UNHCR has confirmed to me that neither the political nor the legal position is conducive to finding safe third countries, especially for Armenian and Azerbaijani refugees."
"A peace agreement is a precondition for economic cooperation."
"Otherwise, it is simply not on - or do we intend to invest in Nagorno-Karabakh through the Latschin corridor?"
"In my view, therefore, we must link the ratification of the PCAs to the conclusion of a peace agreement. That must undoubtedly be a precondition, and only then will we be able to give our support to a coherent and responsible foreign policy action."
"It is an illusion to believe that economic action is possible in the current situation!"
"Mr President, the partnership agreements we are studying this morning send a clear, consistent and positive political signal to the infant Caucasian republics."
"They serve the security interests of the European Union States in both the short and the long term."
"The Caucasus is not at the ends of the earth - it is on our doorsteps, and what happens there has a direct impact on our security."
"That is why our group is glad to see that these agreements take due account of questions of environmental and nuclear safety and the efforts to combat organized crime and drugs trafficking."
"In the longer term, our objective must be to help achieve lasting stabilization of the situation in that region."
"We must not exaggerate the importance of these partnership agreements, but they can help to achieve this, first and foremost by endorsing the sovereignty and independence of each of these young republics which have just recovered those benefits after the collapse of the soviet system and are particularly attached to them."
"While encouraging the difficult process of co-operation in the region, we must nevertheless respect the specific characteristics and identity of each State."
"The differences are important: two of these States have a Christian tradition and a European culture; some have got rid of their former communist masters while others have kept them on in re-incarnated forms, following elections that have sometimes been suspect."
"Overall, though, the agreements can help to encourage the establishment of democratic practices and the development of the market economy in societies which are tackling the considerable problems of transition, as Hélène Carrère d'Encausse recalled just now."
"These countries justify the institution by us of certain forms of aid, provided, Mr President, that they are really effective and do not have the paradoxical purpose of compensating for the disastrous effects of blockade policies against some of these States pursued by some of our partners in the region."
"Mr President, I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent reports, which cover interim agreements and partnership and cooperation agreements with the three Transcaucasian states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan."
"This House has already adopted Mrs Carrère d'Encausse's report on Transcaucasia, which provided the background for the PCAs with three out of the four countries we are dealing with today."
"I would like to thank her warmly for her earlier contribution on this subject."
"We are dealing with two separate regions of the world in this debate - trans-Caucasia and Central Asia."
"Both regions are very different, although they share certain characteristics: both formed part of the former Soviet Union and inherited a dislocated command economy and a political system subject to Moscow."
"Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and, to a lesser extent, Georgia and Armenia are heavily influenced by the presence of the Caspian Sea and, particularly, the exploitation and transportation of oil."
"All four countries are seeking to assert their independence from Moscow while cooperating in varying degrees with the Commonwealth of Independent States."
"To a certain extent the interim agreements and accompanying PCAs are intended to encourage the independence of these countries and assist with the transition to market economies and democratic development."
"It is important for the EU to build up relations with such countries which lie in an important geopolitical region."
"Kazakhstan lies between Russia and China and near to Iran and politically unstable Afghanistan."
"Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan sit between the Caspian and Black Seas, with both Iran, Turkey and Russia as near neighbours."
"The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorny Karabakh and the fighting over Abkhazia in Georgia make this a volatile region."
"Economic and democratic development in three of the four countries has been weak."
"As Mrs Hoff's report shows, only Georgia, with former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze at the helm, has managed to hold free and fair elections and resist a lurch to authoritarian methods."
"We have seen rigged elections in Armenia and Azerbaijan, while in Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev has flouted the country's constitution and cowed the opposition."
"These countries need to improve their democratic and human rights record."
"I agree with the points Mrs Lalumière has made on the current unsuitability of the nature of the partnership and cooperation agreements to be signed by these countries."
"It is misleading to give the impression that the EU and the European Parliament endorse the level of democracy and human rights in Kazakhstan, Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"So, in adopting all these reports, I hope the House will continue to monitor closely the situation in the countries concerned."
"By developing closer relations with these four countries, the European Union must work to develop prosperity, peace and democracy."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, now that the leaden casing of the USSR has melted away, we can make one observation and one request."
"The observation is that in Transcaucasia, as in many other places, the problems with nationalities, borders, minorities and ethnic and religious differences that existed in the past have survived almost intact."
"Sometimes their effect is supplemented by the legacy of fragmentation practised by the USSR, as in Nagorny Karabakh, for example."
"The request is that we should approach this situation in a totally new spirit, aimed at finding lasting solutions."
"That is the context of the joint agreement on Armenia which we are being asked to approve today."
"To give that country the opportunity to strengthen its independence, to deepen its democracy, to open up more to international relations, to orient itself towards a market economy, to diversify its trade flows which are too exclusively geared to the former USSR, to achieve the lifting of the blockade and then develop a sound, trusting policy of regional cooperation with its neighbours - those are the objectives of this agreement, and I approve of them."
"I hope that Europe will use its influence to ensure that these things do happen, and to ensure in particular that Armenia has the right of freedom of trade, one of the foundations of the rights of nations, which will enable it in particular to close down a dangerous nuclear power station and will also be an essential condition for lasting peace in that region."
"Mr President, I have a series of two or three observations."
"We are debating about three or four republics in the Trans-Caucasian area, about the same number or more in Central Asia, for all of which we have allowed a very brief joint debate."
"My comment is that the debate is superficially organised, it assumes that we are dealing with soulless issues that can all be dealt with in the same way, whereas in fact these are countries, peoples with ancient and modern civilizations and cultural, religious, economic and social traditions."
"They cannot all fit into a single mould and be dealt with in one debate."
"This poor organisation of the debate encourages me to make a second comment."
"Despite the good intentions of the rapporteurs, all the reports and recommendations we have heard have a common characteristic."
"And what is that?"
"They betray a patronage, a didactic spirit, and an attitude like a rich uncle who holds the purse strings and dictates what people are to do if they want to see any of it."
"And I will go on to say that we have learnt nothing, at least from the example of Albania which is much smaller in size and in every other way, and where such machinations led to the present situation, which has literally exposed and ridiculed the entire policy of the Community and American influences in their treatment of these new republics, as you call them."
"My third observation, Mr President, because I do not wish to be negative, is that we must be careful, we need a proper approach, and we must view those countries, those peoples on an equal basis. We must respect their dignity and history if we wish to establish relations of cooperation and productive agreements with them."
"Otherwise, it will seem that beyond our own intentions or those of the rapporteurs, there is an underlying Community policy which aims to plunder those countries and establish neo-colonial commitments and relations. And the price for that will be paid both by those peoples and by the peoples of Europe."
"Mr President, allow me to make a brief contribution in my capacity as president of the Delegation for Central Asia and Mongolia, to demonstrate our support for the cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan being discussed today."
"It is our sincere belief that this agreement will assist this young republic in consolidating its new-found democracy, in developing its economy and in completing the process of transition to a market economy."
"As has been stated, we are aware that Kazakhstan's record regarding the protection of freedom, respect for human rights and consolidation of the democratic process is unsatisfactory, but it is also a fact that some positive progress has been made, allowing us to hope that that country has now started on its way down the right road, leading to implementation of the agreement."
"To delay doing this might be counterproductive and may risk a return to the previous state of affairs."
"This republic is of great value to the European Union in strategic terms and its stability is of utmost interest to the Community."
"Do not forget that we are dealing with the world's third-ranking nuclear power, a country which has significant mineral, energy and textile resources - including space installations - , one which is on the dividing line between Islam and Christianity and which is home to a significant Turkish-speaking minority, and also Russianspeaking and Polish-speaking minorities."
"We are in fact dealing with an area which is not so very far away since, ultimately, Turkey and Eastern Europe are the closest and most natural routes towards the European Union."
"To sum up, Mr President, the agreement creates optimum conditions for mutual development of economic and cultural relations."
"The only matter outstanding is for us to cast our votes, so that Kazakhstan's political situation can allow this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this debate on the PCAs with these four countries, on which we have to decide, is one of crucial importance."
"That applies both economically and politically, because this will be an extremely important region in the future."
"It contains major reserves of natural resources, especially oil, which are probably far greater than is currently estimated."
"Someone gaining the friendship of this region will always be better off than someone losing it."
"Secondly, of course, the question of Islam is a particular issue as regards two of these countries."
"There are two Christian and two Islamic states in the region."
"The two Islamic states are mainly inhabited by Turkish peoples who have close links with the Turks."
"I therefore have to say quite clearly, once again, that our policy towards Turkey is breathtakingly short-sighted."
"We need this country; we need it vitally, because it represents the alternative to certain other powers in the region which are extremely dangerous."
"The Turks are clearly well aware of this."
"I have been to Turkey several times recently, and I know just how many people from these two Islamic states are currently living in that country, where they are receiving training."
"I would almost go so far as to say that there are two countries which give us a good example of how to provide development aid: Turkey and China."
"Turkey, because it delivers its development aid primarily to the people - in other words, it is finally restoring to the peoples of these countries the structures of which they were deprived during the period of Russian rule. And China, because it applies its development aid at grass roots level, especially in Africa, rather than promoting large-scale projects - like some other donor countries - which often do not have a particularly beneficial effect on the regions concerned."
"We must therefore also think of these two states in political terms."
"And we must cooperate with Turkey in this region, because that is in Europe's long-term interest."
"As far as the two Christian states - Georgia and Armenia - are concerned, I should firstly like to say that it is certainly right that we should develop relations with and assist Georgia, but this should not mean that we put our trust in Russia's Gauleiter in Georgia, Mr Shevardnadze."
"This man was once used to counter Georgia's freely elected president, Mr Gamsakhurdia, who was subsequently murdered."
"I do take some interest in Georgia, I belong to the bureau of the group for human rights in Georgia, and I can assure the House that some extremely serious human rights violations are being committed there."
"That must be constantly emphasized."
"We are somewhat naive about human rights questions."
"We see violations in some places, but not others."
"And we should definitely see them in Georgia."
"With regard to Armenia, I know that many people criticize President Ter-Petrossian."
"Nevertheless, we should not forget what he has done for Armenia, how he has built the country up."
"It is therefore also important for us to maintain good relations with Armenia, and especially to use our influence finally to bring about a settlement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which takes account of the legitimate rights of both states and makes it possible to ensure the restoration of order in a region where we have interests."
"Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor."
"I was not able earlier to give the opinion of the Committee on Budgets on the interim agreement between the European Union and Armenia."
"I should like to do so now, after what Mr McCartin has said about the partnership agreement."
"He was a member of the Committee on Budgets, which delivered a favourable opinion."
"He was responsible for the comments that honourable Members have heard."
"Of course, the Committee on Budgets has delivered a favourable opinion on the interim agreement."
"It did so unanimously, in response to a proposal by myself."
"It obtained the figures it wanted from the Commission, relative to what is mentioned in the written opinion."
"Having regard to the fact that the general partnership agreement required Parliament's assent, and the importance of the interim agreement, the Committee therefore welcomed the fact that the Council consulted Parliament."
"I should add that I personally endorse the comments that have been made about the importance of Armenia to the European Union."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today, at 12 noon."
"(The sitting was suspended at 11.36 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon)"
"Mr President, I would just like to pass on my good wishes to the Bureau for the taking the enlightened decision to remove the photograph of Robert Maxwell from Parliament's premises."
"It is just a pity that it took them twenty-four hours to do so."
"What a pity you had to qualify your praise."
"Mr President, I should like to ask The British Conservatives, especially Mr Cassidy, during this voting time, to refrain from making obscene gestures to people in the public gallery."
"I am sure Mr Cassidy will give that assurance."
"Welcome"
"I should like to welcome here today a delegation from the Parliament of Lithuania, the Seimas , led by its chairman Mr Racas."
"He is accompanied by the Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Rinkunas."
"The delegation is visiting Strasbourg to meet its counterparts in the European Parliament and has held meetings yesterday and today."
"The association agreement which has been signed between the European Union and Lithuania and which will put Lithuania on an equal footing with the other associated states in its relations with the European Union is still awaiting the ratification of three of the Member States."
"As the European Parliament called, through the Oostlander report, for a policy of equal treatment of all the associated states, we hope that the ratification process will be completed shortly so that an EU/Lithuanian Joint Parliamentary Committee can be established."
"Chairman and colleagues, we welcome you to the Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Votes"
"Mr President, with reference to Amendment No 5, I have heard that a number of groups have problems with this amendment because it contains the words 'countries or' ."
"I would therefore propose an oral amendment deleting those words."
"The amendment would then read: ' Organizations which approve of or encourage compulsory abortion or sterilization and infanticide as methods of controlling population growth shall be excluded from Community support' ."
"Does anyone object to this oral amendment?"
"Mr President, there are in fact countries which approve of and officially engage in these practices."
"They should accordingly be referred to as countries."
"Simply referring to organizations, on the pretext that we can make that include countries if necessary, is in my view unacceptable."
"(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)"
"(The President declared the common position approved as amended)"
"Mr Falconer wants me to congratulate Mr Donnelly on the adoption of his report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since yesterday, we have had as our guests Members of Parliament from ten Mediterranean countries who have been meeting us for the first time in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the Barcelona process."
"In the course of our very interesting discussions, our colleagues put forward a number of constructive proposals, whose inclusion in my report would have added to and enhanced it."
"I explained to them that our Rules of Procedure unfortunately did not permit the tabling of amendments at the last minute, but I wish to put on record that I share a number of their reservations concerning this report."
"However, we shall now vote on the report."
"Amendment No 6 :"
"Mr President, I have consulted my colleagues in the PPE Group, and they agree that this amendment could be misunderstood."
"I would therefore propose a compromise oral amendment adding the following phrase to the end of recital A, which I shall read out in French:"
"' ... and recognizing the consistent follow-up by subsequent presidencies, starting with the Italian presidency...' ."
"That is all."
"If the House agrees to this oral amendment being put to the vote, Amendment No 6 can be withdrawn."
"(The amendment was withdrawn)"
"Amendment No 13 :"
"Mr President, I do not know why our colleagues in the Liberal Group have tabled this amendment."
"It simply seeks to delete a phrase from this paragraph, the important phrase concerning the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Mediterranean region."
"That could be done by means of a split vote."
"Amendment No 11 :"
"Mr President, I would like to propose adding the word 'maintenance' to the word 'restoration' , and the word 'archaeological' to the phrase 'promotion of artistic and historical monuments' ."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, I would propose that the second paragraph of Amendment No 11 should incorporate the present text of the motion for a resolution, with five words being deleted."
"You all have the text in front of you."
"I shall read it out in the amended version in French:"
"' rejects any proposal to list in the Treaty a large number of conditions to be fulfilled before Article 7A, providing for free movement of persons, comes into force; strongly criticizes the fact that this text does not provide a role for the European Parliament and the Court of Justice' ."
"I understand that there will be a roll-call vote on Amendment No 11."
"That seems to me a very relevant consideration as to whether we should accept this oral amendment."
"In principle I would be against ever accepting an oral amendment that then leads to a roll-call vote."
"It seems to me that a roll-call vote engages the political responsibility of Members of this House in a way that is unusual and we should be given notice of that."
"I might even argue that under Article 119(1) a request for a roll-call vote only applies to the amendment as printed and put before us and cannot apply to an oral amendment."
"Would the Liberal Group be prepared to withdraw its request for a roll-call vote?"
"I would like to reply to Mr Schäfer."
"I understand that it concerns an oral amendment to Amendment No 11 tabled by the Liberal Group."
"It replaces the whole of paragraph 8, not just the second paragraph."
"Could you confirm that?"
"If that is the case and if the Socialist Group supports Amendment No 11 entirely we are willing to withdraw the request for a roll-call vote."
"If he only wants to replace the second part of the paragraph then we maintain our request."
"It replaces the whole paragraph."
"Then we withdraw our request for a roll-call vote."
"Mr President, for the House's information, I think it would be helpful if the Member who proposed this oral amendment repeated exactly what he wishes to delete, because in my opinion it amounts to a criticism of the Dutch presidency, and is of course politically motivated."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"Amendment No 14 :"
"Just for fun, Mrs Van Dijk wishes to propose an oral amendment."
"Not just for fun, Mr President, but because I really do not think it is clear either to the Members of the House or to the public just what this amendment involves: what is it exactly that the Dutch presidency has deleted?"
"I should like to clarify the amendment, which would then read in English:"
"strongly opposes and refuses the proposal by the Dutch presidency to delete sexual orientation, age and handicap from the anti-discrimination article put forward by the Irish presidency."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"
"Before the final vote :"
"Mr President, I have discussed this matter with various groups, and it appears that, although we were unfortunately not aware of the fact before the deadline for tabling amendments, the Dutch presidency did not attend the debate, and everyone was extremely angry about it."
"I therefore propose to add a paragraph - you have the text of it in front of you - which reads as follows in English:"
"strongly regrets the absence of the presidency of the Council during yesterday's debate on the development of the Intergovernmental Conference and condemns the presidency's apparent lack of interest for the views of the European Parliament."
"(The oral amendment was rejected)"
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Mr President, this afternoon we are due to vote on the Tillich report, but I would like to draw attention to an error."
"Paragraph 10 states: ' Considers it essential that, if Member States...' , but instead of 'Member States' it should state 'Council' , which, legally speaking, is not the same thing."
"I think the relevant services should speak to the rapporteur and correct the error before we move on to the vote."
"Mr President, I am sorry to have to say that when I asked you how long you thought the voting would take you said five or ten minutes."
"It has taken 15-20 minutes, but that is not my point."
"It is becoming customary, and the same is continuing this week too, for the voting to continue until half past one or a quarter to two."
"I consider this unacceptable."
"We have said very many times that voting should end at one, or ten past one, or even a quarter past one, but no later."
"If there are so many votes to be taken, let the voting start at 11.30."
"I ask you to convey both to the President of Parliament and to the Conference of Presidents what I have said, because I think that the Members are not at all disposed to give up their lunch when they work 12 and 15 hours a day."
"There is a view in the Conference of Presidents that now that we have established a set beginning time for votes we should not alter that."
"If we change the time it creates problems."
"Mr President, I have two points to make."
"It seems extraordinary to me that a political group can put down an amendment and then ask for a split vote on their own amendment which happened on Amendment No 9 in that final vote."
"Could that be looked at by the Bureau?"
"It leads to a lot of confusion."
"Secondly, we all admire your presidency."
"We all admire presidents who congratulate rapporteurs."
"But there are a lot of reports which come to this House with a huge number of amendments."
"The rapporteurs who get concise reports to the House which do not take up a great deal of voting time deserve congratulations but maybe some of the others do not."
"I must congratulate my colleague Jean-Thomas Nordmann for his recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Co-operation, regarding aid to population policies and programmes in the developing countries."
"It should be pointed out that this text was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Development, and that the European Parliament's amendments have the virtue of recalling the commitments undertaken at the Cairo conference, especially by increasing Community financial aid to population programmes in developing countries to ECU 300 million by the year 2000."
"Furthermore, Parliament made a point of clarifying which committees had responsibility for each major region: the ACPs, the Mediterranean States and the Latin American and Asian States."
"Population programmes can only be introduced at the request and with the participation of the States concerned, but they are today the only means of countering population explosions."
"That is why I am voting in favour of Mr Nordmann's recommendation."
"Linkohr recommendation (A4-0084/97)"
"Already at the initial discussion of this report, I voiced criticism as to how the new research funds for the fourth frame program were to be used."
"As a supporter of the Green Party I do not agree with the proposal on how these funds are to be used."
"Too much money is for example put towards outdated means of transport when we ought to be investing in the development of economical and ecological means of transport."
"In order to try and make some changes, I have proposed three amendments which I will naturally vote for."
"However, I am not sure if we should give more money for research."
"According to Swedish studies there is no evidence of research at EU level being more valuable than the research carried out in Member States."
"I believe it would be more beneficial if the Member States invested the money in research in their native countries (including the international research exchange currently taking place between universities) or to support basic mainstream education."
"Alan J. Donnelly report (A4-0552/97)"
"I spoke in the debate yesterday to express my support for the Commission's communication and for the essence of the Donnelly report."
"In this area, as in many others, we need a genuine European industrial policy."
"I support an increase in research and also in forecasting studies, but more is needed in order to develop production and to combat unfair competition and social dumping."
"The Renault case gives us cause for concern, but lamentations are not enough."
"In order to keep factories there have to be cars to be manufactured and buyers to buy them."
"Finally, I say again: Europe must not impose rules upon itself that its competitors do not impose on themselves, particularly in the area of mergers and direct or indirect government intervention, whether in the United States or Japan."
"The Europe of the free single market is showing its limitations, and is now at risk of killing off the European idea as such unless it moves forward to a political and social Europe, an industrial Europe, a Europe of employment."
"That is the fundamental problem raised by Renault, and not a problem of form or even of method."
"I have voted against, because no new legal framework is required."
"There is a need to conclude the agreements stipulated in the accession treaties and to complete the review process promised by Commissioner Bjerregaard, as Parliament has already decided."
"Langen report (A4-0040/97)"
"I have voted for the report but do not agree with the proposal to construct a network of pipelines between factories in Europe."
"This would be too dangerous both from a safety and environmental point of view."
"Much more emphasis should have been placed on the chemical industry's own responsibility for the environment, particularly with regard to waste from the industry."
"Europe is truly at a crossroads."
"Either it goes further down the road of neo-liberal deregulation as indicated by the Molitor Group, or it genuinely takes the road of comprehensively developing its environmental and social capacities for the future."
"There is a need for political decisions to promote the development of a sustainable industrial policy worthy of the name, one which does not regard industrial production as a matter for manufacturers alone."
"Environmental considerations are part of the production process, just as employees - with their skills, initiative and responsibilities - are part of a business, and not just a disposable source of labour."
"Issues such as the introduction of eco-taxes and taxes on particularly harmful substances such as chlorine, the rehabilitation of contaminated areas and the long-term usability of certain substances and products are still on the agenda as matters of urgency, even though Parliament has not adopted a clear position on them in this report."
"Only in this way can the conflict between sustainable social efficiency and a purely economic approach be resolved - even if this is a message that Commissioner Bangemann is apparently still not prepared to take on board."
"Katiforis report (A4-0030/97)"
"In theory, the maritime industries provide a shining example of something that is simple yet difficult to achieve: a long-term, viable component of a mobility and production system that respects the environmental constraints within which people live, whilst encouraging the social progress that gives history its meaning."
"In practice, however, the opposite is unfortunately the case. The overlong predominance of the neoliberal model of economic policy has wrought havoc in this sector throughout the world: the international fleet is ageing and far from 'state of the art' in terms of safety and environmental protection; the employment culture in the shipping industry has largely gone to the dogs as the result of flagging-out and the creation of a racist hierarchy within crews; environmentally and socially responsible coastal shipping and inland waterway transport is being undermined by unfair competition from the road transport sector; and the potential of ports and coastal towns as sites for innovative production and especially processing is in no way being sensibly exploited."
"The means of reversing this unfortunate trend are well known, and are to some extent set out in the practical proposals from Mr Katiforis."
"We need global solutions, but we cannot wait for them."
"Europe can and must take the lead here by playing a more active role within the IMO, but also by introducing its own strict regulations wherever necessary."
"From port state controls, through the introduction of stricter safety rules for vessels calling at Union ports, to the regulation of coastal shipping - whatever the United States and Japan are doing, the European Union must do to the same degree."
"Morgan report (A4-0325/96)"
"Mr President, unlike many of my colleagues, I supported Mrs Morgan's proposal in the vote on Amendment No 20, since I believe that the cultivation of minority languages, for which she argues as a particular matter of concern in this report, is extremely important."
"We advocate the protection and promotion of minorities throughout the world in our resolutions."
"And we repeatedly advocate it as a principle in our list of demands to the IGC, I am glad to say."
"But I believe that we must also do so when it comes to actual competences within the Union - legislation and practical measures."
"It makes no sense to defend a principle and then not apply that principle in practice."
"I therefore wish to thank Mrs Morgan for her report, which has my full and complete support."
"The Danish social democrats voted in favour of the Morgan report, which deals primarily with the training of the population in the use of information technology."
"The report points out that the rapid developments in information technology could easily lead to new inequalities in society as a result of differential access to the new information and communication technologies."
"The existing social divisions would thus be deepened, with the risk of further marginalization of already disadvantaged groups."
"The Danish social democrats would urge that initiatives should be taken to spread the knowledge of information technology in the education system, so as to avoid any marginalization of particularly vulnerable groups."
"It is only through education and further training in the use of information technology that everyone can have equal access to the information society."
"We do have one criticism of the report, however, as it completely fails to mention the situation of women in the information society."
"Unless special attention is given to women's opportunities for education and training in the information society, there is a fear that women will become completely detached from the developments in information technology."
"I should like to start by saying that my group will unhesitatingly vote in favour of Mrs Morgan's report."
"As I said during the debate, we regard this report as an important element of European educational policy and we welcomed many of the suggestions that were made."
"Because, although the information society must be regarded as a positive element in the provision of a modern education, we must nevertheless remain vigilant: the campaign against academic failure and the reduction of inequalities must remain our priorities, and there is no certainty that multimedia development is always beneficial to the achievement of these objectives."
"We should also like to take advantage of this debate to say how sorry we are that this review of education, so basic to the future of young Europeans, was the subject of two debates: yesterday evening's debate on the White Paper on the information society, held in the absence of the Commissioner responsible for it, Mrs Cresson, and the present Morgan report of which Commissioner Bangemann is the sponsor."
"This entirely artificial division is, unfortunately, not a matter of chance because it reflects the highly dubious division because these reports on the basis of their having two distinct legal bases - training on the one hand and the information society on the other."
"Even so, I believe that for the sake of consistency in our work, it would be as well to regard the education requirement as one and indivisible."
"Committee of Inquiry recommendation (A4-0054/97)"
"Mr President, the excellent report by the Committee of Inquiry on Community transit highlights the crucial errors that have been committed during the last ten years with regard to European integration."
"This transit system, which was designed to enable goods from third countries entering our territory to move through that territory without paying any customs duty or tax before arriving at their destination, is now a hotbed of tax fraud which is costing billions of ECU to the exchequers of the Member States and to the Community finances."
"Why does this fraud exist?"
"The Committee of Inquiry began by pointing out a number of technical reasons associated with the obsoleteness of a system that uses paper as its medium, disregarding information technology, and which has failed to cope with the increase in trade transactions."
"But the Committee also, and more importantly, demonstrates that the abolition of checks at the Union's internal borders enormously facilitates fraud, since a load can cross the whole of Europe without any country knowing it is there and without anyone knowing, if it happens to disappear, in which country the offence was committed."
"That is why the report rightly concludes that there was, and I quote, a 'lack of foresight by the Commission in the introduction of the single market, which has been guided by the principles of market liberalization and the abolition of controls' ."
"The report adds, perhaps disingenuously, that this lack of foresight by the Commissioners was incomprehensible."
"In fact, in my view, it is entirely comprehensible since the issue as far as they were concerned was to ensure that the dogma of the abolition of controls won the day at all costs."
"Well, it is clear today, perhaps pending the arrival of other systems that do not yet exist, that the internal customs services are still valuable, especially for keeping control of the transit of goods."
"Furthermore, the report by the Committee of Inquiry, which does not venture to suggest that controls should be reintroduced at the internal borders, recommends that, listen carefully, I quote 'the customs code should be amended to permit spot checks anywhere within the territory of the European Union' ."
"That's progress: abolish the controls at the internal borders and then increase them everywhere else."
"In conclusion, our congratulations once again to the members of the Committee of Inquiry for their intellectual honesty, and may we express the hope that the European Parliament will take the initiative to institute other inquiries of the same kind in connection with the problem of the borders, for example regarding intra-community VAT fraud."
"The Kellett-Bowman report, the result of the efforts of the Committee of Inquiry of which I was a member, is intended to define the problems encountered with the setting-up of the Community transit system, established on the territory of the European Union and extended to include Switzerland, the EEA countries and the Visegrad States (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary)."
"It also proposes measures designed to improve the functioning of the transit system."
"It is a good report that reflects the good work done by the Committee of Inquiry."
"It should be remembered that the transit system allows the temporary suspension of customs duties, excise duties and VAT until these are paid at the destination of the goods."
"The system is clearly indispensable for the functioning of the single market, but there is a need to combat crossborder fraud and to halt the loss of revenue, which amounts to several billion ECU since 1990."
"This level of fraud is intolerable."
"That is why, in response to a proposal by the Committee of Inquiry, the European Parliament proposes that the transit system should be computerized as quickly as possible, that a system of physical control should be set up throughout the territory of the European Union, and that a specific legal framework should be set up with 'mutual recognition of evidence' , a 'centralized legal office' and national customs services functioning as if they were one."
"I approve of these proposals."
"The European Parliament considers that this problem of fraud control must be a subject of discussion with Switzerland and negotiation with the countries of central and eastern Europe and with Cyprus, not forgetting the customs union with Turkey."
"Finally, the Committee of Inquiry welcomed the fact that the Commission accepts that it will not further extend the transit system until it has been reformed and computerized."
"It is also happy to have succeeded in having the necessary resources for this project appropriated in the European Union budget."
"It is only logical for there to be co-operation at EU level between national Customs Departments to fight fraud."
"The Swedish Green Party remains opposed to the introduction of an internal market which automatically results in, for example, customs frauds as mentioned in the Committee of Inquiry's report."
"We take this matter very seriously and believe that the national Customs Departments within the EU must co-operate in order to prevent smuggling."
"However, we strongly disagree with the introduction of a common Customs Department at EU level, as mentioned in recommendation No. 1 and at several other places in the documents of the Committee of Inquiry."
"The Danish social democrats would like to thank the chairman and the rapporteur of the Committee of Inquiry for their excellent work."
"The report indicates that the transit system is on the verge of collapse, and that Europe is being swamped by an obdurate form of crime as never before."
"Thanks to the report, the politicians and the Commission have had their eyes opened to the problem, which many had approached with blinkers on."
"The Danish minister responsible for taxation has written to us thanking the committee for its good work, and offering to the Commission that Denmark could act as a pilot country for the data system that we wish to see introduced to improve the transit system and to stop the abuses which are taking place."
"The report shows that arrangements between individual states will not solve the problem."
"The welfare of each and every person in the European Union depends on the secure and efficient administration of the internal market and the import and export system for the massive quantities of goods traded and transported every day."
"The decision of the European Parliament to investigate the detailed workings of the system was therefore well justified."
"We have found that the system is under strain and is not capable of efficiently handling the volume of trade."
"Furthermore a relatively low, but unacceptable, level of fraud and irregularities have been found."
"However, given the antiquated system in use it is a miracle that the level of fraud is so low."
"Any level of fraud and irregularity is unacceptable and forces us all to pay more taxes."
"The loss of one container of cigarettes, it is reported, costs us £800, 000 in lost revenue."
"Up to 15 % of the market for cigarettes in some Member States is supplied by the black market."
"The extra taxes we must pay to make up for these losses runs to several billion pounds annually."
"Of course, the problem of the inadequate transit system for the transport of goods in Europe is not related to the existence of the European Union."
"Most of the increasing volume of trade would have occurred in any case and exposed the inability of the system to cope effectively."
"What seems to have happened is that responsibility for the system is not clearly defined and both the EU and the individual Member States have neglected the problem to some extent."
"I therefore fully support the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry to improve the Community transit system."
"We must computerize the control systems, make them more efficient and effective and reduce bureaucracy and delays on the external borders."
"These measures are necessary in any case and will help eliminate fraud from the system especially if, as we propose, they are backed up with spot checks and mutual recognition of evidence."
"As I did in my speech in the debate, I wish to declare my support for the Committee of Inquiry's report."
"However, I wish to sound a warning that the transcript of the committee's proceedings could easily be misused as a virtual instruction manual for customs fraud."
"I would therefore recommend that some thought be given to how such an undesirable outcome can be prevented."
"First of all, I must congratulate the chairman of the Committee of Inquiry, Mr John Tomlinson, and its rapporteur, Mr Kellett-Bowman, for their exceptional efforts over the last 15 months."
"In the seven years during which I have had the opportunity to follow the work done by our Parliament, there has never been a parliamentary project on the same scale as this report on efforts to combat fraud against the Community budget."
"What I do rather regret is that our parliamentary committee, while endeavouring to find compromises, was unable, or perhaps unwilling, to play its most important role - as the driving force behind the progress of the European Community."
"At a time when everyone is discussing the introduction of the euro as the single European currency, we are retreating in the face of a problem of European customs administration, necessary though it unfortunately is."
"When you think that, according to certain cautious estimates, several billion francs are being lost each year, those losses are liable in the short term to undermine the confidence that Europe's citizens still place in the Community institutions."
"It is true, too, that this evil has many causes: bad faith on the part of the recipients of the Community's funds, inadequacy of the controls carried out at both national and Community level, problems of proof and problems with the application of effective penalties, not to mention omissions and inaccuracies in the Community texts."
"A second point I should like to make is the lack of any desire for change on the part of the Member States with regard to Community law."
"In my view, the Member States should be induced to take action so that breaches of Community rules are subject to the same punishments or penalties."
"I believe, in fact, that the Community must be given a punitive power - the power to impose uniform punishments to penalize breaches of its regulations anywhere in Community territory."
"Mutual assistance in legal matters, as applied at present, is not really an instrument for combating fraud against the Community budget."
"The Commission cannot make use of it and cannot really control it."
"The European Union is a victim of fraud, but it relies on the goodwill of the Member States to be told about it."
"Any positive action in this field is conceivable only if the Member States and the public really take cognizance of the fact that money from Brussels is not someone else's money."
"We have every reason to be impressed with the extensive work of the Temporary Committee of Inquiry when mapping out the extensive frauds in connection with transits."
"We also agree with several sections of the analysis presented concerning the shortcomings of control by national Customs authorities."
"However, we oppose the conclusions and the recommendations made by the Committee and especially disagree with the solutions aimed at strengthening the centralised structure of the Customs, e.g. the proposed introduction of a common framework 'to make the national Customs Departments work as one' ."
"The current Intergovernmental Conference has expressed considerable doubt as to whether the sovereignty of Member States over the Customs should be removed."
"This doubt is shared by the Swedish government."
"The European Union's own experience of supranationality, e.g. the Common Agricultural Policy, Structural Funds, various programmes for Eastern and Central Europe, leaves much to be desired as far as efficiency and control in the prevention of fraud is concerned."
"The problem of fraudulent activity must instead be solved by strengthening national Customs Departments, not least when it comes to the employees, and by expanding the co-operation between all European states."
"Europe is after all much bigger than the European Union."
"Albania"
"Mr President, I voted against the joint motion for a resolution in the end, even though some of the worst of the Socialist Group's amendments were rejected."
"What concerned me was recital D, however. I do not believe that undermining President Berisha's position at the present time will serve the cause of peace."
"I believe that we must press him to compromise, and he is doing so already."
"Undermining his position is the most dangerous thing that we could do, however."
"That would make the peace process impossible for the foreseeable future."
"The second point I should like to make is that there is a great deal of hypocrisy in this debate."
"Parliament has frequently attempted to mobilize resources and other forms of support for Albania."
"It has been thwarted by the Council and by certain Member States, in particular Greece, and what concerns me here is that now that the results of this mistaken approach are emerging, people are pointing the finger and expecting a society which has been isolated for decades to behave like a democracy which has been established for hundreds of years."
"Moreover, it is those who have done the least for Albania and have blocked Community aid who are now being most critical of the country."
"With relatively modest resources, we could have created a model of development in this small country."
"Now we have lost that opportunity, and I therefore protest at this hypocrisy!"
"Although the negotiators for the PPE Group made great efforts and managed to improve the text, I too am unable to support the joint motion for a resolution, because it does not correspond to the facts."
"It still pins the blame on the democratically elected President Berisha, a patriot and a democrat who made a crucial contribution to the liberation of his people from the totalitarian communist yoke."
"The truth is that southern Albania is the stronghold of a mafia which, together with the KGB, largely controlled the pyramid investment schemes."
"What happened was not a popular uprising, but a coolly planned operation by organized criminals to prevent the implementation of President Berisha's measures to eliminate them."
"The strength of these criminal elements lies not least in the powerful support which they receive from across the border."
"It is therefore in no way in Europe's interest to allow these elements, who call themselves social democrats but who reject socialist internationalism, to lead the people of Albania back into slavery."
"Sakellariou report (A4-0027/97)"
", in writing. (ES) I would like to express my full agreement with giving a parliamentary dimension to the process initiated by the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Conference and, at the same time, I would like to mention the following with regard to the report:"
"The first Euro-Mediterranean Conference marked the beginning of a new stage in relations between the Mediterranean countries and Europe."
"A 'before' and an 'after' ."
"A new policy had to be inaugurated even though the European Community's Mediterranean policy had already been in existence for 20 years. However, its purely trade-related approach and system of unequal treatment with a basis in colonialism resulted in its failure."
"Perhaps the essence of the first Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona was, therefore, that it constituted a change in procedures and in the way in which Euro-Mediterranean relations were regarded - from that time on, such countries began to be regarded as partners and associates of the EU; and the relationship procedure has become one of mutual agreement, based on principles of reciprocity and association aimed at shared work and objectives."
"It is therefore essential to observe these rules."
"We must pay close attention to how we have to go about things!"
"We must be careful that there is no possibility that, via this report, the EP should be seen to be making decisions unilaterally without the prior agreement of our partners and against their will."
"As Vice-President Marín stated yesterday, the Euro-Mediterranean process must now be consolidated - this must be a priority - before new requests are made."
"Finally, we should also have regard to the territorial approach: each partner must have its own relational space, in addition to the shared space, with no one feeling marginalized or relegated."
"We should also protect the integrity of the Mediterranean area which is unambiguously defined by nature, geography, culture and history."
"One can only agree with Mr Sakellariou's report and his broad encouragement for a Community partnership with the Mediterranean States on matters of security, stability and economics."
"I have read this report very carefully, and I note that in the chapter entitled 'Economic and financial co-operation' , reading between the lines, there is evidence of a desire to change the Common Agricultural Policy."
"This impression is confirmed in the explanatory statement where Mr Sakellariou frankly proposes a reform of the CAP and rapid liberalization of the trade in agricultural products."
"For some time, I have been unable to escape the feeling that every report, or virtually every report, going through this Parliament becomes a pretext, directly or indirectly, for the reform of the CAP."
"That reform, if there is to be a reform, must not be sketched out in odd paragraphs of reports that are more or less remote from the subject."
"This pillar will have to be dealt with as such, through a process of in-depth analysis within the most competent committee concerned, which is the Committee on Agriculture."
"However, I must caution those of us who favour a swift reform."
"We have just formally celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, and we must never forget that the Common Agricultural Policy, along with the ECSC, was the first pillar of European unity."
"We should be cautious and vigilant. We must not be in such a rush to dismantle and dispose of our Common Agricultural Policy, which has done so much to hold our 15 Member States together."
"Despite the generally positive outlook described in the report on the Barcelona Conference, there is one prospect which can hardly fail to alarm a particularly frail group of European citizens: farmers."
"This is explicit in the explanatory statement, though it appears in more veiled form in the resolution."
"The relevant sentence is in paragraph 14 under 'Economic and financial cooperation' , where establishing a free trade area by 2010 is mentioned."
"To achieve this objective, structural reforms of the various economic policies are proposed, starting with agricultural policy."
"The point is made that there can be no free trade area unless there is rapid liberalization of imports of agricultural products from Mediterranean third countries."
"It is right to emphasize the importance of a very close relationship between Mediterranean countries, and bilateral agreements between some of them have already been in operation for several years, as a result of which European Union markets are in fact already penetrable."
"It is important for the measures to balance Community protection and free trade with third countries."
"The agriculture of third Mediterranean countries is highly competitive with Community countries in terms of seasonality and plant variety."
"Those countries also have the advantage of infinitely lower labour, land and processing costs."
"IGC"
"Mr President, not liking to inconvenience too many people I shall make my explanation of vote orally."
"The House has just debated, for the first time, a new idea floated at the Intergovernmental Conference - the possibility of enhanced co-operation, meaning joint actions which would not automatically involve the fifteen Member States but would be organized as required, possibly with a smaller number of participants."
"This is what my group prefers to call, using a broader term, differentiated co-operation or a multi-speed Europe."
"The most striking point, though, is that this idea - which could result in a Europe that is less rigid, less monolithic, better adapted to the specific needs of all concerned and therefore closer to the citizen - is being received by the European Parliament with extreme mistrust and a plethora of restrictive conditions."
"This House is wedded to the idea of unitary progress, within a single institutional framework, to the point of caricature when it goes so far as to proclaim that the European Parliament, in its entirety, has the right of codecision regarding the legislative framework and administrative spending of differentiated co-operation, even when these joint actions would, by definition, involve only certain Member States and not all."
"We believe that methods like these, on the pretext of introducing flexibility clauses into the Treaty, are in fact going to burden it with bureaucratic procedures which would obstruct everything and result in even greater rigidity."
"That is why my group tabled, at the Committee on Institutional Affairs, numerous amendments designed to introduce genuine flexibility."
"We believe that differentiated co-operation must be decided upon very freely by the participants, provided only that it is not in conflict with the Treaty and does not prejudice non-participating Member States."
"The organizational form to be taken by these joint actions must also be very free, in other words free of compulsory intervention by the Community institutions, subject to any necessary co-ordination within the Council."
"These proposals seem to us to offer a prospect of ending the current deadlock by returning the institutions of cooperation in Europe to the exclusive service of the citizens' needs rather than of a federalistic ideology."
"Our basic view is that the European Union should be a cooperation between independent states."
"Unfortunately, the proposed resolution is going in precisely the opposite direction."
"The resolution is in favour of increasing decision making by qualified majority vote in the Council of Ministers and increasing the influence of the European Parliament."
"This will only lead to an even more ambiguous situation as to who is responsible for the political decisions in each of the Member States."
"We believe that national parliaments should be the highest decision-making forum in Member States."
"Consequently, we cannot possibly vote in favour of this resolution."
"We must also put on record the substantial increase in the number of resolutions issued by this House in connection with the IGC and before and after the summit meetings held regularly in the European Union."
"Lindqvist (ELDR), Sjöstedt and Svensson (GUE/NGL), Gahrton and Holm (V), Bonde and Sandbæk (I-EDN), in writing."
"(SV) The proposal involves an intensification of co-operation from a mainly interstate co-operation to a federal state."
"For us development in this direction is unacceptable."
"We are therefore voting against the proposal."
"Common regulations could result in equal salaries for all members of the European Parliament which would increase the salaries of the Swedish members considerably, especially if the common salary is calculated as a percentage of the judges' salaries in the courts of the European Union as proposed by the Presidency of the European Parliament during a press conference in Sweden."
"This would most likely delay a settlement of the most controversial alternative regulations on expenses, e.g. the regulation concerning the travel allowance for business class travel when there are many other possibilities of travelling by less expensive means."
"The most natural thing would be to start by changing the more controversial regulations on expenses, e.g. the travel allowance, so that payments in excess of actual costs are not made."
"Our Parliament could, if it wanted to, make a valuable contribution to the essential in-depth reform of the European Union's present institutional system."
"The quality of the work that has been done by our first two parliamentary Committees of Inquiry, into mad cow disease and into the Community transit system, shows that Members of the European Parliament can, on occasion, demonstrate good sense, competence, a sense of reality and a zeal to expose the truth."
"What do we actually learn from these two reports?"
"They expose, arrestingly and very specifically, how sadly the European institutions have lost their way since the mid-1980s: the susceptibility of the Community system to the interests of the lobbyists at the expense of those of the public; the extent of the problem of fraud, a structural secretion of the supranational institutional system; and generalized irresponsibility in the absence of any democratic control over the Community actors."
"Can Parliament learn the lesson of its own investigations?"
"It should, in all logic, infer that there is a need for swift action to correct errors on such a scale that they largely explain why the public has lost its enthusiasm for European integration."
"How can this be done?"
"By abandoning efforts to secure the infinite growth of what is literally an 'institutional monster' , of ever-increasing remoteness, complexity, opacity and uncontrollability, and start enthusiastically advocating genuine, controlled subsidiarity."
"But what do we actually find?"
"Parliament takes no notice of its own observations, especially those regarding the failings of the Commission, when determining its position on the IGC."
"To the contrary, every error it identifies becomes one more pretext to justify the intensification and expedition of the process of total communitization, the supposed panacea to cure all ills."
"Having denounced the ravages of the Commission's bureaucracy, Parliament promptly recommends that it be strengthened."
"This schizophrenic contradiction between relevant analysis when Parliament inquires and inappropriate recommendations when it deliberates is preventing this House from being a credible influence when it comes to proposals for institutional reform."
"It is high time that Parliament abandoned empty slogans and ideological dogma."
"No one would believe our lack of interest in putting right the errors that we ourselves have listed."
"The IGC provides a unique opportunity for doing so."
"By building on the very serious investigatory work it has begun and drawing specific conclusions from it, our Parliament can help to put European integration back on the rails and heading in the right direction, in line with the intentions of the founding fathers and the present expectations of the public."
"If our institution fails to take this opportunity offered by the IGC it will bear a heavy responsibility, because if these errors continue the very idea of Europe is likely to be in jeopardy."
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.45 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome Mr Eddison Zvobgo from Zimbabwe, who has taken his seat in the Official Gallery."
"Mr Zvobgo is a Minister and coordinator of the parliamentary reform committee in Zimbabwe."
"He is visiting us to acquaint himself with our work and working methods."
"We extend a warm welcome to him, and hope that he will be able to take back many ideas from Parliament to his country."
"Topical and urgent debate"
"The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance."
"Madam President, this week saw the opening of the fortieth meeting of the UN Conference on Human Rights in Geneva, which is scheduled to continue until mid-April."
"The House may know that Amnesty International has published a report for the meeting which names a number of countries where the most systematic and serious human rights violations are taking place."
"This extremely interesting report also puts forward a number of suggestions as to how the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council of Europe could work together to develop a European human rights policy."
"What I would like to talk about now are the countries which Amnesty names in the report."
"It will come as no surprise to anyone here that one of the countries accused of systematic and continual human rights violations is China."
"We in Parliament are therefore right to keep a close eye on the situation."
"We cannot simply say that we have discussed it often enough, so we should not need to do so again."
"We need to do it every time, unfortunately."
"One of the ways in which the Chinese Government demonstrates its oppressive nature is in its treatment of Tibet."
"This too is something we have discussed on a number of occasions and are discussing again this afternoon, because we in the House would like to make it clear that we wholeheartedly support the Dalai Lama's proposal for talks on the future."
"We hope that his offer will also be given serious consideration in Geneva, so that the parties could perhaps enter into talks through those channels."
"This is what is needed at the moment to end the hopeless situation in Tibet: talks between the Chinese Government and Tibet."
"Madam President, over the last year, we have seen the Chinese authorities step up their campaign of terror against the Tibetans yet again."
"They have even made it an offence to possess a photograph of the Dalai Lama, for which dozens of monks have been arrested."
"The campaign against the Dalai Lama and his followers has taken many forms and has recently become much more violent."
"The Tibetans have been deprived of nearly all their fundamental human rights, and the world has simply stood and watched as the Panchen Lama has been held in captivity by the Chinese."
"Why?"
"The Dalai Lama has responded without violence and his calls for talks deserve our support."
"He is not asking for independence, he simply wishes to have cultural and religious freedom."
"This time, he has even made the concession that independence is not a precondition."
"The Union must use its contacts with the Chinese authorities to get these talks started."
"We hope that China will come to realize that oppression does not work, either with Tibet or Xinjiang."
"China's new leaders must see that they are simply turning the international community and their own people against them."
"My group has every sympathy with this resolution today."
"Madam President, I think that other speakers have sufficiently stressed the importance of this motion, which calls for negotiations to begin at last between the authorities in Peking and the Tibetan government in exile."
"Despite a very bad start, I think the compromise text is satisfactory."
"There is still room for improvement on one point, however: I feel that we cannot, in a European Parliament text, limit the aspirations of the Tibetan people to cultural and religious autonomy."
"The Dalai Lama, when he visited Parliament, was very clear on that point: Tibet must have full and complete independence, even though the Dalai Lama, in the interests of promoting a dialogue with the Chinese authorities, was willing to give way on defence, security and foreign policy."
"Otherwise, and it does seem to be very important to emphasize this, the Tibetans must be in a position to govern themselves without interference from the Chinese authorities."
"I think this is a particularly urgent matter."
"Today, as we know, the Tibetans are already a minority in their own country; so we must act quickly, and I believe this motion is along the right lines, but the Council and the Member States should start making serious representations at the United Nations to demand that the question of the decolonization of the Tibetan people, and indeed their survival, is finally taken into account and dealt with by the international community."
"I must thank all my colleagues, James Moorhouse in particular, and our Liberal friends for having combined effectively to change the purport of this motion, and I hope it will be adopted."
"I ask you all to vote in favour of the amendment which would eliminate this restriction on religious and cultural autonomy."
"We must be quite clear about this, and therefore I once again urge those who have not yet done so to reconsider their votes on this amendment."
"Madam President, this is by no means the first resolution we have debated about the situation in Tibet."
"Indeed no fewer than eleven previous resolutions dealing with various aspects of the problem have been adopted by this House over the past ten years."
"This is a clear indication of the deep concern felt about the plight of the people of Tibet, a situation which continues to deteriorate, one regrets to note: so much so that there are real fears that Tibetan culture will become still further eroded."
"One can only conclude that the Chinese aim is to cause the extinction of Tibetan culture."
"The particular significance of this debate is that among other matters it follows the death of Deng Xiaoping and takes place three days after the anniversary of the Chinese occupation of Tibet."
"Along with Olivier Dupuis, I joined 3-4, 000 demonstrators from all over Europe in Geneva on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the initial occupation of Tibet."
"That was a vivid illustration of the degree of support behind the Tibetan cause, which was prominently featured in the world news."
"But the crucial point of our resolutions, which have a common thread, is that we now have the opportunity, we believe, for fresh negotiations about the future of the Tibetan people, with a possible move towards selfgovernment."
"His Holiness the Dalai Lama has indicated that he would not be pressing for full independence provided that Tibetan culture, the way of life, can be safeguarded."
"So we feel that we should back this new approach and hope that it will really come about."
"I look forward to the reaction of the Commission."
"Madam President, I should firstly like to say how pleased I am that the House is once again debating the situation in Tibet."
"This problem has been discussed often enough, but little has been done about it."
"That is no reason to stop discussing it."
"Over the last ten years, we have had to listen to a great many speeches about bloody conflicts around the world, but I think we can say without cynicism that a war waged against the soul and culture of a people can ultimately be more devastating than a purely military conflict."
"However, that is exactly what China's treatment of Tibet amounts to."
"The people of Tibet are largely prevented from practising their religion, whilst their temples are renovated beyond recognition - a tried and tested means of repression - and their cultural artefacts are shipped off to China."
"I shall not address the wider issue of torture and human rights violations, as previous speakers have already done so."
"When we consider that, according to a report by UNESCO, some 50 % of the world's cultural heritage has been destroyed in the course of this century through ignorance, and very often through communist vandalism - in Cambodia, for example - it is clear that a stop must be put to China's actions in Tibet."
"The joint motion for a resolution refers to the cultural and religious autonomy of the Tibetan people."
"In this respect, however, and here I agree with Mr Dupuis, I firmly believe that it does not go far enough."
"It should also refer to the independence - with the exceptions referred to by Mr Dupuis - and the right to self-determination of the Tibetan people."
"We should also not forget that the leader of the Tibetan people, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, has indicated to the Chinese Government his constant willingness to engage in talks, without making any substantial political demands; his overtures have just as constantly been rebuffed by the Chinese authorities, however."
"To my mind, Parliament is therefore obliged to adopt a clear and unequivocal stance on this issue, especially since a similar situation is now threatening to engulf the Uigur people of Chinese Turkestan."
"That is all the more reason, I believe, why we in Parliament really do have a duty to speak out for the right to self-determination, religious freedom and democracy in Tibet."
"Madam President, the motion has been drawn up with the inspiration not of the Holy Ghost and by Christian authors, but at the instigation of His Holiness the Dalai Lama as he is referred to in the motion."
"All that has been said demonstrates the tendency and effort to liberate Tibet and censure the Peoples Republic of China, by maintaining that Tibet is under Chinese occupation."
"Tibet has been an integral part of China for centuries, it is today, and it always will be."
"Do not those who tabled the motion consider that if their fanciful plan were ever to come about, this would lead to destabilization in that part of the world?"
"And they take as their point of departure what was said by His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who when he came to the Political Committee of our Parliament as the representative of the Tibetan people and I asked him how and in what capacity he represented the Tibetan people, answered: ' Ah, you have no idea!"
"Such then are the enlightened members of the European Parliament, those who have drawn up this motion, who are also inspired by the spirit of reincarnation in what they say in their resolution."
"Madam President, I will vote against it because the motion does nothing to help relations between the European Community and that great country, the great market, but by making them more difficult, facilitates the penetration of American and Japanese multi-national companies."
"That is what this resolution will achieve."
"Is this unsuspected, or is it motivated by suspect interests?"
"Mr President, I think our Parliament should recognize the benevolent and devoted commitment of the Italian and transnational radicals to the Tibetan people's struggle for their rights."
"If they were not constantly monitoring what is going on in Tibet and raising the issue, this tragedy would probably not have the profile it has in Italy, Europe and the UN."
"The Italian Right is so sensitive to that struggle and solidly behind it, that during a recent demonstration of solidarity, many of our members hung out the Tibetan flag on town balconies and the much berated Berlusconi-Fini government was the first in Europe to receive a visit from the Dalai Lama in exile."
"Having said that, we will obviously vote for the joint resolution because we are convinced that the only way to help the Tibetan people is to call on the Chinese government in every form and in every international forum to abandon its arrogant and prevaricating policy and finally concede the fundamental rights which will allow the Tibetan people to safeguard their identity and hence their survival."
"Madam President, this question involves the human rights and the right to self-determination of the people of Tibet."
"No one, not even the People's Republic of China, is entitled to restrict human rights on the basis of their own philosophy or culture, let alone annul those rights."
"As the previous speaker said, Parliament must therefore use all the means at its disposal to defend the human rights and the right to self-determination of the Tibetan people."
"One thing is clear: the European Union and this Parliament can only interpret the right to selfdetermination as this is set out in the Helsinki Final Act, from which it follows that the right to self-determination does not imply the right to alter borders arbitrarily, since that violates the right to self-determination of other peoples."
"That being so, we must stand up for the Tibetan people's right to self-determination as a cultural and human right."
"I therefore support the call made in Parliament's resolution for the question of Tibet to be placed on the agenda of the UN General Assembly."
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, an unchanging aspect of European Union policy regarding China has been the importance accorded human rights."
"The Commission is therefore determined to improve the situation in Tibet and also shares the concern of this House about this subject."
"The Commission condemns any attempt by the Chinese authorities to suppress freedom of speech and of religion and deplores the current situation in Tibet."
"As you will be aware, the European Union has made constant reference to human rights issues in Tibet and the religious dimension of Tibetan identity in bilateral talks with China - both in the political sphere and regarding the specific subject of human rights, and at an international level."
"The European Union intends to continue its efforts towards consolidating a constructive and positive relationship with China."
"As regards Tibet, the European Union's traditional line of action has been to attempt to foment direct dialogue, direct negotiation, between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the Tibetan people, including, naturally, the Dalai Lama."
"At various times, both through specific approaches and via dialogue in international institutions, the European Union has expressed its concern regarding the fate of the Panchen Lama appointed by the Dalai Lama."
"As you will already know, the European Union has always demanded guarantees regarding the safety and freedom of the Panchen Lama and will continue to do so."
"Thank you, Commissioner Marín."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0198/97 by Mr Colajanni and Mrs Terrón i Cusí, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the Israeli Government's decision to approve construction plans in Jerusalem; -B4-0219/97 by Mr Bertens and Mr Vallvé, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on new settlements in Jerusalem and Israeli-Palestinian relations; -B4-0224/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the peace process in the Middle East; -B4-0233/97 by Mr Pradier and Mr Vandemeulebroucke, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on Israel's policy of new settlements; -B4-0248/97 by Mr Wurtz and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on East Jerusalem; -B4-0264/97 by Mr Provan and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the Middle East peace process."
"Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the 6500 dwellings authorized in the Arab district of Jerusalem by the current Israeli government undoubtedly herald, Madam President, an extraordinarily serious crisis in the extremely complex peace process which we have all supported in the past and continue to support."
"In the Oslo Agreements, it was understood that, until such time as current phases and negotiations are completed, Jerusalem must retain its present status. That is a subject for discussion during the third phase."
"Therefore, although good and faithful friends of Israel, we are given great cause for concern by the step taken by Netanyahu and we support this common resolution to the effect that the conservative government in Israel should not pursue this building project in East Jerusalem."
"This decision, Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, can only help to undermine what has been achieved in such a difficult peace process and - Heaven forbid - could again open the flood gates to tension and violence which it would be difficult to stem."
"Madam President, the peace process still has a long way to go."
"There may be agreement on Hebron, but new obstacles have now emerged."
"The Israeli Government's decision to go ahead and build a new development in East Jerusalem was extremely unwise."
"It may not contradict the letter of the Oslo agreements, but it certainly contradicts their spirit."
"The negotiations on Jerusalem which form part of the last phase of the entire process are going to be difficult enough in themselves, and the Israeli Government must understand that its decision may only do it more harm than good in the long run."
"The European resolution may have been blocked by an American veto in the Security Council, but there too there is growing unease."
"Israel is playing with fire."
"Furthermore, it needs to be made clear to the Palestinian President, Mr Arafat, that his attitude is also not helping the peace process."
"He must not add fuel to the flames by threatening a unilateral declaration of independence for the Palestinian State."
"And the European Parliament must not allow itself to be drawn into taking sides."
"Now that the Union has a role to play in the peace process, the European Parliament must also behave responsibly and in an even-handed way."
"Madam President, the decision by the Israeli Government has to be seen in a specific context."
"Not only that, it is all the more serious because of the existence of other measures which may be less spectacular but indicate the same desire to compromise the peace agreements."
"The context I refer to comprises, first of all, the texts: UN Resolutions Nos 242 and 338, which very specifically exclude any further forcible acquisition of territory, together with the European Parliament's resolutions, especially that of November 1996, and the Council's latest declarations."
"Quite apart from these texts, though, we have History and the lessons it can teach us."
"There is the symbolic significance of this region to the entire world."
"There are other examples, such as the example of South Africa, where men of great worth are trying to overcome the difficult legacy of a bloodstained history through dialogue and negotiation."
"Above all, perhaps, bearing in mind the values on which the Member States of the European Union are based, there is the need to proclaim that there is much more greatness in respecting an adversary, especially when he is down, than in constantly indulging in a show of force."
"We must give our support to those, even in the Israeli community, who are concerned about future relations between Israel and the Palestinians."
"Madam President, the Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Hebron gave a new stimulus to the peace process and raised hopes of new, constructive initiatives."
"Before the ink was even dry on that agreement, the Israeli Government was creating a further obstacle to the peace process by deciding to authorize the building of a new settlement of 6500 homes in Arab East Jerusalem Jabal Abu Ghneim."
"This project is designed to drive a permanent wedge between the eastern sector of Jerusalem and the Palestinian autonomous territories."
"Jerusalem would thus be completely cut off from the West Bank."
"It is an illegal decision, because the final status of East Jerusalem will have to be discussed during the third stage of negotiations, and because both sides have undertaken to refrain from any action that might change the situation on the ground."
"The Israeli Government has been supported by the United States, which used its veto against a United Nations Security Council resolution banning the establishment of any settlements that would change the status quo laid down in the signed agreement."
"The peace process is thus, once again, in jeopardy."
"This House must firmly condemn the decision taken by the Israeli Government, with the complicity of the United States, and demand compliance with UN Security Council Resolution No 242."
"We must call upon the Council to become more involved in the peace process and to use all means at its disposal, including economic and political sanctions, within the framework of the agreement with Israel to persuade the Israeli Government to apply the peace process, respecting the Oslo Agreements and the United Nations resolutions."
"Madam President, we are delighted that we have this opportunity of debating this issue today."
"We are at a stage in the development of the peace negotiations in the Middle East which is causing great concern."
"I am sure there are many who are greatly disturbed to hear that the Israeli Government has decided to go ahead with the building of the settlement in East Jerusalem."
"All settlement building, particularly in this sensitive case of Jerusalem, risks damaging the peace process and preempting the final status negotiations that we all want to see concluded in a successful way."
"We should urge the Israeli Government, therefore, not to proceed with these plans as we need to get a direction which is more positive."
"We cannot expect a positive outcome to some of these negotiations while decisions which are seen to be confrontational are taking place."
"Confrontation is not what we want to achieve."
"We want to make sure that the peace is re-established and can move forward rapidly."
"That is not happening at the present time."
"Mr Arafat has decided that he wants to take up the cudgels and combat what he sees as some difficult situations in East Jerusalem."
"Furthermore, we see even worse evidence today in the exchange of letters between King Hussein of Jordan and Mr Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel."
"That is a very serious development."
"If one reads the correspondence as it has been published in some of the newspapers today, we are heading for something really quite serious."
"I hope Parliament, therefore, can support the resolution when we come forward."
"But this resolution must be well balanced and recognize the fact that there are difficulties on both sides and it is both sides that have eventually to come together and reach agreement."
"Madam President, circumstances dictate that I must first express my condolences, on behalf of this House and my group, to the people of Israel, the families concerned, and the government of the country for the terrible incident on the Jordanian border, which has resulted in the death of several Israeli children."
"And I do so as a friend of Israel and its people, and as a citizen of a country which has indissoluble ties of guilt with that country and its citizens."
"It is precisely for this reason, however, that I wish to make it quite clear that I unreservedly share Parliament's concern and regret at Israel's colonization policy in East Jerusalem, and that I therefore support the demands set out in the joint motion for a resolution."
"I should like to take this opportunity to say something personal, as a Christian and a theologian."
"Jerusalem is the city of three world religions, and Judaism undoubtedly lies at the root of them all, but I wish to say that the Jerusalem of the twentieth century and, I believe, of future centuries will remain the city of Yad Vashem, the city of remembrance of the most systematically planned and executed attempt at genocide in the history of mankind."
"Clearly, therefore, this city must possess a special moral authority within the international community."
"However, this moral authority also has political implications, and I would therefore call on the Israeli Government to consider whether its colonization policy in East Jerusalem is in keeping with the moral authority which - for the reasons I have given - this city undoubtedly enjoys within the international community."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Israeli government's decision to create a new settlement in the Arab sector of Jerusalem has regrettably given rise to a deterioration in the Middle East peace process, and we are currently at a delicate and difficult stage."
"Like the rest of the European Union's institutions, this House has repeatedly demonstrated its support for dialogue and peace."
"Therefore, given our responsibilities as a player on the international scene, this Parliament must urge the parties involved to refrain from taking steps which might lead to an erosion of the confidence needed to pursue the application of the agreements and not to prejudice the result of negotiations regarding the permanent status of Palestine, particularly when, as recently as 24 February last, the European Union signed a provisional association agreement with the Palestine National Authority in which an evaluation is given of the special legal position of the Palestine Authority together with a provisional period identical to the transitional period of autonomy set by the Oslo Peace Agreements."
"Our principal concern in the European Parliament, as we have repeatedly demonstrated in this House, must be and has always been the achievement of a lasting and stable peace in the region."
"An essential condition for the achievement of peace in the region is strict application of the spirit which prevailed in Oslo, given that dialogue is the only way in which to arrive at a peaceful solution."
"On very many occasions the European Union has condemned the settlements in the occupied territories as being illegal under international law, and they constitute a major obstacle to peace."
"We have to bear in mind that this decision affects not only political interests, but also human interests - the interests of those citizens who feel themselves under siege and denied the right to free movement in order to carry on the activities of their everyday lives and, principally, to gain access to their place of work."
"Dialogue and cooperation between the parties to the Oslo Agreements are, I say again, the only ways in which potential conflict in the region can be resolved."
"I would like to conclude by calling upon Mr Arafat and Mr Netanyahu to allow wisdom to prevail and to have recourse to negotiation as opposed to confrontation, for the benefit of their peoples."
"Madam President, what is happening at the moment is extremely depressing."
"Israeli children have been killed visiting a peace project in Jordan, and Israel's plans to build a new development have put further pressure on the peace process."
"There should be no building work, no new intifada by the Palestinians and no declaration of a Palestinian State, since these all undermine the agreements."
"With your permission, I should like to make one or two personal comments on the subject of Jerusalem."
"East Jerusalem was captured as a result of a major external offensive."
"It is a city of great significance to the international community."
"Since 1967, it seems, there has been a broad degree of religious freedom throughout Jerusalem."
"The Bible mentions Jerusalem 811 times, and Jews throughout the ages used to long to live there."
"The Koran, however, makes no mention of Jerusalem."
"The Jerusalem question, as I have maintained right from the outset, is a matter for the Israelis and the Palestinians."
"Last month, we saw both groups working very positively with each other on two occasions here in Parliament."
"Outside intervention serves no purpose: they must sort things out for themselves."
"And they will do so, of that I am confident."
"Madam President, the compromise motion that we are in some danger of adopting has several defects."
"The first is inaccuracy."
"Israel could fairly be accused of excessive respect for the Oslo Agreements and of standing by the letter of those agreements, but not of violating them."
"Now, this kind of inaccuracy gives the impression that we favour one faction rather than the other, whereas impartiality is what is needed."
"Not only that, but this one-sided view is combined with dangerous short-sightedness, because developing a fixation with one point of a complex process where there are extremely difficult political equilibria to be respected on both sides is to miss the overall logic and consistency of that process and the difficulties which have to be faced both by the Palestinian leader and by the Israeli Government."
"Madam President, peace is like a great painting: viewed from close up it breaks down into blobs of colour, but the aesthetic dimension requires a longer view, and then we see that there are sometimes areas of shadow that bring three-dimensionality and colour to the whole."
"Madam President, Israel's plans to build a major Jewish district in Jerusalem, Har Homa, are coming under fierce criticism."
"From a psychological point of view, the decision is admittedly not very wise, but in legal terms, there is little that can be said against it."
"The Oslo agreements do not prohibit the development of a residential district such as Har Homa, they simply specify that the legal status of Jerusalem will not be changed without a definitive agreement on the subject between Israel and the Palestinians."
"Building work does not affect the official status of Jerusalem."
"We must also remember that the building plans are not an isolated incident, but mark the continuation of the policy of successive Israeli governments to surround East Jerusalem with a ring of Jewish districts."
"The background to this decision is the fact that during the Six-Day War in 1967, West Jerusalem was bombarded from the surrounding hills."
"We must also remember that the view is still widely held in Israel that Jerusalem will always be the indivisible capital of the State of Israel."
"After the initial optimism regarding the Hebron agreement, the peace process appears to have ground to a halt."
"However, the very fact that the agreement was reached made it clear that the Netanyahu government was able to overcome the divisions of opinion in Israel about the peace process."
"It was adopted by a surprisingly large majority of 87 to 17 in the Knesset, and there were hardly any protests against it."
"But we should not forget how careful the Israeli Government is going to have to be, now that the negotiations with the Palestinians have entered a phase where a number of sensitive issues such as the status of Jerusalem have to be resolved."
"However, there are also more and more developments on the Palestinian side which are presenting problems for the talks with Israel."
"Contrary to the agreement to resolve problems through direct negotiations, the Palestinian authorities took the issue of the building plans straight to the Security Council, and Mr Arafat's calls to liberate Jerusalem and unilaterally to declare a State of Palestine have cast a pall over the conclusion of the Hebron agreement."
"Furthermore, the network of government institutions which the Palestinian authorities are developing in East Jerusalem is actually contrary to the Hebron agreement, and the fact that the process of amending the Palestinian national charter is still not finished is equally unlikely to encourage Israel to trust the Palestinian authorities."
"Outsiders little realize what a difficult predicament Mr Netanyahu and Mr Arafat are in, both in terms of their relations with each other and with regard to their own people."
"This being the case, other parties should act with restraint."
"It is not likely to help the peace process if the European Parliament constantly interferes in the incidents which regularly occur between Israel and the Palestinians."
"Madam President, I should briefly like to ask the House to consider what would have happened if this incident had occurred a few years ago."
"We can indeed see from the prudent reaction of the Israeli Government, which declared from the outset that this was an isolated act, that we have moved a considerable way forward."
"Secondly, nowhere does it say in the Oslo Agreements that development in a city with a population of 600 000 must be stopped for several decades; nor does it say that houses can only be built for Israelis, and not Palestinians."
"Thirdly, I would ask the House to recall its fears when the present government was elected and to consider the progress which has since been made."
"We should be highlighting that progress instead of always pointing an accusing finger, not least since the Knesset has so far refrained from criticizing us in the European Union for possible failures in our own area."
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Commission fully supports the declaration issued by the presidency of the Union and its Council of Ministers on the very day the Israeli government approved the plans for the building of a new settlement in East Jerusalem."
"The Commission regards the settlements in the occupied territories as contrary to international law and as constituting an extremely grave obstacle to the peace process."
"The European Union's position regarding the status of Jerusalem is clear and unambiguous: East Jerusalem is covered by the principles of Security Council Resolution 242 in that the acquisition of territory through the use of force is prohibited."
"The Union, therefore, cannot and must not agree to East Jerusalem being regarded as part of the territory and sovereignty of the State of Israel."
"The Israeli/Palestinian peace agreements explicitly prohibit the building of settlements inside or outside Jerusalem."
"In addition, the Union is of the opinion that the fourth Geneva Convention fully applies both in East Jerusalem and in the occupied territories."
"The Council of Ministers and the Commission therefore consider the Israeli government's decision as particularly negative and unjustified at a time when the peace process was beginning to pick up again on account of a series of positive steps, such as the agreement regarding the Hebron protocol, the release of Palestinian female prisoners and an increase in the number of Palestinian workers with permits to enter Israel."
"I can confirm that the peace process is at a very delicate stage and tension must be reduced. Naturally, the European Commission condemns the dreadful incidents of this morning on the border with Jordan and the regrettable deaths of a group of schoolgirls."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0191/97 by Mr Cars and Mr La Malfa, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on Kosovo; -B4-0228/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on Kosovo; -B4-0263/97 by Mrs Lenz and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on Kosovo; -B4-0190/97 by Mr Bertens and others, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on human rights violations in Argentina; -B4-0247/97 by Mrs Miranda de Lage and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the situation of the Mapuche people in the province of Neuquén in Argentina; -B4-0250/97 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the situation of human rights and the Mapuche Indians in Argentina; -B4-0260/97 by Mrs Aelvoet and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the situation of human rights and the Mapuche Indians in Argentina; -B4-0262/97 by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party, on the situation of the Mapuche people in the province of Neuquén, Argentina; -B4-0201/97 by Mrs Fouque, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on women's rights and democracy in Algeria, Turkey and Afghanistan and International Women's Day; -B4-0235/97 by Mrs Leperre-Verrier and Mr Hory, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the detention of two French nationals in Afghanistan and the application of the Sharia; -B4-0249/97 by Mrs Sornosa Martínez and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the violation of women's rights; -B4-0259/97 by Mrs van Dijk and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on International Women's Day and the violations of women's rights; -B4-0252/97 by Mrs Pailler and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the release of Leyla Zana; -B4-0194/97 by Mr Papakyriazis and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the extradition and trial of A. Brunner; -B4-0192/97 by Mr Ford, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the welfare of migrants; -B4-0230/97 by Mrs Roth, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the death of asylum seekers in the Mediterranean."
"Kosovo"
"Madam President, this debate on Kosovo is to some extent the continuation of yesterday's debate on Albania."
"In fact on that occasion many speakers made it clear that the crisis in Albania could explode throughout the Balkans, particularly in the areas where there is a significant Albanian minority, like Kosovo and Macedonia."
"We must reiterate that the Serbian government is pursuing serious and unacceptable repression against the Albanian community of Kosovo and that Community is really experiencing major tension and pressure at the moment."
"In fact, although the confrontation in Serbia, which is important for democracy, has fortunately been nonviolent, one repercussion has been an increase in repression against the Albanian people of Kosovo, and what has happened in Albania encourages the tendency to have recourse to arms."
"Fortunately the Albanian people of Kosovo have so far preferred to use non-violent methods of passive resistance under the guidance of the leader of the Kosovo Democratic League, Ibrahim Rugova."
"But can we expect a situation like that to last for long?"
"It is obvious that such tension can have serious repercussions."
"That is why we support action to promote dialogue with the Belgrade government, create the bases for reconstruction of society, and make it possible to open a European Union delegation in Pristina."
"Madam President, Kosovo is not an unfamiliar subject in the House."
"It has long been a powder keg, and we have drawn attention to this repeatedly."
"The easing of the situation in Serbia - if one can call it that - has brought Kosovo back towards centre stage, and that is a good thing."
"The people there are becoming impatient."
"There is the threat of assassinations by the Kosovo Liberation Army and these cannot be ruled out, even though the leader of the Democratic League is continuing to seek a peaceful solution."
"This motion for a resolution also relates to another matter, however, which really cannot be passed over in silence: the conditions in the prisons, which are leading to torture and death, consequences which a delegation from our Parliament has been able to see for itself."
"In our motion, we are therefore renewing our call for the release of the prisoners, for freedom of the media, and for the start of a genuine dialogue, with a view to finding a solution for the people of Kosovo who have long been subject to repression."
"We are calling on the Serbian Government finally to open the office in Pristina for which we have long been asking and which has already been agreed to by the Commission - and as the UN special rapporteur, our colleague Mrs Rehn, has also requested - to show the people that the European Union is standing by them."
"I believe that we should be exerting a great deal more pressure here, in order to make Europe's stance in Kosovo really clear."
"Madam President, two factors have changed the situation for the Kosovo Albanians: one is the increasing Serbian oppression, the other the Albanian resistance movement which has now started to execute all those they call collaborators."
"The result is that Albanians are caught in the cross-fire from at least two directions."
"Another event that most likely will be of consequence to the Kosovo Albanians, although we do not yet know in what way, are the open confrontations and the skirmishes occurring in Albania which is now one of the trouble spots in Europe."
"Today's debate and our resolution is really a manifestation of Parliament's wish for the Council of Ministers and the Commission to act."
"First of all, we would like to call a conference to discuss the situation in Kosova."
"We are looking for analysis units in the treaty which hopefully will be agreed in Amsterdam."
"Such a conference may not solve all problems but will demonstrate a desire to analyse the matter better and to find a reasonable solution for Kosova."
"Madam President, I can basically endorse what was said by Mrs Lenz, although I must correct one thing."
"There is not just a threat of assassinations, they have in fact been carried out, which means that this form of violence has taken place alongside the violence on the Serbian side, in the prisons and so on. So the first thing we must call for is certainly that this violence should come to an end."
"But Mrs Lenz was right to say that Kosovo is a powder keg, and we also have to realize that the Kosovo question can only be solved within the context of the overall situation in Yugoslavia."
"I should therefore briefly like to mention the following five points, which seem particularly important to me and to our group."
"Firstly, there must be fair and transparent elections, in other words the elections which take place must really offer every person, every party and every section of the population the chance to present their programme and their candidates."
"Secondly, there must be media laws, but above all media practices too - and this was brought home to us on our visit to Yugoslavia - which correspond to freedom of the media."
"It must also actually be possible for human rights abuses, whether in Kosovo or other areas, to be described publicly and discussed, because there are many citizens who know nothing at all about these, since such matters are concealed from them in many cases or across the board."
"Thirdly, the European Union and above all its cities and regions must support the new municipal authorities, thereby signalling that this new democracy also has Europe's full support."
"Fourthly, there must of course be full recognition of human rights, in particular the minority rights of all groups."
"In this context, I would very much refer to the Hungarian minority."
"Lastly, a real solution must be found to the problem in Kosovo."
"It is important here to make it clear to all sides: stop the violence, take part in talks, and find a solution within Yugoslavia."
"If we are talking here about holding a conference, then all the factions must be prepared to engage in dialogue, and the European Union needs to spell it out to all of them that this dialogue must take place inside Yugoslavia."
"We can provide help from outside, but the solution to the problems must be found in Yugoslavia itself."
"Madam President, since we are talking about Kosovo, I would like to make a few things clear."
"I should not dream of questioning the merits - even the excellence - of the intentions underlying this motion for a resolution, nor of underestimating the gravity of the events taking place in Kosovo because of the two communities living there."
"There are four reasons why I personally felt I could not endorse this motion."
"First, if words have any meaning, it seems to me inappropriate to refer, as this motion does, to apartheid in connection with Kosovo."
"Secondly, I also regard it as inappropriate to exacerbate the ethnic divide by calling for support for Albanian civil society only, whereas it is the entire civilian population in the region that deserves aid and consideration."
"Thirdly, our attention is constantly being caught by thousands of human rights violations throughout the world."
"Yet always, obsessively, prompted by those who regard it as literally a crusade, Parliament comes back to condemnations of Serbia."
"I am not aware that our past resolutions have had any pacifying effect in the Balkans."
"Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, amid countless difficulties, a democratic dialogue seems to be taking place in Belgrade."
"Is this any time to obstruct that dialogue and fan the flames of anti-European paranoia in Serbia?"
"Let us not forget that the day will come when we will have to integrate Yugoslavia into Europe."
"Argentina"
"Madam President, this debate should be looking not just at the problems of the native peoples of Argentina, but at the problems of the entire population."
"The native population does of course deserve our attention."
"Half a million people are being deprived of the land on which they live, and speculators are pushing them out even further."
"This must be stopped, of course, and it is an issue that should be broached in the Union's contacts with Mercosur."
"But we must not just consider the native peoples."
"Argentina is still carrying the burden of the past, and the legal authorities are still refusing to cooperate fully in investigating all the disappearances during the junta years."
"Those who stand up for justice face intimidation and opposition."
"The famous 'mothers of the Plaza de Mayo' , the symbol of Argentina's legacy, still do not really know what happened to their children, and they too are being hampered in their quest."
"Democracy and freedom of expression are still being covertly undermined in today's Argentina."
"Critical journalists have even been killed and newspapers gagged."
"Democratic activists have been murdered, and the situation is deteriorating, but the authorities refuse to acknowledge the facts."
"Human rights violations must be punished, even those committed by members of the armed forces: they must accept this in Argentina, otherwise there can never be a proper feeling of democracy in the country."
"The Union's representatives must draw the Argentine Government's attention to these issues."
"Democracy and respect for human rights are the foundations on which relations between the Union and third countries are based, including Argentina."
"Madam President, the European Union bases bilateral cooperation on respect for human rights."
"The conditionality clauses appearing in the texts of agreements with Latin America have served to consolidate democratic systems and also - and this is a fundamental aspect - to help guarantee the freedoms and rights of citizens."
"These conditionality clauses are quite distinct in their philosophy from certification procedures and are, on the eve of the new millennium, the most positive contribution being made, in the context of globalization, to humanize international relations and the expansion of democracy."
"If this House is on occasion critical of situations where there are abuses, shortfalls or breaches, such criticism must be understood as a positive contribution aimed at strengthening democracies and defending the weakest against injustice and inequality."
"The resolution we are debating today on the problems facing the Mapuche communities aims to make a positive contribution in helping to resolve an acknowledged conflict because, if this conflict did not exist, the Pulmari Interstate Corporation set up a few years ago would not exist either."
"The shortfalls detected in this corporation's system of management, the judicial processes open to indigenous leaders and the departure from set objectives through errors in interpretation have given rise to deep concern in social sectors and the Argentine Parliament itself has heard voices raised in favour of amending the regulations governing the corporation."
"Lastly, and within the general context of the defence of the human rights and freedoms of all Argentine citizens, we call upon the authorities to remain active and vigilant."
"Our Parliament awarded the Sakharov prize to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and maintains close cooperational links with that group of women, the majority of them now old ladies, who are history's record of a time of madness which left thousands of victims and much pain and grief in its wake."
"Harmony in Argentine society is being achieved with difficulty but with tenacity."
"The problem is not solved by attempting to deny that there are, on occasion, attacks which are, without doubt, perpetrated by minority groups unwilling to accept a pluralistic democracy in which all citizens have a role to play."
"Nor is it solved by limiting constitutional guarantees."
"Therefore, Madam President, our Group will be supporting each and every one of the paragraphs of this resolution."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, we are all aware of the political will behind your call for the conditions of the clauses in defence of human rights to be complied with when agreements with the Mercosur countries or the one with the Argentine are signed and we condemn once again the three human rights violations already denounced here."
"These are the death of a journalist, José Luis Cabezas, in January, when the death of Salvador Aguirre, a defender of human rights, remains unpunished, and there was an attempt to assassinate a friend of his."
"We condemn the expulsion of the Mapuche Indians and also the threads made to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo."
"In my opinion, the Commission is in a position to demand the following of the Argentine government: firstly, that the lands, regarding which such suspicion persists, should be returned to the Mapuche indigenous peoples; secondly, that an investigation be started to ascertain the nature of the threats against the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo; and, thirdly, that crime should not go unpunished in Latin America."
"What I mean is that if a photo-journalist is assassinated and the murder of a defender of human rights remains unpunished, I am convinced, Mr Commissioner, that you have in your hands the power to put pressure on the Argentine government."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the treatment of the Mapuche in Pulmari by the Argentine Government is illegal and marked by shameful corruption."
"It deserves our condemnation, and the fact that this has turned out so weakly in the resolution is only because of the appeasing influence of the PPE Group."
"We are concerned about the Mapuche, and we are also deeply disturbed at another sign of growing repression in Argentina."
"This involves the press."
"In the past, the press has played a crucial role in this country."
"I would remind the House of how it revealed the terrible human rights abuses by the armed forces during the military dictatorship, or how it shed light on the scandalous corrupt practices of Argentine politicians and officials."
"I am thinking of how it reported on revolts against the government's disastrous economic policy in several provinces of the country, or how it has supported the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who are constantly under threat."
"The precondition for all this is freedom of the press."
"But that is now in jeopardy."
"On 25 January, the photojournalist José Luis Cabezas was killed because he was trying to shed light on the dark and criminal machinations of certain politicians."
"We condemn that, and I hope that when President Menem visits Brussels in the coming months, he will clarify these events for us."
"Madam President, I would say to Mr Telkämper that there is a difference between lecturing people in a positive and a negative way."
"The relations between Europe and Argentina are undoubtedly among the closest that exist between continents, and that is also why every word we say here is interpreted very sensitively in Argentina."
"If we are devoting this resolution chiefly to the indigenous peoples, whose very existence had previously been denied, then I would say that in our view that is an entirely good and sensible thing."
"It will therefore also have the support of my group."
"However, I do not believe that the situation in Argentina is as disastrous as Mr Bertens also portrayed it, but precisely because we are Europeans, because we have many political groups here, we have to exercise a proper influence and actually talk to the Argentines about these matters."
"Of course the murder of a journalist is a terrible thing."
"Of course it is right to discuss such things as the threats to the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo - who incidentally are here nearly every month, and hold talks with us."
"My group will only be requesting a separate vote on this paragraph because we do not think it is right in terms of the methodology of the resolution."
"But the resolution will certainly have our support."
"Women's rights in the world"
"Mr President, this part-session opened with President Gil-Robles' timely and much appreciated speech on International Women's Day and, a few hours from its close, we turn to the issue of women's rights, focussing our attention on women in countries which do not belong to the European Union."
"The European Parliament and the European Union renewed their commitment to them in the debate and resolution passed after the Peking Conference, and the Commission and Parliament have referred to them in the programmes and initiatives in progress."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, we are speaking of women who suffer particular violence linked to the customs of their countries, and, with all due respect to the cultures of those countries, the European Union should contribute to eradicating that violence: I refer to sexual mutilation of such humiliating cruelty that it is difficult to describe; women and children beaten, raped, forced into prostitution and even starved."
"Those of you who took part in the meeting yesterday in this Parliament on women refugees' right to health were horrified to hear that women and their children in concentration camps are at direct risk dying of hunger because those who distribute the food - and they are always men - refuse to recognize them as heads of families. Women are suffering the violence of fundamentalist interpretation of their own religion."
"As we commemmorate and celebrate International Women's Day, we should be thinking of our less fortunate sisters with reaffirmed commitment."
"The suffering and outrage faced by those women goes far beyond any discrimination and difficulties we European still have to bear on the eve of the third millenium, and we must condemn that and take urgent action against it."
"Madam President, wherever it occurs in the world, fanaticism - religious or nationalist - leads to human rights violations and in particular to violations of women's rights."
"That is no exaggeration, as we can see from the UN statistics which show that the overwhelming majority of victims of human rights violations are women and children."
"Wars and other nationalist or religious conflicts very often lead to the subconscious or conscious suppression of women."
"Women are ordered to do certain things, but are prohibited from doing others."
"Women must not go onto the streets, women must not receive an education, women must not work, but women must ensure that their men are well looked after."
"They are raped and abused and even sexually mutilated."
"And all this is often perpetuated by those in power."
"A number of things need to be done as a matter of urgency."
"Women's rights need to be put higher on the agenda in the Union's and the Member States' international and bilateral relations with countries where these kinds of things occur."
"The right to asylum on the grounds of sexual persecution must be recognized, as a vital step towards ridding the world of this problem."
"We must work very hard, both here and outside the Union, to have the sexual mutilation of women banned."
"That is why it is vital for the UN Human Rights Commission to appoint a special observer to monitor cases of sexual mutilation, so that we can have a clearer picture of what is happening and actually do something about it."
"Madam President, a day devoted to women's rights is all very well, but it would be even better if we had any certainty that the European Union would fight all the year round for women's interests, in Europe and elsewhere."
"Because, as we know, women are the primary victims of human rights violations, in breach, incidentally, of all international conventions."
"So we have a duty to take action to put an end to this discrimination."
"Another subject of concern is sexual mutilation."
"UNICEF puts the number of female victims of this, worldwide, at 130 million - an enormous figure, and all the more appalling in that it is still rising."
"So, contrary to the sometimes deceptive impression that women are becoming better integrated politically, economically and socially, not only is their status not progressing, or not yet progressing sufficiently, but in some cases it is regressing, and to an alarming extent."
"First, we must be concerned by the proliferation of these Islamic fundamentalist movements which are reducing women to the status of minors."
"In this respect, the situation of women in Afghanistan seems to me particularly detestable."
"The Taleban who came to power a few months ago are forbidding them, in the name of the Sharia, to work, to speak in public or to participate in public demonstrations."
"The wearing of the veil is obligatory, and adulterous women are stoned, as in the Middle Ages."
"So we must react firmly, condemning such activities of course, but also withdrawing all forms of co-operation with Afghanistan until such time as the basic rights of its citizens are once again respected."
"Also, the European Union must fight for the immediate, unconditional release of Frédéric Michel and José Daniel Llorente, two French citizens employed by ACF, who were arbitrarily arrested and imprisoned simply for having lunched with some sixty Afghan women."
"We cannot tolerate this kind of arbitrary action, or the terror tactics used against these women."
"Madam President, a good many points have already been made here with which I entirely agree."
"I shall therefore not repeat them all now."
"I think that in Afghanistan, there is the worst official repression of women that we are currently aware of in the world as an official policy."
"However, this topic is also dealt with in the other resolution marking International Women's Day."
"It cannot be made clear often enough how vulnerable women's rights still are in many countries."
"The world women's conference in Beijing is over."
"Europe should now be in the very front rank of those helping to put into effect the decisions that were secured with great difficulty, in other words to campaign against the trade in women, girls and children, to combat prostitution, child labour and sexual mutilation in traditional societies of a kind that we still see to some extent in Europe, for the most part among emigrants."
"Once they have left the family unit, perhaps expelled from it, women are often regarded as fair game, and it is almost inconceivable in our emancipated society how they can be pursued."
"However, we do need a cautious approach to help us win these women over to our side, because a society can only change from within."
"But we must support this in our contacts with governments, and I hope that Commissioner Marín will do this in particular, since he was once responsible for women's issues here in the European Parliament, in his dealings with the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Madam President, we should be hanging our heads in shame that, today, in March 1997, it is necessary to reiterate firmly that the rights of women and of minors (especially minors) are an inalienable, integral and inseparable part of universal human rights."
"This only reveals that women and minors are still not yet universally considered to be human beings."
"This is just point 1 of our motion for a resolution."
"I agree with the reiteration and the firmness, but at the same time I wanted to share with you the shame that I feel."
"The preamble to this motion did not paint a full picture."
"There is a lot missing, in particular on the social front, in what is independent from religious options and cultural atavism and what results from considering others, of either sex, as bearers of merchandise to be exploited."
"Therefore, fortunately, this is just a rather weak show which justifies indignation as well as shame."
"Equally vehemently, I would like to express solidarity and condemnations of what we are going to approve."
"Not as an act of relieving my conscience but - also! - as a reaffirmation of a determination to fight."
"In a practical way."
"On a day-to-day basis."
"Leyla Zana"
"Madam President, fourteen months after being awarded the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize, Leyla Zana is still being held prisoner in Ankara, together with three other Kurdish Members of Parliament, for having, in her capacity as an MP, asserted the Kurds' right to their culture."
"Leyla would not forgive us, today, for simply referring to her prize and her detention in a spirit of sentimentality."
"After meeting her in prison in Ankara and at the time of her trial, I still remember a young woman of incredible strength and determination."
"Her struggle is our struggle - the struggle for respect for democracy and universal rights."
"Today, she is in prison, and we in the European Parliament can do nothing about it."
"We voted - though my group did not - for customs union."
"Although I didn't vote for it, I did want to believe in it."
"Today, though, we have to acknowledge - with great reluctance - that we were right."
"Because from that time onwards violations of human rights in Turkey have escalated."
"Today, I am no longer able to visit Leyla Zana, as I used to do before customs union."
"We have frozen the agreements, which of course increases the problems faced by the Turks, and human rights are still being treated with contempt in that country - a country which we like to see as being close to Europe but whose government makes no concessions and laughs at Europe."
"Let me end by allowing Leyla Zana to speak for herself, in the words she used to me when I visited her in prison in Ankara. 'I am a Kurd and I am defending my identity."
"I believe the role of women is very important."
"As a woman and as a Kurd, I want this bloodbath to end."
"I want it all to end."
"My struggle for human rights will advance the cause of democracy in Turkey."
"I am clear-thinking, and a price has to be paid for that today."
"I am here for the Kurds, and for the Turks as well.'"
"And I should add that she is there for us, to show us what the dignity of democracy means."
"Madam President, the imprisonment of Mrs Leyla Zana epitomizes Turkey's failure to respect freedom of expression."
"She has not committed any terrorist crimes, she only said what she thought."
"At present, there are three countries which are holding their own Sacharov prize-winners in prison: Turkey, Burma and China."
"This puts Turkey, a European country with which we have signed a customs union and maintain close relations, and which is a member of the Council of Europe, in exclusive company."
"When is this country going to keep the promises it made to the Union, or at least to the European Parliament when it voted in favour of the customs union?"
"Four of the six Kurdish members of parliament are still in prison, and should be released immediately."
"If Mrs Ciller meant what she said at the beginning of this week about improving human rights in her country, she should start by freeing these four members of parliament and, of course, Mrs Zana."
"As a way of solving a problem, imprisoning members of parliament is the most counterproductive."
"The Turkish Government must be persuaded to begin talks with the democratic Kurdish organizations."
"This is the only way to reach a permanent solution, and the only way in which we can hope to cooperate successfully with Turkey - which is, after all, a European country."
"Alois Brunner"
"Madam President, in this Chamber on 30 January, a few days ago, we debated and voted on what was in my opinion a fundamental declaration on racism, xenophobia and antisemitism, on the opportunity of 1997 - the year against racism."
"In 1995 we paid tribute to the 50 years since the Holocaust. However, today we see the recurrence of some effort to tarnish the memory of the victims and deny that the genocide ever took place."
"My compatriots, my Jewish fellow-citizens in Thessaloniki, paid a heavy price in blood during the Holocaust, and one name stands out in connection with the annihilation of Thessaloniki Jews, the name of Alois Brunner."
"Recently, articles in the international press have repeated that the war criminal Brunner is still living, and is in hiding in Syria."
"The motion which I have the honour to present today on behalf of my political group, asks the Council of the European Union to take specific and energetic action to expose and prosecute Brunner."
"Because crimes against humanity cannot be forgotten, and we here must be certain that no war criminal will remain unpunished."
"That is the highest symbolism, the vigilance and the sense that we attribute to the year against racism, xenophobia and antisemitism."
"Madam President, the personal history of Alois Brunner is a history stained with the blood of innocent people, Jews from Thessaloniki and victims of racism."
"It is one more instance of the psychopathy of the Second World War criminals."
"While nothing can bring back lost lives, the dispensing of justice is a historical imperative and helps to heal the wounds created by the personal history of Alois Brunner."
"For that reason, Alois Brunner must be found, exposed, condemned and punished as an example."
"You have before you a motion which the European People's Party supports and calls on you to vote for."
"Madam President, the question of whether there is any point in having urgent resolutions is the subject of debate in every committee and working party in the House, but if ever there has been a useful resolution, it is the one tabled by our colleague from the Socialist Group today."
"The subject should have come earlier on the agenda."
"Brunner was an assistant of Eichmann, who was responsible for the deaths of 125 000 people and for the deportation of Jews from Austria, Greece, Yugoslavia and France."
"If Syria is serious about wanting good relations with Europe and showing good will towards the peace process, then it should hand this man over."
"Commissioner Marín, you visit this region often, including Syria."
"I hope that you will make sure that our wishes are delivered to the right address."
"The last known address was 7, rue Hadat, and I expect you to bring a reply back with you."
"Boat people"
"Madam President, this resolution concerns the drowning of 282 immigrants off the coast of Greece on Christmas Day last year."
"This was a crime either of omission or, more likely, of commission, when their boat was deliberately rammed and sunk."
"There has been no major investigation into this crime against humanity; it has disappeared into a judicial black hole, because the authorities in Greece, Italy, Malta and Egypt - all involved in this passage of illegal immigrants - have largely ignored the problem."
"Some of the people who could bear witness to it in fact have been extradited and sent back to India by the Greek authorities and, therefore, are unavailable to provide evidence."
"Unfortunately, this is but one incident of many: in 1993 the human rights organization Amsterdam United estimated that 393 people had died trying to enter the European Union."
"Illegal immigration is illegal immigration, but it does not imply that the death sentence is available."
"What we need and want is coordinated action to track down and prosecute those people engaged in this crime, no matter where they are - whether they are in or outside the European Union."
"We need coordinated action by EUROPOL and by EUROPOL via INTERPOL around the world, because until that happens these crimes will continue to be committed and people will continue to suffer the death sentence for merely wanting to travel to the European Union."
"Madam President, the episode just mentioned by Mr Ford is one of many episodes which unfortunately occur periodically in the Mediterranean and along its shores."
"At the moment there is a criminal racket in illegal transport of migrants, encouraging clandestine immigration."
"This racket is also linked to the racket in illegal labour, employed in domestic service, agriculture and construction, but also unfortunately in prostitution."
"Women and children are particularly subject to this abuse."
"The criminals we are talking about are unscrupulous people and effective action must be taken against them."
"For this reason we ask for an investigation into abuses victimizing clandestine workers. We also ask for maximum respect for the human dignity of these migrants and real determination to deal with those who profit from the difficulties and needs of our neighbour peoples."
"I think this should be put on the agenda for the EuroMediterranean Conference in Malta on 15 and 16 April."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to make a statement of principle: the Group of the European People's Party is in favour of discussing human rights, it is in favour of any violation of human rights being pointed out and punished, and in favour of preventive measures being taken wherever possible to stop such things occurring."
"However, the discussion of human rights should not be misused simply to drag into Parliament topics from the left and generally ideological wing of the House, with the aim of scoring political points here and there on various issues."
"It should not happen in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs, where the left demands such things as the right to health or the right to social security under the heading of 'human rights' , and certainly not as part of the topical and urgent debate."
"We are in favour of human rights abuses being pointed out, of targeting the discussion on that point and focusing on it."
"The PPE Group will therefore be voting against this motion tabled by Mrs Roth and Mr Ford, because it simply seeks to impose on us here in Parliament an ideological debate on migration policy and police cooperation in Europe and beyond, and ultimately threatens to obscure our main concern - and that of the Union - which is to protect human rights."
"I could in fact have cut you off pursuant to Rule 47, Mr Pirker, because you were not speaking on the subject, but engaging in a discussion of principle."
"I was pleased that at the end you did nevertheless use the term human rights, which helped me to avoid making such a decision."
"That brings us to the end of this debate."
"Mr Marín will now speak on behalf of the Commission on all the issues which have featured in the debate."
"(ES) Madam President, I intend to answer all the various points individually. I will attempt to be as brief as possible."
"Firstly, on the subject of Kosovo, the situation there is indeed characterized by serious violations of human rights and ongoing frustration of the legitimate political aspirations of Kosovo Albanians, and it continues to be one of the main sources of concern for the European Union in that region."
"Given the current state of unrest in Albania, there is a risk that this will become a still greater source of destabilization."
"The European Union's position has always been to seek greater autonomy for Kosovo within Yugoslavia's internationally recognized borders."
"It has also urged the Belgrade authorities to begin a dialogue with the Kosovo Albanians in the presence of a third party."
"However, I regret that I have to say that such efforts have still not borne fruit."
"Violation of human rights continues and Belgrade maintains that the status of Kosovo is a purely internal matter. In a similar manner, Belgrade rejects the European Union's request that it also establish a presence in Kosovo."
"Full normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the European Union will be possible only if Belgrade fully respects human rights and the rights of minorities and grants the necessary degree of autonomy."
"The European Union will continue to urge the current and future authorities in Yugoslavia to make progress towards that objective, but it will also have to make it perfectly clear to the Kosovo Albanians that it does not support their claims to independence."
"Genuine democratization in Yugoslavia would facilitate a solution for Kosovo."
"Consequently, the Commission is drawing up a strategy to support democracy, civil society and independent media."
"As regards the Argentine, in recent years the European Commission has generally supported efforts by Latin American countries to establish and consolidate genuine democratic states which have respect for human rights."
"It will therefore continue to monitor the results of efforts on the part of both civil society and the authorities to continue down the road to justice and the full safeguarding of human rights."
"This is an appropriate approach under the terms of both the 1990 bilateral cooperation agreement between the European Union and the Argentine and the more recent agreement signed between the European Union and the Mercosur countries in December 1995, in which it was laid down that one of the common values we share - and upon which our relations must be established - is, in fact, based on respect for human rights."
"During the period from 1990 to 1996, the European Commission financed a series of initiatives aimed at developing and consolidating the rule of law, including respect for human rights, the total amount of this being ECU one million two hundred thousand."
"Amongst other things, support was given to work carried out in connection with the Association of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who have, as you are aware, benefited from Community aid on several occasions, particularly in the form of assistance in identifying their missing children."
"Likewise, we have recently been implementing a very interesting programme in connection with the situation of detainees in Argentine prisons, amounting to a sum of ECU 300, 000."
"I have to say that, in this area, we have found the Argentine authorities to be most open in their approach."
"More specifically, as regards the indigenous Mapuche communities in the Neuquén region, we share the concern of this House and I am able to inform you that the current situation is as follows: the Argentine government has not rejected political dialogue with the European Commission on this matter, quite the contrary; it has accepted a plan under which, on 15 February this year, the Secretariat for Social Development of the Nation has, in agreement with the Governor of Neuquén and the indigenous communities themselves, set up a committee whose task is to propose a resolution to this conflict within 90 days."
"The solution has been a positive one."
"I cannot deny that, naturally, the Argentine authorities immediately submitted to us a project for the economic and social development of this region whereby, perhaps via the economic and financial cooperation chapter, it will be possible to achieve the small advances which, ultimately, if we persist in our efforts, will eventually bear fruit."
"Finally, in connection particularly with the Wiqui Matacos indigenous communities in the northern region of Formosa, I would like to inform you that the Commission has just approved a cooperation programme worth ECU 5.5 million, also in collaboration with the Argentine authorities."
"This means that, independently of the pressure it is possible to apply - to respond to some of your points - it must be acknowledged that the Argentine authorities are cooperating, are allowing us to work and, in the case of the Mapuche people, we have at least entered into a 90-day moratorium period, and, in the case of other minorities, have initiated economic and social development projects which already have concrete form."
"Now, the matter of women and the problematical situation of women in Afghanistan."
"Naturally, the European Commission fully shares the views of the European Parliament and we believe that the extreme interpretation - I would stress the word 'extreme' - of Islamic law by the Talibans is behind the setting-up of this system which so discriminates against women."
"Lastly, there is yet another series of questions relating to the internal situation in Afghanistan where, regardless of the efforts it might be possible to make, it does not appear possible in the short term to work with the Afghan authorities, in political terms, outside the NGOs system owing to the internal situation of that country."
"Consequently, I have little to offer you in the form of a concrete solution and can only join with you in condemning the current situation there."
"As for Leyla Zana, we have, of course, called upon the Turkish authorities a number of times, urging them to make a significant gesture in the case of Leyla Zana and also in the case of other imprisoned DEP elected representatives."
"Some but by no means all have been released, as Mr Bertens has informed us."
"We are still calling for an improvement of the human rights situation and for the country to continue with democratic reforms begun at the end of 1995."
"Such reforms are essential, particularly since the Turkish government is currently putting itself forward as a candidate for full membership of the European Union."
"I am able to tell you that we are aware of the open-minded approach - or at least the announcement of an open-minded approach - on the part of Mrs Çiller in adopting, between now and the end of 1997, a law abolishing remaining obstacles to freedom of speech in Turkey."
"This is good news and a positive step forward."
"We do not believe that all problems can be solved in this way, but this is the kind of thing we want, namely ongoing and continuous development, albeit one step at a time."
"The Commission has also been making representations in connection with the presence of Alois Brunner in Syria, as has the Council of Ministers' troika ."
"What I am able to tell you is that the Syrian government categorically denies that this war criminal is present on Syrian territory."
"There are reports by journalists but, when we requested confirmation at a formal diplomatic level, we were told more than once that this war criminal is not in Syria."
"Be that as it may, the Commission naturally shares the view that war criminals must be detained and put on trial."
"Now for the matter of the boat people spoken about by Mr Ford and other members of this House - of course, this is nothing more than exploitation of citizens from third countries by criminal networks organizing clandestine immigration!"
"We are, of course, aware of this problem and agree that trafficking in human beings and working illegally must be combated and that the clandestine networks involved in the transport of migrants must be brought to justice."
"Now, three points related to this subject: a number of measures have been taken in connection with the specific subject of trade in human beings for the purposes of sexual exploitation."
"In January this year, approval was given to a joint action relating to the typification of the behaviour of traffickers and to improved cooperation between Member States."
"A training programme, the STOP programme, has been organized, the aim of this being the exchange of information and training in the campaign against trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of minors."
"In December 1996, approval was given to a joint action whereby the mandate of the European Drugs Unit was expanded with regard to trafficking in human beings."
"And the Union, the European Drugs Unit, has already commenced work in this field."
"Secondly, on the wider question of the criminal networks organizing illegal immigration there is a regular exchange of information within the corresponding Council Working Group, which is called the Centre for Information, Discussion and Exchange on Crossing of Frontiers and Immigration."
"An attempt is being made to review the entire field of offences relating to illegal immigration."
"Illegal immigration promoted by criminal gangs and by criminal networks is essentially a crime and, although this may appear trivial, we must direct our attack at the very basis of the organization of such networks if we wish to be effective."
"Thirdly, the Council of Ministers has been looking at the problem of illegal working on the part of citizens from third countries and the text approved by the Council of Ministers indicates that illegal trafficking in manpower should be regarded as a crime and be subject to criminal penalties."
"Such penalties must be effective and make it possible to block additional benefits or other advantages accruing to employers."
"The legislative work being done by Member States and the authorities themselves signifies a major change and, therefore, what we are doing -in connection with a subject Mr Ford is sufficiently familiar with - is also to apply the budget line for the campaign against racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism to this subject."
"Attempts are being made - an old debate you took part in many, many years ago - to, in some way, draw up a political response."
"However, I would say again, according to the data available to the Commission, these are criminal networks which must be viewed essentially from the standpoint of control and, naturally, of criminal and judicial repression."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0197/97 by Mr Morris and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the NonProliferation Treaty; -B4-0221/97 by Mr Bertens, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reformist Party, on the Non-Proliferation Treaty; -B4-0229/97 by Mrs Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament, on the revision of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and Nuclear Weapons Convention; -B4-0241/97 by Mr Dell'Alba, on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance, on the Non-Proliferation Treaty; -B4-0253/97 by Mr Alavanos and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Madam President, the development of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, is an enormous threat to the safety of the Union and that of the world."
"The European Union has also played an important role in halting the spread of nuclear weapons and in disarmament."
"As indicated by the Canberra Commission, no one will be entirely safe until all nuclear weapons are destroyed."
"During the nonproliferation conference in 1995 and the inspection conference it was decided to extend the Treaty for an indefinite period."
"Parliament is playing a key role in matters concerning nuclear weapons. This does not mean that the agreement runs without supervision or that there are conditions attached to its extension."
"The Preliminary Committee will meet in New York on the 7-18 of April."
"The work will then begin to bring about a new and effective monitoring of the non-proliferation agreement."
"Each step towards nuclear disarmament is naturally an encouragement for the non-proliferation treaty."
"Article 6 of the Agreement does in fact stipulate that the nuclear powers should disarm their nuclear weapons."
"In our resolution and proposed amendments we have emphasised the importance of the statement from the International Court on the illegality of using nuclear weapons. The Canberra Commission's report on a nuclear free world and the official opinions of the ex-generals and ex-admirals in December 1996 as to the responsibility of the nuclear powers to work in good faith for nuclear disarmament."
"These opinions are important contributions for the realisation of Article 6 of the NPT."
"We would also like to remind you of the U.N. General Assembly's resolution on the launching in 1997 of negotiations leading to a convention on nuclear weapons."
"The resolution asks the Council to present a series of proposals in order to reinforce the NPT and the work of the European Union in conjunction with the NPT conference in New York. These proposals could for example include combined action to be taken jointly to concentrate on the point at issue, the revision of both the agreement and its principles and aims, a new formal system for the reporting of the results achieved and any future proposals for implementing the NPT and finally that the Preliminary Conference in the year 2000 be used only to prepare for the Inspection Conference, so making it possible for the three previous preliminary conferences to discuss the point at issue."
"We request that all Member States immediately ratify the test-ban treaty and act together to persuade other states to do the same."
"Finally, we ask the Member States to support the negotiations starting in 1997 that could result in an agreement on the elimination of all nuclear weapons."
"Madam President, my thanks to Mrs Theorin, who has just expressed my very thoughts on this issue. There are still one or two points I should like to make, however."
"We all wish to see progress on nuclear disarmament, and this is why the forthcoming meeting of the Prepcom in New York is so enormously important."
"The revision of the NPT could give fresh impetus to the whole process of nuclear disarmament, and the Union played an important role in the conclusion of the NPT in 1995."
"The Council must take this new opportunity to bring its considerable influence to bear by speaking with one voice in the negotiations, and by seeking compromises between the two extremes."
"That is why we have urged the Dutch presidency, through Mr van Mierlo, to give this issue its closest attention."
"The Union must make every effort to ensure that the revision conferences are well structured and effective by focusing them on evaluating how far countries keep the promises they make during the international negotiations."
"The first task is therefore to ratify the CTBT and to introduce measures to ensure that it is implemented as widely as possible."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the joint motion for a resolution which has been tabled by six groups contains nothing that we have not been saying for a long time already."
"Parliament is thereby closing its eyes to the latest developments."
"There is no doubt that nuclear weapons are being internationally shunned."
"Maintaining the nuclear threat, let alone planning for a first strike, is now even being rejected by the generals, because it has no strategic advantages but would bring endless suffering to mankind and the environment for generations to come."
"1997 is a year of major steps towards nuclear disarmament."
"At the Clinton-Yeltsin summit, far-reaching proposals on the dismantling of strategic nuclear arsenals will be on the agenda."
"Parliament must insist that France and the United Kingdom take an active and serious part in these disarmament efforts and proposals."
"If it wishes to be credible, Parliament has a responsibility to prevent the Non-Proliferation Treaty from being furtively undermined in the harmonization of the common foreign and security policy."
"It has a responsibility to call for negotiations on disarmament now, and to ensure that the capacity of France and Germany to act is not suddenly Europeanized and furtive talks with Germany or attempts to create de facto situations at the FrancoGerman summit do not become the norm."
"Do you not think, ladies and gentlemen, that it is worth campaigning for a nuclear-free Europe, as a symbol of a Europe which is at peace?"
"Madam President, I think we should be talking about civil nuclear disarmament as well, because according to information published recently in the press there are nuclear power stations that cause pollution only at low tide."
"That's just one example among many."
"In Japan, too, it has been noted just recently that the civil nuclear installations were quite dangerous."
"So I am not going to focus on military applications."
"I am very glad, though, that Commissioner Marín had the patience to stay with us a few minutes longer because when it comes to disarmament an important problem involves bringing in India and Pakistan."
"India, in particular, has a neighbour which is not exactly a shining example of democracy but is powerfully armed: the People's Republic of China, a member of the Security Council and one of the nuclear powers which, broadly speaking, determine the speed of disarmament."
"It is absolutely essential to include India, which has major security problems, including 30, 000 km2 of territory still occupied by the People's Republic of China, and which is in no condition to negotiate and guarantee its security."
"As Mr Marín has responsibility for that part of the world, I hope he will find an opportunity to take some appropriate action."
"Madam President, I would say to the last but one speaker that Germany has no nuclear weapons, does not wish to have any, and will not have them."
"I should just like that to be noted."
"As a member of the Committee on Development, I see with some concern that it seems possible that certain countries are making the possession or development of nuclear weapons into a kind of status symbol, so we do need to look particularly critically at the course of events with regard to the newly industrialized countries."
"We have to rely on the good will of all those who sign such non-proliferation and test ban treaties."
"But we never have any means of ensuring compliance with these treaties."
"I therefore welcome the statement in the joint motion for a resolution that greater efforts are needed in this direction, and that countries must be enabled genuinely to accept agreements of this kind on test bans and non-proliferation."
"Madam President, Enrico Fermi wrote that anyone who is not afraid of nuclear energy is not normal."
"He was implicitly stating that fear is a common heritage and collective fear is therefore normal."
"People want to escape this situation and ask for protection from nuclear fear."
"The means are now available and offered to us by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is strengthened by the agreements already signed on review times and by the disarmament principles and objectives."
"But we are asking the Council to put the necessary pressure on Member States to ratify the treaty preventing nuclear experiments as well, and to intervene with those countries which have not yet complied with the nuclear moratorium, and indeed to provide for possible suspension of existing cooperation agreements."
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, on the eve of the first meeting of the Preparatory Committee in the strengthened review process of the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation Treaty, which will be taking place in New York from 7 to 18 April 1997, I am able to inform you that the Commission is of the understanding that the European Union will do its utmost to play a constructive role at this meeting in order to obtain positive initial results and to put back on the right road, from the very beginning, the new review process of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"With this in mind, the Commission is of the opinion that all the Non-Proliferation Treaty rights and obligations must be reviewed without exception since the Treaty is the cornerstone of the international non-proliferation mechanism."
"The decision adopted in May 1995 on the principles and objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament is an important document for evaluating application of the NonProliferation Treaty and the European Union wishes to take maximum advantage of what is offered by an improvement in the review process."
"As for the specific questions Mr Dupuis put to me, my impression is that, after having accompanied various troikas to the countries you mentioned, I do not, in the short term, envisage any significant movement on the part of any of the parties you mentioned."
"Naturally, however, the European Union's position has been openly presented."
"I am certain, finally, that members of the European Union will take the objective of this resolution into account, since it is virtually along the same lines: when embarking upon the second review process, the objective is to review effectively and without exception all - I repeat - all the rights and obligations deriving from the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
"Naturally, this is a recommendation the European Union will make, but I will not hide from you the fact that debate on this specific question will always be very, very difficult and complex."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions:"
"B4-0200/97 by Mr Apolinário and Mr Colajanni, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the earthquake in Iran and the need for humanitarian aid; -B4-0243/97 by Mr Pasty and Mr Azzolini, on behalf of the Union for Europe Group, on the need for humanitarian aid to the victims of the earthquake in Iran; -B4-0265/97 by Mr Pettinari, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the earthquake in Iran; -B4-0203/97 by Mr Correia and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the storms in the Azores; -B4-0205/97 by Mr Miranda and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, on the floods in Mozambique."
"Earthquake in Iran"
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has taken a firm, clear and determined position to condemn the policy of violating human rights pursued by the Iranian authorities - including the persecution against Salman Rushdie, which are quite obvious successive violations of human rights, which are quite obvious at the Sarqi prison, which are quite obvious in international terrorism, which may be inspired by the Iranian Government."
"However, through this resolution we wish to manifest our solidarity with the people, because our fight, our criticism, is not of population but of the government concerned. We should launch an appeal so that, through humanitarian organisations, we can offer all of the conditions of solidarity to the people themselves who are victims of this recent earthquake."
"Madam President, Mozambique, the Azores and Iran have each suffered from a natural disaster, and I should like to express my own sympathy and that of my group with the families of the victims and those who have suffered."
"It goes without saying that we fully support the aid to be provided there by the Union."
"However, Madam President, I should also like to express my own regret and that of my group at the fact that no agreement has been reached on adding the Algerian situation to the list of emergencies."
"Although this is not a natural disaster where we could bring aid, I do regard terrorism as a disaster, and one which unfortunately certainly exists in Algeria."
"The suppression of freedom of expression, violations of human rights and terrorism are everpresent in Algeria, and I cannot share the optimism of Mr Ataf, whom we heard this morning claiming that the elimination of terrorism is just a matter of time."
"When speaking on this subject previously, I stressed the fact that the press is muzzled in Algeria."
"Well, silence perpetuates oppression."
"The press must be given back its voice, because it is being subjected to fundamentalist violence and governmental pressure."
"Every time the Algerian authorities are accused of human rights violations, they react with indignation."
"There is no doubt about one thing: but for international solidarity, the independent press would long since have disappeared in Algeria."
"In conclusion, Madam President, I deplore the fact that the European Parliament has still not defined any clear position regarding the Algerian problems."
"Observer status at the forthcoming elections would result in increased commitment by the European Union, but, unfortunately, we have not yet been invited to attend."
"I venture to hope that the Algerian Government will review its position and that we shall be able to continue working together calmly and dispassionately."
"You have completely confused me, because you did not speak on any of the subjects on the agenda."
"Storm in the Azores"
"Madam President, last December the Azores were assailed by violent storms which provoked terrible damage especially on the islands of São Miguel, Graciosa and Flores, while the harbour at Punta Delgada and the population of the Povoação district were the worst hit."
"Fortunately there were no deaths."
"But the estimates for the cost to rebuild and repair the damage exceed 13, 000 million escudos."
"If it were not for the prompt action by the Portuguese Government and the Government of the Autonomous Region of the Azores and the solidarity of the communities in the islands, Christmas for these European citizens would have been much sadder."
"The fact that this is an ultra-peripheral region, where people are faced not only with isolation and structural backwardness but also frequent damage caused by storms, means that perhaps now we should set up a special fund aimed at dealing with this type of situation."
"After all, this is not the first time this has happened, and there are even plans in the new guidelines of the Community INTERREG Initiative to cover natural disasters, floods etc."
"On 19 December, I sent a letter to the President of the Commission calling for Community support for the Azores."
"I must thank Mr Santer for his positive reply, which informed me of an extra 26 million ECU to repair public and farming infrastructures on the islands."
"We hope that we will see further signs of this willingness to support the needs of the peoples of the Azores."
"Despite this we have decided to present once again this motion for a resolution whose approval we hope will show European solidarity with the people and the regional government of the Azores and support enshrinement in the Treaty of a special scheme to deal with and help ultra-peripheral regions of the European Union."
"It is not our habit to turn people's suffering into an act of demagoguery."
"At the European Parliament and in the Azores, the reason behind our proposal is to help our fellow-citizens."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I come from the Azores."
"Of course, I did all I could to make sure that this issue should be the subject of the European Parliament resolution."
"This was justified given the extent of the damage done and the need to continue programmed investment."
"I did not succeed in having this put on the agenda of the part-sessions of January or February and these storms took place back in December."
"There are signs that some people seem to think that my position in the Azores was more important than having this resolution passed."
"I therefore resolved to back the initiatives taken by others and back it even though, in this case, the text of the resolution is completely innocuous."
"It is important, very important, that this text should be approved, in the end and despite everything."
"The interests of the people concerned should always come before meaningless one-upmanship."
"I hope that it will be the beginning of a new position in the future, where the people themselves are more important than other issues."
"As for the situation of the Azores, there is a lot to be done."
"We really must get humanitarian aid to the families concerned and it is vital that we add to the support already given."
"Portugal can resort to the Cohesion Fund in order to finance investment in the fields of transport and the environment."
"Inexplicably, to date, since the Cohesion Fund was launched, it has never been used for the Azores."
"Finally, it is fundamental to ensure direct support by the European Union to farmers who have lost their crops."
"And yet there is no proposal on this!"
"Madam President, obviously I am also behind the people of the Azores after what has happened and on this matter we have already presented and formulated a particular type of process, but the reason I am speaking before you today is because of another situation, a recent event which took place in Mozambique."
"This is a situation which has arisen after terrible floods which have had tragic consequences: dozens of dead, some 400, 000 homeless, 25, 000 of whom are trying to find refuge in neighbouring countries, crops destroyed, infrastructures destroyed, problems of a possibility of epidemics, in particular of cholera and malaria, in other words a truly tragic situation, particularly important when we bear in mind that this is a very poor country."
"That is why I am here today and I think we should bear in mind the assessment which has been carried out by the Mozambican Government of damage, something around 30 million US dollars, and therefore I would like to ask the Commission to take action on this matter and also - since the Commission is here, to give us an idea about the possibilities of taking action in this field in general."
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Madam President, regarding Iran, the Commission naturally shares the concern of this House for the victims of the earthquake which struck the province of Ardebil in Northern Iran."
"There have been requests from the humanitarian aid department of the United Nations, the International Federation of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent and we have at this time placed ourselves at the disposal of these organizations, through ECHO, and are offering to do all we can on behalf of the European Union to coordinate aid, above all for the earthquake victims."
"Up to now, we have had no concrete response either from the United Nations, the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, but as soon as one is received, our response will obviously be a positive one."
"As regards the Azores, a first consideration is this: the meteorological system of all Member States is sufficiently advanced and the problem is not predicting major downpours or hurricanes, because you are all well aware that hurricanes, typhoons, periods of extremely cold weather and rain can perfectly well be predicted."
"The problem is that human beings are unable to stand up against nature when it is unleashed and it is therefore impossible to prevent catastrophes which are therefore referred to as natural disasters."
"I can confirm to you that the Commission has already taken a decision to earmark ECU 26 million for the Azores operational programme, within the Community framework of aid for Portugal, which means that de facto solidarity has been established between the metropolitan peninsular area of Portugal and the government of the Azores because, finally, a transfer of internal income from the continental part of the country to the islands is now taking place."
"We believe this is a good and positive step targeted specifically at assisting victims of the disaster."
"As for the floods in Mozambique, our delegation is perfectly up to date with the situation in the regions in central Mozambique affected by the floods."
"The Maputo delegation is in contact with non-governmental organizations present in the region."
"Regarding potential action by the European Union, we will be able to act straight away since we have compensation funds available in Maputo and equipment which can be mobilized immediately to alleviate, in addition, problems which arise for the affected population."
"The only thing both our delegation and ECHO are telling us is that it will be necessary to wait for the waters to recede before a proper evaluation of the situation can be made."
"This is not, therefore, a problem of financial resources - the financial resources exist - but simply one of whether or not it is possible to work out in the field."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m."
"Did you have something further to say, Commissioner?"
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) We have finished ten minutes early."
"I shall therefore now suspend the sitting."
"We shall begin the votes at 5.30 p.m."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.20 p.m. and resumed at 5.30 p.m.)"
"Votes"
"Madam President, I would just like to recommend that the House adopt this amendment, provided that a reference is added to the Committee of Inquiry into the Community transit system, as well as that on BSE."
"I was hoping that the rapporteur would delete the last three words."
"These are guidelines for the 1998 budget and the last three words are: ' and subsequent budgets' ."
"We really should not be voting on those three words."
"It would be far better if those three words were deleted and if the rapporteur could take that on board."
". (DE) I agree with the Socialist Group, Madam President."
"(Applause and isolated heckling) - on paragraph 37"
"Madam President, before we vote on this paragraph, I ask you in your capacity as President to make a decision to declare the end of this paragraph inadmissible."
"The Commission of the European Union is the guardian of the Treaties."
"We can hardly ask it to violate them."
"But we are now asking it to present to us, before the end of this year, a plan for the creation of what is literally a European Foreign Service."
"Indisputably, no provision of the Treaty allows such a service to be set up."
"So this part of the paragraph is not admissible."
"We knew of course that this problem would be raised."
"The services responsible have considered this question and the paragraph is in fact admissible."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to give a very warm welcome to the members of a delegation from the standing committee of the Land of Baden-Württemberg, who are visiting Parliament and have taken their seats in the official gallery."
"I should note that this meeting forms part of the exchanges on European media policy and the exchange of information between our institutions."
"I sincerely hope that this meeting will be a very fruitful one, especially as regards relations between the European Parliament and the regional parliaments of our Union."
"Votes (continuation)"
"The first Tillich report was absolutely unacceptable since the objectives of the Treaties concerning solidarity and economic and social cohesion were completely absent from it."
"Similarly, the principles set out, such as that of subsidiarity, which in practice means translating a rejection of social policies, sent back to national level, and the re-nationalization of common policies, or indiscriminate cuts in all budgetary chapters, were unacceptable."
"Thanks to almost 140 amendments tabled and the excellent work carried out by the Committee on Budgets, we are now faced with a much more sensible, balanced and pro-European report."
"The main reasons which have led me to vote in favour of this report, in its new form, are:"
"the clear and systematic affirmation of the principle of economic and social cohesion; -the elimination of any reference to subsidiarity; -the express consideration that the Structural Funds make an important contribution to strengthening the economies of beneficiary regions and helping Member States to meet the convergence criteria and that the revision of regulations, to be presented by the end of 1998, heads in the direction of rationalisation and increased efficiency; -the condemnation of the negative attitude of the Council in relation to social policy (compulsory approval by unanimity) and the decision to include pilot projects on social exclusion, the elderly, the disabled and families, as well as strengthening activities designed to help with the execution of a sexual equality policy; -the willingness of the European Parliament to make an active contribution to setting up at European level a general policy to combat organised crime; -the importance of making budgetary allowances for the new needs of European citizens and promoting in practice the creation of jobs, both directly and by means of support to small and medium-sized undertakings."
"One of the good things about the Tillich report is that it focuses on a small number of priorities for the 1998 budget."
"The emphasis on helping small and medium-sized firms is particularly welcome, since this is where the greatest potential lies for creating jobs."
"On the other hand, I think it is wrong to include in the priorities a number of youth, education and culture programmes, which are all areas where European policy should not encroach on the Member States' responsibilities."
"The report also rightly criticizes the growing gap between commitments and payments under the Structural Funds."
"The amount of unused appropriations has grown into tens of billions since 1986, and the ceiling for appropriations that was agreed at Edinburgh was manifestly too high."
"Many projects do not meet the Commission's criteria, and there is also the fact that each Member State has to match at least half of the European subsidy provided, so that in years of budget discipline, the system is clearly much less successful."
"The budget amounts should at least be based on realistic expectations."
"Finally, there is agricultural spending, where strict budget discipline is also needed."
"I do not agree with paragraph 10 of the Tillich report, which urges that savings should be made by changing the regulations."
"In 1992, it was decided to have a programme which shifted support from prices to incomes, and this was completed in 1995."
"However, the Union will now have to bear the budgetary consequences of this decision, and direct income support is now a heavier burden on the European budget than price support ever was, as we can see from the enormous increase in spending in the cereals sector."
"Then there are the extra income allowances that were introduced to compensate for lower prices: if these are now to be axed, as the Commission proposed in the prices package for 1997-1998, it will mean reneging on the Commission's earlier promises."
"The report attempts to use the current BSE crisis to justify reducing incomes in the cereals sector, but BSE is a one-off problem, whereas the reduction in the extra income allowances is likely to be permanent."
"All things considered, I decided to vote against this report."
"On the Kittelmann report (A4-0031/97)"
"Ever since antiquity, close cultural and historic ties have existed between Armenia and a number of European countries."
"Also, the existence of large communities of Armenian origin in some Member States, including France, calls for a closer partnership between the European Union and Armenia."
"Armenia, the smallest of the republics making up the former USSR, long since undertook economic and democratic reforms."
"However, in a region as unstable as Transcaucasia, this landlocked country has been exposed to intolerable economic pressure from its neighbours Turkey and Azerbaijan."
"As the rapporteur emphasizes, the economic embargo imposed on Armenia because of the conflict in Nagorny Karabakh must be lifted without fail!"
"Although the growth of the Armenian economy has been facilitated by the cease-fire since May 1994, the political instability of the region is having many adverse effects on the country."
"The new Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Armenia, concluded for a period of ten years, is intended to promote economic and social reforms and the restructuring of the economic and trade systems."
"Hitherto, Armenia has not really been the main concern of the European Union."
"The change of attitude by the Member States thus indicates the dawning of a new period of co-operation between the European Union and Armenia."
"The Greens regard the implementation of the PCA with Armenia at this stage as a serious mistake, and were therefore unable to vote in favour of it."
"We approve of close relations between the EU and Armenia, but Armenia is still in a state of war with Azerbaijan."
"The peace talks are not making progress."
"The OSCE's call for the moves towards a peaceful settlement to be stepped up - on the basis of OSCE principles and with the key requirement of an autonomous region with the maximum degree of self-government within the internationally recognized borders of Azerbaijan - was not accepted by Armenia."
"The talks on the status of Nagorno-Karabakh have since come to a complete standstill."
"Linking the implementation of the PCA to a peace agreement would not only have given the necessary impetus to the peace negotiations, but possibly also have led to them being swiftly concluded."
"The majority in Parliament has declined to see this opportunity, and has casually loosed its grasp on an important instrument of legislative potential within a CFSP."
"In the draft texts produced by the IGC, Parliament's legislative rights with regard to international agreements should be drastically curtailed."
"Perhaps things have to reach that point for the House to realize how important such apparently minor contributions can be for peace in Europe, and what far-reaching effects they can have."
"The Greens are also critical of the fact that the Council has incorporated a so-called repatriation clause in the text of the PCA, thereby linking economic cooperation to the repatriation of refugees, without the necessary conditions for this existing in the country."
"On the Schwaiger report"
"The Greens regard the implementation of the PCA with Azerbaijan at this stage as a serious mistake, and were therefore unable to vote in favour of it."
"The Green Group approves in principle of a PCA with Azerbaijan, and sees this - if it is implemented on the basis of partnership - as a valuable aid to the conversion process, to the extent that the EU assistance is geared to the real needs of the region and not just provided for reasons of self-interest."
"However, the fact that Azerbaijan is still in a state of war with Armenia and that a front line runs through the middle of the country excludes 20 % of it from participating in the benefits of this aid."
"That is why there must first be a peace agreement with Armenia which includes the lifting of all regional economic blockades."
"This also means, however, that Azerbaijan's interest in an attractive proposal for self-government for Nagorno-Karabakh, on the basis of internationally recognized principles, must be brought to the negotiating table without delay, and the negotiations thereby taken forward."
"Given the dramatic situation of expulsions in Azerbaijan and the absence of a proper rule of law, both in terms of fair jurisdiction and civil rights, the linking of the so-called repatriation clause to the cooperation agreement is both unreasonable and incompatible with the UN convention on refugees."
"The Greens would criticize the Council for creating an unjust form of linkage here, shaped by its own interests in securing demarcation."
"We doubt that things can be dealt with quite so simply when it comes to the settlement of conflicts."
"There is still a broad gulf between intentions and actions in Europe's foreign policy in terms of achieving peace on the continent."
"On the Chesa report"
"Preparation for UN General Assembly Special Session of June 1997"
"The next item is the report (A4-0083/97) by Mrs Dybkjær, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the communication from the Commission entitled: ' a common platform: guidelines for European Union preparation for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session to be held in New York in June 1997 to review Agenda 21 and related outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992' (COM(95)0569 - C4-0656/96)."
"Madam President, just in the last few days, two clear examples from the heart of Europe - Paris and La Hague - have shown that the world is a long way from sustainable development."
"The first example is the warning signals which are now being posted in Paris."
"If the pollution becomes just a little worse, cars will only be allowed on the roads in Paris every other day."
"The second example is the escape of radioactivity at La Hague."
"In other words, we have car pollution on a scale which we used to think was reserved for places such as Mexico City and, at a pinch, Athens, which is after all a long way away - with apologies to Greece."
"The pollution has now struck deep into Europe's central nervous system, just as the escape from the processing of nuclear waste is of a scale which we used to think was reserved for the former Soviet Union."
"It is against this background that we should view today's report, which deals both with how we should put our own house in order and move towards sustainable development, and how we should bring our influence to bear on the international stage."
"Having made these introductory comments, I should like to thank the members of the committee and also the Committee on Development for their work on this subject."
"I am pleased that there has been such a broad measure of agreement on an approach which seeks to tighten up the negotiating proposals put forward by the Council and the Commission."
"Clearly, this gives added weight to the European Parliament, and that is badly needed."
"I was present at Rio in 1992, and I remember well what the atmosphere was like when the conference came to an end."
"There were certainly no wild scenes of jubilation - the results were not far-reaching enough for that - but there was a certain satisfaction at the adoption of Agenda 21, and that sustainable development had thus been put on the global agenda."
"The mere fact that the countries promised each other that they would work positively towards sustainable development was a step forward in itself."
"Now, five years later, we unfortunately have to ask ourselves if the world's leaders had their fingers crossed behind their backs when they delivered their promises."
"As already illustrated by my opening comments, things are still moving in the wrong direction in a number of areas."
"We shall not have to foot the bill for this, but will pass it on to future generations, who will have to pay it with compound interest added."
"It is becoming more and more expensive to achieve sustainable development, the longer we wait to take action."
"The first task of UNGASS must therefore be to make clear the seriousness of the situation and to put sustainable development back at the top of the international agenda."
"At the same time, it should be stressed that we do not need prophets of doom."
"We should recognize the progress which has been made, in spite of everything: no one should be led to think that the task is so great that this is not of any use."
"That only leads to paralysis."
"We should be forward-looking, which means that we should be constructive, purposeful and realistic."
"Ultimately, this is a question of political will, and it is appropriate for us to start by showing some of this ourselves."
"In practical terms, this means that the European Parliament has laid down a limited number of key priorities, which show where we ourselves should take action, where the world must take action in the first instance, and what we therefore expect as regards the final outcome of UNGASS."
"The EU has a very special responsibility which we are not fulfilling at the moment, neither internally nor externally."
"Internally, we are still a long way from sustainable development."
"Clearly, our international negotiating position is weakened if we are unable to put our own house in order."
"We need to tackle this, for example by revising the fifth action programme on the environment."
"Externally, the EU has not supported the developing countries to an adequate extent."
"The other rich countries certainly have not done so either, indeed they are actually worse than us, but that is no excuse."
"It is incredible that only three of the Member States are fulfilling the Brundtland report's recommendation that at least 0.7 % of GNP should be donated in development aid."
"The most important thing for the developing countries, however, is for them to be integrated into the international economy."
"Sustainable development is not only about the environment, as the rich countries might otherwise seem to think."
"It is also about creating reasonable conditions for the developing countries to move forward."
"The aim is to improve the partnership between the rich and poor countries in order to encourage sustainable development."
"Such a partnership can only be successful if we recognize that different parts of the world have different problems."
"In our part of the world, the problem is overconsumption."
"In others, it is called survival."
"If leaders from all over the world are still meeting at these international conferences, it is because there is coming to be an understanding that we live in a world of common fate."
"Our task now in UNGASS is therefore to evaluate, to reassess, to revitalize - speaking more figuratively, to give the process a kick in the pants."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the PPE Group supports the report by Mrs Dybkjær on the subject of sustainable development."
"Unfortunately, the Rio Conference has so far produced very few really positive results."
"This situation has to change, and I am pleased to say that we agree on that here in the House."
"For example, if the production of CO2 continues throughout the world as indicated in the last five years, the result will be an economic, humanitarian and environmental disaster."
"The argument which is often put forward - that the European Union is not in a position to solve this problem throughout the world, because of course we are not responsible for all the CO2 emissions, and there are high rates of increase in India or China, for example - is unacceptable, although it is a comfortable argument if one wishes to do nothing."
"If we, as major industrialized nations, cannot manage to reduce our emissions of CO2 and other harmful substances, then those who are campaigning for environment policy in the newly industrialized and developing countries will have no chance of success."
"We must therefore act as a positive role model, and more should be done in this respect."
"At the same time, however, we must act intelligently."
"I always put it dramatically and say that we do not need to go back to living in caves, but must use modern technology to cut down on CO2 and other harmful substances."
"Only then can we be a real model, because the people in the developing countries would also like to achieve prosperity, and we have to show that - with modern technology - sustainable development, prosperity and conservation of the environment are all possible."
"I believe - and once again this is a very current issue, which was discussed yesterday by the Commission - that fiscal measures are also needed for this purpose."
"The Commission's proposal for an energy tax is a weak one, but it is at least a step in the right direction, and the European Union should at last begin to take some action here!"
"Madam President, the European Union has so far been principally an organisation for trade, economy, markets and competition."
"This is good, but it is now time for environmental issues, social questions and employment to move up on the agenda, partly because this is necessary for world development and partly in order to strengthen our relationship with the general public and to increase their confidence in the EU."
"This is an excellent report and a good example of how these questions can be raised."
"I myself had an opportunity of visiting Rio de Janeiro in 1992 during the U.N. conference on the environment and development."
"I was not in any way representing the Government, but a non-state organisation, Stockholm County Council, plus an environmental organisation called 'the People's Campaign Against Nuclear Power in Sweden' ."
"The whole experience was fantastic and left me with an urge to achieve something positive."
"I believe that the conference was a breakthrough, although mainly in terms of public opinion."
"The actions taken as a result of the conference were however rather poor."
"In many areas the development has in fact gone backwards, some of these areas being the ones raised in Rio; the question about biological diversity and the climate."
"This must be changed!"
"The report reveals many beneficial proposals that must be carried out if we are to produce a credible environment policy for the world around us."
"Let me take up some examples and their positive aspects: Agenda 21 has been introduced by many countries."
"As an example I can mention that this program has been tried by the Swedish communities for every individual citizen to be able to work with environmental questions locally."
"We have accepted Agenda 21 for the Baltic Sea and have made some progress in our work."
"As mentioned in the report, we must also raise the level of our ambitions prior to the conference in New York."
"The EU i.e. our Member States, must also set a good example, so that we at least can fulfil the minimum requirements of the environmental directives which we ourselves have adopted."
"Our concern for the environment must be incorporated in all areas from transport to energy, consumption, trade and the contact with developing countries."
"The proposal for binding international legislation and an environmental court is very good."
"I would also like to emphasise the following things: Alternative fuel, bioenergy instead of nuclear power, extended environmental labelling and manufacturer's product responsibility - all this will simplify environmental choices for the individual person which is the best method of improving the environment."
"The question of a carbon dioxide tax must be resolved and we must also ensure that procurement is carried out with regard to environmental issues by the communities, the county councils and by nations."
"The European Union can become a powerful instrument in pushing forward environmental improvements within the EU and in the world at large."
"This is an excellent report."
"It is now up to us to make this work successfully."
"Madam President, in truth, I am unaccustomed to speaking for four minutes, so I don't know if I will be able to use them up."
"We agree with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, with Mrs Dybkjaer's report and the amendments that other Groups have tabled."
"She herself recommends modifications to her report which also improve the text at the end."
"We are in agreement with some significant aspects of her report."
"Firstly, she states that it is indeed true that there have been positive results since the 1992 Rio Summit, for example the Climate Change Convention and the Biological Biodiversity Convention."
"However, the following is also true, namely that we are further away now from genuine sustainable development than we were in 1992."
"And it is also true that the European Union must take a very active part in the forthcoming United Nations Summit."
"As she herself says, we probably lack the credibility we ought to have, since the objectives the European Union set itself in Rio have not been achieved."
"Perhaps it should be remembered - this is an extremely significant debate taking place within the Committee on the Environment - that it will be very difficult if not impossible to succeed in limiting CO2 emissions at their 1990 level."
"The Commission itself acknowledges that they cannot be limited - they will only increase."
"There is also a call for the environmental aspects to be integrated into the Treaty. This, for us, is a fundamental aspect."
"For many years there have been calls for environmental policy to be common to all European policies: agricultural policy, industrial policy, economic policy, etc., but this is not how things are, integration has not yet been achieved."
"We therefore agree with what the rapporteur says about the need to have specific objectives, to state precisely what these objectives consist of and the fact that there should be a proper plan aimed at achieving them."
"I would not like to end without emphasizing something extremely important in the report which was key to the Rio Summit and is still key today."
"By this, I mean the failure to transfer resources from the developed to the developing world."
"The rapporteur herself quotes figures in her report which are truly illustrative, stating that, in 1990, the richest 20 % of the world's population enjoyed 30 % more income than the poorest 20 % and that, in 1995, this percentage had doubled, the income difference between the poorest and the richest populations being 60 %."
"Therefore, if we do not achieve progress in this direction, it will be very difficult to fulfil the Rio objectives and to renew commitment to them at the forthcoming United Nations Summit."
"In short, I hope that, tomorrow, Mrs Dybkjaer's report will be approved at voting time, because this will constitute a platform document enabling the European Union to adopt a united front at the forthcoming UNGASS Summit, this being the next summit to review, restore order to and give new impetus to the Rio objectives."
"In truth, if we were to look at the contents of Mrs Dybkjaer's report in all its minute detail, we would have to devise a different economic and consumer-oriented model because, if the developed world does not reduce its level of consumption and does not help the developing world increase its own level of consumption to survival levels, it will be very difficult to impart renewed vigour to these objectives."
"I believe that the European Union, together with the Non-Governmental Organizations and local and regional authorities, has to play a fundamental role at the forthcoming United Nations Summit."
"Madam President, the Green Group also congratulates Mrs Dybkjær on her report, which it welcomes."
"In Rio, the industrialized countries accepted the main responsibility for the worldwide environmental crisis and for correcting the ecological mistakes of the past."
"As yet, no action has followed this expression of remorse."
"That point has already been made."
"Environment and development policy is stagnating, and indeed we should actually be talking about a 'roll-back' in environment policy."
"Nor has the EU taken on a pioneering role."
"It gauges its measures not by the scientific need for them, but by the willingness of industry to compromise."
"Of course, the same also applies to the Member States."
"Hence the energy tax in Germany is blocked by the argument that Brussels is responsible for it, and Brussels argues that the responsibility lies with the USA and Japan."
"It is clear to us that the sparkle of Rio has gone."
"Now we can see the reality."
"And the reality is that we have no biodiversity convention, no biosafety protocol and no climate protocol."
"Kyoto is scheduled for December, and we still do not know if we shall succeed in adopting a protocol on climate protection there."
"And we are still miles away from a convention on forests."
"Not even Rio could agree on that."
"We must therefore put the subject of sustainable development back at the top of the world's political agenda."
"The Special Session of the General Assembly in New York must send out some clear political signals, to the effect that implementation of Agenda 21 needs to be binding - too many of its provisions are still optional."
"We really need binding force here, the introduction of minimum social and environmental standards in world trade, a binding framework convention on climate, with a biodiversity convention containing climate and biosafety protocols, and an agreement on the protection of forests."
"I hope that UNGASS succeeds in doing this, because otherwise Rio will have achieved nothing, and we shall be set back years in our discussion of the environment."
"Madam President, I should like to begin by thanking both the Commission and the rapporteur, Mrs Dybkjær, for their very positive efforts towards making a success of the UNGASS conference at the end of June 1997."
"This will be difficult enough, since the enthusiasm for Agenda 21 that was generated in Rio in 1992 is now ebbing away."
"Of course, this is partly because steps are now having to be taken to put sustainable development into practice."
"Targets are having to be set, schedules met and past promises kept."
"In short, the time has come to do battle to reduce environmental damage in both the developed and developing countries."
"This is all taking place against a background of declining interest in the environment and development."
"Other subjects such as unemployment and meeting the EMU criteria are competing for the attention of governments and public alike, and it is obviously difficult to keep attention focused on long-term projects such as environmental protection and development."
"That is why it is so important to give the environment fresh impetus as an issue."
"We need not only a strong and effective policy, but also people, leaders, who are capable of putting it into practice, leaders whose personalities are likely to inspire and who are prepared to persevere in the long term."
"Mrs Brundtland has been doing this for a long time now, and her report made a noticeable difference to people's thinking on sustainable development."
"Now that we have come to the actual implementation of Agenda 21, perseverance will be important."
"Will the main players be able to get to grips with the practical implications of Agenda 21?"
"I think the Commission and the rapporteur have identified a number of good priorities here."
"We certainly need flexible organization within the UN, with better work structures and more money, but the main need is for all countries to show determination in working towards the targets set, particularly on climate policy, for example."
"New York will be a very important preparation for the conference in Kyoto, and the Commission is right to focus on it."
"It is encouraging that the Dutch presidency has succeeded in reaching agreement on the CO2 reduction target for 2010, and although we really need much more than 15 %, at least we now have agreement within the Union."
"We will have to do everything we can to persuade the United States to come up with a percentage target too."
"I think that this form of 'burden-sharing' that we have now developed in Europe could well serve as a model for the rest of the world."
"It is logical for the biggest users to bear the heaviest burden, and since the United States accounts for more or less a quarter of all energy consumption each year, it must have certain obligations towards the rest of the world."
"I sincerely hope that it will take the lead on environmental policy, because otherwise UNGASS will not be a success."
"Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports Mrs Dybkjær's report."
"We are facing the reality that the rich countries have not shown sufficient commitment to the priorities agreed at Rio, either in their own actions or in helping the Third World."
"Species and habitats, especially forests, are still declining across the world and this underlines the pressing need for agreement on a forest convention."
"The Commission's communication is predictably cautious and Europe must take a lead at UNGASS in calling for a more far-reaching programme, in particular to demand binding environmental legislation and targets."
"We should be looking more carefully at the non-compliance issue and the implementation of existing multilateral environment agreements."
"UNGASS is a step on the road to the Climate Change Conference in Kyoto in December and climate change continues to pose an enormous challenge."
"There seems to be little momentum to change the status quo."
"It is essential therefore to push for an agreement on abatement of greenhouse gases and a target for CO2 reductions of 20 % by 2010 with more to follow."
"The only way that we can begin to forge a partnership with poor countries is for ourselves to show a good example so that we in Europe should be working towards this reduction by 2005."
"Vision and leadership are the missing ingredients at the moment to meet the global environmental challenge and we need both of these at both of these conferences."
"Finally, the European Parliament must formally be associated with the European Union delegation to these conferences and I look forward to a commitment on that from the Commission."
"Mr President, it has taken five years for many of those who criticized the organization, development and results of the Rio Conference in 1992, who even went as far as organizing a parallel meeting, to now recognize that the objectives and items that were approved at Rio continue to be a reference point, a very important reference point for future decades."
"I had the honour of representing this House at the Rio Summit and I am pleased that there is this convergence and that there is now recognition that it was a landmark in history acknowledging, at world level, that the concepts of sustainable development and environmental protection were complementary and not opposed."
"In my opinion, much more progress has been made than is being acknowledged today in this chamber."
"I pay tribute to the laudable effort Mrs Breyer and other colleagues have put in and to the concern they show. They see everything in fairly black terms."
"My feeling is that we ought also to see the situation somewhat more 'greenly' ."
"There is, however, one topic which causes me concern, because it was a problem at the Rio Conference, namely the European Union's presentation: governments and the European Commission have to come to an agreement to the effect that this joint Commission/Parliament resolution genuinely represents the European Union with a sole voice at the conference."
"This is a call we have to address to all governments."
"I also believe that it is fundamental to insist on the final resolution - there are some essential points."
"One worthy of special consideration must be the request to governments that they strengthen the environmental dimension of their macro-economic policies."
"Another must be giving a higher profile to the considerable problem of trade at world level and of environmental protection, which is another concern of this Parliament. National policies must be consistent with international resolutions."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Dybkjær for her excellent report, even if it does not make pleasant reading."
"A temperature increase of 2ºC by the year 2030, a rise of 50 cm in the world sea level, an alarming fall in the area of rain forest - the unwelcome trends in the environment go on."
"We rejoiced at Rio."
"Today, we are disappointed."
"We have hopes of New York."
"Perhaps this is our last chance."
"We all know that first the forest dies, then the people."
"Climate change is alarming, there is a shortage of fresh water, there is radioactive waste - why do we make no progress, when we are all familiar with everything?"
"In my opinion, a very important point here is the fact that many countries, including a good many in Europe, still believe that economic development and conservation are opposites."
"That is wrong!"
"Conservation creates jobs, it gives fresh impetus to the economy, it is a great challenge for research and technology."
"The Germans invented the social market economy."
"The Austrians - I am proud to say - invented the eco-social market economy."
"This means using the market mechanisms for conservation, it means creating economic incentives to reward environmentally friendly conduct and to punish pollution."
"And it also involves using taxes to exercise control."
"I believe that only the EU will really succeed in providing the necessary political weight for conservation and development aid."
"Only the EU, only the rich countries, only the economically developed nations can really succeed in reconciling the economy and the environment, and in enabling both the economy and the environment to flourish!"
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, the debate in this House today is undoubtedly very opportune, given preparations for the special session."
"I would like to thank Mrs Dybkjaer for the report she has submitted on the subject."
"As you know, last November the Commission approved a communication regarding this matter and the Council approved its conclusions in December. In the intervening six months up to June 1997, account must be taken of all the important preparatory work that is being done."
"With this debate and with your report, Mrs Dybkjaer, Parliament has the opportunity to play a part in defining priorities with a view to the special session, bearing in mind the changes which have occurred."
"Firstly - this is the Commission's opinion - it must be acknowledged that there was no real progress at the Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization last December on subjects relating to commercial exchanges, trade and the environment."
"In addition, as predicted, negotiations regarding a protocol on the Climate Change Convention, establishing binding objectives in the form of a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, are proving, predictably, to be very difficult."
"Lastly, the Intergovernmental Group on forests concluded its deliberations last month without defining recommendations on a whole series of key topics, including the need for a forest convention."
"Obviously, all these topics - commercial exchanges and the environment, climate change and forests - require political impetus at the highest level at the special session."
"The resolution is on target regarding this point and, naturally, the Commission would be delighted to continue conversations with the European Parliament with a view to defining our strategy on the basis of our 1996 communication, which is still our major strategic approach."
"As regards climate change, as a number of members have pointed out, certain decisions have already been taken in the Environment Council which relate to the reduction and quantification of harmful emissions."
"Although the target is 2010, an agreement between Member States has finally been reached."
"It might be thought that progress on reductions could have been made more rapidly, but the fact that an agreement has already been arrived at on this thorny subject at the Council of Ministers is one more step forward."
"In this context, we regard it vital to concentrate on legally binding reductions by 2005, 2010 and 2020."
"The demand formulated in your report, in subparagraph 18 D of your resolution, for a global maximum emissions limit, is interesting, but, to be realistic, you ought to accept that this will in any case be a fairly long-term aim."
"Another very important priority for the special session which the European Commission would like to highlight is the growing scarcity of fresh water and the implications of this for people, agriculture, food security and also poverty."
"Finally, there is another very important matter mentioned in your resolution: the flow of finance to developing countries, sustainable development naturally having to be supported by both public and private development aid."
"This is obviously an important aspect influencing sustainable development which makes it possible, as some of you have stated, to export environmental technology."
"Therefore, as Mr Valverde rightly pointed out, there is no such contradiction between development and environmental protection; there are many complementary aspects and it is important to make progress aimed at increasing this type of capital transfer."
"Admittedly, in overall terms over the last few years, the increase in direct investment in countries in the southern hemisphere has been spectacular, but one has to look at this critically since, although the figure is spectacular in global terms, we can see, if we examine the volume of investment, that what is actually happening is that there is a concentration of such transfers towards so-called emerging regions which are in fact developing very rapidly. This does not reflect reality in all countries, much less in the poorest countries."
"Lastly, I would now like to refer to the Commission's working programme on sustainable development."
"We think that, over the next few years, we ought to define a series of priorities. It is our belief that the limits set in the resolution are appropriate for effective progress."
"Lastly, regarding European Parliament participation, the Commission obviously agrees, as in the past at the Rio Conference, that the European Parliament should participate in the United Nations General Assembly session."
"Mr President, I would like to ask the Commissioner how this institutional participation is envisaged."
"He mentioned that the European Parliament will be represented, but how will the Commission itself be represented and how will matters be coordinated with the Council?"
"Will the Member States have to waive their right to take part on an individual basis and will there be just one spokesman?"
"I ask this because, at the Rio Conference, our role was somewhat uncoordinated."
"Secondly, will we be able to take to this Conference an evaluation of the national plans agreed to by the various governments which signed the Rio Agreements and, above all, Agenda 21?"
"The Commission has given us no information on this aspect."
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Bearing in mind that the Intergovernmental Conference will apparently be able to rationalize this problem, I am able to tell you what the Commission would like."
"Regarding this subject, as regarding all others connected with external relations, the Commission supports the Presidency of the Council/General Secretariat of the Council + Commission system representing the executive part and the management part."
"Then we think that the European Parliament should be represented within the Community delegation as Parliament."
"I believe this is the most rational approach."
"To move on, you mentioned something which could involve us in a potentially lengthy debate."
"At the next Summit, if you will allow me to call it that, it will be very difficult for the European Union to be represented by one party. The EU made a public undertaking at the Rio Summit - as both you and I remember very well - to make available a budget of ECU 2000 million, this being aimed specifically at solving problems arising in connection with the future of the world environment."
"We all know that our Member States were never able to approve such a figure nor even to agree as to the distribution of such an amount."
"We have to recognize this fact."
"Very few States have fulfilled their financial undertakings contained in the Rio Group's decisions."
"In my opinion, what we need now is prudent reflection together with the Council. The next step, naturally, will be to bring up the matter of evaluations of each and every one of the Member States which, I believe, it will be possible to do together with the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"Withdrawal of GSP from Myanmar"
"The next item is the report (A4-0085/97) by Mrs Theorin, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Security and Defence Policy, on the proposals for Council Regulations:"
"I.temporarily withdrawing access to generalized tariff preferences for industrial goods from the Union of Myanmar (COM(96) 0711 - C4-0085/97-96/0317 (CNS)II.temporarily withdrawing access to generalized tariff preferences for agricultural goods from the Union of Myanmar (COM(97) 0058 - C4-0086/97-97/0041 (CNS)"
"Mr President, I welcome the three reports from the Committee on Budgets, the Committee on Development and Co-operation and the Committee on External Economic Relations all of whom support the proposal."
"I am glad to be able to say that the Committee on Foreign Affairs also stand unanimously behind the proposal."
"In December 1994, the European Union and Burma entered into an agreement giving certain industrial products generalised tariff preferences."
"On the 1 January this year, an identical agreement concerning agricultural products came into force."
"The agreements can be revoked at any time in the case of forced labour."
"The definition of forced labour in this connection was defined by the Geneva convention in 1925 and 1956."
"The Commission has on the basis of the complaints about industrial products and agricultural products which in June 1995 and on 1 January 1997 were filed by the European Trade-Union Organisation and the International Free Trade-Union Organisation, carried out an investigation into alleged forced labour in Burma."
"The result of the investigation showed the military regime had made forced labour a frequent occurrence and a demonstrable reality."
"Forced labour means mass deportation of men, women and children in conjunction with the construction of certain infrastructures that often lead to the people forced to work being killed or mutilated."
"The human rights situation in Burma has been of concern to the European Union and the European Parliament for a long time."
"I have in the explanatory statement described the human rights situation in the country."
"The military regime came into power by force in 1988."
"A reasonably free election was allowed in 1990 but the leader of the democratic party, Aung San Suu Kyi, who in 1990 was awarded the Sakharov prize for freedom of thought by the European Parliament, was not able to stand for election."
"She has been under house arrest since 1989."
"The democratic party won the election with an overwhelming majority, but the military regime did not respect the election result and remained in power."
"According to information received, 18 per cent of the elected Members of Parliament are being held as prisoners."
"San Suu Kyi has requested that all foreign investors should pull out of the country which is what Pepsi, Levis, Apple and other companies have done."
"There is strong evidence that human rights are extensively violated, e.g. summary executions, torture, rape and other harassment of women, assault and battery of prisoners, etc."
"In addition, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, religious freedom and mobility are also being severely restricted."
"According to Amnesty, two thousand people are today imprisoned as a result of having demanded human rights reforms and harsh restrictions still apply to Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Amnesty International declared the year 1996 as the worst year this decade for human rights in Burma."
"The European Union is now not alone in reacting to the situation in Burma."
"In USA, a proposed bill has been drawn up for action to be taken against Burma."
"In addition, many companies from both the USA and the EU have now cancelled their investments in the country, in many cases as a result of a consumer boycott and other pressure campaigns."
"However, it is embarrassing to see that certain European companies financially, politically and morally support the military regime by still being involved in projects with the regime."
"Forced labour has been used for building hotels, roads and other infrastructures."
"A large group of Members of the European Parliament has therefore pleaded with Club Med in a letter today to halt its tourist packages to Burma."
"The Commission's proposal to impose specific sanctions against Burma is entirely new in its way and well worth supporting - and we give them our full support."
"This is the first time that the European Union has proposed sanctions against a country that is consciously violating human rights through forced labour."
"I therefore appreciate - even if it is an obvious point for me to make - that Parliament has been heard in this matter."
"The regulation about the generalised tariff preferences lays out in detail how a temporary cancellation is to be carried out."
"How they are to be reinstated is however not mentioned."
"Hence, I have proposed that the Commission should continuously monitor the circumstances surrounding forced labour."
"Should there be evidence of forced labour ceasing to exist, the Commission should, after thorough investigation, submit a proposal to the Council which after having informed the European Parliament should decide whether the regulations should all be revoked."
"Naturally, it is of the utmost importance to inform and consult Parliament about the reinstatement of the generalised tariff preferences."
"It would not only be ironical if Parliament was not to be consulted about the reinstatement of the preference system, as Parliament was consulted on the cancellation of the generalised tariff preferences, but totally unacceptable from a political point of view."
"Finally, let me call attention to an irritating detail."
"The result of the Commission's investigation has not been made public."
"I have in my capacity as a rapporteur asked Commissioner Marin on several occasions if I may study the contents of this report but have always been refused on the basis of some official legal reasons."
"I do not disbelieve the Commission's conclusions arising from the investigation but see it as a question of principle."
"Parliament must be able to study the documents in a matter of this sort. The least one can request is therefore for the rapporteur to have access to or to be able to study the investigation documents; this is crucial when introducing tariff preferences."
"It has been a hard day's night for the Commissioner and for us all."
"However, I still wonder, Commissioner Marin, if we ought not to look into the possibilities of finding a solution so that Parliament can gain an insight in the future; I can accept that it has not happened this time."
"I have hopes of Parliament supporting the proposal unanimously and that the Council on the 24 of March will decide to revoke the generalised tariff preferences."
"Anything less would be a scandal and would create a strong political reaction."
"Mr President, the European Union is for the first time imposing sanctions on a country which is violating workers' rights, and we must welcome this decision to withdraw Burma's access to the generalized preference system."
"For many months, we in this House have been campaigning for measures to be taken against this military junta in Burma, as mass deportations of men, women and children continue to take place."
"The Burmese army is involved in these practices and is maltreating these victims of forced labour."
"According to the ICFTU, the number of people involved is 800, 000, several thousand of whom are said to have died already at these sites."
"Consequently, on 6 June 1995, the international trade union confederations filed a complaint with the Commission requesting that Burma be excluded from the GPS as far as industrial products are concerned."
"On 1 January 1997, the same unions filed the same complaint with regard to agricultural products."
"Two-thirds of Burmese agricultural and industrial exports benefitted from tariff reductions at that point."
"In view of the appalling disregard for human rights, it was essential that the European Union should react, even if it did not go as far as a full trade blockade."
"However, we would like to see the Commission adopting an even more pro-active attitude: in addition to the decision taken by the European Commission, it would also be appropriate for the Member States and the Council to adopt an identical position towards Burma and impose harsher sanctions, the more so since, although these procedures are commercial, their political impact must not be underestimated."
"In addition, Burma's membership of ASEAN causes a serious problem."
"Although this is exclusively a matter for the States making up that body, it would be appropriate for the European Commission to maintain pressure on the States in that region and to reinforce what it calls the critical dialogue that it seems to have instituted."
"Finally, I should like to make one comment on behalf of my group, because we would like to see the same determination applied to every country that shows this kind of contempt for workers' rights and indulges in forced labour, which is slavery under another name."
"Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Theorin on her excellent report which has been brought before the House today."
"Action against Burma is well overdue."
"I welcome the proposal to withdraw access to the GSP or generalized tariff preferences for industrial and agricultural exports."
"This will cost Burma an estimated ECU 2, 262m in additional customs duties."
"The grounds for these economic sanctions are quite clear."
"The use of forced and slave labour in Burma breaches the Geneva Conventions of 25 September 1926 and 7 September 1956 and Conventions 29 and 105 of the International Labour Organization."
"There are other broader moral grounds for taking action against Burma."
"SLORC, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, is a brutal military dictatorship which violently seized power in 1988."
"SLORC refused to accept the result of the 1990 election which was won by the opposition National League for Democracy."
"Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the 1990 election, has been the victim of house arrest and continual harassment."
"Apart from the killing and wounding of slave workers, the general human rights situation is appalling."
"Disappearances, rape, arbitrary arrest and execution are the order of the day."
"Political opponents, ethnic minorities and the wider population face daily intimidation and worse."
"Against this background it is to be welcomed that a number of US and European companies, including Heineken, Carlsberg and PepsiCo, have pulled out."
"But other companies still trade in Burma, turning a blind eye to the human rights abuses occurring all around them."
"TOTAL Oil company and Club Med continue to do business in Burma."
"There is documented evidence of human rights abuses at the sites of TOTAL's gas pipeline project, including the execution and torture of forced labourers."
"This is just not acceptable."
"What are these European companies doing with Burmese blood on their hands?"
"The European Union should continue to question Burma's possible future membership of ASEAN."
"ASEAN's credibility will only be damaged if Burma is offered membership of this prestigious South-East Asian club in the near future."
"It will also complicate ASEAN's relations with the EU."
"For many years the European Parliament has called for a clause guaranteeing the fundamental rights of employees to be included in agreements when the EU grants generalized tariff preferences."
"Such social clauses could be used to improve human rights across the world."
"Certainly when our political and trading partners fall below universally accepted standards of human decency, it is right that the EU should impose political and economic sanctions."
"I warmly support Mrs Theorin's report."
"I hope the EU maintains the pressure on the Burmese authorities so that they feel compelled to embrace democracy and liberate the Burmese people from their suffering and oppression."
"Mr President, Burma is a country with a violent military dictatorship, and with an elected opposition leader - or really an elected president - who received 80 % of the votes and has been under house arrest and effectively held hostage for six years."
"It is a country where 80 % of the elected members of parliament are imprisoned or have disappeared."
"It is a country where a sizeable section of the population are obliged, through forced labour, to help to build all manner of government projects, a country where slave labour is being used."
"It is a country where, according to Amnesty International, the worst human rights violations are happening at the moment."
"There are still people who ask what is wrong with this relatively unknown country, why the United States Congress has passed a law banning investment, and why the European Union is proposing to withdraw its tariff preferences, which is effectively the start of an economic boycott."
"I hope that all these facts show that the regime in Burma is not fit to govern and can no longer be respected or tolerated by the international community."
"I am delighted that the Commission has reacted positively to Parliament's resolutions of July 1996 and October 1996, and has put forward this proposal to withdraw the system of tariff preferences."
"I should also like to congratulate the Commission on its careful work in determining the nature and scale of the slave labour."
"It has done a most thorough job, so no one can accuse it of proceeding hastily and without due care."
"In 1994, I was Parliament's rapporteur on the preferences system, and we were then very careful to include the clause which we are now using."
"And this example - the first time the clause has been invoked - shows that it contains some good provisions and can be applied in practice."
"I am therefore quite happy with the approach we adopted in 1994."
"Parliament is sure to approve this sanction against the military regime in Burma today, and the next step is now up to the Council."
"I would like to ask the Commissioner what the situation is in the Council."
"Does he think it will approve this proposal fairly quickly?"
"I have two further comments to make before I end. This proposal to withdraw the system of preferences marks the beginning of an economic boycott."
"If this does not help, we must be prepared to go as far as the US Congress, and ban investment."
"Secondly, as has already been mentioned, we should urge people not to go on holiday to Burma, and we should call on all holiday companies and tour operators to stop organizing trips to Burma, because the hotels and all the rest of the infrastructure for the tourist industry are being built with the help of slave labour."
"I hope that the steps we are taking in Parliament today are quickly followed up by the Council, but I hope most of all that the opposition leader who is currently being held hostage will one day become president of her country, that the members of parliament who are in prison can one day take their seats, and that human rights will be respected."
"I wish Burma well, and I hope that our actions here today will do some good."
"Mr President, today's debate is quite timely as industrial leaders in different parts of the world are pressurizing governments into dropping any plans for sanctions against Burma."
"Earlier this week the US-ASEAN Business Council, which represents the cream of American and South-East Asian business people, made a strong denunciation of economic sanctions against Burma."
"Instead it called on the US to adopt a strategy of constructive engagement with the Burmese authorities to maintain economic links with Burma while pushing for change."
"Constructive engagement was exactly the policy which Ronald Reagan pursued in South Africa."
"That policy prolonged the suffering of black people and it was only when the international community was mobilized into taking strong economic measures against South Africa that the apartheid regime crumbled."
"Recent events in Burma also show the need for decisive action at EU level."
"The oppression of Burma's six-millionstrong Karen minority has become increasingly ferocious over the past few months."
"The Karen are seeking an autonomy which the British guaranteed them when they made Burma independent in 1949."
"There have been numerous allegations of mutilation, rape and indiscriminate firing on civilians fleeing across the Burmese-Thai border."
"The Burmese military junta cannot use its ongoing conflict with the rebels of the Karen National Union as an excuse for attacks on civilians."
"Amnesty International has estimated that almost 2, 000 people were arrested for political reasons in Burma last year."
"The vast majority of them are believed to have been involved in entirely peaceful activities."
"When the Burmese Prime-Minister-in-exile visited Dublin recently he expressed fears that the European Union would ease its pressure on the generals in power for trade reasons."
"We need an assurance from both the Commission and the Council that this will not happen."
"The Greens fully support the EU's decision to withdraw trade preferences for Burma on both industrial and agricultural goods, but more action needs to be taken."
"TOTAL, the French state-owned oil company, has been active in Burma for many years and there have been allegations that it has used forced labour, including child labour, in its work."
"A few months ago it, along with the US company UNOCAL, signed a new contract with Burmese oil and gas enterprises to expand natural gas explorations in the Andaman Sea."
"This summer ASEAN is expected to admit Burma as a member."
"During the ASEAN January meeting efforts were made by certain foreign ministers to keep human rights off the agenda."
"If Burma is admitted the EU must raise its ongoing abuse of human rights there at every opportunity."
"Mr President, Presidents of Parliament pass by, honourable Members come and go, but Commissioners remain."
"That is all to the credit of Commissioner Marín and it is all to our advantage, because the Burma question is one of his cases and I am very glad it is."
"I think this decision to suspend the GPS is particularly important because a meeting to set up an international network of support for democracy in Burma has just been held in Tokyo."
"So I think that the signal that could be sent by the European Union is particularly important for the Asian countries, many of whom attended this forum in Tokyo and exhibit a great deal more interest in this matter than the European Union does, I must admit."
"But that doesn't mean that it isn't important."
"Also, I believe the decision is an important one because it is the first of its kind in the European Union's policy."
"This is in fact the first time we have used such a strong instrument of economic policy in the interests of defending human rights and advancing democracy."
"I congratulate Mr Marín for having handled this matter as he has."
"I should say to previous speakers who believe that Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi has a great deal of charm - which is also my belief - that there are other people in various countries in that region, such as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan and many other dissidents, who also have a lot of charm."
"I hope that will give them ideas for the future."
"I shall not ask Mr Marín if he thinks Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi is particularly charming, but I would like to ask him if he thinks - and I hope he won't pass this straight on to Sir Leon Brittan - that it would be possible, at the request of the European Parliament, to launch similar procedures for other countries in the region."
"I think that the present case involved an initiative by the unions, but would it not be possible for Parliament itself to take the initiative in similar procedures to suspend the GPS for other countries in the region?"
"To my way of thinking, this would represent a determined and positive step by the European Union towards strengthening its foreign policy."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"First and foremost what I would like to do is to add my congratulations to those of the rest of the House to Mrs Theorin for her excellent report and very sensible amendments to the text."
"It is also very good to have the opportunity to congratulate the Commission on what is a historically significant action."
"I think the action on preferences on industrial and agricultural products is very welcome, although the complete ending of trade, particularly by oil companies such as TOTAL and Premier, is sadly not yet likely."
"But those measures do at least bring the EU into line with the strong US position."
"What I would like to do is actually share some views - from experience, rather than just received through the media."
"If you go to Rangoon covertly as I and others did late last year you unequivocally see the child labour and the forced labour on the roads in Rangoon district, building the hotels and the roads there."
"You see the high emphasis that the SLORC regime places on international investment there."
"Today I and colleagues Kinnock, Thomas and Ford have presented a strong protest to the Club Med travel company here in Strasbourg, demanding that they stop their tours and their activities there and take notice of the others that have pulled out, however attractive the Burmese people and country are."
"Vital though western action is, SLORC will continue to be underpinned by neighbours such as China, who, it is alleged, have a flourishing, poisonous, underground drugs and jewel trade through the country."
"This directly funds and nourishes the repressive regime which is murdering indigenous peoples near and across the Thai border as we speak tonight."
"In that context the moves to include Burma in ASEAN are deeply depressing but predictable, and I call on the Commission in all trade negotiations with the ASEAN states to urge them to reconsider."
"I hope that these actions on GSP are effective and do weaken the SLORC, but while they take effect I hope that this House will recognize the dedicated work of all the people striving for democracy in Burma, as well as the Burma Action Group, other networks, and NGOs, keeping open international contacts and channels of hope."
"We in this House cannot debate Burma every month, but we must think how we can help the Burmese people every day until they are free, and this report and these proposals are a part of that process."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the European Union granted tariff preferences to Myanmar - formerly Burma - in 1994, the political situation there was already extremely tense."
"Nonetheless, relief was given for certain industrial goods and agricultural products, not least in the hope that improvements in the social situation could be achieved."
"The opposite has happened."
"In Myanmar, human rights are trampled over, and ill-treatment, arrests and torture are everyday occurrences."
"The democracy movement is subject to repression, and for years now Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, President of the National League for Democracy, has been under house arrest."
"She is a holder of the Sakharov Prize and of the Nobel Peace Prize."
"How can we effectively combat a regime which treats those holding different views as criminals?"
"As has already been pointed out, the forced labour taking place in Myanmar is a form of slavery which breaches the international agreements, the Geneva Convention, the ILO Convention and so on."
"Suspension of the tariff preferences is absolutely essential."
"In the opinion of the Commission, the Council, the NGOs, Amnesty International and the State Department, human rights abuses in Myanmar increased further during 1996."
"It has been and remains the aim of the European Parliament to make development cooperation dependent on respect for human rights, an example of this being last year's cooperation agreement with Nepal."
"Parliament must therefore be consulted before any future decisions by the Council on the restoration of tariff preferences, as rightly proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Theorin."
"A legal basis exists for this to happen."
"We must continue to apply pressure through the political and economic means at our disposal."
"No consideration can be shown towards ruthless policies."
"At the same time, we wish to give a sign of encouragement to the democracy movement in Myanmar."
"Its peaceful resistance to the junta which has seized power is exemplary."
"It deserves both solidarity and success!"
"Mr President, I welcome the Council's proposals to withdraw access to GSP for both industrial and agricultural goods from Burma."
"Hopefully this action will put further pressure on the military dictatorship of the SLORC in that sad country to stop its massive use of forced slave and child labour to construct its infrastructure of hotels to try to boost its tourist trade."
"Last December Mrs Kinnock and I visited Aung San Suu Kyi clandestinely."
"We videoed an interview with her."
"Her message was absolutely crystal clear: End investment in Burma; impose sanctions."
"Clearly these would not be without impact on the Burmese people."
"Yet the need for action was absolutely clear to her and who better to speak for the Burmese people."
"In 1990 her party, the National League for Democracy, received 80 % of the votes."
"When Mrs Kinnock and I returned from Burma we took the opportunity to meet both with Commissioner Marín and the Irish presidency."
"They were both sympathetic but were awaiting the response from the regime to a request from the Commission for an investigation team to visit Burma to investigate the allegations of forced labour."
"Within a few days of our meeting the Burmese junta peremptorily refused permission for the Commission to visit."
"We therefore congratulate the Commission and the Council for moving so swiftly."
"I would particularly like to congratulate Commissioner Marín for the very tough line he took in Singapore and the way he stood up to the criticisms from some Member States."
"I also hope that the industrialists of Europe are listening to this and that TOTAL and Club Med will follow the line taken by Heineken, Carlsberg, PepsiCo, Levi, Apple and Thomas Cook."
"Two final points."
"The European Parliament is rightly emphasizing its links with Asia."
"As one of the Bureau members of the Japan delegation, I had a meeting yesterday with other representatives of Asia delegations to talk about ASSET II, an inter-parliamentary meeting between Members of the European Parliament and the Asean parliaments."
"I hope it is crystal clear to everybody that will only include Asean parliaments with which we have a relationship."
"Finally, I would like to ask Commissioner Marín if he could assure us that the Council is not now going to block this proposal because of the actions of a fag-end government in one Member State."
", Vice-President of the Commission. (ES) Mr President, the Commission would firstly like to express its thanks for the support given by the European Parliament to the recommendation to withdraw the preferential treatment Myanmar enjoys under the generalized system of preferences because, to a degree, Mr Ford, if we manage to have this decision approved on 24 March next at the Council of Ministers, it will be the first time that the Commission, Parliament and the Council of Ministers have managed to agree - the first time - on the fact that certain social standards have to be respected within the sphere of trade also."
"An additional point, regarding the European Parliament's viewpoint: the Commission - I myself - recommended that the Council consult Parliament on this proposal owing to the political interest this institution had always expressed in the observance of a specific system of social ethics in international trade."
"Independently of the way in which it is applied, I would like the decision to be made on the 24th. We will then have time to consider how it will be applied in the future."
"The reason for this?"
"Essentially because the basis of the decision we have to make was specifically to verify the reality and extent of the use of forced labour in Myanmar and the responsibility of that country's authorities in this matter."
"To achieve this objective, the Commission opted for a procedure which was intentionally long, complex and detailed so that the rules established in the Regulations of the Generalized System of Preferences were scrupulously complied with, with a sole objective: that when the Commission proposed withdrawal, there could be no possibility of legal attack."
"The decision depends on Parliament and the Council of Ministers."
"Now there are no excuses."
"A decision has to be made and whoever answers 'yes' will have to explain it politically. Whoever answers 'no' will also have to explain themselves."
"It is not possible to say 'There are defects in the procedure, the work has not been carried out satisfactorily, therefore the judicial procedure has to be repeated once again' ."
"Therefore, I always stated - Mrs Maij-Weggen will remember - that I preferred to be slow but sure."
"Therefore, the Commission's services, in cooperation with internationally acknowledged experts who assisted us, proceeded with the task of verification and the analysis of 42 witness statements, and heard various witnesses who have had to be protected under the terms of a confidentiality agreement."
"Our opting for confidentiality is based, Mr Dupuis, on the fact that there was no advantage in publicizing to the military junta exactly who was coming forward as a witness."
"I myself lived under and worked against a dictatorship in my own country, Spain, and I know how basic a requirement it is when one is underground to be as prudent as possible with regard to persons lending assistance from the inside. This work therefore, logically, has to be undertaken confidentially."
"The facts were examined and the Myanmar authorities were given a verbal note asking them to take part in a meeting with a view to ensuring the procedure genuinely included views from all sides. This was done irrespective of the intellectual or political repugnance any one of those of us there may have felt."
"In a verbal note, the Burmese government rejected our invitation. However, the Commission has upheld the idea that this is a procedure in which all sides can state their views, by protecting the confidentiality of those who were giving statements and, secondly, also giving the authorities in Rangoon the chance to have their say."
"We arrived at the conclusion, under our responsibility, that forced labour continues to be used on a large scale under the direct responsibility of the authorities at all levels."
"Forced labour in Myanmar affects the population as a whole, without distinction for age or sex, both in rural and urban areas, although the inhabitants of urban areas have greater financial resources enabling them to purchase exemption from such work."
"Cultural and religious pretexts were refuted by the witnesses and, naturally, contacts were also made with the Buddhist area of the country, where it was in fact confirmed to us that Buddhism is in no way a protection against slavery."
"Consequently, the Commission decided to propose this withdrawal of access to the Council, independently of the argument as to whether this is a CFSP decision or a 'Commission 113' decision."
"Mr Dupuis, I think it would be a very bad thing, this week, prior to the Council of Ministers' decision on the 24th, to discuss whether this concerns doves, partridges, rabbits or hares."
"We are attempting to establish a precedent, set up a basic principle and a body of law."
"Then we will have time to look at how to structure this initial solution in the future."
"This is my point of view but, naturally, I respect Parliament's autonomy and sovereignty."
"Finally, Mrs Maij-Weggen, Mr Ford and Mrs Theorin, I hope that the Council of Ministers makes the decision."
"If, after all the work we have done, after all that happened in Singapore, after this debate in the European Parliament, we are incapable of making a decision in the Council of Ministers, I, for one, will be deeply unhappy."
"But I hope that we will indeed be able to make it."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9 a.m."
"(The sitting was closed at 8.05 pm)"
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The minutes of yesterday's session have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Madam President, on page six of the Minutes of yesterday's sitting, three reports are listed under what is referred to as the 'Hughes procedure' ."
"I would prefer in future for the correct rule from the Rules of Procedure to be quoted, instead of using the name of some random Member."
"We have actually finished with the approval of the Minutes, but I shall pass on the suggestion that we could perhaps add something to the expression 'Hughes procedure' , in order to make it clear to those Members who do not understand what is meant by that expression."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Madam President. I just wish to inform the House that tomorrow morning in Liverpool a commemorative service will be held for our late colleague Ken Stewart."
"The President's Office has very kindly agreed to send a letter of condolence."
"I want to record my thanks to the President for that."
"Given that the Commission is here, I also wish to mention that last week the Commission issued a press release supporting an expedition to investigate the wreck of the bulk carrier Derbyshire , which vanished in the Pacific in 1980."
"This was an issue which Ken Stewart fought long and hard for in his years in this Parliament and he would be most pleased that the Commission is investigating this."
"Indeed, as we all know, he fought very hard on all issues of maritime transport, for the safety of those who earn their living and the passengers who sail on the ships."
"So we are pleased to record that the Commission supports the expedition."
"Ken would be pleased."
"Thank you for this information."
"Madam President, on a point of order."
"I refer to the tragic events on the Israeli-Jordanian border yesterday."
"I would ask the presidency to send an appropriate note of condolences to the people of Israel and particularly the families involved."
"Thank you very much Mr Hallam."
"Madam President, I should also like to go along with the request made by the previous speaker and send my condolences in respect of the terrorist attack perpetrated yesterday in Israel, which cost the lives of six schoolchildren and a teacher at the Jordanian border."
"I think that there are deeds which go against the peace process but there can be no greater assault than the irreparable loss of human life."
"I think that the Parliament should therefore send its condolences and condemn acts such as this one."
"Thank you very much Mr Vallvé."
"Madam President, I should like to say that I share Members' special commitment to the Middle East."
"I would ask Parliament to observe a minute's silence, so that we can give special expression to these tragic events, and show how much we, as Members of the European Parliament, wish to be involved, in every way, in the events taking place in the Middle East."
"Thank you very much Mr Sichrovsky."
"Votes"
"Madam President, on a point of clarification."
"Yesterday, Commissioner Marin made it clear that he understood that this decision was going to have to be made on the basis of unanimity."
"Certainly, in earlier discussions, the point had been made by the Commission in formal discussions that the decision in principle which required unanimity had already been made and the implementing decision would only require a qualified majority vote."
"Can the Commission look at this point and come back to us?"
"I will gladly arrange for this point to be checked again, but obviously I am not in a position, here and now, to give any opinion other than the one given by my colleague yesterday."
"Madam President, there are a number of countries where the human rights situation is very depressing, but in Burma the situation is particularly extreme."
"The military regime abuses people in the most terrible manner, not only by using forced labour for infrastructure projects, but also by forcing people to work as pack animals transporting arms and ammunition for the army."
"As the rapporteur also described, slave labour is not the only abuse in Burma."
"People are being driven out, being forced from their homes and killed."
"The desperate plight of the two million minority in the Karen tribe deserves special consideration here."
"The United Kingdom promised when it left Burma in 1948 that this overwhelmingly Christian tribe would have the right to self-determination."
"A few weeks ago, the Burmese army started a major offensive against the Karen National Union, triggering a flood of refugees across the border into Thailand, which then refused to protect them."
"So in addition to the issue of forced labour, there is every good reason for the Council to consider the Karens' desperate fight for survival against the Burmese regime and the Thai Government."
"This is the first time that the Commission has proposed to apply world trade sanctions on humanitarian grounds, and it has certainly done its work very thoroughly."
"Forced labour is one of the grounds for withdrawing preferences mentioned in Article 9 of the regulation."
"From what Commissioner Marín has said, the Council seems certain to adopt the proposal unanimously on 24 March."
"One question that has not been answered is the conditions attached to the continued withdrawal of preferences."
"Will the preferences be restored if forced labour is abolished?"
"Or will it be a condition that the human rights situation in general must be improved?"
"And how does the treatment of Burma relate to countries like China, Cuba and Libya, where there are also many human rights abuses?"
"We hope that the Commission will be able to give us details in due course."
"We unreservedly support the proposal to withdraw tariff preferences for Burma."
"Dybkjær report (A4-0083/97)"
"We are nearly blue in the face using the term 'sustainable development' , given the virtual paralysis of the European Union in developing this concept worldwide."
"At various times, we in the European Parliament have already maintained that the Rio Summit, for many European leaders, was little more than a photo opportunity and unfortunately we have been proved right."
"There is no political will and without political will and economic solidarity, with so little north-south dialogue, it is going to be very difficult for us to achieve the aims of Agenda 21, since as the rapporteur properly points out, the worldwide environmental situation has gone from problematic to alarming."
"The European Union must take much of the responsibility in order to achieve any success in the New York Conference."
"What do I want them to be told?"
"I think that the current Commission is going through bad times - that is why it is necessary for the European Parliament to play the role which the citizens of Europe have given us in this area and strengthen its presence at that Conference."
"Therefore, my vote is going to be above all a sceptical one."
"Permanent abandonment premium for winegrowers"
"The next item is the report (A4-0077/97) by Mr Martin, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a Council Regulation amending Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88 on the granting, for the 1988/89 to 1997/98 wine years, of permanent abandonment premiums in respect of wine-growing areas (COM(96)0706 - C4-0047/97-97/0009(CNS))."
"Madam President, Council Regulation No 1442/88 of 24 May 1988 on the granting, for the 1988/89 to 1997/98 wine years, of permanent abandonment premiums in respect of wine-growing areas was last amended by Regulation 1595/96 of 30 July 1996."
"The amended regulation provides that the Member States shall designate the regions affected by the grubbing-up measure."
"This decision may be made subject to conditions designed to guarantee a minimum level of production in the areas in question and respect for the ecological balance."
"I should remind the House that, on the occasion of the debate on the 1996/97 price package, I and a number of other Members tabled certain amendments on grubbing-up."
"Those amendments were rejected in the plenary on the ground that there were not enough vines in the European Union."
"At that time I highlighted the specific problems of Charentes."
"Unfortunately, some of those in the trade adopted a somewhat demagogic stance."
"I regret that because, in view of trends in the production and consumption of wine products in the European Union, there is clearly a structural surplus for the 1996/97 wine year of around 15 million hectolitres."
"The abandonment policy therefore needs to be brought more into line with economic and environmental reality so that it provides stronger incentives and ceases to be irreversible."
"Rapid answers are therefore needed."
"To achieve that end, a number of measures are proposed."
"The first is to extend the period of applicability of planting rights, which at present is only eight years, eight wine years, after that in which a duly declared grubbing-up of vines has taken place."
"Some wine-growers are therefore tempted to replant their vineyards before the date on which their right to do so expires."
"The new system should make it possible to extend this period of validity to twelve wine years, and this should include the rights currently held by wine-growers."
"Next, a temporary abandonment scheme is proposed."
"The abandonment premiums as defined by Regulation 1442/88 involved permanent abandonment and caused extreme inflexibility, which renders the measure less effective."
"The new system proposes temporary abandonment for a period of 12 years, with a premium of 40 % of the permanent abandonment premium, and the abandonment may be the subject of a transfer as referred to in Article 7(2), second subparagraph, of Regulation 822/87, or replanting within a period of eight years after grubbingup."
"These measures could both improve the transfer of enterprises, inter alia by enabling young wine-growers to become established more easily, and at the same time help enterprises to respond to developments in their market."
"Temporary abandonment is therefore a dynamic rather than a static response to changes in markets and enterprises."
"The measures proposed in this chapter are not contrary to current provisions planned for the 1996-97 wine year, but would allow wine-growers additional measures to increase the flexibility of enterprises in relation to market trends."
"In the particular case of wines subject to Article 36, it is important to consider the value of this procedure."
"It is clear - the main example being the special case of Charentes - that producers obtain very high yields, far exceeding the capacities of the traditional outlets, which consequently disrupt the traditional markets of other wine-growing regions."
"Finally, with regard to regional development, it should be borne in mind that some regions are economically dependent on wine-growing."
"Permanent abandonment entails an irreversible loss of economic potential."
"For obvious reasons, both temporary and permanent abandonment must remain voluntary, and therefore no element of compulsion should be introduced."
"That, Madam President, is what I wanted to say about this report."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are dealing, by urgent procedure, with the Commission proposal to postpone the time limit for presenting applications for permanent abandonment premiums by one month, i.e. from 31 December 1996 to 31 January 1997 - note January, despite the fact that today's date is 14 March."
"My group, the PPE, supports Mr Martin's report."
"Mr Martin is proposing that the time limit should be postponed not by one month, but by three."
"This certainly makes sense, not only because the time limit has already expired anyway, but also because Member States are experiencing real difficulties in implementing the set-aside scheme."
"As a result of the changes introduced in 1996 by Regulation No 1595, set-aside quotas were allocated to Member States for the first time."
"For example, my country, Germany, was given only 50 ha for the permanent abandonment of wine-growing areas."
"Major problems arise simply from the question of how this small area is to be distributed among the 13 wine-growing regions."
"It must be possible to transfer areas for which no application for abandonment was made in 1996/97 to the following wine year, so that the grubbing-up quota does not lapse."
"The permanent abandonment of wine-growing areas, and thus the withdrawal of areas from wine-production, is a measure intended to stabilize the wine market in Europe."
"The structural surpluses in the EU still amount to about 15 million hectolitres."
"The first market-regulating instrument in the case of wine has to be sales promotion."
"We must make every effort to maintain our market shares, and also to increase our exports."
"Only in this way can we protect jobs in Europe, and only in this way can we guarantee that our culture and our cultivated landscape are preserved."
"In the European Parliament, we have asked for financial resources for wine sales promotion, as part of the new arrangements for the organization of the wine market."
"The reform of the organization of the wine market still leaves much to be desired."
"Fundamental changes are needed."
"What we are doing now is a mere patching-up exercise."
"Grubbing up vineyards without offering any alternatives for individual regions may be the ruin of those regions."
"This would, of necessity, result in structural compensatory measures."
"Wine production is an economic factor in Europe."
"Good wines are produced throughout the world, and they are penetrating our markets, both inside and outside the EU."
"By unilaterally withdrawing from the market, we are losing not only economic potential and jobs, but also a piece of our cultural identity."
"Market regulation must be tackled with moderation and understanding, and the permanent abandonment of wine-growing areas must always be done - and here I agree with Mr Martin - on a purely voluntary basis. It must also be possible to control it in such a way as to ensure that it is the less successful sites, and those sites that do not help to shape our cultivated landscape, that can be taken out of production."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, grubbing-up is one of the Commission's favoured ways of reducing production."
"But there are many others."
"Downstream, there is distillation, a traditional tool."
"At the production stage, the grapes can be harvested before ripening, fertilizer use can be reduced or ceilings placed on yields."
"Upstream, mention should be made of programmes relating to the planting of quality varieties, automatically reducing production."
"Finally, vineyard areas can be reduced by permanent abandonment, the main instrument used by the Commission and the only one that receives 100 % financing."
"However, wine production can also be reduced, for example, by diversifying the outlets for grape products: we have grape juice or its derivatives, for example, or grape sugar although this is still a marginal method."
"Getting back to the idea of reducing production through quality, we need to realize that by 2010, 5 % of European consumption will come from biological farming - including wine."
"Furthermore - and this is what matters - quality wines under a registered designation of origin or local wines will constitute the majority of the market."
"What quality wines have in common is that the yield per hectare is low; so they do offer a genuine way of controlling production."
"As for grubbing-up, it should remain, for preference, a tool to be used for the restructuring and requalification of vineyards."
"Thus, in my own region of Alsace, thanks to a strict quality policy, yields have fallen over twenty years from 120-130 litres per hectare to about 60 hectolitres for the best growths."
"By the combined implementation of strict quality policies, therefore, the wine-growers have succeeded in maintaining their incomes while reducing production volumes, without abandonment, and while increasing their export markets."
"As far as I am concerned, I still reject a general policy - a suicidal policy for Europe's wine-growers - designed to control production by permanent abandonment with all its familiar effects on the countryside in wine-growing areas, on soil erosion, on the abandonment of the land resulting in economic decline, rural exodus and youth unemployment, not to mention the lost means of production for the world market."
"Any such policy is in total conflict with the desire for integrated rural development and the protection of the land, and it conflicts, too, with the idea of regional economic development which, as we know, relies essentially on agricultural resources such as vine and wine products."
"And, of course, I have said nothing about the cultural, historical and symbolic aspects of vine growing, which can look back on two or three millennia of tradition in southern Europe."
"Its permanent abandonment has to be regarded as an act of radical surgery, to be undertaken only in extremis."
"Grubbing up the vines to replant them with a view to quality production is the only sane way of planning this measure. So any policy of grubbing-up must be selective and temporary."
"It must include an economic aspect, in the form of increased premiums per hectare, a social aspect in the form of retirement aid and establishment aid for the young, and an environmental aspect - here I am thinking of sanitary set-aside and erosion prevention."
"All this must, of course, go hand in hand with a controlled policy for those regions that really do have surplus production for which they cannot find a market."
"In conclusion, I would say that only a realistic policy, appropriate to the needs of the population, the environment and an increasingly high-quality market, is capable of achieving the objectives which we think the European Union should be aiming at in terms of viticultural policy."
"On this basis, the Group of the European Radical Alliance obviously supports the report by our colleague Mr Martin."
"Madam President, in some European wine-growing regions we are witnessing an escalating crisis of excess production which should be eliminated immediately by a carefully structured programme of action."
"We support Mr Martin's report, because it contains not only immediate measures to achieve this but also useful suggestions for the future."
"The immediate measures are those proposed by the Commission for the 1996, 1997 and 1998 wine years, but they are merely a stopgap."
"They do not solve the whole problem."
"This is why our group studied the second part of the report, on the improvement of the grubbing-up procedure, with the greatest interest."
"The need now is for the Commission to move quickly to present proposals aimed at reforming the common organization of the wine-growing markets, a project which has been hanging fire for two years although the European Parliament previously made proposals on the occasion of the Fantuzzi report."
"As far as this reform is concerned, the abandonment aspect must take due account of the rapporteur's proposal."
"Apart from the looming crisis, it is absolutely essential to preserve a future for our wine-growing regions."
"The only way of achieving that is voluntary, temporary grubbing-up rather than permanent abandonment."
"It is a matter for regret that the House did not follow our lead on the occasion of the 1996-97 price package by voting in favour of the amendments proposed by our group, which have now been adopted by the rapporteur."
"We were told at that time that there were no wine surpluses."
"Well, we know today that the European Union has had to distil no less than 15 million hectolitres during the present wine year."
"What a waste! What losses for our wine-growers!"
"Let us retain a degree of flexibility in the management of wine-growing enterprises, through temporary grubbing-up."
"And let us remember that any permanent abandonment entails the equally permanent loss of the right of production, and that the land thus released can no longer receive aid under the CAP."
"Regarding the specific case of Charentes, it would be suicidal to abandon permanently, as some people have nevertheless suggested, some 20, 000 hectares - 25 % of the wine-growing potential of the region."
"Those vineyards would be allowed to lie fallow, and we would see the loss of a vital economic asset in that region and the destruction of a traditional human equilibrium."
"For these reasons, we urge that the reform of the common organization of the markets be pursued as soon as possible."
"Madam President, Mr Klass has expressed my group's position and I do not want to repeat what he has said."
"Instead I want to make the link with the general issue implicit in this morning's debate, which is the need to renew structural measures in the wine-growing sector to update rules that are now obsolete and no longer capable of meeting current needs."
"As other members have said, action must certainly be taken to reduce the surplus further, focusing on quality and market outlets. Action must also be taken through measures like grubbing-up and replanting to reinvigorate the wine-growing sector for the future and take account of the real situation in the geographic areas of the European Union."
"I do not know if the solution is to renew the COM which, by the way, was approved by Parliament a year and a half ago. Nor do I know whether we also need to review the proposals we made then."
"I do know that last year I myself tabled an amendment to the 'price package' , which was passed by the Committee on Agriculture and which made it very clear that Regulation 1442/88 on grubbing-up was such an antiquated, obsolete and rigid regulation that it should not be extended and that there was therefore a need to draw up a new regulation which would take account of the need to establish a market balance between demand and supply, affecting the nation states, but also specific geographic areas."
"An example is the region of north east Italy where all of local wine production is sold and where further market outlets are needed."
"So we need to have a more flexible instrument which reflects the specific positions of European Union regions."
"First of all, we should like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for accepting the urgency of this proposal."
"It goes without saying that we shall have to make the changes proposed here if we want to continue to operate the measures that have proved so successful up to now."
"Naturally this is not a final arrangement to improve the organization of wine-growing areas and wine markets; that much is absolutely clear."
"Those speakers here today who have said that of course this is only a continuation of what we have already been doing are quite right."
"However, the Commission has not said anything different."
"On the contrary, in this regulation we have indicated, yet again, that this arrangement is needed only until the final measures have been proposed and adopted."
"I should like to thank you for the debate that we have had here today."
"We have no problem in accepting all three amendments, and so we shall now be able to push this measure through very quickly."
"The fact that it is to be implemented by the Member States, and that difficulties may arise in the process, is quite right."
"That is, after all, what happens when you have a system of subsidiarity."
"If certain tasks are delegated as a result of subsidiarity, then of course it becomes more difficult for those who have to take on those tasks."
"Thank you very much, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Madam President, naturally I have supported the excellent report by Mr Martin, because the interests of our wine growers are at stake."
"But I did so with a heavy heart, because of course any withdrawal from production of wine-growing land means a setback as far as our culture and civilization are concerned."
"Mrs Klaß was right when she said that the areas of poorer land should be the ones to be set aside."
"Often, however, the only question is how to decide which are the poorer areas."
"We are fortunate today, that our session is being presided over by a President who represents one of the best wine-growing areas of Europe, namely Lower Franconia."
"I am very glad about that, because it sends out a positive signal, because we must be quite clear about one thing: set-aside is a setback."
"We must do more to concentrate our deliberations on the effects on people's health of moderate wine consumption."
"We must urge the Council Presidencies to finally do something about it."
"Unfortunately, Ireland and the Netherlands have done nothing, and so we are now putting our faith in Luxembourg, which is itself a wine-producing country."
"Finally, I should just like to say, quite clearly, that we should be doing all we can to spread the message that, as Europeans, we should be drinking less Coca Cola and more wine."
"We are voting in favour of the report, especially as we believe the entire policy of helping to close down vineyards on such a large scale is wrong."
"It should be the market and the individual wine-grower who should decide when to close down a vineyard."
"In addition, the proposal would involve higher subsidies for closing down vineyards in the Charente region."
"Setting a longer timescale will also facilitate payment of the subsidy."
"In summary, the proposal involves an expansion of the subsidy policy which we cannot possibly support."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"Guarantee against losses for EIB loans"
"The next item is the report (A4-0078/97) by Mr Tomlinson, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the proposal for a Council Decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern Europe, Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia, and South Africa) (COM(96)0586 - C4-0018/97-96/0278(CNS))."
"Madam President, guaranteeing European Investment Bank loans in third countries has long been a concern of the Committee on Budgets."
"Historically we have seen a pattern of role reversal in which the European budget has been assuming all the risks and yet the major political decisions have been taken by the European Investment Bank."
"In a resolution of Parliament on loans and guarantees last year in July, Parliament expressed yet again some basic principles that the Budget Committee has long held: firstly, the necessity to protect the Union's general budget from exposure to higher loan risks; secondly, the need to ensure an adequate provisioning of the guarantee fund in relation to the level of risk coverage; thirdly, the assumption that defaults on guaranteed loans are increasing, as well as the risk to the European Union budget."
"Because of the historic position we have taken, it was Parliament that insisted at the time of the last major revision of the financial perspectives that there should be a separate guarantee fund established in order to protect the budget from exposure to the guarantees it gave to EIB loans."
"At the European Councils in Cannes and Madrid it was concluded that the European Union would extend the lending and borrowing activities of the Community to third countries."
"We, as they say, had established the principles on which we wanted to see those guarantees provided."
"The proposal that has now come from the Commission, instead of renewing specific mandates to those parts of the world that are mentioned in the title (Latin America, Asia, South Africa and the Mediterranean), is seeking to renew the loans together globally, under a single mandate; and also, simultaneously, to make the expiry dates coincide with the period covered by the financial perspective while reducing the guarantee to the European Investment Bank to 65 %."
"Although the Commission proposal was made properly and in due time, the Council of Ministers has been laggardly indeed in the way it has dealt with it."
"Once again I draw the attention of the House to the fact that something that could be the subject of conciliation seems to be debated without adequate representation from the Council."
"We have approved, in principle, the aim of the ECOFIN Council which was expressed as far back as November 1995: that the responsibility of the European Investment Bank for loan risk should be increased."
"We consider that the chosen proposal was an interesting change in the approach."
"But it is clearly inadequate, in our opinion, to achieve the declared aim."
"We feel that there is still the possibility of the European Union budget being exposed to greater risk than before in the proposal that the Council has chosen to follow."
"The reduction of the guarantee will, we believe, lead to an increase in the global amount of the loans available, thus increasing the potential risk to be borne by the European Union budget."
"The responsibility of the European Investment Bank is increased because the risk that default payments are more than 65 % is close to zero."
"In considering what is a highly technical but also highly political proposal, the European Parliament Budget Committee has proposed two amendments, which follow the traditional view expressed in this House."
"At the same time, the Budget Committee is commending to the House the somewhat more political, less technical amendments that have been adopted by the appropriate committee to give an opinion - the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"With those few introductory remarks I commend the report."
"I urge the House to support not only the two amendments of the Budget Committee but those that were tabled by the REX Committee in its opinion and have subsequently been adopted by the Budgets Committee."
"Madam President, the subject of guarantees by the European Community to the European Investment Bank against losses for loans granted for carrying out projects in third countries is of great importance for the European Union's co-operation policy."
"The EIB's loan operations are in keeping with the objectives of that co-operation policy."
"The aim of the Commission's proposal is globally to renew all of the existing mandates concerning third countries."
"The uses and instrument of the European Union's co-operation policy means that the guarantees which the Community gives the European Investment Bank for external loans should be shared out in a balanced way among the different regions."
"That is why I wish to express my satisfaction to the Committee on Budget and Mr Tomlinson for having approved and incorporated into their report the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations which I hope will also be approved by the Assembly as whole."
"The need for the European Investment Bank to step up its activity to finance exemplary transfrontier projects between countries in the Mediterranean Basin and the lack of appropriate infrastructures in the areas of transport and telecommunications are one of the main obstacles to development of external and interregional trade as well as regional co-operation in general."
"It is therefore necessary to guarantee improved visibility of the financial effort."
"It is necessary for the citizens to perceive and know that the Community is taking part in the joint financing of projects together with other international financial institutions."
"The need for the assessment of the functioning of the new guarantee system to include an assessment of its economic and social impact on beneficiary countries is a vital element which will allow these countries to accelerate their economic development and guarantee the most effective possible use of resources and guarantees under the Community budget."
"I also wish to mention the timetable suggested in the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations, adjoining the report, and the demand for periodic information from the Commission to the European Parliament on the economic and social impact on the beneficiary countries of these loans."
"I also wish to express by satisfaction at seeing that Amendment No 4 has been included - in it the Committee on External Economic Relations proposes that the overall guarantee limit should be redistributed among the regions in order to strike a coherent balance."
"In the Commission document it was possible to note a timetable for loans from 1997 to 1999 in which Asia and Latin America were the only regions in which the volume of guaranteed loans remained capped to the level of 300 million ECU."
"This has been resolved by the last amendment and I should like to thank the European Parliament for approving these amendments and the Tomlinson report by the Committee on Budgets."
"Madam President, in the Bible it says that Moses, when he saw the Jews dancing around the golden calf, smashed the Ten Commandments in his anger."
"I am always reminded of this picture when I listen to Mr Tomlinson, because the Bible also says that this was a righteous anger, and I am grateful to Mr Tomlinson, for bringing righteous anger into this otherwise too peaceful House!"
"However, I should also like to add something to what Mr Tomlinson has said."
"It is not directly connected with it, but there is a connection, nonetheless."
"We are dealing here with the fact that, in our credit policy, we are gradually losing our conscience."
"We criticise the Albanian government for not banning the pyramid selling schemes."
"But we come up against other pyramids, and we ourselves are involved, every day, in building pyramids."
"What our banks are doing here is no longer tolerable."
"They are not putting their own money in, they are putting in the money that belongs to the people who have invested it with them, just like the pyramid schemes in Albania."
"I read in this morning's papers that we are once again going to give a large loan to Russia, but I think we should start to realise that there are political risks there that make these loans extremely dangerous, and that we should therefore be much more careful."
"I am also very grateful to Mr Tomlinson for once again pulling the communication cord with regard to the European Investment Bank, because slowly but surely we are heading towards a nasty shock as a result of these loans that we are giving to Russia."
"We have already given them much too much."
"On the other hand, when it comes to certain countries that have been liberated from Communism and are demonstrating that they are conscientious, countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, we slam the brakes on, whereas Russia is receiving unlimited credit, and slowly but surely this will place our savers at risk."
"I should therefore like to thank Mr Tomlinson and ask him to keep up the good work, so that eventually we can restore real order here."
"(FI ) Madam President, the European Investment Bank was founded to promote those objectives which the EU considers most important."
"Financing must also be directed at third countries."
"The activity of the European Investment Bank is not risk-free, because it is directed at projects in which the common good has to be defended and striven for."
"If it was risk-free, financing would be obtainable for development projects from other lending institutions, and the European Investment Bank would be unnecessary."
"The report before us states that the financing risks are divided into political and economic risks, and that the EU guarantees only the political risks."
"Political risks are regarded as arising from the banning of foreign currency transfers, compulsory payments, wars and internal unrest."
"This definition seems obvious, but in practice it is hard to distinguish between political and economic risks."
"Economic difficulties are, for example, also often caused by internal insecurity and unrest."
"Very often it is political difficulties which cause damage to economic activity."
"Therefore, in my opinion, a practice ought to be introduced whereby loan decisions contain a political risk assessment, otherwise, when a default occurs, the temptation may be to blame purely political factors."
"Two types of practice would be possible: either each country in question would be assessed in advance and a decision taken for that individual country on what proportion of the EIB's risk in the country was political in origin; or each financing decision should have an assessment annexed to it concerning the division of the risk between political and economic factors."
"As I said, inability to pay arises only rarely from a single factor."
"Therefore in my opinion the concept of political risk should be agreed upon in such a way that, in the event of a default, the damage would be divided in advance into political and economic risk."
"For example, if the bad debt was ECU 1 million and the political risk had been assessed in advance to be 40 %, under the proposal in this report the European Union guarantee would be only ECU 400 000."
"In other words, this decision would not be allowed to cause the relationship between the political and economic risk to be changed subsequently."
"Mr President, subject to these remarks I am prepared to adopt the report."
"Madam President, once again our discussions here today have concentrated, quite rightly, on the question of how such risks should be covered, and that is, of course, Mr Tomlinson's main proposal."
"Mr Tomlinson knows that this question has been discussed within the Commission, in other words in the Budget Committee."
"We indicated that the system proposed by him, in our opinion, need not be applied, at least at the present time, for the following reasons, which I shall quote in English:"
"'The new Guarantee system for EIB lending in practice is because of the substantial improvement on the outlook of the possible defaults for 1997/1999 relative to the recent past and the probability of the Guarantee Fund reaching its target amount in 1997 and the likelihood that the fund would be able to cover potential defaults in the medium term.'"
"These were the reasons given to Mr Tomlinson for the Commission's position."
"He asked then for a note which we gave him and he was kind enough to judge it as interesting but not relevant."
"(Laughter) Of course we took note of that as well."
"I would propose that for the time being we can accept the first half of the first amendment but for the rest we would like to stick to the present system, as we have said."
"If Parliament wants to go to a conciliation procedure that would be interesting - and relevant!"
"The Commission noted the applause with which Mr Tomlinson's speech was greeted by his colleagues and I began to fear that he was preparing himself for a cabinet post in the next government."
"However, when he was praised by Otto von Habsburg, this fear disappeared."
"(Laughter)"
"Madam President, I deliberately only took four and a half of my five minutes because I thought thirty seconds might be needed to reply to the Bangemann circus."
"When you heard those words read by Mr Bangemann it shows the predictive capacity of the Commission depending on a crystal ball."
"It was promising that everything in the future is likely to be better than the empirical evidence of the recent past."
"Hope springs eternal!"
"We have to be more prudent with our responsibilities for the Community budget."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, on a point of order."
"Very briefly, Madam President, Mrs Green, the chairman of the Socialist Group, is not here, but I am sure that what I have to say will be passed on to her."
"I should just like to follow her example in extending a welcome to a group of visitors in the gallery, who have come here in accordance with the rules..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"This is not the time for speeches."
"I am sorry, Mr Fabre-Aubrespy, but we are going to hold a vote now, and this is not the time for giving a speech."
"The Rules of Procedure do not allow it."
"Perhaps you could say what you want to say personally to Mrs Green."
"(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)"
"RTD cooperation with emerging economies"
"The next item is the report (A4-0066/97) by Mr Pompidou, on behalf of the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, on the communication from the Commission entitled 'Promoting RTD cooperation with the world's emerging economies' (COM(96)0344 - C4-0494/96)."
"Madam President, Mr Commissioner, I am standing in for the rapporteur, Professor Pompidou, who has been called away to Paris - as you mentioned, Madam President - by other commitments."
"I do so with pleasure, both out of respect for Parliament and because of the involvement I have had in the debates on this report in the Committee on Research and the Committee on External Economic Relations."
"The Commission's communication on cooperation in science and technology with the emerging economies covers design and implementation of specific cooperation instruments adapted to the characteristics of groups of countries with economic situations not classifiable under traditional categories for developing countries."
"There is a continuum of economies in transition between rich industrialized countries at one end, and really poor developing countries at the other. Economies in transition are progressing towards industrialization at their own pace and therefore present dual features, with prosperity and poverty existing side by side, state-of-the-art technology alongside underdevelopment, economic sectors and people on welfare, aggressive firms on the international market, demographic growth and economic expansion attracting foreign investment to high addedvalue businesses."
"All this means cooperation on a basis of equality with our companies and research institutes is now possible. Amongst the emerging economies I naturally want to mention China, India, Brazil and the countries of south east Asia, sometimes called 'the tiger economies' ."
"Describing a developing country as an 'emerging economy' does not mean that country immediately moves into the category of industrialized country."
"The best formula needs to be examined case by case."
"Here I should mention that it is part of the remit of the Committee on External Economic Relations to discuss whether a specific protocol on research and technological cooperation detailing the sectors concerned, should be included in each new association agreement that the Union establishes with third countries."
"The report from the Committee on Research concurs with the European Commission on the parallel use of different assistance and cooperation instruments when those countries present dual characteristics."
"The motion for a resolution emphasizes the need for any cooperation in advanced sectors of science and technology with the emerging economies to be organized within a framework of equal rights and responsibilities so as to permit genuinely reciprocal benefits, taking account in particular of the protection of intellectual property and the safeguarding of employment."
"One important point in the Pompidou report relates to setting up a research exchange programme with the emerging economies."
"The European Union is host today to less than 10 % of the population of young researchers from Asia active in western research laboratories, the great majority being concentrated in the United States."
"As well as making their intellectual ability available to their host countries, these young researchers often return to their countries of origin, where they become part of the management class, formers of opinion and culture, and they bring with them the baggage of personal relationships developed in the countries that hosted them."
"Given the imbalance as regards presence of Asian researchers in the Union, there is a real risk that the European Union will lack visibility and that could translate into commercial difficulties."
"The student and researcher exchange initiatives with the emerging economies must be strengthened in the Fifth framework programme, keeping them on as reciprocal a level as possible."
"This criterion of reciprocity should be geared to stimulating collaboration in areas where the emerging economies have already shown a high level of competence and competitiveness, and in the final analysis that is the core of the Pompidou report, which I naturally recommend to the approval of Parliament."
"Thank you, Mr Malerba, for your words and for so efficiently standing in for Mr Pompidou. We are aware of your excellent knowledge of this subject."
"Mr President, the Socialist Group warmly welcomes the communication from the Commission on the emerging economies and the need for closer cooperation in the research and development area, and very much welcomes the report by Mr Pompidou."
"We are sorry he is not here this morning but we congratulate the rapporteur nonetheless and also thank Mr Malerba for the very considerable attention he has given to this very important issue."
"These economies are developing very rapidly."
"We know that the Japanese and the United States are already very firmly established in these areas, so there is a need to act decisively and quickly."
"The biggest difficulty we have, though, is to put it into some sort of picture."
"I received in my mail this morning some interesting figures showing world energy demand."
"If you look at the per capita use of electricity, for instance, the countries we are talking about use at the very most only one third of what we are using."
"Some of them you can hardly see on the chart."
"If you look at the density of vehicles we are up at 500 per 100, 000 population and when you look at the countries that we are talking about in this report you need a magnifying glass to try and work out what the vehicle density is."
"A tremendous explosion is going to take place in the not-too-distant future in the scientific and technical area."
"The subjects that have been highlighted by the Commission for attention in the agro-industry area, in health, in communications technology, non-nuclear energy and biotechnology are all very relevant to this explosion and we very warmly welcome the way in which the Commission has put this together."
"There are going to be specific workshops in some of the countries and some specific studies on space technology, engineering, seismology and advanced materials."
"It is obvious from the communication that a great deal of work has been put into it."
"We hope that this will also build on the bilateral arrangements that are already well in place between Member States and these emerging economies."
"It is important that the Community should be involved in this."
"It should not just be a question of bilateral help."
"We very much need the Community dimension as well."
"The specific measures that the Commission has highlighted are a necessary part of the approach to ensure that the programme is not one that just looks at short-term industrial gain at the expense of long-term effective and beneficial cooperation."
"The Commission has got the ideas pretty well right as far as that is concerned."
"We also have to recognize that these economies are not all the same: some are advancing faster than others and some are advancing in different sectors, so that it needs a very wide approach, but nonetheless a very specific approach as far as each of the countries is concerned."
"The social and environmental issues that affect each country also have to be taken into account."
"I was able to attend the symposium that the Commission held last November and I would like to draw the attention of the House to two very important issues which emerged from that symposium."
"There was not a consensus and I hope these questions will be resolved by the operation of this programme."
"The first is whether we should be concentrating on the scientific end of cooperation or on the technology development part of it."
"You can argue it both ways."
"I must confess that very often my personal preference is to look more at the technology end rather than the scientific end."
"But I do not believe that you can completely separate them."
"The other interesting question was whether technical cooperation leads to business cooperation or whether it is business cooperation that leads to technical cooperation."
"Probably the answer is, as in most of these types of question, that it is a mixture of the two."
"I hope that the programme the Commission has put forward will help us to have a better understanding of these areas, because the contribution this has to make in the Fifth Framework Programme is what we must really focus on."
"Mr President, I must begin by making it quite clear that we support this motion for a resolution to foster RTD co-operation with emerging economies."
"However, it is very important to be cautious when qualifying a given country as an 'emerging economy' , since the combination of macro-economic criteria is not always applicable in given cases."
"You will have to, advisably, resort to a case-by-case examination, dealing with each agreement on its merits, and ensuring that prosperity is simultaneous with its development."
"We mean that, in developing agreements, we should put the most possible emphasis first of all on mutual benefits, ensuring social and economic results of European interest and social prospects which are favourable for the European Union as a whole, as could be the results of job creation; secondly, in the legal protection of the results and thirdly in seeking a fair joint funding set-up."
"On the other hand, we believe - given the dual character of these economies - that an undeniable consequence has been that of improving human rights in emerging economy countries, since we believe sincerely that, with the right type of project, this improvement in human rights situations will come about normally, since it is known that human rights nearly always evolve alongside the improvement in social, economic and cultural levels."
"This circumstance, together with that in paragraph 7, calls for a fair social and economic development, while paragraph 11 calls for conduct based on solidarity and paragraphs 4 and 9 are perfectly in keeping with application of bilateral agreements, which means that it is unnecessary to have any amendment on these matters."
"We also think that, generally speaking, the guidelines contained in the Commission communication are the right ones, as well as the emphasis on this particular aspect contained in the motion for a resolution which means that the PPE Group wishes to congratulate Mr Pompidou and also the Commission for its communication."
"Mr President, our Group is in full agreement with the Pompidou report, which has made a worthy contribution and far-reaching improvements to the Commission's communication on RTD cooperation with emerging economies."
"However, we have tabled an amendment aimed at improving trade union rights in these countries, calling for the proper establishment of cooperation relations in the field of research."
"We feel that the process of globalizing the world economy has led to other things, benefits of the European Union, and capital being invested in these countries, motivated by the high profits which can be reaped despite meagre salaries and the lack of trade union rights."
"We also feel that in the process of improving the profitability of these economic structures the introduction of research as an extra component should be added to that of low salaries."
"This overview means that any cooperation and undertakings by the European Union in terms of research programmes should be turned into yet another opportunity to fight one of the most dramatic consequences of globalisation: mass unemployment and the miserable exploitation of the working masses."
"Therefore we advise that, in addition to all of the conditions and precautions which have been properly introduced by Mr Pompidou and the Committee on Research, Technological Development and Energy, we should add a clause for the respect of trade union rights, since we have seen young children working, we have seen a lack of trade union freedom, we have seen hazardous work and an increase in working accidents in these countries as well as the use of violence - the epidemiologist Jaime Breihl pointed out that one of the most dangerous epidemics in these countries is violence."
"Therefore I think that we should back this motion, but as long as the amendment which we have tabled is passed as well."
"Mr President, in principle, cooperation with the world's emerging economies is to be recommended."
"It has already been pointed out that these countries differ widely from one another, but even within the countries themselves, the differences in the distribution of poverty and wealth are very great."
"It is therefore difficult to draw up a report that is relevant to every situation, and that is evident from this report."
"The basic needs and living conditions of the whole population are to be taken into consideration."
"That is one positive feature of this report."
"In this context, however, I wonder why there should be no partial financing."
"This means that only large-scale research projects will be supported, and that leads to centralization, so that it is then questionable whether there will be any narrowing of the gap between rich and poor."
"I take the view that specific projects for the poorer sections of the population, and technologies for the prevention of famine situations, e.g. in the areas identified, could also bring about synergistic effects."
"The encouragement of regional cooperation is also approved by us, as are programmes for exchanges of scientists, researchers and engineers."
"Improving the agricultural situation is a very important issue, and we discussed this at the FAO Conference."
"However, there is no mention here of the fact that this situation is often the result of the property-ownership conditions in these countries."
"Often there is no famine situation, but famine occurs because of the unfair distribution of property, and population growth, which is mentioned in this report, is not the cause."
"The BSE scandal shows that the encouragement of agricultural production on an industrial scale is the wrong approach for the world's emerging economies and developing countries."
"Someone has just pointed out that the human rights situation has to be taken into consideration."
"I believe that this should be included in agreements of this kind."
"If we conclude an agreement with China, then of course we must not forget about human rights."
"If this is not possible - and at the moment we have a disagreement with Mexico here - then these agreements should not be signed."
"Finally, on the report as a whole, I believe that it is a blank cheque for the Commission."
"The question is, what will the Commission do with it?"
"I hope, Mr Bangemann, that you will do your best, so that we shall not, at some subsequent date, have to set up a committee of inquiry on this report!"
"It is extremely important, for the future position of the European Union in a global world market, that the Commission and the European Parliament should recognize the special position of the so-called emerging economies of the world, in other words, those countries that can no longer be classed as developing countries, but at the same time cannot be regarded as real industrial countries."
"These countries harbour an enormous, in some cases unexploited, technological talent potential, they attract considerable foreign investment, and in some areas of state-of-the-art technology they have long been our competitors."
"These countries have already developed remarkable economic power in some sectors, and it is no coincidence that more than a few well-known European companies use Indian software, for example."
"Japan and the USA already have strong positions in these markets."
"The same applies, to a lesser extent, in the case of some Member States of the European Union."
"However, it is high time that the Commission, too, aimed its policy in these countries more towards those sectors that are already developed, and sought to achieve European participation in the state-of-the-art technology markets in these countries."
"The current action plan is an initial step in the right direction."
"It reveals the need for the European Union to take definite steps in order to ensure that it does not lag even further behind Japan and the USA in these countries, but starts to catch up with them."
"It is clear from this that countries which in some fields already occupy a very strong position can no longer be treated on the basis of development-aid criteria alone."
"On the contrary, our efforts must lie in the direction of effective cooperation in our mutual interest, cooperation in the sense of partnership, with the same rights and obligations, and in the sense of reciprocity, as the Commission puts it in its report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's communication must be examined in conjunction with the European Union's strategy in the context of the Fourth FRDP."
"One of the specific objectives of that framework programme is cooperation with non-member countries and international organizations in the field of research and technological development within the so-called INCO Programme."
"On behalf of the PPE Group I welcome Mr Pompidou's report."
"I too believe that future cooperation between the European Union and the world's emerging economies should not be based exclusively on the purely economics-based definition of this concept that has prevailed up to now."
"In recent decades, each of the countries concerned has had to cope with emerging industrialization against a background of very different starting conditions, and this has influenced their continued development."
"This has been my experience, particularly in the context of our work in the Latin America delegation."
"For this reason, I believe that every cooperation agreement between the European Union and the so-called emerging economies should be examined individually."
"I agree with the guidelines proposed by the Commission, and I believe, especially, that an initial exchange programme for scientists, researchers and engineers should be submitted soon, in order to encourage future cooperation in the field of research."
"In addition, I should like to emphasise that it would be desirable for a final report, containing an evaluation of this programme, to be produced by the end of 1998, which is when the Fourth FRDP comes to an end."
"We must not underestimate the strong position that some of these emerging economies already occupy in the world market."
"Moreover, we must expect some of the countries that are at present emerging economies to become industrialized countries within the next ten or twenty years."
"Others, which need more time to develop, have a population situation that will lead to their becoming major sales markets, regardless of their stage of development."
"The European Union must have a common, strong and positive strategy in the field of cooperation in research and development, because cooperation that is pursued intensively now will bear fruit in the future."
"Mr President, I am pleased that we agree with Parliament on almost all the major issues relating to cooperation with the world's emerging economies in our research and development policy projects."
"This is probably due, amongst other things, to the fact that we began our dialogue with Parliament some time ago, with a statement of principle."
"It has been proved again and again that if such a dialogue is opened at an early stage, then a whole range of difficulties will already have been removed by the time it comes to implementing what has been planned."
"This is good news, not least because, as all the speakers have quite rightly said, it is absolutely essential that we should undertake new initiatives in this area, for several reasons, including, of course, the fact that these emerging economies constitute what one might call a mixed bunch."
"Because the countries concerned are slowly emerging from the developing stage, however, we should not pick up on all the major difficulties that this implies, and all the development-policy considerations involved."
"This is a very clearly defined and specific programme, and so I think that we can allow ourselves not to try to solve all the problems that arise from development policy. Somebody mentioned human rights."
"This is a general problem that concerns our cooperation policy, and we have no intention of treating it here any differently from the way we treat it in other areas."
"Mr Adam has pointed out that we may have to decide between technology development projects on the one hand and scientific research projects on the other."
"We want our Fifth Framework Programme - and this is a sort of preparation for the Fifth Framework Programme - to concentrate more on the technology issues, one of the reasons being that here we can share the responsibilities between the Union, on the one hand, which should be concentrating on these matters, and the Member States, on the other, which are in a position to be much more active in basic research at university level."
"This will probably also mean that what Mr Adam said will become increasingly the case, in other words, that in this type of cooperation too, the accent will be placed more on technology development programmes."
"There is one point that has been the subject of a somewhat controversial debate between Parliament and the Commission, and I should just like to add here that the Commission's position may possibly develop further, and that is the question of how research programmes should be funded when those programmes involve cooperation between undertakings which will later become involved as competitors."
"Should such a research programme be funded in its entirety, or should it be financed only for the European participants, because the other participants will turn up as competitors later?"
"The traditional approach that the Commission has opted for here, following, I might add, a proposal from Parliament, is that in such cases only the European participants should be funded."
"I say that this approach is traditional because, as you know, in our thinking on industrial-policy we no longer see such a big contrast between cooperation and competition."
"One can cooperate and yet at the same time be a competitor, and there are many companies that do this, when they combine their resources for a limited purpose and for very clearly defined reasons, and then later compete against one another when the product is on the market, because such a product is, after all, only one part of the overall supply."
"This might also be a conceivable solution, but it is clear that these more modern considerations require time, and perhaps they may also require some convincing examples."
"I should also like to thank the rapporteur and his deputy again for their excellent cooperation."
"A lot of Parliament's work has gone into the report and, as I have already said, if we start work in good time, then, Mr Telkämper, we shall certainly have no need for any committees of inquiry."
"You seem to regard a committee of inquiry as a sort of threat, but I can assure you that the Commission regards a committee of inquiry as a normal element of democracy."
"I would not go so far as to say that we look forward to committees of inquiry, but naturally we accept them."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution) I call on Mr Malerba to congratulate Mr Pompidou on our behalf."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"I wonder whether you would accept a genuine mistake."
"You have just called a roll call vote and I automatically pressed the button."
"This is not my seat - this is Mr Lomas' seat."
"I pressed the button with Mr Lomas' card in it."
"I hope you will accept that as a genuine mistake, and the record can be amended accordingly."
"This will be checked and, if it is the case, your remark will be taken into account and the necessary rectification carried out."
"The demographic situation"
"The next item is the debate on the report (A4-0042/97) by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's report on the demographic situation in the European Union (1995) (COM(96)0060 - C4-0143/96)."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are to discuss the report on the demographic situation in Europe, but before I go into this in detail, I should like to thank the Commission and my colleagues for all their help in producing a report which we have managed to keep fairly concise, whilst still saying everything we wished to say."
"The demographic situation is changing, so we can no longer base our policy on the presumption that it will remain static, which it sometimes has, especially since the changes are expected to be more drastic and more rapid than they have been for decades."
"What is happening?"
"The population pyramid is being turned upside down."
"Population growth is likely to be minimal, but the composition of the population is set to change dramatically."
"The under-20 age group will decline, while the number of people aged over 65 will increase considerably."
"These developments will have a major impact on policies such as social security and pensions, employment, health care, regional policy and agriculture."
"An ever-decreasing active population will have to care for an increasingly large number of people who are not working."
"The pensions and health care costs in some Member States could even affect their chances of meeting the EMU convergence criteria, unless we do something to prevent it."
"So demographic changes can happen very quickly."
"I shall not quote any statistics here, since you can look at these for yourselves."
"The question now is what to do about it."
"Can we in the European Parliament, or more broadly in the European Union, have any influence over demographic change?"
"I think we should not deceive ourselves on this point."
"Having a baby for Europe, as one of my colleagues said, is hardly realistic, and it is an area in which we politicians should not become involved."
"The idea that the growing numbers of immigrants will replace the decline in the population is also not really an answer, although we should adopt a more humanitarian approach and stop worrying so much about them."
"We therefore have little scope for influencing demographic statistics, but what we can do as politicians is respond to changing circumstances."
"We need to focus our labour market policy on encouraging maximum participation among the potential workforce, and this means that people who are currently excluded from the labour market will have to be reintegrated into the employment process."
"If we are to do this, a great deal of attention will have to be given to education and training, since many of the excluded groups do not currently have the knowledge and skills that the labour market needs."
"We must put aside the idea that it is not worth training people over 40, particularly with an ageing workforce and in an increasingly computerized society where lifelong learning is a key factor in determining competitive positions in Europe."
"This has already been mentioned in the reports this week by Mrs Waddington and Mr van Velzen."
"Participation levels can also be increased by eliminating legal, fiscal and practical obstacles, for example by shifting employment taxes onto other bases such as production or energy."
"We shall, of course, have to create the right conditions for childcare and care for the elderly and the disabled, so that men and women can participate in the labour market on an equal footing."
"I have included an amendment from the PPE Group on this point, and I would draw your attention once again to the report by the Committee on Women's Rights."
"Demographic change also presents a major challenge when it comes to social security and pensions, in my opinion."
"Given the increasing individualization and flexibility on the labour market, the time seems ripe for a complete overhaul of the social security systems in the Member States."
"The solution to the problem lies in a whole raft of measures such as making the pensionable age more flexible, making greater use of capital investment systems - a point on which I hope Commissioner Bangemann agrees - and premium differentiation."
"But in addition to these measures, I think we need to go even further by working towards an integral approach to social security and health care."
"I think that Europe as a whole needs to start moving towards more flexible and individualized systems, as I am sure you will be glad to hear, Mr Bangemann, while at the same time respecting the principle of solidarity which forms the basis of our European social model."
"Part of the solution lies in modernizing social security, which some countries have already started doing, including my own."
"More competition in the insurance and retirement pension markets and more fiscal and legal freedom for private provision will also lead to greater efficiency and lower costs."
"So it is not that we are lacking in new ideas, but the rigidity of the existing systems in some Member States means that it is difficult to put these ideas into practice."
"I therefore urge that the Member States' demographic statistics should be produced in a comparable form."
"Europe must try to promote an integrated policy in order to cope with the changing circumstances as efficiently as possible, and this will mean that the Member States will be forced to take measures which will fundamentally change their existing systems and will be difficult in the short term."
"However, the Council does not yet seem to have grasped the seriousness of the demographic sea-change we are experiencing: it is happy to publish the figures, but it does not act on them."
"I would therefore urge that demographic trends should also be included in the annual employment report, or the Essen procedure as it is known."
"It may sound trite to say so, but the time bomb is still ticking away before our very eyes."
"If we are to live with the consequences that this time bomb will undoubtedly bring, we need to think long and hard about our labour market policy and our social model very soon."
"The sooner the better, in fact."
"Society will not wait patiently for us to wake up."
"If Europe wishes to maintain its position on the world market and its social model, then we must stop running away from reality."
"We must not be frightened to enter the twenty-first century, we must have the courage and enthusiasm to seize the opportunities at hand."
"Mr President, I should like to thank and congratulate, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and also my political group, Mrs Boogerd-Quaak for the excellent work carried out on this 2nd yearly report on the demographic situation of the European Union."
"We should like to send our thanks for her sensitivity in incorporating virtually all the content of the Opinion issued by the Committee on Women's Rights."
"I regret that, as is usual in the European Parliament, when there are subjects related very directly to women's issues, the family and in the case with older people, there are always put at the end of the agenda."
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, this report is a snapshot of developments in Europe and ways in which those developments affect the success or failure of a project which, day by day, is based on an economy of productive and technological processes which are increasingly directed at competitiveness and effectiveness rather than human resources."
"The effects of the drop in the birth rate and the drastic ageing of our population have considerably altered the reality of a social Europe for the 21st century."
"Old Europe will be full of old people."
"To the so-called third age we will have to add a fourth category, the fourth generation, whose needs will have important effects on social, health and pension matters."
"There will be two generations of non-productive sectors and the productive generation will go on decreasing in ratio."
"Obviously, in this debate we will have to look at central subjects such as the cost of employment, the possible increase in retirement age, the conditions for early retirement, private pension systems and the cost of social security in general."
"On these aspects, the rapporteur would like the Commission to launch a debate on the future of old age pensions in Europe and to draw up a list of creative solutions and new methods for funding systems. I should like to congratulate it on its suggestion because we must also show imagination and properly manage all existing resources in order to renovate social and health services so that they are properly tailored to the needs of our peoples."
"We should also be happy at the fact that life expectancy has increased but we should not forget that this life expectancy in some cases will be independent while in others it will be dependent."
"The loss of autonomy creates the need for aid and this should be dealt with quantitatively and qualitatively without the expenditure by states on welfare policies growing excessively."
"As far as social matters are concerned we have to emphasise the fact that in the last twenty years we have seen significant changes to family structures, which have led to the diminution of the number of people in family units and a redefining of the role of women."
"This makes it more difficult for elderly disabled people to count on the traditional support of their families which they used to be able to in times gone by."
"This problem is getting worse in urban areas, where houses are small, there are architectural barriers, as well as economic problems and a lack of alternative resources."
"There has been an increase in the number of elderly people living alone, something which is acknowledged as a factor of social risk."
"That is why it is so necessary to develop social health projects which are innovative and which, incorporated into existing welfare policies, can ensure an increase in the living standards of young people and elderly people alike: crèches for young children and day centres for elderly people, home help and, above all, an assessment of the findings of the application of these measures which, bringing together the private and public sectors, have forced people and the authorities to set viable priorities in terms of existing economic resources available at a given time."
"We have to boost measures for reconciling family and working life, generally reducing working hours, granting parental leave for men and women alike."
"We must families with children, especially single parent families and disabled families."
"Enabling women to take part in working life will actually contribute to economic growth, but I would not like to conclude without recalling the great service which women do to their families and all of those women who help their working spouses despite the fact that they do not figure in the statistics and that the European Union has only been dealing with their situation since 1986."
"If the European Union really wants a good working population it will have to count on the potential of women."
"Yes, to the tertiary sector, but new forms of part time working, atypical working and temporary work should be shared with men without giving up on progress before the arrival of the Euro, and in the Intergovernmental Conference we should locate human dignity in its proper place."
"Mr President, I would like to thank rapporteur Boogerd-Quaak for an exceptional report and for the excellent co-operation while drawing up the same."
"We are in the middle of an enormous transformation in society."
"In Sweden, my native country, we do not quite have such a dramatic future in front of us as the past we have just left behind."
"We are at different stages in this development, and it is important not to become pessimistic over this."
"We see the costs piling up, but there are also opportunities with such a development."
"Progress is dramatic and will affect all strata of society."
"The number of older people will increase drastically, and the most elderly people in particular will need substantial medical care, etc."
"At the same time both the active working population and the number of children and young people will decrease."
"As mentioned, this will affect all areas of society such as for example the pension system."
"I believe that the pension system must be altered in all of the EU countries."
"It is important to have a flexible system that gradually allows for working life to give way to an albeit active life which can still play a useful role in society."
"We are also talking about equal pension systems."
"This is not the case with the current private systems which are calculated purely on a financial basis and with women often living longer than men and therefore having to pay more for their pension."
"The state systems should therefore equal with a good basic pension both for men and women."
"We need to expand health care and medical services, particularly for older people."
"New types of housing are required."
"We must change society, public transport, accessibility and convert our houses to make them accessible for all people."
"This is another area of society that is being affected."
"Education has already been mentioned."
"If we look at the changes in the active working population, the number of young working people is decreasing while the older group of working people aged between 40 and 65 is increasing."
"At the same time, society is constantly undergoing changes as a result of advances in technology."
"This tells us that a basic education is no longer sufficient for our young people."
"In order to compete, we must continually educate the people throughout their working life."
"This is where most of the population is found and these are the people who will need to take part in the development of new technology."
"We must of course increase the birth-rate."
"If we look at the labour market, the problem cannot be solved through immigration."
"Immigration would have to be enormous."
"The problem can only really be solved by women entering the labour market."
"In this area, different countries are at different stages and development will continue."
"However, as result of this it can no longer be left to women to care for the elderly and children, but all of us, men and women, will have to share this responsibility."
"Society must also play a part."
"Child care must be expanded and an insurance system created making it possible to combine parenthood with a working life."
"Finally, I would like to say this: let us not just see the problems but also the opportunities."
"The opportunities exist, not least when it comes to the third age and the fact that older people should be considered as a resource."
"Mr President, Europe is increasing as far as the age of its people is concerned."
"Europe is decreasing as far as the number of its people is concerned."
"Is our position in danger?"
"Are the data on which these developments are based even meaningful?"
"Can they be used to develop strategies?"
"In the Commission's second annual Report on the Demographic Situation it is clear that, in addition to the three generations that we have been familiar with up to now - young people in eduction, people of working age, and pensioners - a new generation is emerging, that of the over seventy-fives."
"Their numbers are growing considerably."
"It is a good thing that people are remaining active longer, thanks to medical progress and better health care provision."
"On the other hand, however, there is a shortage of care, integration and solidarity."
"This increase in age has serious consequences for our social security systems."
"There are considerable differences of opinion between Member States, as well as considerable differences in distribution."
"Matters at issue include the level of pensions, in one country basic protection, in another the essential performance-related element, here the lengthening of people's working lives, there the forced early retirement scheme, which operates at great cost to the tax-payer but which has led to hardly any additional jobs for young people."
"As ever, women get less than their fair share when it comes to calculating pensions."
"Of course measures have to be fundable, and so we have to say yes to the reform of social policy, but at the same time we must say no to the dismantling of social policy."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak is to be congratulated on her report, which sets out specific priorities."
"We agree with her about greater differentiation in the light of the vital regional differences between densely populated towns and isolated villages."
"The effects on traffic planning, regional planning, housing policy and social policy are very grave, as are the effects on our European structural funds."
"The amendments proposed by my group, the Group of the European People's Party, have been included almost without exception, and relate to the world of work."
"Fewer and fewer people are employed here, though those that are employed are highly productive."
"Bigger companies, in particular, are unfortunately sacrificing the experience factor."
"Experience is becoming a handicap."
"People are excluded or dismissed, instead of taking advantage of their knowledge, their meticulous work, and their reliability, and it is quite likely that their innovative potential is being totally underestimated."
"Participation in the labour market must be extended."
"This applies to younger people, the proportion of whom, in the total population, is declining drastically, though this is no excuse for 'running down' educational measures."
"On the contrary, future opportunities are increased by a more broadly based basic education system, with many different qualifications and language skills."
"The same applies to women, who are still just as disadvantaged as ever, in everything from pay to working hours."
"What are we actually doing, in policy terms, to achieve a more child-friendly society, again in the light of the demographic data that have been described to us?"
"This is a broad field for European 'added value' , which could be used to coordinate national policies, to supplement them and - to stay with the metaphor - to fertilize them."
"Mr President, I too, on behalf of my group, would like warmly to congratulate the rapporteur on this exceptionally interesting report."
"The fact that Europe's population is ageing is not new, we all know it."
"The dramatic reduction of the birth rate on our continent and the parallel increase of average life expectancy, together with headlong economic development and the increase in population shown by some other parts of the planet, make the situation here particularly disadvantageous."
"In the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, not only is a clear picture presented of what is happening, but in addition, we are given a specific warning."
"This is the second report on the demographic situation in the European Union with 1995 as its reference year."
"This time the report is selective, because it aims to present a first general picture at the Community level of the predominant factor of our democratic future, in other words the extent and acceleration of the ageing process among our population."
"I would like to dwell on three points which the rapporteur considers to be basic areas that will suffer serious consequences from the ageing of the population, because they are very interesting: the labour market, social welfare systems, and health care."
"She would like to see increased proportions of participation in the labour market, especially among groups in which these proportions are below average."
"We are speaking about women, young people, immigrants and the aged. The report also points out the consequences in the area of social welfare, concerning the type of risks insured, the obligations to provide finance, and the distribution."
"In addition, a phenomenon is examined in depth which the Commission mentions only rather marginally. That is, the inequalities created by demographic developments, on the one hand between different regions, and on the other hand between urban and rural areas."
"It is also worth noting that demographic development has an important effect on the Union's economic and social conditions."
"For all those reasons, our group supports the report and will vote in favour of it."
"Mr President, demography is and must be the basis of all representations of society."
"Because man is, and must be, both the end of society and the means which constructs it."
"Demographyy cannot be looked upon as an expression or statistical representation of isolated man, each one, each number, one woman or one man."
"Demography reflects social evolutions and dynamics."
"In the apparent innocuousness of numbers, all of this represents a real and well clarified story of people living in society."
"The concerns brought to us by this report - and I must very warmly congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her excellent work - on the basis of the Commission document, are very relevant, they are some of the most essential concerns and they deserve a different degree of attention and another position on our agenda."
"Demographic evolution is, within safe limits, something which is predictable."
"Demographic structures alter according to rules which we can minimally know and minimally influence."
"Participation in the labour market, social security and pension, health care and regional asymmetries are, it almost seems needless to say, indelibly marked by a predictable demographic evolution."
"To ignore this and pretend to be surprised, to overlook something that can be predicted and prevented only shows that people have not been placed at the centre of our attention."
"Problems such as reducing working hours, in the framework of a determined organisation of time according to certain structures, and that of funding social security would not exist, or would have a totally different dimension, if society were not blinded by the objectives of profit making and the accumulation of capital."
"We, Europe, are a continent which is losing in terms of demographic weight."
"This is a certain fact in quantitative terms but it can be debated if we take quality which we could have in terms of elderly people, life experience, experience of work, a truly human capital."
"This is a debate which leaves us frustrated because it is not at the basis of all other debates. In any case, let us know how to make the most of the little that we have achieved."
"Let us use this report as a means of promoting a continued debate on this subject."
"Mr President, I think that Mrs Boogerd-Quaak has produced a very good report, but my group feels there is still something missing."
"I will come straight to the point."
"I have no intention of joining in with everyone else in saying how terrible these demographic trends are, because to tell the truth, with the natural resources at our disposal, it is probably not such a bad idea for there to be a few less of us in future."
"In fact, I think it can only be a good thing for the environment and the planet."
"Of course, it will be a challenge to find a solution to the problems we shall face in the short term, as I am sure we would all agree."
"Quite honestly, I do not think it is sensible to pay 'breeding bonuses' as a means of tackling these problems."
"I do not think that expecting people to lie back and think of Europe is the right way to go about things, even if it worked."
"What we need to do is to ensure that we have a child-friendly environment in which both men and women are responsible for bringing up their children, and in which they can have enough parental leave and childcare facilities to make it less complicated for them to have children and easier for them to bring up their children in a normal way."
"Things are made extremely complicated for them at the moment, and it is not without good reason that women are delaying having children longer and longer."
"Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's report calls for more privatization, particularly in the pensions market, but I am not convinced that this is a good idea."
"More privatization also means that women will have to pay more premiums into private pension schemes if they live longer, and I wonder whether this will actually be the case."
"Looking at taxation, we can see that more care will be needed, and that taxes will have to go up if the burden of care is to be a collective responsibility, rather than being left to women."
"So taxes will certainly have to be increased."
"But what is tending to happen in the European Union?"
"The Member States are using taxes to compete with each other and are cutting collective provisions to the bone."
"Finally, the Dutch presidency has insisted on deleting age from the non-discrimination article."
"How could they think of doing this, when we are going to have to rely more and more on older people to be active in future, not just among their friends and families, but also at work?"
"Mr President, the sole merit of this report is that it calls attention to the disastrous demographic situation in the European Union."
"But it is strangely silent regarding the causes of the falling birth rate, of which the rapporteur pretends to be unaware, and the measures proposed seem to me to be contrary to the most elementary common sense."
"If European couples are having fewer children, the reason, quite obviously, is that they regard the future as very uncertain, and that the Member States of the European Union grant no financial incentive, or not enough, to those planning large families."
"The possibility of parental leave associated with a reduction in working hours is a proposal which would be ineffective in practice."
"Only the introduction of a parental wage, enabling women - or those men who wish to do so - to devote themselves fully to the education of their children can improve the birth rate."
"This measure, which has recently been applied in France although timidly and inadequately, has already produced positive effects."
"In any case, it is impossible to consider the problem of the falling birth rate without mentioning the infanticide laws adopted by the European Union countries. Those laws have allowed, with absolute impunity, a form of genocide which is unprecedented throughout history, literally a crime against the peoples of Europe."
"In this context, we cannot escape the fact that the masonic lodges which plotted this massacre of the innocents are the same who are now preparing to campaign in favour of euthanasia."
"First the unborn children, then the old."
"Already I, as a physician and a humanist, have long been faced by the agonizing question: where are they going to stop?"
"Among the solutions suggested by the rapporteur, there is one, the one that recurs most insistently, which is disquieting."
"It aims to increase the influx of immigration from the Third World, endorsing what has just been said with a straight face by a Belgian government minister, a socialist, who is not yet in prison, who said, ' Immigration is a blessing for our country, ' heedless of the inexorably lengthening queues of unemployed people of every nonEuropean nationality, political pseudo-refugees, coming to Belgium because they can earn more there without working than they can in their home countries by working, while in ten years the proportion of non-European foreigners among Belgium's prison population has increased from 15.4 to 28.7 % - proof, if proof were needed, that the cumbersome policies for immigrant integration are ineffective."
"I am equally surprised to see this report proposing a new European development policy for rural areas."
"If this means a U-turn away from the suicidal measures regularly adopted by this Parliament on matters such as the setaside of farmland, the fixing of quotas and the grubbing-up of vines, I need hardly say that it has my enthusiastic support."
"Also, Mr President, on reading this report I was struck by the phrase - a socialist invention - ' the inalienable right to health' ."
"No doctor, however qualified, can guarantee his patients' health."
"Only God can give health."
"It would be better to talk about the right to receive care, the best care, for everybody."
"This is an elementary precaution - otherwise, why not take the principle further and talk about an inalienable right to intelligence?"
"Talking about health, this report again echoes the unending liberal chorus: let's privatize social security."
"How can anyone imagine for a moment that insurance companies, whose sole ambition is to make money, would do better than systems based on national solidarity at financing the cost of medicine - an ever-increasing cost because of technical advances and increasing life expectancy."
"Of course, there are reforms that are needed, and they will be painful for some."
"In particular, there is the need to depoliticize the mutual insurance associations in Belgium."
"And in conclusion, Mr President, I must say, and say again, that it will be impossible to create employment in Europe while we continue to let ourselves be overrun by every conceivable product manufactured outside our borders, in countries where the cost of labour is 40 or 50 times less than it is here."
"We must free our enterprises from the social burdens they bear, replacing those burdens with a social VAT from which our products will be exempt on export, though it will be applied to imported products."
"We must turn our backs on global free trade, on unbridled, stateless liberalism, which will eventually reduce our populations to starvation."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her excellent report, but I would also like to thank the Commission for its Report on the Demographic Situation in the European Union."
"With this report, the Commission has given us a document that shows everyone - Parliament, the Commission, and above all the Council - that there is an urgent need for action."
"The figures themselves are nothing new; they come as no surprise."
"We all examined these problems intensively in 1993, the European Year of the Elderly and of solidarity between generations."
"At the time, the Commission published many different, helpful studies, and Parliament unanimously approved the Fayot-Chanterie report, which incorporated the recommendations of the Senior Citizens' Parliament."
"So what has happened in the meantime?"
"Although no one doubts the urgent need for action as a result of the alarming demographic developments, so far nothing has happened."
"Or has it?"
"Although the foreseeable changes in demographic structure will affect mainly the labour market, and it is urgently necessary to promote education and training measures, and above all women in employment, with accompanying measures such as child care, in the Member States secure jobs are being changed into casual jobs with no social security, training measures are being cut short or omitted, and the financing of child-care facilities is being reduced."
"Unemployment in the EU is becoming an increasingly pressing problem."
"Yet so far the Council has been unable to decide, when revising the Treaty, whether to include a chapter on combatting unemployment."
"Now we come to pensions."
"It is mainly elderly women who receive inadequate old-age pensions."
"The demand for a minimum pension, which would guarantee everyone a decent standard of living in their old age, has been up for discussion for several years now."
"Those Member States which ought to have taken action, however, have so far not made a move."
"Guaranteeing health protection, medical treatment and health care is becoming increasingly more complicated because of the rapid rise in the number of older and elderly people."
"So what are the Member States doing?"
"Almost everywhere they are cutting back on health protection and, as far as guaranteeing health care is concerned, they are making practically no effort to make the necessary provision or to train health-care personnel."
"So what has been happening at EU level since 1993?"
"The action programme for the elderly expired in 1996."
"The Council, in other words my country, Germany - and I am ashamed to have to say it - and the United Kingdom, have blocked a new programme for the exchange of information and the encouragement of innovative projects."
"Parliament and the Commission had asked for the revision of the Treaty to include a non-discrimination clause, and the Irish Presidency, thankfully, included it in the Council draft."
"Last week, however, we learned that the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of age and disability has been scrapped, and so I am appealing to the fifteen Member States to reinstate, in the draft treaty, the prohibition on discrimination on grounds of age and disability."
"Mr President, we are conducting a very important debate on the implications of population change inside the European Union. It is astonishing that, while demography is a science where forecasts can be reasonably accurate, little account is taken of the implications of those forecasts in policies for dealing with relevant problems at national level, and to a certain extent at Union level as well."
"Very important issues have been touched on here: the implications of the new equilibria which are going to emerge for the labour market, for immigration policy - an issue we must certainly return to - and for reform of the welfare state and the pensions system."
"State intervention can certainly provide some solutions to the new problems: it can provide a better legal context, for example for the labour market."
"The family must be at the centre of our concerns and our actions."
"In fact the family has the answer to the rise in the birth rate and to better demographic balance, and to problems like welfare in an ageing society."
"The voluntary sector can also play a major role."
"We talk a great deal about subsidiarity, but we must reestablish the fundamental importance of responses from citizens, from families, and from the voluntary sector, and reduce the illusion that state and public intervention can produce a satisfactory answer to these problems."
"Mr President, our Group as has already been pointed out, is fully behind the report drafted by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, as well as the major amendments and improvements tabled and introduced by the Committee on Women's Rights, as already pointed out by Mrs Benassar Tous."
"However, I should like to point out that demography, the demographic phenomenon, is not a phenomenon which is autonomous of society or without a consequence of economic models; that has always been the case, from prehistory until today."
"The growth in human population in prehistory is the consequence of changes which took place in the palaeolithic age; growth during the Middle Ages is also a consequence of changes which took place, and the same is true of the beginning of the industrial revolution."
"At this moment in time if the population is actually diminishing in Europe and having problems, then this is due to our economic model and should send out a clear message to our people: there are too many people and too many young people and at the same time there is no possibility for demography to advance."
"Therefore, I think that we have to be responsible and we have to ask questions about the economic model which at present is throwing young people off the work market and suggest changes to our economic model."
"If we carry on this way we are going to go over the precipice and the proposals which we would like to put forward are the following: first of all, an urgent reduction in working hours, because to do the opposite will not create jobs for everyone; secondly, we must maintain the welfare state because that is the only way, with increases in employment, that we can maintain pensions and offer appropriate conditions for health, social services, etc; thirdly, we must fully incorporate women into the labour market, and respect all of their rights."
"This is the only way in which we can head towards the fully employed society which is the only guarantee for European demography to be a favourable and positive perspective."
"Otherwise we are saying one thing and doing another."
"Mr President, we all have a vested interest in this report, because none of us is getting any younger."
"I, too, want to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report on the Commission's second annual report on the demographic situation in the European Union."
"I come from a country, Ireland, which in some ways is out of step with the major demographic trends evident in other EU Member States."
"Recent figures show that the population could increase by up to 10 % over the next 10-15 years."
"Of course, our birth rate has fallen remarkably since about 1980, but we still have one of the highest proportions of young people in our population."
"The current healthy state of the Irish economy, including a labour market which has increased by 10 % over the last 5 years, has meant that our dependency ratio is actually improving."
"The rapporteur correctly identifies the major demographic challenges that we face here in the European Union and that we will have to meet in the future."
"Firstly - and many people have mentioned this - is the whole question of the number of women at work, and this will obviously now be increased."
"This, in turn, means that we will have to have employment policies that are much more female-friendly than in the past: we need shorter working hours, more job-sharing and improved maternity laws."
"Secondly, we should encourage older people to remain at work longer if they so wish."
"There is a significant step which the Commission could take with regard to this and that would be to abandon its ridiculous age-discrimination policies."
"Thirdly, the Member States will have to redesign their pension scheme policies - and this has been mentioned too by many speakers - so that the principle of solidarity between the generations can be maintained."
"Of course the Commission must now immediately initiate the debate on the future of old age pensions in Europe and work out new ways of financing these systems."
"People cannot go on working until they are in their nineties; we have to provide some equitable way of paying those pensions in the future, and now is the responsibility and the time to do that."
"Finally, the European Union's and the Member States' policies must give greater attention to maintaining a healthy democratic division between urban and rural areas."
"The Commission, in the review of the structural funds, must give consideration to the various regional imbalances."
"Mr President, first of all I should just like to say how very much I congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her report, and of course I also welcome the Commission report."
"I believe that it is very important for us to keep on tackling this subject because, quite simply, we have a responsibility towards future generations."
"It is therefore important that we should concern ourselves with this subject."
"I should like to take up one point that is frequently mentioned but seldom really discussed, and that is the role played by healthy families in the context of population development."
"In those regions of Europe where the traditional family still plays an important role, the changes in the national economy resulting from the shift in the population age structure are much less noticeable and more easily coped with than in those regions, and above all in large conurbations, in which the destruction of the family has already reached an advanced stage."
"A functioning family is simply in a better position to absorb difficulties, because the parts of the family are less dependent on state institutions."
"However, I should also like to make it quite clear that when I talk about the family I mean a father, mother and children living together and, if possible, another generation as well, and I do not mean an informal arrangement in which partners of the same sex live together, or a relationship that simulates a marriage, of the kind that is, I regret to say, mistakenly promoted in the Lindholm report."
"Unfortunately, our tax legislation in most cases punishes families who have children, whilst at the same time it gives material advantages to childless couples and couples of the same sex, thereby making an enormous contribution to the negative development of the population age structure and the distribution of wealth."
"In this sense, I see the report as a clear appeal for families to be given more support in future, and for less support to be constantly given to small, vociferous minorities."
"Mr President, the excellent report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak deserves our applause because demography is an extremely serious problem."
"Our age-pyramid already seems to have a very weak base, which means that it is bound to collapse."
"We must stop Old Europe being converted into a decrepit and regressive Europe and that is the role of the European Parliament."
"The excellent report which we are debating today insists greatly on means of attacking the effects of the demographic crisis."
"However, I think we should try to look at the causes."
"Demographic movements only change in that they correct the causes in the medium term."
"Therefore, I think that this report, which is a very good approach from the point of view of social assistance, should also have a couple more viewpoints added to it."
"First of all, the cultural one."
"We really must favour family life."
"In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy we are spending money on favouring the Euro; it should also favour the family and family values, parenthood; we should eliminate a certain hedonistic and materialist life style which is latent in the substratum of modern society."
"We really must favour family life, parenthood, respect for elderly people; all of this has to be the object of cultural promotion, just as women's rights and just as the future single currency will also have to be promoted."
"Finally, in terms of direct taxation, we really must make sure that family expenditure is not taxed, as happens in some of our member countries."
"Mrs Banotti wishes to speak."
"I would ask Mr Bangemann to be patient."
"You have the floor, Mrs Banotti."
"Mr President, you and I have many happy encounters here on the floor."
"We can meet outside too, if you so wish."
"We are coming to the end of a long week."
"Thank you very much for the invitation."
"Mr President, There are many things on which Mr von Habsburg and I would not agree."
"Unfortunately, for feminist women, the family has become sort of battleground."
"Notwithstanding by feminist credentials, I have to say that I still believe that the family is the most satisfactory and effective social union for the care both of the young and the old."
"That does not mean that the women become the primary carers and the rest of the activities in those units is carried out by the men."
"I see the family as having a very real relevance both at the beginning and end of life."
"Mrs Malone is quite correct when she says that our birth rate is rising but, unfortunately, it is rising in areas where the children do not have the best possible advantages for the future."
"My mother died a month ago."
"She was the mother of six children and we were all able to give her the care and love she needed at the end of her life."
"I have one child, as do many people in this Chamber."
"Who is going to take care of us when the time comes - not just financially but also with the love and attention that the elderly need at that stage in their lives."
"We have to think about this."
"We have to put a real value on those who care at both the beginning and end of people's lives."
"This applies to both men and women."
"I am happy to see that in the caring provisions men are increasingly becoming, for example, state-registered nurses, giving wonderful care and cheering up the old ladies."
"I hope there will be plenty of men around when I need care at the end of my life."
"It would make life a lot happier for me - and also for you Mr Bangemann."
"Mr President, I have just one question for Mr Bangemann."
"Following his lyrical observations on the state of the world in general, I would very much like to know whether he is really of the opinion that the various contributions that Members have made to the debate were all reactionary and ideologically tainted, and only his remarks were modern and ideology-free."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for his comments, but I did not hear him say that the report contains a number of excellent recommendations across a broad spectrum, which he intends to adopt."
"I should like to hear him say that."
"The Commission is able to accept the proposals."
"That was apparent from what I said, but I can confirm it again now."
"To Mrs Schmidbauer, I should like to say that what I actually said here was that some of the speakers - and I did not name any names, nor did I list them all - expressed a certain traditional, or, if you prefer, conservative and reactionary approach, and I was trying to illustrate a different approach."
"That shows that we need a political debate here, so that we can arrive at a result that will be acceptable to as many people as possible."
"However, you cannot assume - though I think that is what you sometimes appear to be trying to do - that a Commissioner speaking here is simply reading out what his staff have written down for him and what is, as it were, a bureaucratic confirmation of certain points."
"When a Commissioner gets down to specific political opinions, and argues them here, then you ought to be able to tolerate it if they do not coincide with your own."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"(Parliament adopted the resolution)"
"The Commission's report on the demographic situation in the European Union and the European Parliament's report presented by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak, are somewhat discouraging documents. They highlight the scale and increasing speed of the aging process in our population, which they regard as 'the factor that will dominate our demographic future' , but fail to offer any analysis of the causes or propose any ideas that might remedy the situation."
"Indeed, Parliament's report merely offers partial suggestions for adapting the labour market, the social systems and healthcare to the supposedly inevitable presence of an increasing proportion of elderly people in the future."
"But these adjustments will not take us very far."
"The Commission, moreover, explains in its own report that in order to compensate for the global financial burdens caused by aging it will be necessary to achieve an increase in productivity far beyond anything that has been achieved in the past - an improbable hypothesis, since aging itself, by increasing the average age of the working population, is liable to reduce productivity."
"This situation seems all the more worrying in that the excess social burdens caused by the older population are going to have a little more impact, in the medium term, on the competitiveness of European nations against the young populations of South-East Asia."
"In this world of runaway free trade, which the European Union has so irresponsibly helped to bring about, the burden of aging is going to be yet another handicap for us, accelerating unemployment which itself, as we all know, generates additional social burdens and handicaps."
"To limit the damage, we should have secured acceptance, during the GATT negotiations, of the legitimacy in international trade of certain forms of duty to compensate for excess social costs."
"Sadly, we are now farther away from that than ever."
"Probably, then, we are laying the foundations here for social disasters that none of our political leaders will have had the courage to oppose or even the foresight to predict."
"At any rate, the two reports under consideration today say nothing about such disasters, which we regard as an additional cause for regret."
"Nor do they say anything about the only radical solution - the possibility of a family policy to boost the birth rate."
"Such a policy has, in fact, reached a total dead end in many European countries, and certainly in France, for shortsighted budgetary reasons but also for other reasons that we hear less about, perhaps because they illustrate too graphically the vicious circle in which we are locked."
"Today, according to statistics recently published in France, 70 % of families with more than six children are foreign, as are 50 % of families with five children."
"Furthermore, the incentive effect of an improved family policy must logically be stronger among foreign parents who have come from poor countries."
"Finally, two-thirds of births in all large families in France are of African or Maghreb origin, which is soon liable to cause far greater problems of integration than those we face today."
"Overall, then, in these circumstances, no government dares give a fresh boost to family policy, for fear that the easing of the burden of aging that would result might not be overcompensated by an increase in the burden of integration (which itself, I may note in passing, may be a handicap in international competition)."
"Total deadlock."
"So everything follows inevitably from something else."
"Unless the countries of Europe and the Union radically change their immigration policy, there is a serious risk that none of these problems can be solved: not the problem of family policy, not the problem of the birth rate, not the problem of aging, not the problem of the vast gap in competitiveness which is opening between this continent and the rest of the world."
"The Report on the Demographic Situation in the European Union is sensible and helpful, because it expresses the essential aspects of development in the Community, and offers everyone the opportunity to understand the effects of individual projects on a specific area."
"We too note with concern the ageing of the population, the rising costs of social security schemes and the changes in family life."
"However, we believe that immigration, and improved access to the employment market for immigrants, is the wrong approach."
"The problems are much more likely to be solved by reforms, beginning with family policy, and passing via tax incentives and better social protection, through to the restructuring of the social security system, turning it into a combined system of personal provision and state provision."
"It is precisely in times of high unemployment - and in the course of this week we were given a sample of what is happening on our streets - that we need to ensure first of all that our own citizens have work."
"In the Year against Racism and Xenophobia, we should not forget that unemployment and social insecurity often give rise to racist attacks on immigrants, who then become the scapegoats for this short-sighted policy."
"And it is essential that we should prevent that."
"In consideration of this clarification, however, we non-attached Members are voting in favour of the report by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak."
"This is not an explanation of vote, it is to follow up the point I made earlier this morning."
"As Members will recall I raised a point on the resolution on the suspension of GSP to Burma, asking if the Commission would clarify whether in fact it required unanimity or qualified majority voting to implement the measure, because it was not the decision in principle but an implementing decision."
"I am pleased and grateful to report that since the point was raised this morning the message has been conveyed to Commissioner Marín and he has confirmed that the decision will be by qualified majority vote and not by unanimity as was stated in the debate yesterday, which of course means that no single country will be able to block the measure when it is discussed on 24 March."
"I would like to thank the Commission and in particular Commissioner Marín for the swift clarification of the position."
"Thank you Mr Ford."
"I have no doubt that Mr Bangemann will pass that on to Mr Marín."
"You have the floor, Mr Hallam, on a point of order."
"Mr President, on a point of order."
"As you know, there is going to be a general election in the United Kingdom within the next few weeks."
"A Member of this House is actually a declared candidate in this general election."
"I was half expecting to see him put in an appearance this week, or possibly even to vote."
"I wonder whether it would be possible for you, as President, to write to the electors of Putney in London, pointing out that Sir James Goldsmith has hardly taken part in the proceedings of this House during the time he has been elected."
"What on earth is he doing seeking another job when it is quite obvious that the job he already has is beyond him?"
"Mr Hallam that was not a point of order and I cannot answer your question."
"Adjournment of the session"
"We have completed our business."
"I should like to thank everyone who has assisted us and you, yourselves, for helping me. The calmness of this session does nothing to reduce the importance of its content."
"I think that as a result I am going to have a most enjoyable week-end."
"I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament."
"(The sitting was closed at 12 noon)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 14 March 1997."
"Approval of the Minutes"
"The Minutes of the sitting of Friday, 14 March have been distributed."
"Are there any comments?"
"Mr President, before the sitting begins I should like to mention here a political incident which does not appear to me to be very pleasant in so far as it concerns the Honourable Member, Mr Martens, who stated in Lisbon that the party with which I cooperate is a party of the extreme right."
"In an interview published on 29 March Mr Martens accused the CDS-Partido Popular, with which I work as an independent and of which my colleagues, Mr Girão Pereira and Mrs Celeste Cardona are stalwart members, of being an extreme right-wing party."
"And why?"
"The answer is simple: because we dared to support a referendum in Portugal on the Maastricht Treaty."
"Not a serious crime."
"This party was then expelled from the PPE and it was Mr Martens who came to Lisbon to do this dirty job, making uncharitable threats and by differences of opinion..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"Mr Rosado Fernandes, that is neither a point of order nor a personal statement, since it is something which took place outside the Parliament."
"Rule 108 covers the rebuttal of personal remarks made within the Parliament, but not the discussion of a political row which took place outside the Parliament."
"I am sorry, but I cannot allow you to make such a speech now."
"It is my duty to cut this speech short, since it is bound to give rise to other personal remarks on topics which are neither on the agenda nor have any bearing on the Rules of Procedure."
"I am sorry, but it must be so."
"... (without microphone) directly personal to us all."
"I think I have always avoided making personal attacks; it is not my custom to do so and I should like..."
"I think that personal attacks are typical of the decadence of our democracy, are typical of those who want to conceal the fact, for example, that the Social Democrat Group has gone over to the PPE..."
"(The President cut the speaker off)"
"I am sorry, Mr Rosado Fernandes, this is not a personal attack."
"These are political opinions, but this is not the time for them according to the Rules of Procedure."
"I regret that I cannot allow you to speak."
"Mr President, can I simply point out to Members that the signing-in sheets are now back inside the Chamber."
"I hope Members will draw that to the attention of their colleagues who may be wandering around outside looking for them."
"Thank you, Mr Balfe."
"You know that this was at the initiative of the Quaestors, who tried to find the least inconvenient way possible."
"(The Minutes were approved)"
"Mr President, on the subject of the agenda and the work of the Conference of Presidents under Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure, unfortunately Parliament has still not set up a monitoring committee in order to ensure that the requirements of the Committee of Inquiry on BSE are met."
"Despite many letters, following the decision by the Committee on Agriculture, you have still not replied to them."
"Since 1 April of this year, a regulation now has to be implemented, in accordance with which the animal carcase units would have to work in accordance with specific quality criteria."
"But they are not doing so!"
"This Parliament ought to be raising the issue of this requirement, which was one of the main requirements, with the Commission."
"This is not possible, however, because the committee has not yet started to operate."
"I have the impression that the setting up of this committee will continue to be postponed, by one political group which is being guided by electoral considerations."
"We cannot make the reputation of this Parliament take second place behind the electoral considerations of one Member State."
"Therefore I should like to ask you to press ahead with the setting up of this committee, so that this Parliament can do its work properly."
"Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, you cited Rule 28 of the Rules of Procedure, but Rule 28 envisages written questions, not oral questions, concerning the work of the Bureau."
"The Bureau has already taken note of the question you mention and will be taking a decision at the appropriate time."
"The question was submitted during the Bureau's last meeting since it was not possible previously."
"The Bureau has many matters to deal with."
"It will take a decision on Thursday if the time is right, otherwise as soon as possible."
"Mr President, Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has just made certain comments."
"He did not have the courage to say what he meant; he talked about one particular country."
"As a British Member of this House, and leader of the Socialist Group, can I make it entirely clear that I wrote within days of the BSE Temporary Committee reporting asking that we should deal with the follow-up committee immediately."
"If he is referring to my group, there has been no attempt whatsoever to keep it off the agenda."
"Mrs Green, no reference was made either to you or to your Group, so that explanation was not called for."
"Mr President, I would assume that, according to the announcement of what was decided by the Conference of Presidents, a decision on this ad hoc committee will be taken at its next meeting."
"That is my intention."
"It will depend upon you, the Chairmen of the Groups, whether it is taken or not."
"Order of Business"
"We shall continue with settling the order of business."
"The final draft of the agenda drawn up pursuant to Article 95 of the Rules of Procedure by the Conference of Presidents has been distributed; the following amendments have been proposed for inclusion:"
"Mr President, I should like to point out that the Committee on Budgetary Control approved these reports quite properly in accordance with the rules, and I very much regret the fact that the Council did not take the opportunity to give its opinion on them within the proper time limit, thereby forcing us to separate these two reports from discharge in general, and postpone them to the April II sitting."
"Moreover, that is the last date on which we are conducting this approval debate and on which a decision can be given, because according to the budgetary rules we are obliged to give approval by the end of April, or to give our opinion on approval in the part-session."
"I want to make this point quite clear here, and I very much regret the fact that we have now had to take this step."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Theato."
"I hope the Council will take note of that observation."
"The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has asked for a statement by the Council and the Commission on the closure of the Renault factory at Vilvoorde to be included on the agenda."
"The Council has said that for its part it will not be issuing any statement, since it does not regard the matter as falling within its ambit."
"The Commission would be willing to do so on Wednesday, although Wednesday would be fairly problematical as regards the agenda which is already quite full."
"But of course the decision rests with the Honourable Members."
"Mrs Moreau of the Confederal Group of the European United Left /Nordic Green Left has the floor to explain the request."
"Mr President, the decision to close the Renault factory at Vilvoorde, which is an indication of the current construction of Europe, based on putting employees into competition with one another, has raised a legitimate wave of protest."
"This House has echoed this by adopting, at its March part-session, a resolution which requires of the Council and the Commission, I quote, ' That they do everything possible to have the decision by the management of Renault revoked' ."
"One month later, where do we stand?"
"The management of Renault, which has put forward no concrete proposal, stands by its decision."
"The workers are continuing their actions and the occupation of the site, and they enjoy the solidarity of the employees of the Renault factories in other countries."
"Two court decisions, one Belgian and the other French, have blamed the management of Renault."
"The Nanterre tribunal has forbidden the closure of the Vilvoorde factory to be proceeded with."
"This House cannot be content with having adopted a resolution and not be concerned about the follow-up this receives."
"What is at stake is too serious."
"For this reason, in conformity with Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Procedure, my group proposes an amendment to the order of business, with the tabling for the Wednesday sitting of the statements from the Council and the Commission reporting on the measures taken in the spirit of and out of respect for the European Parliament's resolution of 12th March last."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this is the moment when social Europe is beginning to grow, thanks to the struggles of the people concerned."
"The initial court proceedings have shown that there is also a real chance of further development, and at this historic moment this Parliament should start to play its role as the sounding-board of the European public, and should look after the interests of the people concerned."
"Therefore we should give ourselves time to deal with this issue."
"Ladies and gentlemen, pull yourselves together and do it!"
"Millions of unemployed people, millions of marginalized people are looking to you for action."
"If you refuse them, then you will be showing them that you are pursuing a vision of European construction that has nothing, absolutely nothing to do with the interests of the people involved."
"It is for this reason that no one in this House can vote against this request."
"Mr Martens has the floor to oppose the request."
"Mr President, last week, the workers at the Renault factory at Vilvoorde gained an important victory."
"The sudden closure of the plant was declared unlawful by a tribunal in Brussels, and also by a court in Rennes."
"A completely new situation has emerged."
"I heard this morning in my country's media that the trade unions have accepted the principle of resuming work, because the closure of the plant is now unlawful and an entirely new procedure is beginning."
"They are going to hold a ballot on this on Thursday morning, in which all the workers at Vilvoorde will take part."
"The situation has completely changed."
"In these circumstances, I think that an opportunity exists, and that it is legitimate for the normal methods and procedures for consultation in the event of collective redundancies to be applied."
"I have also heard that the Social Affairs Council will be meeting on 15 April."
"In these circumstances, since legality has been restored by two courts and a new procedure is under way, I think we must give every chance to the discussions which are being called for by the workers and their trade unions, and it does not seem appropriate for us to hold another political debate on the matter."
"We still strongly support the interests of these workers, and it is in their interest that I would ask for this new procedure to be given a chance."
"I put the request of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to the vote."
"(Parliament rejected the request)"
"Thursday and Friday:"
"(No proposed amendments submitted) ."
"Mr President, I just wanted to raise a point with regard to the statement from the Commission and Council following Mr Alavanos' report on the Middle East and ask whether the deadlines could be adjusted."
"As I understand it, the deadline for the resolution is set for this Thursday and it is to be voted on at the April II partsession. It seems to me that if we are going to vote on such a sensitive issue as the Middle East at the April II partsession in Brussels, then it really is more appropriate to set the deadline nearer to that part-session."
"It is a very sensitive political issue."
"I am sure much will happen in the interval and we should allow ourselves to do something more up-to-date at the time rather than establish a deadline this week."
"Mrs Green, the next Conference of Presidents will set the time-limit for tabling resolutions."
"It is better like that as we can take any points into consideration."
"Mr. President, my point concerns the agenda for this week."
"We are intending to discuss Ms Terrón i Curí's report on the European Information System on Wednesday."
"There have been some problems while discussing this report in committee as the papers are not available in Swedish."
"At our last meeting we discussed this matter very thoroughly indeed."
"Finally, Mr. Cederschiöld and I, since we were both present, decided that we would not, so to speak, hinder the committee further."
"Instead we abstained from participating in the vote in the hope that Swedish texts would be available prior to this session."
"Currently only the section covering motivation is available in Swedish, nothing else."
"Neither the Council document nor the report itself is available in Swedish."
"As we all know, this is a very important report covering an important issue."
"But from our point of view the situation is totally unacceptable, and not having access to texts in one's mother tongue is not in line with good working practice."
"I refer you to and request that this report is postponed until the documents are available in Swedish."
"Mr. President, this point concerns the same issue raised just now by Mrs Lindholm."
"I would like to emphasise one aspect of all this, namely that we did discuss whether to proceed with the debate but not the voting, despite the fact that there was no translation."
"I think this would be wrong."
"I do not think we should proceed with either the debate or the voting until the documents are available in Swedish."
"I think, therefore, that the whole subject should be removed from the agenda until the translations are available."
"Mrs Cedersschiöld, that is what the Rules of Procedure say and, if, therefore, the text is not available in Swedish and Finnish, we shall not vote."
"Mr. President, I am pleased that the President has shown an understanding of this matter."
"But if we are now intending to set the translators working day and night so that these texts will turn up the day before the vote, how on earth will we have time to read them and form an opinion on them?"
"Surely this is not what is meant by working on equal terms."
"We must have the same opportunity as other nationalities to read, discuss and work."
"I find this totally unacceptable and move that the subject is postponed, perhaps even until the next session, by which time we may have the Swedish translation."
"Very well, Mrs Lindholm."
"I put to the vote the proposal to withdraw from the agenda the report which is not available in all language versions."
"(Parliament approved the proposal)"
"Mr President, you have now removed from the agenda both of Mr Kellett-Bowman's reports on discharge."
"In that case, however, we ought to make provision for dealing with them during April II."
"They are not on the agenda now, but we must, as a matter of form, fit them in."
"I do not know when they will actually be dealt with, but whatever happens these reports must remain on the April agenda."
"Mr President, I too am very anxious to obtain clarification with regard to the agenda for April II, because the Commission has stated that on the Wednesday morning it will be deciding which countries, in its opinion, meet the deficit criteria and which do not."
"That decision will, therefore, be an extremely important one."
"For a long time, we have been asking the Commission always to notify Parliament first when such decisions have been taken, and only then to notify the press."
"Commissioner de Silguy has said that he is prepared to clarify this point at 3 p.m., and that the press conference will not be held until afterwards."
"I believe that this represents substantial progress in our relations with the Commission, and I therefore think that it is very important that this statement - and, as I understand it, this has already been agreed - really can take place at 3 p.m., in other words, right at the beginning of the April II sitting."
"Mr von Wogau, in the final draft of the agenda for Wednesday, 23 April there are two Commission communications: one on equality of opportunity between men and women and the other on the broad economic policy guidelines and excessive deficits."
"Each will be allocated 45 minutes for questions and answers."
"As regards what Mrs Theato quite rightly said, I think that the appropriate time to consider the day for including the information mentioned still pending before the Council would be at the meeting of the Conference of Presidents this Thursday."
"We do not need to fix the date and time now; we hope to have more details by Thursday to consider the inclusion."
"(Parliament approved the Order of Business thus amended)"
"Animal experiments in the field of cosmetic products"
"The next item on the agenda is the debate on the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the Commission report on the development, validation and legal acceptance of alternative methods to animal experiments in the field of cosmetic products - 1995 (COM(96)0365 - C4-0662/96) (A4-0017/97)."
"Mr President, allow me first of all to say something that will come as no surprise to anyone, in fact, basically, I am just repeating something I have said before. For eight years I and many other members have been campaigning in favour of a total ban on animal experiments in the field of cosmetic products."
"This campaign, however, has met with only very limited success."
"If, in my speech here today, I am somewhat milder than I have been in the past, it is only because I do not want the Commissioner who is present here today, Mrs Bonino, or her officials, to be punished for the crimes that have been committed by her predecessors, because unfortunately that is what has happened."
"In 1993, this House decided, quite clearly, that there should be no more animal experiments in the field of cosmetics, on the grounds that there are already 8, 000 ingredients that have been tested on animals."
"Any other new ingredient to be used for cosmetic products would have to be tested using alternative methods, i.e. in vitro, and not on animals."
"We asked the Commission to report to us, on an annual basis, regarding the progress that had been made."
"Unfortunately, almost no progress has been made at all."
"The fact that I am speaking on the subject today, somewhat belatedly, is due to the fact that the report that I prepared for the Commission's annual report was removed from the agenda at the last sitting."
"In the meantime, the Commission, in its haste, allowed the committee to meet in order to approve technical amendments, and that committee took certain decisions that, by its own standards, were relatively mild."
"In spite of this, I am now asking the Commission to accept the report that I have prepared for Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, and to take on board the wisdom that it contains, because this technical committee has done nothing about it."
"Let me just refer to two of the three points I have in mind, and then ask Mrs Bonino two questions."
"First of all, in 1993 we decided, for reasons of common sense, that if, by 1998, no alternative methods had been developed and validated, then we would have to allow a one-off postponement of the ban on animal experiments, for a period of not more than two years."
"I would now like to ask Mrs Bonino whether she agrees with us that the year 2000 has to be the final cut-off point for animal experiments in the field of cosmetic products, and that there can be no further extension."
"Unfortunately, the decision taken by the technical committee on 20 March is not so clear-cut."
"I would then like the Commission to establish beyond doubt that now - contrary to what has occurred in the past - it is being made quite clear that none of the animal experiments that are used has ever been validated."
"A requirement that we expect, and indeed demand, that alternative methods should meet, is not being met by these animal experiments at all!"
"Therefore, will you, Mrs Bonino, establish beyond doubt that, when it comes to validations, you will not set any requirements that are higher than those set for animal experiments?"
"And will you also take note of the fact that most animal experiments have never been validated, which means that they have never really been put to the test, and that therefore they are of only very limited relevance?"
"If we are to abide by international agreements, and apparently the OECD is an authority as far as the Commission is concerned, then will you also establish beyond doubt that the OECD is trying to eliminate and abolish as many animal experiments as possible by validating alternatives?"
"Will you also establish beyond doubt that the OECD has received a satisfactory number of applications for the approval of alternative methods?"
"And finally, Mrs Bonino, will there be a seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive in the near future?"
"I know that always in the past the technical committee and its staff have kindly given advance notice; at the time, the sixth amendment, together with my 1993 report, led for the first time to our demanding a ban on animal experiments in the European Union."
"As you can imagine, Commissioner, a seventh amendment would take more account of Parliament's wishes, and you would therefore receive the measure of support that you would no doubt like to have."
"I should therefore like to hear your answer. Will you, in the near future, be proposing a seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive?"
"And will this seventh amendment finally make it quite clear that no more finished products will be tested on animals?"
"I was convinced that the sixth amendment had already made this sufficiently clear, but apparently that was not the case."
"Therefore I expect the seventh amendment to have that effect."
"I should very much like to hear you tell us when you will be giving Parliament its chance, within the legislative process, to make its position known and to support the millions of people in the European Union who are demanding that there should be no more animal experiments in the field of cosmetic products."
"Mr President, I find Mrs Roth-Behrendt's generosity quite amazing."
"She has been very kind to the Commission and I understand why."
"This is not the Commission which failed so abysmally in the past, it is a new Commission."
"Nevertheless, I contend, the responsibilities of the old Commission transfer to the new one and I am deeply disturbed that this Commission is as subject to the influence of the lobby as was the old one."
"It is only a parliament and parliamentarians which can respond to the many thousands of letters which we collectively receive on this subject."
"I must also say that I find it very upsetting that we have missed the boat."
"If this were a situation where co-decision applied, we would have had a much greater power and influence over the Commission."
"Just as on the last occasion, cooperation has meant that we have been overruled."
"I wonder if the possibility has occurred to the Commission that we as a parliament might look at measures which are not directly related to this issue and possibly threaten to hold them up in order to get our way on this subject."
"We have never tried this tactic before."
"It seems to me that our only alternative would be a motion of censure for failure on the part of the Commission to do what it promised."
"We tried that only a month ago and of course in those circumstances we were obliged to support the Commission - and rightly so."
"However, we cannot be constantly rebuffed by the Commission as if we had no democratic accountability to our constituents."
"When she responds to the debate, I would ask the Commissioner to deal with some of the following specific questions, arising from the resolution before the House."
"Firstly, may we know what draft measures are to be proposed to us? 'Draft measures' could mean anything."
"Secondly, could we have some indication as to what has happened so far?"
"No clear explanation was given in committee."
"We are told that there are no detailed statistics available."
"Why not?"
"Who collects the statistics?"
"Where do they come from?"
"What has the Commission done to chase up these matters?"
"If the Commissioner does not know then who does?"
"This has all very much been lost sight of."
"Once again the lobby has been more effective than anyone else."
"That is a totally unsatisfactory situation."
"The Commission and Parliament should take joint responsibility and ensure that animals are no longer abused in the way they have been in the name of commerce."
"Mr President, the EPP Group will be supporting Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report and would like to congratulate her on it."
"We have taken a keen interest in this issue and recognize that the European cosmetics market is very important."
"It accounts for about 40 % of the world cosmetics market."
"Even though the actual number of animals involved in testing for cosmetics is relatively small, our aim, like that of the rapporteur, would be to reduce it to zero."
"We draw attention to the fact that it is not actually known how many tests for cosmetics within the European Union involve the use of animals since most Member States are failing to comply with the obligation to collect those statistics, including Germany."
"I hope Mrs Roth-Behrendt will take that message home."
"Secondly, it distresses me to agree with Mr White in the context of the British general election, but it seems to me that the only people approaching this issue with any urgency at all are Members of the European Parliament and members of outside pressure groups."
"This is curious since the European Union has a framework for a ban available in the 1993 Directive."
"It is also curious because the European Union has some claims to be a democratic body."
"I would like to call on the Commissioner, when she speaks, to give us a timetable for the early banning of any requirement to test finished products on animals."
"It is also very important that we show greater clarity and urgency in developing and validating alternatives."
"I, together with Mrs Roth-Behrendt and some other Members of the European Parliament visited the European Centre for Validation of Alternative Methods of Testing for Cosmetics at Ispra in northern Italy."
"We found it in a pine forest."
"It was, I believe, previously the Italian Centre for Nuclear Energy."
"I have referred to my notes."
"I note that Dr Balls, the director of the centre said to us in December 1995 that he believed that it would be possible to ban, from 1998, all the following tests on animals for cosmetics: finished products, skin penetration, photo-toxicity, skin irritation, mutagenicity, eye irritation and sensitization."
"There is something very curious going on here where the director of the centre said in 1995 that this would be possible by 1998 and yet the Commission has not come up with any proposals."
"I wonder whether this has anything to do with the troubles that the Commissioner can see ahead relating to the World Trade Organization, and the fact that it may not be possible to bring this legislation in as originally envisaged in view of our obligations under certain GATT rules."
"If that is the case, then I, and I suspect, Mrs Roth-Behrendt as well, would be prepared to be very combative on this."
"What is the point of having a European Union position on this issue, which is very important to many people in Europe, if we cannot do anything about it because of international rules?"
"Surely we should test those rules to the ultimate."
"Mr President, the ban on the marketing of cosmetic products and ingredients which have been tested on animals is due to enter into force on 1 January 1998."
"Unfortunately, however, as other speakers have already pointed out, the Commission takes the view that this ban should be postponed for two years."
"I should like to be somewhat stricter than the rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt."
"The resolution says that no part of the ban should be postponed for more than two years."
"I would like to have this two-year period taken as a maximum, and I would ask the Commissioner if she sees any prospect of reducing it."
"Because a maximum is just that, and it also means that you can go for less."
"I think this whole affair is very unfortunate, and we shall also be voting against the two amendments tabled by the UPE Group, because they are simply trying to weaken the resolution drawn up by the rapporteur."
"It seems to me quite senseless that animals should have to suffer so that yet more cosmetics can be produced."
"And I also feel that the Commission does not have sufficient grounds for proposing a postponement."
"If you look at the Commission's annual report, it shows that there has been a casual approach, a lack of effort to secure the implementation of a ban on animal testing in 1998."
"It is a great pity that the Commission has made so little progress and is now taking refuge behind such things as the WTO and risks to health."
"And if we look at paragraph 3 of the resolution, we see that the Commission has failed in not even being able to provide detailed statistics on cosmetic testing in the Union."
"I would ask Mrs Bonino to look at paragraph 3 and to respond by telling us how things can be improved, so that at least some better statistics can be obtained."
"The Commission would have appeared in a better light if it had gone to more trouble over the international recognition of alternative testing methods."
"We must also not forget that there are already some 8000 ingredients which have been tested."
"The Commission would have done better to oblige the cosmetics industry to use these existing ingredients and finally introduce a ban on further animal testing."
"Mr White says that one response might be to dismiss the Commission."
"I hope that the Commissioner's reply will be such that we shall be rather more generously disposed than when we started this debate."
"Mr. President, first, I would like to say that Mrs Roth-Behrendt has written a good report."
"But, a new situation has arisen since the decision taken by the technical committee on 20th March which changes the basic circumstances."
"It must be said that this was a very negative decision; settling this issue has once again been postponed to some very indefinite future time."
"The decision is negative for several reasons."
"Firstly, of course, because of the subject matter: This is an ethical question and it is totally indefensible to use animal testing in the production of cosmetics."
"Secondly, the format of the decision is totally unreasonable, i.e. that we have a technical committee which is, in practice, creating legislation."
"This is not the way a democratic country, for example, would operate."
"It is also disturbing that the technical committee will once again postpone the decision in two years time if it has not found sufficient alternatives by that time."
"We cannot possibly accept this way of working."
"The Commission must also take some criticism for remaining passive on this issue and for once again taking the initiative of postponing the ban."
"Of course alternatives are slow to appear when it can be seen that the ban is continually postponed; we are contributing to this slow pace as there is no clear date by which testing must stop."
"And now a new argument has appeared on the scene: it is said that the World Trade Organisation will prevent the introduction of a ban on sales."
"This is a very dubious argument, particularly as it is really impossible to know whether or not the organisation will approve such a ruling until we have tried to introduce it."
"If the World Trade Organisation does not approve it, we can refuse to accept the decision without first attempting to fight for the introduction of such a ban on sales of this type."
"We support the report and would like to see a ban as soon as possible both on sales and on testing themselves."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we look at this affair by the light of day, we can see that the Commission has perfected the art of evading directives or regulations that have already been adopted."
"It really is a scandal that the prohibition on animal experiments, which was due to come into force on 1 January 1998 - and which in any case has been known about for four years and repeatedly postponed - is now to be postponed yet again, until the year 2000."
"It is neither technically nor ethically justifiable for millions of animals to have to die, in the nastiest possible way, merely so that the cosmetics industry can produce a few more pots of cream, when there are already millions of little pots of cream and such like products."
"The majority of the population of the EU rejects the idea, as proved by the millions of signatures that we have received."
"Parliament is against the idea as well."
"Nor is it acceptable that there should be arrangements to allow exceptions to the rule."
"If it is not possible to prove in vitro that a new ingredient is harmless from the toxicological point of view, then we must simply do without it."
"We already have enough of them anyway."
"In any case, it is time we decided, once and for all, whether we should always carry out research into everything using animal experiments."
"Something that has been proved harmless in animal experiments may nevertheless cause serious reactions in human beings."
"This has already been proved on innumerable occasions."
"It cannot and should not be possible to keep on and on postponing something!"
"Remember the leghold traps!"
"Something that this House decided on a long time ago is being postponed, by bringing up all sorts of odd arguments, statistics, the WTO and whatever else happens to occur to us."
"Then you either say that we do not want such laws at all, and what Parliament has decided is all very well and good, but in principle we shall do as we like - at least that is what it has looked like recently."
"But I reject this viewpoint, and I also reject animal experiments."
"I like to use cosmetics, but not like this."
"It is high time that we stuck to the decisions taken by this House."
"That is why we were elected, and that is what the public expects of us."
"Mr President, at first sight, the ban on animal experiments to test cosmetics or the substances of which they are composed should be a matter of consensus, as each of us is naturally opposed to any act of cruelty to animals."
"An important observation becomes necessary, however, when one examines the matter."
"A favourable decision on this ban could well be fatal for the European cosmetics industry, which is the world leader."
"Most third countries, in fact, require this type of experimentation and our most aggressive competitors - the Americans and Japanese - will have no hesitation in continuing tests on animals in order to place on the market products which they will sell throughout the world, including in our countries."
"Moreover, is it really cruel to test a product by applying it behind a rabbit's ear or, at worst, by instilling it onto a rat's cornea, to check that it does not develop conjunctivitis?"
"Mrs Roth-Behrendt's report wants to authorize alternative methods only."
"But what are they?"
"I know of only one which is scientifically reliable, and that is experiments on human beings."
"As a plastic surgeon, I am very well informed on this subject and I can tell you that the Americans are past masters in these techniques."
"In California, in particular, it is common to recruit in prisons volunteers who, for a fistful of dollars and a reduction in their sentence, agree to expose themselves to the sun for ten hours at a stretch with a mixture of sun lotions on their backs."
"These prisoners - volunteers for science - always come from a socially disadvantaged background and most of the time they are immigrants."
"Are we - in Belgium, in France or elsewhere in the European Union - going to appeal to North African delinquents in our prisons in order to subject them to experiments?"
"As a humanist all my life, I cannot reconcile myself to this and the writer of this report will be hard pressed to explain to me in the name of what moral principles protecting a rabbit's ears and a rat's conjunctiva takes priority over the health of immigrants, even if they are delinquents."
"Mr President, every time we have this debate here in Parliament we have to clarify many concepts if we want to avoid a dialogue between deaf men."
"One indisputable fact is that scientists the world over are in favour of alternatives to animal experiments, where they exist, because they are easier."
"No-one prefers to use animals since, amongst other things, the work is more difficult and very much more costly."
"The debate is not therefore whether we are in favour of or opposed to the alternative methods."
"The real debate lies in determining whether people's right to health can be protected with the alternative methods which now exist."
"That must be this Parliament's chief concern."
"What sometimes happens in the field of rights is that there are conflicting forms of good."
"Where the promotion of animal welfare which conflicts with the good of protecting people's health, we must opt for the second form of good which is a higher form."
"Moreover, in this Parliament we often have great political voluntarism."
"There are occasions unfortunately when we cannot overtake science."
"Mention has been made of the Research Centre at Ispra and it has been said that they cannot do much; here too there is confusion between the faculties and the capacity of the Ispra Centre."
"Alternative methods will arise from international research and not from any specialist voluntarist centre."
"We can encourage, we can act, we can spend money, but it will be international research which finally comes up with these alternative methods."
"Mr President, I would like to make it clear that I fully support one of the previous speakers in the view that what we are considering here is human health."
"It also has to do with human vanity, and this is quite a different matter."
"So I would like to thank the rapporteur for an outstanding report, though in fact it was a little more biased - as others have pointed out - than it should have been, which was of course quite natural."
"But the issue it brings to our attention, and I hope the Commissioner will understand this, is that it is in fact quite unacceptable that we should postpone the ban so that it does not come into effect in 1998."
"There is absolutely no justification for doing this."
"There is an abundance of cosmetics on the market."
"We can make do with those that are available."
"We have ample opportunities."
"There is no reason for researching further products unless this can be done using alternative methods."
"As others have pointed out, it is wholly unacceptable that these decisions be taken by technical people."
"This is a question of policy, so it is logical that the decisions should be taken by politicians, not be technical personnel."
"Unfortunately this decision making process demonstrates all too clearly how strong the cosmetics lobby is in the European Community."
"There is no defence for this when we consider the fact that 40 % of the market in this area is located in Europe, but it is precisely for that reason that we should give a lead in preventing animal experimentation."
"It is lamentable that the Commission should succumb to the lobbyists' activities."
"It would be sending the wrong signal if we once again postponed the ban."
"If we do so, the industry will simply think that we will do the same again next time and may in fact become indifferent."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the purpose of the Roth-Behrendt report is to summarize the progress achieved by the Union in the development, validation and legal acceptance of methods which could replace animal experiments in the cosmetics sector."
"It also refers to the 1994 report of the Commission, which confirmed the lack of valid alternative methods to replace animal experiments and confirmed the Commission's commitment to at least reducing the number of animals used."
"I must stress that with regard to certain tests, specifically those for eye irritation, skin absorption, phototoxicity and photo-irritation, and those basic tests relating to mutagenicity, the Commission report did evince a degree of optimism regarding the possibility of testing valid alternative methods."
"Our view is that the differences of opinion between the European Parliament and the Commission are still unresolved, because we are concerned here with a conflict between the principles of free trade and the assertion of non-commercial values in animal experiments in the field of cosmetic products."
"The European legislator can legislate in respect of any product in circulation within the Union, but he must follow the dictates of international law, because when European enterprises export to third countries which require animal experimentation for European products, these must conform to the laws of those countries."
"Furthermore, the rules endorsed by the European Union at the GATT negotiations do not allow us to prohibit the circulation within Europe of foreign products that have been tested on animals."
"To summarize, imposing stricter rules on European producers than on their foreign competitors could sound like discrimination against the former."
"To eliminate any such possibility, at least for the time being, the Commission should delay for a few more years the directive prohibiting the marketing of cosmetics that have been tested on animals."
"Mr President, I think it is quite incomprehensible that the Commission once again feels that it has to postpone the issue for two years, and I should like to take this opportunity to say to those ladies and gentlemen who believe that there are no alternative methods that that view is totally incorrect."
"It is not true, for example, to say that there is no alternative to the eye irritation test."
"This fact is now established knowledge at international level."
"If that is what you maintain, sir, then you do not know what you are talking about."
"It is also complete nonsense, in this context, to quote a few poor prisoners on whom some kind of tests are being carried out."
"Every woman and also every man who would like to use perfumes would do without them if they knew that, in order to manufacture these products, somebody has to be tortured."
"I too can quote a statistic, from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the provisions in force are particularly stringent."
"This statistic was published in 1997."
"It refers to thousands of dogs and cats."
"There are millions of animals tortured year after year."
"And all of you, ladies and gentlemen, who perhaps have a dog at home, and who think about what else you can do to make its life better, should just try to imagine how you would feel if it was your dog that somebody was going to test a cosmetic product on."
"I believe that enough research has been done, and that there are enough alternative methods."
"We all know why this issue is really being postponed: it is exclusively for reasons of trade policy."
"It has nothing to do with a lack of alternative methods."
"Mr President, having heard what Mrs Flemming has to say, it is obvious that both the Commission and the Member States accord very little importance to the concept of animal protection."
"The Commission's annual report for 1995 makes it quite clear, at any rate, that the Commission is totally lacking in commitment when it comes to implementing the restrictions and halting animal experiments in the cosmetics industry."
"Although the cosmetics industry itself has carried out a certain amount of research that is worth mentioning, the Commission has to a large extent limited its own action to merely coordinating certain validation programmes."
"It is a fact, unfortunately, - and scientists are by and large agreed on this - that research methods not involving animal experiments are still not sufficiently well developed in some areas."
"I should therefore also like to give my support, in particular, to the rapporteur's demand that research and development work aimed at discovering alternative methods for tests in the cosmetics field should be included in the fifth R & D Framework Programme."
"Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner Bonino."
"The rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, has asked to speak."
"Mrs Bonino, please allow me to ask you a few questions, so that I can be certain that I have understood you correctly."
"I am normally quite mild in my dealings with those sections of the Commission that you represent, but if I had heard your speech earlier, I might not have been in quite such a mild mood."
"I am not happy about much of what you have said."
"It is superfluous to argue about what percentage of animal experiments are used for cosmetics, because you know, and I know, that there are very many animal experiments carried out to test ingredients that are also used in the cosmetics industry, which do not appear in any of the statistics."
"Nor is it a question of whether there is enough money for Ispra."
"As far as I am concerned, the matter at issue is the conclusion, and the conclusion is that there are no validated alternatives."
"Have I understood you correctly, in that you said that with effect from 1 January 1998 there will be no more animal tests for finished products?"
"That is what I understood you to have said, and we are agreed on that point."
"That would be one contentious issue fewer."
"For those members who have not been following the issue for quite such a long time, let me begin by saying that this Parliament first requested this in 1993."
"We have for a long time been in agreement with the scientific representatives that this ought to be possible and that it is self-evident."
"If compounds and ingredients have been tested on animals, then the final product no longer needs to be tested."
"Do you take this view as well?"
"Then 1 January 1998 is the appropriate deadline!"
"Have I understood you correctly in thinking that you said you would be submitting a seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive under the co-decision procedure? If so, when will this happen?"
"My last question refers to a point that has been annoying me for some time now, namely GATT."
"I understand all too well what you are saying."
"But do you share my view, that your two proposals, firstly to make an exception for the territory of the European Union and then for products that are imported into the Union, cannot be justified, either on ethical grounds or in the interests of European competitors?"
"Do you also share my view that the Commission would do better to take as a basis Article 20 of the GATT agreement, which clearly states that other laws are justified on ethical grounds?"
"Have you tried to use the rules as your basis, and have you also perhaps tried to fight a little?"
"Mrs Bonino, you are normally so full of fighting spirit."
"In this case you have me on your side, but if I were in your position I hope I should have rather more courage."
"Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner Bonino."
"The debate is closed."
"The voting will take place tomorrow at noon."
"Maize and genetically modified organisms"
"Mr President, the Commission has agreed to the authorization of genetically modified maize, although it has not been possible to dispel the doubts that exist with regard to health and the environment."
"It has bowed to pressure from industry, and has sacrificed the consumer and health protection."
"The majority of Member States were against the marketing of this product because of the risks attached to triple gene manipulation."
"The results are ineffectual antibiotics, increasing allergies and chemical-contaminated soil."
"Transgenic maize is a time bomb as far as consumers and environmental protection are concerned."
"For example, there is a real fear that the built-in antibiotic resistance will cross over into human disease pathogens."
"This could mean that ampicillin will be forever lost as a treatment for disease."
"The Commission is thus accepting the fact that human beings will have to be exposed to disease pathogens without any protection."
"In the meantime, there is now absolutely no dispute, scientifically, about the fact that foreign genetic material can pass into the gastro-intestinal tract via food, without being fully decomposed."
"It has even proved possible to detect foreign DNA later in the cells of the body."
"The question arises as to why these risks are being ignored, and why consumers are thus being used as guinea pigs by the genetic engineering industry."
"The approval for the marketing of transgenic maize is a slap in the face for consumers, and you, Commissioner Bjerregaard, have ignored not only the health and ecological reservations, but also the provision of transparency and the consumer's wish that genetically modified products should be labelled as such."
"Genetically modified maize is being palmed off on consumers, and keeping everything secret like this is contrary to consumers' interests."
"This is almost like a kind of forced feeding."
"By giving approval for the marketing of this product, you have irresponsibly turned yourself into the lackey of the genetic engineering industry."
"Commissioner, we expect some answers to our questions today!"
"Why, for months on end, have you tolerated the illegal importation of transgenic maize?"
"Is the information correct, i.e. that you have given the USA an undertaking not to intervene?"
"Although the Commission is responsible for foreign trade, did you deliberately fail to take action when these illegal imports became known?"
"Are the accusations made by your colleague, Mrs Bonino, true, i.e. that in approving transgenic maize, economic interests took precedence over consumers' interests?"
"And how, Commissioner, do you propose to cope with the ban on imports that exists in Austria and Luxembourg?"
"Are the rumours true, when they say that the Commission will try to withdraw only as far as the formal aspects are concerned?"
"Why do the ten genetically modified plants for which marketing licences have been applied for not fall within the scope of the novel food regulation, and why do you want to leave it to the genetic engineering industry itself to decide what type of labelling should be used?"
"We expect the marketing of transgenic maize to be abandoned until all reservations have been taken into consideration."
"The principle of taking precautions, and the protection of the environment and of consumers, must take precedence over economic interests, and we therefore want to hear your position with regard to the accusations regarding the marketing approval and the question of how to proceed further."
"Mr President, on 18 December last the Commission took a decision which we consider disastrous, authorizing the placing on the European market, for all uses and without specific labelling, of thousands of tons of genetically modified maize together with cereal substitutes derived from this maize, which originated in the United States and were then stocked in our ports."
"Essentially, this decision seems to us very serious on two accounts."
"First of all, we do not know for certain the ultimate consequences of dispersing genetically modified organisms into the environment or into the food chain."
"By transferring genes, one is in fact transgressing the species barrier and upsetting the equilibrium of the genome, without knowing how nature is going to react."
"It seems to us that, in granting this authorization, the Commission has shamelessly broken the rule of prudence which it had, however, sworn to us, after the mad cow affair, that it would respect from then on."
"Our concern is further increased when we see the great haste and lack of thought which prevailed at the decision of 18 December."
"The opinions of the scientific committees, on which the Commission claims to have relied, are vague and laconic - in this case a few lines each, we are told - whereas the risks of transgenic maize are of the utmost seriousness: dispersal of pollen into the environment; the risk of seeing weeds become resistant to herbicides and the necessity for new, more expensive products to fight them; the risk, in human beings, of resistance or allergy to certain antibiotics; endangering the lives of bees, as the toxin contained in transgenic maize, and which is designed to kill the European core borer parasite, is a poison which the plant will continue to produce permanently; etc."
"It is clear that, in this affair, the population of the countries of Europe is once again being launched into the unknown, blindfolded."
"This is all the truer as the Commission's decision was not even subordinated to specific labelling."
"No doubt we will be told shortly that this labelling is going to come, but it is not there and we reply at once that we do not believe in it, as it will never be possible to label everything unambiguously, particularly by-products."
"Moreover, we are already being told that it will not be possible to apply this labelling to the transgenic products which have already been authorized, or for which the authorization procedure is under way."
"Finally, and in any case, neither Member States nor the Commission have the moral right to let a product which poses such risks be distributed on the market, even if it is labelled."
"Faced with this European deficiency, some Member States have taken decisions, either to ban cultivation or to ban importation."
"We say that you cannot have one without the other: banning cultivation but not importation would not, in fact, lift the threat hanging over human or animal health and would, moreover, put our maize producers in an untenable position in the face of foreign competition."
"We therefore solemnly ask the Commission to revoke its decision of 18 December, even if this means causing a dispute at the World Trade Organization."
"In any event, some day we will have to know where we stand and whether we do or do not have the right to defend ourselves."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the market for products obtained through genetic engineering, which is developing very rapidly at a world level, presents two major problems."
"First, that of the safety of these products; secondly, that of the competitiveness of the Union's Member States in relation to third countries."
"The problem of safety, first of all, which is a dual one: food security and environmental security."
"Food security consists in making sure that the new, genetically modified products are not harmful to our health and that of our descendants, in other words, that of the human race."
"We must therefore arrange for all the necessary tests and experts' studies to be conducted, by authorities which are independent of all commercial and political pressure."
"As for the safety of the environment, we must be sure that the modified plants are not a source of pollution by creating in their surroundings - for example through hybridization or pollination with neighbouring plants - new, dangerous species which are resistant to all methods of destruction and are thus a threat to our plant and animal environments."
"Personally, as a scientist as well as a political representative, I think that purely and simply banning these new products raises the second major question - the competitiveness of the States of the European Union in relation to the competitiveness of third countries."
"We must not conceal from ourselves that at world level these new production techniques will gradually replace the traditional techniques for plant selection which are used at present, and that they will replace them not only in the field of plant selection but also, most probably, in that of animal selection."
"The world market will thus rely to a great extent on the products resulting from this technology."
"The United States are already exporting their transgenic maize, Japan is exporting its genetically modified soya, and banning these products in the European Union would very likely put its Member States in an inferior position where trade and health are concerned."
"Because of the dual problem of competitiveness and safety, it is thus important, first of all, to suspend the authorization to import genetically modified products into the European Union, because the national authorities of Member States are not all in agreement and a large majority is even opposed to this."
"Moreover consumers, who have not yet been reassured about these products, are mistrustful, which is understandable, after the bovine spongiform encephalitis affair."
"Finally, the regulation on labelling, which would enable consumers to make an informed choice between products which are genetically modified and those which are not, has not yet come into force."
"On the other hand, to enable the Member States of the Union to remain competitive in relation to world competition, the marketing within the European Union of seeds for producing widely cultivated plants should be authorized, as some Member States, such as France, in particular, have a lead which they could easily lose at the expense of the development of the European Union."
"Some Member States, indeed, such as the United Kingdom, are already placing on the market products derived from genetically modified organisms, surrounding them, of course, by all the necessary guarantees - as we have said - as regards nutritional and environmental safety, in order to protect European citizens by guaranteeing them the quality of products derived from perfectly monitored European production."
"If this is not done, we shall be at the mercy of foreign produce from third countries, which we will not be able to monitor with all the necessary safety."
"In conclusion, I would earnestly ask the Commission, on the one hand - I repeat - to ban the importation of genetically modified products and, on the other, to authorize the placing on the market of a certain number of products generated within the European Union with all the necessary guarantees, so as not, finally, to put us in a drastically inferior position compared with third countries."
"Mr President, we are not so concerned about the economy - which Mr Cabrol spoke about - as about the health of European consumers."
"And in this case we are not merely mouthpieces for voicing the concern of consumers, particularly of Spanish consumers."
"Over 100 cargoes of genetically modified maize have arrived in Spanish ports."
"This has given rise to great concern and we have even received letters from trades' unions on the matter."
"As spokesmen, we think that the European Commission was too hasty in December in authorizing the marketing of these genetically modified products."
"It seems to us that more attention was paid to economic factors, such as pressure from the United States and the multi-nationals, than to the health and safety of Europeans."
"We believe there should be a moratorium on the marketing of these products."
"I live in a region which goes by the name of Asturias which has come into the international limelight recently with the signing there of an agreement on human rights and bio-medicine."
"To put it briefly, that agreement stressed that human rights must take precedence even over scientific interests, research must be carried out in a responsible way and care and caution must be exercised when scientific discoveries are implemented."
"I think the same rules must be followed in agriculture as in bio-medicine: care, caution and a constant awareness that health and human rights take precedence over any other consideration, especially any economic consideration."
"We therefore, Madam Commissioner, in our motion for a resolution, request a moratorium on these foodstuffs and we think this is the way the Commission must take until rigorous scientific testing shows that there is no problem for human health and the environment."
"We do not think there is any guarantee of that at the moment."
"Mr President, after what we have just experienced with BSE, one might have hoped that the Commission would change its method of taking decisions."
"I am afraid I have to disillusion you: the introduction of genetically modified maize shows us that the reverse is true."
"In December 1996, the Commission, contrary to the opinion of thirteen Member States, authorized the introduction of transgenic maize."
"To justify its position, the Commission hid behind the opinions of the scientific committees which, moreover, still leave room for doubts, as the commissioner responsible for consumer affairs had remarked."
"Of course, there is the threat of the World Trade Organization, which is being brandished about as the big policeman of the world of trade, ready to deal severely with us if the European Union does not accept transgenic maize."
"But, in doing this, the Commission is taking decisions with no regard for European producers, public health or the protection of consumers because it provides for no labelling of this maize."
"To get to the nub of the matter, in agriculture, animals and plants have always been selected: first of all, by conserving the finest specimens and, next, by crossing them to obtain the most vigorous hybrids."
"It is nature itself which puts up barriers to impossible or monstrous crossing."
"The new technology for gene transfer, however, overturn all natural bioregulations."
"There are no more scientific or technical obstacles to the creation of genetic mosaics and, responding only to the profit motive, man plays the sorcerer's apprentice."
"In agriculture, what are the objectives of the producers of GMOs?"
"Resistance to diseases, to parasites, to herbicides, aesthetic and conservational criteria, but also, let us not forget, unlimited productivity."
"Yet risks to agriculture and the environment remain."
"Thus modified soya has led to allergies in animals and modified maize has three genes, one of which, being toxic for the European corn borer, could quite possibly lead this insect to develop greater resistance one day and to proliferate."
"The second gene, which is resistant to a powerful herbicide, could lead to an increase in soil pollution and the third, finally, which is resistant to an antibiotic, could be transmitted to bacteria, or to animals, or even to mankind."
"And yet GMOs are not the panacea of agricultural development!"
"Rural development, the technological mastery of fields and of the environment, the gradual increasing of yields, the fight against diseases - all are possibilities to be exploited with methods which are modern and more natural and, above all, easier to control."
"And what of consumers in all this?"
"Will they always accept the artificialization of their food, and no transparency about its contents and mode of production?"
"And if European consumers started to refuse GMOs in their food, what would become of this market?"
"Some major agri-food groups are in fact already thinking, strategically, about a 'guaranteed GMO-free' label."
"Let us be clear about things."
"We must not get the discussions mixed up here."
"We must make it quite clear that biotechnology for treating genetic diseases constitutes a different problem, because of its limited distribution under medical control, unlike agriculture, where distribution is widespread in nature, and not under control."
"What I, personally, refuse, at the present state of our knowledge, is to cross an ethical and philosophical limit in order to produce more, and always more, the pipe-dreams of the future."
"Finally, however it may be, whatever one may think, to get back to GMOs in agriculture - the subject that concerns us today - the minimum is to inform the consumer and, therefore, clear labelling."
"The minimum is also a wideranging public debate which precedes political decisions and, why not, which leads, concretely, following Austria's example, to the application of a moratorium on the placing on the market of genetically modified organisms."
"Mr President, I am speaking on behalf of my group to express our concern at the recent decision by the Commission to endorse the placing on the market of genetically-modified maize modified by Ciba-Gigy, now known as Novartis."
"During the time leading up to the Commission decision, considerable public concern was expressed about the safety of genetically-modified products and the new risks to public health and the environment that they might pose."
"On this particular application from Novartis for the maize, especially strong objections were raised in Member States and within the European Parliament."
"In the UK an independent body of experts which advises the Government expressed serious concern about the presence of a bacterial gene in the modified maize which is coded for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin."
"This gene inactivates a number of antibiotics which are extremely important in clinical and veterinary medicine."
"It could immediately be functional if it was transferred from genetically-modified maize into a bacterium, for example in an animal's stomach."
"Though this risk is considered remote, the committee thought the risk was unacceptable and recommended that the gene be excised before the maize could be used as animal feed."
"Despite this advice being publicly available, and despite the opposition of most Member States, the Commission took the decision to place the genetically-modified maize on the market without restriction on its use."
"In addition, extremely worrying and as yet unquantifiable concerns exist about the possible creation of new forms of allergy in foods caused by the transfer of genetic information from other species into species commonly used as foods."
"This needs to be thoroughly researched and quantified before potentially fatal accidents take place."
"The decision is even more incomprehensible when we consider that there was no deadline by which the Commision had to reach a conclusion to its consideration of the application, and that the novel foods directive which might have permitted labelling, was due to come into effect shortly afterwards."
"All this gives the impression that economic and commercial pressures were put before consideration of public health and protection of the environment."
"The Commission must therefore justify its decision in far greater detail than it has previously done and give good explanations for its motivation and thinking in arriving at that decision when it did."
"Finally, does the Commission not agree that this series of events demonstrates serious defects in the approval process laid down in Directive 90/220 controlling the deliberate release into the environment of genetically-modified organisms, and will it please tell us what steps it is bringing forward to ensure an urgent review of that directive."
"Mr President, we are here, in this Parliament, normally, to defend the consumer, the European citizen, whom we are supposed to represent."
"Yet I often have the impression that we forget the European citizen and, in this affair, we have been able to see that the European Commission had, yet again, proceeded with a great deal of haste, without referring to that transparency which we all wish for and which is absolutely vital when what is involved is actually a problem as essential as that of food safety."
"Today, we are discussing transgenic maize."
"I fear that we will often have issues of this type to discuss, within our Parliament."
"It is thus important for us to make our positions clear and for us to situate what we must do as regards the protection of the consumer, who absolutely has to know whether he can be sure what he is eating on his plate every day, sure of the quality of the product he is eating."
"We have in fact been able to reproach the European Commission with having taken this decision to place American transgenic maize on the European market, a decision which was taken in far too much of a hurry, while a certain number of questions were being raised in the countries of the European Union, and some countries were actually banning the introduction of this American transgenic maize, for the moment, while other countries, like France, were refusing to allow the production of this transgenic maize on their own territory."
"These are thus so many questions which, quite rightly, represent so many causes for anxiety to the European consumer, concerning this transgenic maize's resistance to pesticides."
"Will we one day stop using more and more pesticides, which are particularly harmful to the environment, to nature and also to health?"
"And will the questions which are being asked on this maize's resistance to antibiotics be answered? Will this be transmissible to human beings?"
"These are all the questions that we are asking ourselves."
"Still others could be listed, and other speakers have already spoken about them sufficiently."
"It is because of all these questions, it is because of all this distress, that we absolutely must, today, respond with the greatest possible precision and, while awaiting responses, we absolutely must make it our duty to suspend any authorization for this transgenic maize on European territory."
"I believe, finally, that it would be, for us, the European Parliament, the way to show the citizens of Europe that this Parliament, worthy of the name, is here precisely in order to support them and to make provision for the future of the generations to come."
"That is what I wanted to say on the subject of the introduction of this transgenic maize."
"I believe that it is absolutely essential to be particularly vigilant and prudent, and to think too of our farmers, who are in fact asking us to have a little more confidence in them."
"This debate is not confined specifically to the release of genetically modified maize onto the market but concerns the whole issue of genetic modification."
"It might have been thought after the BSE crisis that the matter of food safety and consumer interests would be placed very high on the agenda, but obviously this matter is not placed high enough on the Commission's agenda."
"In this case we know, as many of us have already pointed out, that there is also a gene which is resistant to antibiotics, which may pose a risk."
"We ought to be particularly careful therefore with this particular type of genetically modified maize."
"But of course commercial interests, i.e. financial interests, have been allowed to take precedence over food safety and I think there are grounds for reiterating our reproach of the Commission for this fact."
"It is in fact irresponsible of a company to release a product over which there are still some question marks and which is not totally controlled."
"But it is also irresponsible of the Commission to allow the spread of such a product until the outstanding questions have been answered."
"I am not saying that we should be dogmatic and negative towards genetic modification and gene technology."
