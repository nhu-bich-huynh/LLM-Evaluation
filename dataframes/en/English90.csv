"Text"
"The Schnellhardt report improves on the Commission's proposal by making it clearer and by including some spirit drinks that are difficult to define and others that were omitted from the original proposal."
"The report has our backing because it is a complete document that includes two unique Portuguese drinks initially overlooked by the Commission, namely Madeira rum and poncha da Madeira."
"As regards vodka, the decision was taken to vote for an amendment calling for clear reference to the raw materials from which it is made when it is not produced from the traditional raw materials of potatoes, cereals and molasses."
"This strikes us as an appropriate position because it promotes the traditional, original production values of vodka and because it is in the consumers' interest to be given clarification of the products they consume."
"On the other hand, this is also a precautionary position aimed at preventing the situation from recurring in the future whereby the production and placing on the market of, say, a traditional Portuguese drink is undermined."
"Although this amendment was not adopted, we supported the report. Reference was made, albeit less clearly, to the raw material used in vodka production."
"I voted in favour of the Schnellhardt report on the proposal for a regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, because I consider it vital that consumers should not be misled."
"I consider it important that producers should pass on clear information on the nature of the product in order to ensure greater transparency in the market."
"The purpose of adopting a single regulation bringing together the two existing regulations is to pursue a well-defined policy for spirit drinks, adapting the current law to the new technical requirements also defined by the World Trade Organisation."
"The Commission has adopted this proposal for a regulation aimed at updating the Community law applicable to spirit drinks, which includes the definition of criteria for recognising new geographical indications."
"The proposal is also aimed at providing clear information to the consumer on the nature of the product and forces producers to pass on all necessary information in order to ensure that the consumer is not misled."
"This was one of the texts that needed a number of last-minute compromises between the various political groups in order to reach an acceptable proposal for a regulation on the definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks."
"At the heart of the dispute was what is meant by the term 'vodka'. Some said it should only be made from cereals, potatoes and/or sugar beet molasses, whereas others argued that the labelling should enable consumers to distinguish the raw material used in its manufacture."
"As regards Portugal, I feel that there are no problems with the proposals contained in the regulation as regards geographical indications, which include the various forms of wine, grape marc and pear spirits, Madeira rum, fruit spirit from the Algarve and Bu√ßaco, ginjinha portuguesa, licor de Singeverga, Portuguese anis and poncha da Madeira."
"I will be voting for this report."
"I accept the need to bring the rules respecting vodka more closely in line with those of whisky."
"Yet at the same time I hope we will continue to pay attention to the plight of those small producers of 'apple and pear spirit' within the United Kingdom who in the past have suffered from unfair discrimination."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report that is designed to improve the applicability, readability and clarity of the labelling of spirit drinks."
"Spirits will, therefore, be in keeping with the new technical requirements, and particularly with the rules and standards of the World Trade Organisation."
"The aim is to allow European producers of spirits to retain their indications of geographical origin on the world market."
"It was possible to retain the definition of 'agricultural rum' during the negotiations."
"Producers and consumers approved the compromise reached concerning, in particular, the quality criteria."
"In the French Overseas Departments, the definition of 'agricultural rum' makes it possible for producers to set themselves apart from competitors from third countries."
"Produced exclusively from sugar-cane juice, the designation 'agricultural rum' is a guarantee of quality recognised by consumers."
"The solution that has been found with regard to the question of vodka makes it possible also to retain the designation 'traditional vodka', produced from cereals, potatoes or molasses, without preventing production using other agricultural products."
"In the latter case, the label must bear the indication 'Vodka produced from...'."
"in writing. (SV) I voted today against the report by Mr Schnellhardt in the final vote."
"The point of departure is the social situation in Europe, where alcohol consumption needs to be cut back on."
"Work on better public health needs to be given the highest priority."
"In this situation it is preposterous for the European Parliament to define vodka and thus to support the use of an alcoholic drink that is harmful to people when consumed in substantial quantities."
"in writing. - (FR) The battle over vodka really took place at midday in the Chamber during the vote on the revision of the legislation on spirit drinks, a vote during which the European Parliament certainly displayed fairness, but not firmness, in defence of culinary and wine-growing traditions."
"It displayed fairness inasmuch as it rightly considered that vodka, an alcoholic beverage traditionally produced in Poland, Sweden, Finland and in the Baltic States, deserves legal protection in the same way as other spirits with protected designation of origin such as gin, whisky or brandy."
"Then there was confusion as producers who distil vodka other than from potatoes or cereals (apparently there are producers in Italy, the United Kingdom and even in Belgium) will be able to retain the designation 'vodka' for their spirit products in return for a simple statement on the label."
"When all is said and done, it is not consumers who will be the losers in this affair but, rather, a certain conception of cultural heritage and of food or wine-growing traditions that are strongly rooted in our regions and territories."
"Europe must, however, encourage people to devote themselves to these traditional industries and not cause local producers to despair."
"in writing. (SV) Today, the European Parliament has voted on the definition of vodka."
"The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, including myself, chose in the first place to vote in favour of a narrow definition of vodka which, from the perspective of the vodka-producing countries, should contain only grain and potatoes."
"Unfortunately, this narrow approach did not win through."
"In the future, it will be possible for other raw materials, such as grapes, to be put into vodka."
"It is a wording that I accepted in the end, even though it was not my first choice."
"in writing. - (PL) On 19 June 2007, the European Parliament voted on Horst Schnellhardt's (PPE) report which included, among other measures, the proposal to update the rather vague definition of vodka that has been in force since 1989."
"The latest definition of vodka, which appears in the report before us, and which was drawn up by the European Parliament in collaboration with the Council (on the basis of a proposal made by the German presidency), is not favourable from the point of view of countries who are seen as traditional, European vodka producers, especially Poland."
"This proposal allows vodka to be produced from any agricultural materials, which is contrary to the tradition and history of vodka production, or the requests tabled by Poland and the Scandinavian countries."
"That is why I have voted against the compromise drawn up by the Council and Parliament."
"At the same time, I would like to express my support for narrowing the list of raw ingredients used to produce this beverage to include only grain, potatoes and sugar beet."
"in writing. I have been reassured that the compromise reached will not be detrimental to Scottish whisky."
"I therefore support this report."
"in writing. (PL) I am voting against Mr Schnellhardt's report on the 'definition, description, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks'."
"A broad definition of vodka undoubtedly devalues its reputation as it poses a real risk to its quality."
"Introducing vodkas onto the market which are not made from the usual ingredients and will benefit from the reputation of vodkas made from grain and potatoes, will also mislead consumers."
"As far as they are concerned, the use of the label 'vodka' will imply that that this is a reputable, high quality product made from grain and potatoes."
"The Polish PSE delegation have made every effort to ensure that the definition of vodka remains in line with Polish interests and have called for traditional recipes and regional methods be respected in the production of spirit drinks."
"Our position has not, however, gain the support of the parliamentary majority."
"An instrument must be created to standardise the rules applicable to the trade in cat and dog fur, and products containing such fur, on the Community market and to place a complete ban on its use, import or export in the Community area."
"This is based not only on the ethical consideration that these animals can be pets but also on the need to ensure a level of protection and respect for the animals' well-being, which the cruel method of rearing and slaughtering these animals ignores."
"The confidence of consumers and European fur traders must be restored, an objective that can only be fulfilled by means of a common body of law banning this trade, whereby the legal requirements in all Member States as regards the banning of the sale and distribution of cat and dog fur are clarified, and the barriers to the smooth running of the internal market in the fur industry as a whole are removed."
"Mindful of the fact that European citizens are concerned about this illicit, immoral trade, I feel that the adoption of a range of practical measures by the Union in this area will help bring the citizens closer to the European institutions."
"I voted in favour of the Svensson report because I feel that by creating a range of measures banning the use of cat and dog fur, we will be helping to put an end to this deeply inhumane trade."
"I also feel it is vital to create Community-level methods of analysis whereby the origin of cat and dog fur can effectively be monitored and to ban the import of, and export from, the European market of cat and dog fur."
"It therefore makes no sense for there to be any kind of derogation aimed at creating exemptions when it comes to the placing on the market of such fur."
"In response to a large number of petitions and to concerns that have been expressed, this regulation proposes banning the placing on the market and the import of, or export from, the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur."
"The ban would replace the different existing measures implemented by several Member States and aimed at prohibiting the production and/or marketing of furs from cats and dogs."
"The proposal also aims at ensuring that information on new methods able to detect cat and dog fur and to distinguish it from other types of fur is made available to the Commission and exchanged between Member States."
"The rapporteur strongly endorses this proposal, highlighting however the need to clearly eliminate any legal loopholes that would undermine the import and trade ban as such and emphasising the need to tighten customs checks as well as administrative - and, where possible, also criminal - sanctions applied by Member States in order to create a truly dissuasive framework that would enable this shameful and illegal trade to be brought to an end."
"I voted in favour of banning the import into, and export from, the EU of cat and dog fur (and of products containing such fur) from 31 December 2008."
"It is particularly important in this regard that no derogations be allowed and that the Regulation not contribute towards the promotion of the fur trade."
"I reject the idea of a labelling requirement as insufficient and too costly."
"I also voted in favour of specific criminal measures, such as confiscation or revocation of licences, and I hope that the Member States will lay down and ensure the implementation of such penalties."
"There should be a regular exchange of views on the implementation of the Regulation."
"A ban on the import of cat and dog fur into the EU must be fully implemented."
"That is why I cannot support the derogations suggested by the Commission, but fully support the report."
"We welcome the H√∂kmark report on 'Broadband'."
"We supported amendments which point out that public authorities should make every effort to ensure that all citizens have access to broadband."
"The benefits of broadband need to be extended to every section of the population of Europe, including Ireland."
"We believe that public authorities play a crucial role in ensuring and speeding up the deployment of, and access to, broadband in less economically developed regions where it would be more difficult to create ICT infrastructure available at affordable cost and of sufficient standard to provide the necessary services, particularly in rural districts."
"General access to broadband is an essential prerequisite for social and economic development and cohesion, and improved public services."
"The benefits of broadband should not be reserved for the few, and 'Info-exclusion' should be avoided at all costs."
"in writing. - (FR) I regret that the H√∂kmark report did not take up the many suggestions from the Committee on Regional Development, for which I was the rapporteur."
"Consequently, it sidelines the European Commission's initial concern, namely that 'despite the general increase in broadband connectivity, access in more remote and rural regions is limited because of high costs due to low density of population and remoteness', and hence the search for solutions."
"We must recognise that in certain areas of the European Union - isolated and rural areas and new Member States - there is a market failure that justifies intervention by public authorities and particularly by local and regional authorities thanks to the Structural Funds."
"I had experience of this in the Limousin with the DORSAL project."
"I am, therefore, pleased by the adoption of the two Socialist amendments that bring matters down to earth because it is in fact in these remote areas that information and communication technologies are most necessary and useful as they make it possible to overcome distances by facilitating relations between users and services - clients and providers - and between the public and public institutions, and to reduce the costs and timescales for the provision of services."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the H√∂kmark report on Building a European Policy on Broadband, because it is very important to encourage initiatives facilitating access for all to the Internet and, in general, to knowledge."
"In accordance with the Lisbon objectives, it is essential to develop information technologies and, among those, broadband."
"Even if access to new technologies in the most remote regions is an objective that the European Union has to pursue, account must also be taken of the persistent discrepancies within single regions where new technologies are concerned."
"There are still many villages which, being too far from urban centres, still do not have access to the Internet or which have access to it but unduly slow access that does not allow satisfactory connections, while the region as a whole to which these villages belong is, overall, well served."
"For the sake of cohesion, these intra-regional disparities should also be better addressed with a view to combating the digital divide."
"in writing. (SV) In his explanatory statement for the report, the rapporteur pushes two contradictory arguments."
"On the one hand, he points out that it is not the EU's task to finance broadband development."
"On the other hand, he maintains that EU policy needs to support a more rapid pace of innovation in order to make Europe into the world's most dynamic market."
"To conduct a broadband policy at EU level with general resources is in itself indefensible."
"What would happen if this policy were to fail, as the Lisbon Strategy has?"
"Firstly, the June List believes that the development of broadband is a task for the market."
"It is the market's actors who, through technological development in the framework of free competition, must ensure that demand for their services is created."
"Secondly, the June List believes that political objectives in this area need to be formulated and implemented at national level in the framework of institutional competition in order to devise constructive solutions for encouraging the development of broadband."
"The June List is therefore voting against the report as a whole."
"We welcome the adoption of our amendment aimed at considering that 'general access to broadband is an essential prerequisite for social development and improved public services and that public authorities should make every effort to ensure that all citizens have access to broadband, thereby enabling its benefits to extend to every section of the population, particularly in the less-developed areas of the Union'. We are very disappointed, however, by the rejection of our amendments, which included the following:"
"'whereas some parts of geographically highly fragmented outermost regions still have no access to essential ICT infrastructure such as broadband Internet; whereas this applies to, for example, the Western Azores group (Flores and Corvo), which thus has to suffer greater constraints on account of its remoteness and is therefore being penalised twice over';"
"and 'considers it necessary to allow for the differences between individual outermost regions, one example being the constraint imposed by geographical fragmentation of the kind that exists in the Azores and the Canary Islands, which implies a need to guarantee the right of access to essential ICT infrastructure such as broadband Internet in all parts of the outermost regions to their inhabitants as a whole'."
"I am voting in favour of Gunnar H√∂kmark's report on a European policy on broadband."
"The rapporteur rightly stresses that the development of broadband Internet connections will contribute to the creation of advanced, global healthcare systems, as well as facilitating better access to professional training and government administrative services."
"The 500 million European citizens who have broadband access will also provide Europe with the opportunity to become the leading, knowledge-based economy in the world."
"I fully support the appeal, addressed to Member States, for broadband access in all schools, universities and educational establishments."
"I think that improving the broadband infrastructure should be a priority and that significant funds should be earmarked for this purpose."
"I am also sure that European Union funds should be used to modernise or replace broadband networks that do not provide access with a sufficient traffic volume."
"in writing. - (FR) The dynamism of regional economies is strongly dependent on the level of development of information and communication technologies, among which is access to the Internet via high speed broadband connections."
"The European Union must indisputably play a major role in promoting, among its Member States and its regions, the fight against the 'digital divide', in order to reduce the gap separating individuals, businesses and territories in terms of access to the knowledge society."
"Government support, channelled within the framework of public-private partnerships, must, as a priority, target the areas that are ill served."
"Wireless connections and mobile and satellite communications can deliver broadband to areas traditionally excluded from fixed-line networks, thus offering interesting and inexpensive solutions for people living in remote or relatively inaccessible areas, such as the island or mountain regions and, of course, the outermost regions."
"In the outermost regions, these technologies are even more useful than elsewhere, as they make it possible to overcome distances and reduce costs and timescales by facilitating relations between users and their service providers, between clients and their suppliers or even between the public and the public authorities."
"(DE) Mr President, we abstained from voting on the Quisthoudt-Rowohl report, despite welcoming, of course, the fact that there was a 20% growth in mutual trade between Russia and the European Union last year and individual Member States have closer cooperation with Russia, for example in the field of oil and gas."
"Better cooperation should be sought in general terms, although the main focus on both sides must be on the resolution of the issue of the meat embargo."
"The most important thing is to refute the Russian accusations of poor quality and meat smuggling without delay in order to prepare the ground for negotiations on the strategic partnership agreement due to expire at the end of the year."
"Energy supplies are being used as a strategic, political weapon - a fact that should have been clear to us since the Russian-Ukrainian conflict if it was not clear already."
"In this regard, we Europeans will have to start considering a single line and policy strategy already, so that we have a clear position with which to defy Russia in the foreseeable event that such things recur."
"We should not forget, however, that our dependence is reciprocal, and that our objective must be to form a viable axis between Europe and Russia, which - in my opinion - should not apply only to trade relations."
"I believe that there should be a public service obligation imposed on service providers of broadband technology."
"As someone who lives in a village in Gloucestershire, that only within the last 12 months or so has had access to broadband, I know the economic consequences of exclusion."
"I accept that the installation of broadband will start with the more populous and accessible regions, but it should not be allowed to stop until over 99% of the population is covered."
"Service providers cannot be allowed to cherry-pick without adverse consequences for peripheral regions and economies."
"I will vote in favour of this report as it is going a long way in the right direction, if not quite reaching my final destination."
"This report reflects the current climate of inter-capitalist contradictions between the major powers of the EU and Russia."
"The report sets out its approach to intervention in Russia - which goes to show that it is nothing but a guide to neoliberal policy - designed to induce Russia to pander to the interests and ambitions of the major economic and financial groups in the EU."
"Take, for example, the significant criticism of 'the bill recently introduced in the Russian Federation, which allows the government to reject foreign bids for majority stakes in Russian companies, thus prohibiting foreign ownership of more than 49% in companies active in 39 strategic industries'."
"The majority in Parliament 'questions the bill itself as well as the choice and the growing number of industries that have been classified as strategic and essential to national security' in Russia."
"Furthermore, and perhaps because it reveals too much of the real intentions of this report, the following paragraph was removed: 'considers that this does not represent a move towards improving the investment climate and that this raises fundamental questions regarding the role of the State in a market economy and competition in key sectors of the economy; considers that the ownership situation of companies, in Russia as in other countries, is a matter which can best be determined by the market'."
"Need one say more?"
"Russia's importance to the EU is based on a combination of factors such as its geography, its scale, its strategic position, its importance in terms of energy supply - specifically as an alternative to energy sources located in the Middle East - the memories that are particularly fresh in most of the Member States that joined the EU in the last two rounds of enlargement, trade and, of course, Russia's role in international relations."
"With regard to all of these factors, realism is needed."
"Realism must not, however, be confused with ignorance of the difficulties nor with the absence of a framework of values."
"Although improvements have been made in some areas, today's Russia is far from being a free and open democracy that upholds human rights in full."
"I therefore applaud the way in which the EU succeeded in speaking with one voice at the recent EU-Russia summit and the fact that it managed to raise a number of the Member States' concerns and interests."
"Although the results achieved are not ideal, an approach such as this is preferable; an approach that recognises the multiplicity of European interests, that represents those interests and that remains faithful to its framework of values."
"Mr President, the votes today on the Ferreira report demonstrate once again the relentless attack on countries in Europe that operate low corporation tax regimes."
"The putting in place of a common consolidated corporation tax base means that there will be greater distribution of corporation tax receipts to the exchequers of the larger EU Member States at the expense of others."
"Even if eight or more countries agreed to a common consolidated corporate tax base, this would in turn have the effect of invalidating existing bilateral tax treaties with Member States that chose to participate in a CCCTB arrangement."
"Efforts are already being made by some Member States whereby corporation tax receipts would be made in the country where is sold."
"This would be very bad news from an Irish perspective because many of the large companies in Ireland only manufacture or produce new goods and services that are sold in the larger EU Member States."
"Let nobody be in any doubt - and in particular after the very hostile and negative comments recently made by the German Finance Minister - that Ireland and other countries with low corporation tax regimes face a real battle to keep their low corporation tax structure in place, which has kept employment high, unemployment low and has been one of the main planks of a successful economy."
"(SK) I have voted against the report by Mrs Ferreira because in section 13 the rapporteur proposes the introduction of a consolidated tax base throughout the EU."
"In my opinion, tax base consolidation would be the first step towards consolidating the rates of corporate income tax. This would have negative implications by diminishing the competitive pressures to which Member States are exposed."
"In my opinion tax competition is necessary, since it prompts states to introduce necessary reforms."
"My country, Slovakia, is experiencing an economic boom thanks to the numerous reforms implemented by the former prime minister, Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda."
"Slovakia is an example of how simple, transparent, neutral rules generate more government revenue."
"Tax revenue does not depend merely on the tax rate, but first and foremost on a broad tax base and the number of exemptions, allowances, special regimes, etc. For this reason, I am strongly opposed to any corporate income tax harmonisation."
"Parliament tends to use annual sectoral reports - in this case on Competition Policy 2005 - to present its maximalist positions."
"This time, it is doing so in relation to the idea of implementing the liberalisation of the entire energy sector by 1 July 2007, in relation to the harmonisation of business taxation (with a common consolidated corporate tax base) and in relation to the reduction and control of state aid, which is a distinctive characteristic of the EU's competition policy."
"It also makes a point of amending competition rules when they block the concentration and centralisation of capital."
"All of this is done in the name of the neoliberal Lisbon Agenda."
"Hence our vote against."
"There are two points in particular that deserve to be highlighted."
"First, we wish to restate our opposition to changes of strategy in relation to mergers and the impact of competition."
"These changes are aimed at encouraging even bigger European multinationals to compete globally, instead of at looking into the impact of the concentration of businesses in national markets, while 'monopolies' and public authorities continue to be criticised."
"Mergers and acquisitions have trebled in value since 2003."
"Secondly, there has been an attempt to apply competition rules to services of general interest by the back door."
"I voted against paragraph 13 and the overall report on Competition Policy 2005."
"I am opposed to the introduction of a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base as I believe it would be a first step toward tax harmonisation."
"The Union's competition policy is vitally important in an open market economy."
"Measures in the area of fair trade in goods and services - for example, price reductions, increased quality, choice for consumers and the important development of technological innovation - are crucial prerequisites if we are to make the most of the openness of the markets."
"We voted today for greater clarification of competition rules and greater legal certainty, in order that maximum benefit can be derived from all the measures that have been taken to improve the effectiveness, transparency and consistency of this policy."
"The current approach seeks to go beyond a merely formal outlook with regard to competition rules, so that we can better assess the actual or potential effects of certain practices or structural changes in companies."
"Decentralisation is a further positive trend in this regard."
"I therefore voted in favour of the Ferreira report."
"The EPLP believes that the general approach of the rapporteur was the right one."
"However, on the issue of the common consolidated corporate tax base, the EPLP keeps its long established view that this is a case of national sovereignty."
"As such, we voted against the second part of paragraph 13."
"UKIP refuses to support the recommendation of the Equitable Life enquiry on a number of grounds. Principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have proved disastrous."
"Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life Policy holders but not National Provident Institution policy holders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing."
"The EPLP supported the setting up of this committee because it believed Parliament could use it as an opportunity to provide clarification and learn lessons from the Equitable Life crisis and give a voice to the victims."
"Several of the facts of the crisis and its aftermath were not included in the report, so the final result is not balanced."
"The report has also been used by the opposition parties to attack the Labour government, while misleading the policyholders by falsely raising their expectations."
"This vote is on a recommendation to adopt the findings of the report and not the report itself, following the committee vote there were no further opportunities to amend or improve the text."
"Therefore the EPLP abstains on this vote."
"UKIP refuses to support the recommendation of the Equitable Life inquiry on a number of grounds, principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have proved disastrous."
"Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life policyholders but not National Provident Institution policyholders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing."
"in writing. - (NL) As a member of the committee of inquiry, I have looked into the quality aspects of legislation."
"The committee of inquiry has concluded that whilst the Commission monitors the formal transposition, it does not sufficiently monitor the application."
"Is legislation transposed correctly and is it transposed in such a way as to ensure that its application complies with the objectives of European legislation?"
"We as MEPs should also monitor to a far greater extent what happens with legislation in the Member States once we have approved it."
"As I see it, the responsible rapporteur should monitor what is subsequently done in the Member States."
"The rapporteur needs to sound the alarm bell when things go wrong and if necessary, get the Commission to take action."
"I would also counsel in favour of including the national parliaments."
"Structured cooperation between the Member States in the area of national supervisors leaves a great deal to be desired."
"This is not only affecting supervision in the area of financial markets, but also in all kinds of other areas."
"In the Member States, the number of independent supervisors is increasing."
"The big question is: who supervises these supervisors?"
"Is this not where the European Commission could play a substantial role?"
"I will be abstaining on this report."
"When the committee of inquiry was established, I thought it would be an important opportunity to learn important lessons from the near-collapse of Equitable Life and provide some explanations to those who were the victims."
"The problem is that the report disappoints with sins of both omission and commission."
"It falsely raises the hopes and expectations of policyholders and has been used in a blatant political way to attack the Government."
"In the circumstances of a committee of inquiry report where there is no possibility, in line with our Rules, to table amendments, I cannot in all conscience vote in favour of the report."
"UKIP refuses to support the recommendation of the Equitable Life enquiry on a number of grounds. Principally that recommendations include a common regulatory policy similar in concept to the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which have proved disastrous."
"Also a recommendation that taxpayers should compensate Equitable Life policy holders but not National Provident Institution policy holders or failed institutional pension scheme members whose case is no less convincing."
"Mr President, I should like to emphasise my opposition to Amendments 7 and 8."
"The vote was not controlled and I wish to express my opposition, because their content is beside the point. It touches on the principle of subsidiarity and I personally believe that the reference to exceptions weakens the principle of equal treatment."
"I hope that the report will have a good result and will help everyone, without exceptions."
"(DE) Mr President, on behalf of the Members from the German Free Democratic Party, I should like to say that Mrs Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou's report deals with a very important issue, namely measures enabling the combination of family life with a period of studies."
"We have cast our vote to show our solidarity with those of our fellow Members who worked on it."
"Nevertheless, I should like to emphasise on behalf of my colleagues that, in our opinion, this issue is one that should be dealt with exclusively at national level rather than by the European Union. Accordingly, this Parliament should take the opportunity presented by this report to conduct a more careful examination of which issues fall within our competence and which would be better left to the nation-states."
"in writing. (SV) People's level of education is crucial to their personal development and to European growth and innovation."
"The opportunity for students to have families is also very significant from an equality perspective."
"It is therefore important for the EU Member States to invest more in creating good conditions for enabling people to study and have families at the same time."
"In the light of this, we chose to vote in favour of the report in spite of the fact that most of the topics it addresses are national, regional and local, rather than European, responsibilities."
"This report underlines the importance to all young people, men and women, of the benefits of high quality education and training that is adapted to the new demands of the market, and of constantly updating their knowledge in order to be able to enter the labour market and make lasting progress."
"The level of education is an essential factor in the growth and innovation capacity of a society."
"The OECD considers that adding an additional year to the average time spent in education increases the rate of growth by about 5% immediately and by about 2.5% in the long term."
"In countries with a higher level of studies, there is less inequality between people, which is a major challenge for Portugal, a country with the highest inequality and the lowest educational training in the EU."
"In general, the higher the level of studies reached, the higher the level of employment."
"Looking at the whole population aged from 25 to 64, the employment rate of those with higher education qualifications was 84% in 2001, that is to say, approximately 15 points higher than the average for people of all levels of education and almost 30 points higher than for those who had not progressed further than lower secondary education."
"in writing."
"(PL) Mr President, I am voting in favour of Marie Panayotopolous-Cassiotou's report on a regulatory framework for measures to reconcile family life and a period of study in the European Union."
"Member States should give more consideration to the position of young women and men with families The report accurately stresses the need for a framework of policies that would provide more support for young people so that they can study and raise a family without needing to prioritise one of these goals."
"The rapporteur suggests that the expectations of young women and men who both study and have families should be taken more into account in terms of educational systems and social structures."
"This could involve offering favourable student insurance as well as providing social support and medical care which could also cover the student's dependants."
"Other measures could include reducing the tax burden or not taxing students with families."
"As a university lecturer, I think that the report's appeal to Member States to work together with higher education and vocational institutions to create a more flexible framework for studying, which takes advantage of new technology in the field of education, deserves our full support."
"in writing. Work-life balance and work-study-life balance is essential for a healthy and happy workforce."
"Young women who study and have childcare responsibilities need to be given greater support across the EU."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 12.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)"
"Membership of Parliament"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the competent Irish authorities have informed me that, with effect from today, 19 June 2007, Mr Colm Burke has been appointed as a Member of the European Parliament in place of Mr Simon Coveney."
"I should like to wish Mr Burke a very warm welcome to the European Parliament."
"May your work give you great pleasure."
"Mr President, I should like to join with you in welcoming Colm here, replacing our colleague Simon Coveney, who has been elected to the Irish Parliament."
"I take this opportunity to wish Simon every success in his future in national politics."
"We have an excellent replacement in Colm Burke, from Simon's constituency of Cork South."
"Thank you very much, Mrs Doyle."
"With your good wishes it must be a success!"
"Pursuant to Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Procedure, until such time as his credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, and provided that he has made a written declaration that he does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament, Mr Burke may take his seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights attaching thereto."
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"(The Minutes of yesterday's sitting were approved)"
"Conclusions of the G8 meeting - MDGs at the Midway Point (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"statements by the Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the G8 Summit;"
"the report by Mrs Kinnock, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the Millennium Development Goals - the midway point."
"The Council is not present."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I shall make a few comments, as I have been asked to do, about the outcome of the Heiligendamm Summit regarding development issues and issues relating to Africa."
"The mere fact that these issues should once again have received particular attention was already in itself good news."
"The reaffirmation of Africa as an important subject in the G8 process is a good thing, but it is obviously nothing special considering the actual results."
"I quite understand the criticisms of those who are disappointed by the references to development aid."
"The compromise adopted limits itself to simply reiterating the Gleneagles commitment, and I think we could have been more ambitious."
"We know that the European Union of 27 will, for its part, be financing between 80 and 100% of the G8 commitment to Africa."
"We should not allow the G8 members to neglect their own commitment which, as I recall, consisted of doubling aid to Africa."
"Some G8 members are not at all on the right track for honouring this commitment."
"Overall American aid, for example, has fallen by 20% and Japan's by 10%, and they should certainly do more."
"With regard to questions of governance as well as fundamental principles of development policy, I am reasonably happy that our approach to good governance, that is to say one that is multidimensional and holistic, as well as the wording that we suggested, have been retained in the final declaration on Africa."
"Our governance strategy is focused on results and on offering incentives for reform to those countries that are engaged in appropriate and credible reforms of governance based on sound political will."
"I am pleased to highlight the fact that the work of the G8 Summit this year focused particularly on education: that is undoubtedly one of our most valuable contributions."
"The declaration clearly expresses the necessity for financing those needs that are not covered and that are estimated to have a monetary value of USD 500 million for 2007 in all the countries that come under the Fast Track Initiative."
"I am also delighted with the final text on financial resources for health issues, for the Global Fund and for programmes for the prevention of transmission from mother to child."
"The USD 60 billion that were promised for the next few years in order to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis represent a clear and strict commitment in comparison with the cautious language that was used initially and that omitted any definite indication of the financial resources required."
"I am going to conclude my remarks concerning the G8 with an observation of a more general nature."
"The beauty contest of figures and declarations that the G8 seems to have become where development is concerned does not win over our African partners."
"Quite the contrary, as the latter confront us with the lack of results on the ground and, above all, with our lack of respect for our commitments."
"They do so all the more forcibly, moreover, having found an alternative model in China."
"Not only is China purchasing huge amounts of raw materials in Africa, but it is constructing roads, ministries and hospitals in the months following the request it received and the promise it made."
"That is quite a coup when our own procedures which, moreover, were basically established by the Council and the European Parliament, impose upon us de facto timescales of several years between the time when the agreement was reached and the time when it will actually be implemented."
"We must also, however, learn a lesson where the G8 is concerned: while Africa is increasingly developing relations with emerging countries, the G8 beauty contest is going to become a side show which will become less and less convincing if we do not manage to include China and the other emerging countries in international initiatives on Africa and development."
"It is, indeed, for this reason that I shall be going to China at the beginning of July: to talk about Africa with Chinese colleagues."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, before I finish, I should like to say a few words about Mrs Kinnock's report and therefore about the Millennium Development Goals at the midway point, the current relevance of which seems to me to be quite indisputable."
"I remain convinced that the Millennium Goals are within our reach, provided, of course, that all those active in development - not only the sponsors but also partner countries - honour their commitments."
"I should also like to emphasise the European Union's firm and total commitment in this crucial period of implementing those goals."
"On this point, I should like, therefore, to make a few observations - and, indeed, express a few reservations - regarding the detail of the message contained in the report."
"If I am naturally very broadly in agreement with the content of this report, I am all the same a little surprised by the mixed message that the report sends out to the world regarding the European Union's performance as a donor."
"I should like to point out that the European Union is - and let us not forget this - the main provider of development aid, in terms of volume as well as in terms of percentage of gross domestic income: we devote EUR 100 per head to it, compared with the figures of only EUR 69 contributed by Japan and of EUR 53 contributed by the United States."
"This is not a reason for wallowing in blissful self-satisfaction, of course, because progress is obviously possible and necessary in this area."
"Such progress is, moreover, planned as the European Union is committed to it through the European Consensus on Development."
"The report laments the fact that the increase in aid from certain Member States results partly from debt cancellation."
"I agree, of course, with the thrust of this remark or this reservation."
"Having said that, even leaving aside debt relief, aid from the European Union has increased, which is not the case where the other major donors are concerned."
"We are, nonetheless, obviously sensitive to this argument, and that is why the Commission has invited the Member States to establish, by the end of the year, a national schedule showing the budget increases that will allow the Member States to achieve their development aid objectives by 2010."
"Moreover, we must not underestimate either the effectiveness measures or the multiplier effect of dividing the work between the Commission and the Member States. Nor must we underestimate the value of aligning ourselves with the strategies and procedures of partner countries or, still less, the growing recourse to budget support, which is considerable."
"In these areas too, the European Union is in a position of undisputed leadership."
"I note, however, a certain unease regarding budget support which, nevertheless, is the preferred instrument of partnership, reflecting confidence between partners who are equal in terms of rights and duties."
"By supporting national policies and involving ourselves in the budget process, we are putting in place the instrument best suited to appropriation by the partner countries, an arrangement that also offers greater predictability and exceptional flexibility."
"Of course, it is still possible to improve the mechanism."
"That is the purpose of the contract for the Millennium Goals on which the Commission is currently working - a matter on which I touched briefly yesterday when I replied in committee to our colleague, Mr van den Berg - and we shall be able, in the weeks ahead, to discuss with you the criteria and the conditions of this contract for the Millennium Goals."
"Those are just a few remarks. Otherwise, I believe that it is vital to join forces in pursuit of the Millennium Goals."
"Thanks to our approach, developing countries will receive a clear message of solidarity from the European Union, which can only be a support to them in expressing their own determination."
"In conclusion, I must thank Mrs Kinnock for this very significant report and congratulate her on it. It does put the issues in their proper context."
"It is an extremely useful contribution and a constant source of inspiration for the work of the Commission."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, thank you very much for being here, giving the status that these issues deserve in this Parliament."
"I should also like to thank the Commissioner for his kind remarks."
"I think many of us here deeply regret the fact that the Council chose not to be represented here today in discussions on the G8 and the Millennium Development Goals."
"We are sorry that priorities took them elsewhere."
"My report is an opportunity at the midway point to assess progress or otherwise on meeting the Millennium Development Goals."
"Of course the reality is that many sub-Saharan countries are not on track to meet even one of the MDGs."
"Virtually no country in Africa is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals for child and maternal health."
"That is why our committee agreed that the European Union should continue to lead on efforts to support sexual and reproductive health rights through funding and other support."
"In 2005, the leaders of the rich world met at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles and undertook to double annual aid to poor countries to USD 50 billion, and to give 100% debt cancellation."
"In May 2005, the EU Council had already set the agenda for the Gleneagles Summit which took place in July of that year."
"They had agreed - and this is important - a time-bound commitment to meeting the 0.7% of GNI and 100% debt relief."
"At the time of writing my report, it was clear that were serious questions of credibility in relation to certain Member States of the European Union."
"This is where I have a fundamental disagreement with the Commissioner."
"Excluding debt relief, a number of Member States are falling behind."
"The Iraq and Nigerian debt deals have been counted in such a way as to distort the true picture on real aid."
"It is estimated that it amounted to some USD 13 billion in 2006."
"In 2010, when aid to Africa is supposed to reach USD 50 billion a year, debt relief would have been largely accounted for and would therefore no longer bolster the amount of aid a country gives."
"The shortfall is now estimated by Oxfam to be an absolutely shocking USD 30 billion."
"At the G8, we saw efforts by some Member States of the European Union to press for the promises to be met."
"But what we saw, as you said Commissioner, was a reiteration and confirmation of the 2005 promises to increase aid."
"We are still lacking clear timetables and binding practical commitments."
"We need more specifics and clear financial pledges which will, for instance, fill in the funding gaps for the countries endorsed by the Education Fast Track Initiative."
"We also need clarity on the pledge to scale up universal access to HIV/Aids."
"They talk about 5 million people in 2010."
"We want to know whether this is a global figure, because, if it is, it should be more like 10 million."
"If it only applies to Africa, then the communiqu√© is presenting a somewhat different picture."
"Of course, again, there is no specific target date."
"The reality is that developing countries do not want some kind of cheque in the post or some kind of promissory note."
"They want to be able to put credible and costed plans in place, as our own governments do."
"On climate change, all the G8s except the US and Russia agreed to cut emissions by half by 2050."
"The US commitment to join in with the UN efforts was welcome."
"However, again I have to say that there were no clear binding targets, and even the 50% by 2050 target had no base year agreed by the G8 in Germany."
"There is also no agreed intention to limit climate change to 2¬∞C. In the context of the importance we attach to debt relief and to pledges on aid, we know that the whole issue of trade justice continues to elude us."
"Last year in the G8 in St Petersburg they issued a grand clarion call for the Doha Round to reach a successful conclusion, but what you see, in fact, is a far cry from what developing countries thought they were signing up to when they signed up to a Doha development round."
"All the G8 in Germany did was to repeat what they said in St Petersburg a year ago."
"On EPAs, I particularly recommend Mr van den Berg's amendment, which unfortunately was left out of the text that you have here because an error was made when the compilation took place."
"I think it makes a very valuable addition to the debate on EPAs."
"Finally, I would like to say that what we need to see now is an absolute change of gear."
"In 2005, thousands of our citizens across the world marched under the banner of making poverty history."
"We are seeing that aid really works."
"There are real improvements in reducing poverty, getting children into school, improving health and saving lives."
"However, there has to be real social and political change, as well as the growing understanding that what we are calling for here is not for charity but rather for justice for the world's developing countries."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you for your excellent work, Mrs Kinnock, and congratulations on your report."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, the Millennium Development Goals, that were laid down in 2000, are ambitious plans to drastically reduce world poverty by 2015."
"At the end of this month, we are half-way through this period, but not half-way in terms of realising these goals, unfortunately, not by a long shot."
"The development agenda is running way behind schedule."
"There are still too many people dying of starvation, too many children still have no access to schooling, too many women are still disadvantaged and AIDS, malaria and TBC are still claiming too many victims, and I could go on for some time, unfortunately."
"It is vital that the quality and quantity of the aid should improve, and much depends on the political will in the countries."
"Needless to say, all countries must deliver on their promise to set aside 0.7% of the Gross Domestic Product for development aid."
"This is not just about money, though."
"It is mainly about better and more effective aid, and about better coordination of this aid."
"Phantom aid, whereby the money is mainly spent on consultants, assessment reports and studies, must be reduced."
"On behalf of my group, I should like to broach a number of other points."
"First of all, I should like to draw your attention to the importance of transparency of financial flows."
"It must be clear where the monies end up."
"Secondly, with regard to debt reduction, whilst debts are a major problem to many countries, their reduction cannot and indeed, should not, be a reward for mismanagement by governments."
"This is why debt reduction is only possible under strict conditions, including good governance and transparency."
"It must be guaranteed that the resources which have become available are actually spent on fighting poverty."
"Thirdly, I should like to draw your attention to the importance of trade."
"Trade and the opening up of markets can, under certain conditions, represent a tremendous driving force for economic growth."
"Countries must be able to count on our support in this."
"As for intellectual property rights, I should like to caution against throwing out the baby with the bath water."
"It must remain appealing for industry to continue to do research into the fight against poverty-related diseases."
"A certain level of protection for patents of intellectual property rights is needed for this."
"Finally, with regard to sexual and reproductive health, many women in developing countries run high risks, even risking their own lives, during and after pregnancy."
"Many women die unnecessarily from it. Aid in this area is extremely urgent."
"This is why we are in favour of more aid for these women."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, unfortunately, the Council is absent, something which the Socialist Group in the European Parliament is deeply disappointed about."
"In 2000, 191 world leaders committed to the Millennium Declaration to stamp out extreme poverty in the world by 2015 and to improve the health and well-being of the poorest."
"At the moment, one in five of the world's population has no access to basic social needs, including education and clean drinking water."
"In exactly two and a half weeks' time, we will be half-way towards the MDG deadline."
"The excellent report by Mrs Kinnock, which we back fully, takes stock of what we have achieved thus far."
"Over the past seven and a half years, people have worked hard on realising these goals, and a number of great successes have been achieved."
"Particularly in Asia, where there has been a major reduction in poverty."
"The number of people who have to survive on less than 1 dollar per day has decreased there by over a quarter of a billion people since 1990."
"In Central America too, things are visibly on the up."
"In both regions, the number of undernourished children has decreased drastically."
"Child mortality has been cut by many percentage points."
"Hundreds of thousands of people in Central America and Asia have been lifted out of poverty, something which these regions and the whole world should be proud of."
"What is still going wrong in Asia and Central America is the yawning gap between the rich and the poor."
"We have to help implement strategies for a fairer distribution of natural resources and of soil, for fairer taxes, less corruption and good governance."
"Too many people, despite all the growth and progress, are still deprived of basic social needs."
"This is what the focus of European aid programmes, via civil society, should be."
"On one continent, the Millennium Goals have been getting further away instead of closer in recent years."
"Africa, despite separate valiant achievements, despite the efforts of many, is going downhill."
"It is unlikely that any of these Millennium Goals will be met there on time."
"Three quarters of the population suffer from AIDS/HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"The number of starving people has risen in that region by many tens of millions."
"How can we change the mindset of the groups that are successful?"
"How can we help African businesspeople, women's cooperatives and micro-credit banks help turn the tide?"
"First of all, by placing centre-stage not only the victims, but also the successes, including, for example, the end of the wars, in Mozambique among other places, not to mention top African diplomats such as Kofi Annan, fashion houses from Abuja, wine farmers from South Africa, pilots from Ghana, top football players from across Africa and female ICT entrepreneurs."
"They are the ones who will change Africa."
"They are the ones that I want to form partnerships with."
"They are the ones on whom we should focus our European aid."
"They must receive trade benefits instead of being pestered with our dumped goods."
"It is time for a new beginning. A turning point, albeit an uphill one."
"After all, if we combine quality and national resources with our genuine cooperation in the areas of aid and trade, Africa can rise from the ashes."
"Genuine cooperation means that we need to focus the European Development Fund and our aid budgets more on the Millennium Goals, education and health care."
"You are right, Commissioner, MDG contracts are a good way of achieving this."
"This also includes the G8, which set real deadlines for major tasks."
"Genuine cooperation means generous economic partnership agreements."
"African businesspeople must be able to place their products on our markets with added value."
"If GSP-plus can help in this, then it should."
"Let us build an African team made up of good players, of winners, and let us give the African team the chance of winning this football game in the second half of the 2015 match for the MDGs."
"This will benefit Africa, and indeed, the rest of the world."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, it is probably not a coincidence that a great deal of Dutch is being spoken in a debate on development cooperation, something which pleases me enormously."
"Judging from the G8 results, it is safe to say that the process of achieving the Millennium Development Goals is starting to become a case of one step forward and two steps back."
"Indeed, the subject of Africa did come up briefly in Heiligendamm, even if it was with the intention of not alienating Bono and Bob Geldof."
"These pledges from 2005 were once again reiterated, but no fresh commitments were made, let alone a timetable."
"I share Mrs Kinnock's concern that, at this rate, we will not get there by 2015."
"Moreover, the Kinnock report has become a very even-handed document, in which our group's concerns have also been taken into consideration."
"Let me list them for you briefly."
"Firstly, the 0.7% should not be an obsession."
"The quality and effectiveness of the aid granted are at least as important as the quantity."
"The so-called development spending of certain governments leaves many questions unanswered, and coordination often leaves something to be desired."
"Secondly, more direct budgetary aid is inevitable if we want to achieve the MDG goals, but this should be conditional, primarily upon good governance and also on parliamentary control being carried out as a matter of vital importance."
"Thirdly, we are in favour of further debt reduction."
"Not linear, but conditional."
"The capital that becomes available in this way could be paid into a fund that is first and foremost channelled into education and health care."
"I should like to finish off by saying that the debate about whether we should give priority to achieving the MDGs or aid for trade is a false dilemma which we do not wish to get involved in."
"As far as we are concerned, it is not a question of either/or, but of both/and."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, only a joint, global effort can help Africa today."
"Europe's persistent funding on so-called reproductive rights, including abortion, poses a fundamental obstacle to this unity."
"From both a moral and a medical point of view, abortion is not the answer to the problem of childbirth-related deaths in Africa."
"If we want to help African women in this field, we should send medical aid, provide drinking water, education and medical facilities."
"Using European Union resources to fund abortion in Africa is contrary to the principles of providing aid."
"It forces all European Union citizens to become indirectly involved in this matter."
"It is also a form of moral imperialism directed towards Africa, which is an attitude that cannot be condoned in this House."
"That is why I ask you to vote against points 40 and 41 in the report."
"I particularly direct this appeal to the Christian Democrat Members in this House."
"If my appeal is not successful, we will not be able to support this report."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now conducting a mid-term review of the great efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the assessment is poor - that much emerges clearly from Mrs Kinnock's report."
"My group supports this good report most emphatically."
"If the political situation continues like this, many developing countries, particularly in Africa, will not achieve the Millennium Development Goals and most industrialised countries will not keep their promises to provide financial assistance."
"Unfortunately, the G8 Summit in Heiligendamm in Germany was one more example of this."
"Since 1999, at two-year intervals, the same promises have been made and broken time and again."
"This casts doubt on the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of many developing countries."
"The promises made in Heiligendamm are now being offset against the promises made in Gleneagles."
"Sixty billion US dollars for the Global Fund, but we are being told that that will be offset against the broken promises from Gleneagles."
"This is what is known as double-entry book-keeping."
"It is an attempt to cause confusion with figures without obligating individual countries."
"I thought it was very good that the Commissioner expressed himself very clearly in this connection: that is precisely what is needed."
"It is Parliament's responsibility to state things clearly and exert the pressure needed to ensure that at least the European Union keeps to its progressive plan for achieving the 0.7% target for Official Development Assistance by 2015 exactly and without book-keeping tricks."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, we are taking stock of the G8 Summit."
"This G8 Summit issued a declaration on climate change that is quite clearly worthless."
"I endorse the statements made by environmental organisations;"
"Greenpeace said that it was absolutely insufficient, and Friends of the Earth Germany described the promises given as 'woolly'."
"No binding commitments emerged."
"I endorse what Commissioner Michel said about there not having been nearly enough discussion on Africa."
"Debt relief for the poorest countries is still overdue."
"Since this is also a debate on the G8 Summit as a whole, however, I should like to remind the House once more that these G8 countries have no legitimacy whatsoever."
"They are self-appointed world leaders."
"This G8 Summit cost EUR 100 million, the fence around Heiligendamm alone costing EUR 12.5 million of this."
"There was a very successful 80 000-strong demonstration against this Summit, and the rioting - which was wrong and regrettable - was used by the police to subsequently abandon the rule of law."
"For example, we now know that undercover police investigators were among the demonstrators and probably also incited them to violence."
"Lawyers were hardly able to do their jobs there, and judges became an extension of the police."
"The lawyers had a long fight to even be allowed through to the prisoners."
"Prison cages were set up, which Amnesty International has criticised in no uncertain terms and described as wrong."
"The Summit was surrounded by repression worthy of a police state."
"One does not always have to look far to find repression of citizens; human rights are being trodden underfoot in the midst of the European Union, in the context of this G8 Summit."
"Mr President, first I do not think that any citizen in the world has confidence in this G8 summit."
"It is reminiscent of the feudal lords of 400 years ago, who met and decided certain things without giving the people a say."
"This is modern feudalism."
"The G8 will meet and a lottery will be held for eight delegates from poor countries to attend."
"We are talking about Africa."
"Tell me the name of one large hospital in the whole of Africa."
"Would you go to Tanzania, Mr President, if you had a serious health problem?"
"You would go to Germany or England."
"Tell me the name of one large bank with its headquarters in Africa."
"All the big banks to which we entrust our money are in the northern hemisphere."
"This is a special type of racism to which we should finally admit. Or at the very least there is tolerance of a type of racism towards these countries."
"What we give them are the tips we give someone who cleans our windows."
"We need a decision, an ideology whereby all citizens of the world have the same rights to democracy and to health and to involvement in decisions which concern them."
"I do not think that what is happening today is democracy."
"We are sharing the wealth, we are creating cancer throughout the world, while the superpower - America - does not agree to support Kyoto, with the result that death and global warming are affecting everyone, and the people have no say."
"We therefore need more democracy, better access and more respect for citizens, especially in countries where democracy is not yet shining brightly enough."
"We must be careful, because otherwise we shall get a new AIDS from Africa, which will be more catastrophic than this AIDS which sends many citizens from the northern hemisphere to the other world."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to see that the Commissioner for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid is back with us."
"We know how busy his schedule is."
"His leave of absence as Commissioner to play an active role in Belgium's parliamentary elections may have come to an end - and this European Commissioner's leave of absence has certainly not been in vain for his party, which I should like to congratulate him on."
"Nonetheless, we have to note with admiration and some surprise that he remains active on both fronts, even after his leave: here in this Chamber as the Commissioner for Development Cooperation, but also in Brussels where feverish activity is prevailing as a new Belgian Government is being formed and where today, the Commissioner is urging my country's French-speaking Green Party to join the government."
"Indeed, it is not easy combining the job of European Commissioner with that of Belgium's deputy 'informateur' investigating on behalf of the crown whether a proposed cabinet formation will succeed."
"The question whether this mix may not lead to possible bias and whether the Commission's neutrality is in the balance as a result, probably comes into this too."
"Quite apart from this comment, it would be better - and I am now referring to the Kinnock report - to turn our attention to the question of how scientific our approach is towards the Millennium Goals."
"This provocative question was put by Amir Attaran, an authority in development cooperation at the University of Ottawa in Canada."
"Indeed, Mr Attaran very much questions the scientific basis underpinning these objectives and above all, the way in which achieving these is being measured."
"He mentions, by way of example, the objective concerning malaria, and states that even institutions such as the World Health Organisation admit that they are not certain of the relevant data that is being provided."
"By accepting uncertain statistics as the truth, the UN is building a set of Millennium Objectives on quicksand, according to Mr Attaran."
"Scientific reliability should be the first concern in development cooperation too."
"It is time we held a thorough debate on this very subject."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur and my colleagues for the excellent work achieved and for the support given to my amendments within the Committee on Development."
"I would like to spend some time on a few points."
"The fight against AIDS, particularly in the light of the UN's recent reports and the lack of progress made so far in the Millennium Development Goals, must continue to be a priority for the international community, an unbreakable commitment and a responsibility to be borne by the industrialised countries. This is because it is impossible to carry on talking of economic development, education and health infrastructure if in fact the active population that is able to carry out these reforms is being decimated day after day, despite the contribution of therapies and medicines that are clearly not yet adequate or not effective enough."
"According to the UNAIDS report, there were between 4 and 6 million new cases in 2006, with 3 million deaths in the same year, two-thirds of which were in sub-Saharan Africa, the region where the Millennium Development Goals are mainly applicable."
"This is over 8 000 deaths a day, a figure which is truly untenable."
"With regard to this struggle and the struggle against poverty in general we are very far from our roadmap and we can no longer accept the excuses of those countries - my own included, unfortunately - which have not yet met the commitments they have promised to the international community, bearing in mind the fact that these are already minimal."
"We must ask the governments of the donor countries, in addition, not only for greater efficiency in development aid, but also for full consistency with their own trade policies, because supporting development means above all giving countries in difficulty the chance to raise themselves up with their own resources."
"On the horizon there are, then, new challenges, stakes, tests and commitments."
"My hope is that this time Europe will really be able to play the role that it ought to."
"Mr President, at the end of the Second World War, when the concentration camps were liberated, we said, 'Never again': there would never again be such an example of man's inhumanity to man."
"We in this House, and all those at the G8 last week, know that there are millions of children under the age of five dying each year for want of vaccines that we, in what is called the West, have had for the last 30 years."
"This is an even greater insult than what happened in those concentration camps, because we know it is happening."
"It is happening in front of our eyes."
"And what have we done?"
"We have abdicated leadership."
"We have abdicated leadership to rock stars - and thank God for them, because if they were not there to apply pressure, who would do so?"
"This is a devastating lack of leadership in Europe."
"When we talk about communicating Europe, we think we can talk to people about constitutional treaties and all of that."
"It is nonsense."
"As I have said before, people are not talking about constitutional treaties in pubs in Dublin or in restaurants in Germany."
"But look at the people who went to Gleneagles, who took time off work to march to Gleneagles, who went to all of those rock concerts about the Third World."
"Why are we not giving those people leadership?"
"Where are the statesmen and stateswomen of Europe?"
"All we have are politicians - and poor politicians at that."
"No Delors, no Kohl."
"This issue needs leadership, and the G8 let us down."
"They did not give the leadership that this issue deserves, and this House has to insist that sort of standard does not continue."
"We must insist that politicians in the West, within the European Union and within the G8 take real leadership on this issue."
"Nothing else is acceptable and you, Mr President, have a part to play in this."
"You could give us leadership in this House."
"You could influence those who have the ability to change this."
"We have the ability to change this."
"We must not accept these standards."
"The G8 was a grave disappointment to people."
"It showed that we are really lacking in statesmen, in stateswomen and in leaders, and I hope that changes."
"Thank you, Mr Mitchell."
"I appreciate the fact that you place some importance on the President of the European Parliament, but he was not invited to Heiligendamm."
"(PT) The genocide in Darfur, serious crises in Zimbabwe, Somalia, Ethiopia and Nigeria, corruption, pandemics, desertification, the flow of arms and the race for oil and other natural resources; all of these are factors fomenting further conflict in Africa and adding to the number of people desperate enough to risk their lives in order to get into Europe or to a place where they can find better conditions."
"It is therefore depressing to see the G8 limiting themselves to repeating the Gleneagles promises that have not been kept."
"At the halfway mark, as Mrs Kinnock's report correctly says, the Millennium Goals have yet to be given due priority by European governments and the Commission."
"In Africa, in particular, the Millennium Goals must enhance any security and development strategy, and in turn the joint cooperation strategy to be adopted at the EU-Africa summit to be held in December must not be just another photo opportunity."
"Following the summit the European and African authorities must make phased commitments to meeting the Millennium Goals and must propose strategies that are above governments and that go beyond a blinkered, unseemly bout of one-upmanship with China."
"Making commitments to strengthening democratic and civil society institutions in African countries includes investing in those that are fighting for human rights, for women's rights and for civil liberties in Africa."
"It also involves the EU and its African partners being tough with one another when it comes to compliance with already binding agreements such as Cotonou."
"Without justice and the rule of law, there will be no good governance and, still less, sustainable development."
"Mr President, I should like to make two points concerning the midway point for the Millennium Development Goals."
"First, it is quite obvious that the eradication of poverty in the world is one of the most important challenges of the 21st century for the whole of mankind."
"For me, as a medical doctor, it is perfectly clear that poverty and diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis go hand in hand, creating a 'tsunami' that wipes out millions of lives a year."
"It is unfortunate that this awful tragedy has now become a bland, everyday statistic."
"The eradication of poverty presupposes the elimination of those diseases and the strengthening of the health system in Africa through the provision of at least the projected USD 60 billion over the coming years by the G8 countries."
"Today's world has a chance to consign those diseases to the history books, and we have to succeed."
"I also welcome the G8 decision to cancel 100% of the outstanding obligations of the highly indebted poor countries to the IMF, the World Bank and the African Development Bank."
"The MDGs can be achieved only in peaceful conditions, which means that many local military conflicts in Africa must be ended, especially the lengthy crisis in Darfur that has disregarded elementary human rights."
"Secondly, I should like to point out that the new Member States, which just recently were recipients of official development assistance and which, for several years, have seen a rapid growth in their GDP, should increase their contributions, not only meet their fixed goals."
"Naturally, I support the Kinnock report."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to three issues."
"Unfortunately, the level of aid provided by a Union of fifteen Member States, calculated as a percentage of GDP and earmarked for the millennium goals, is decreasing."
"The majority of countries still have not achieved even the intermediate goal of 0.33%."
"In the meantime, funding for basic education needs amounts to only 23% and funding for healthcare stands at 36%."
"Only 18 out of the 60 countries in need have had their foreign debt cancelled."
"These decisions are important, not only because they reduce the often unbearable financial burden borne by these countries, but also because, as the World Bank stated, countries whose debts have been reduced have doubled their spending on fighting poverty."
"Thirdly, the most effective means of helping poor countries is to ensure they have access to the markets of the world's most developed countries, as well as fostering the development of small enterprises and micro-companies in poor countries."
"Finally, it is also important to support the development of local governments, NGOs and to establish a central management system for aid from the European Union's budget, as this is the only way of improving effectiveness and limiting red tape and corruption."
"(DA) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Kinnock for a brilliant report on the mid-term review of the Millennium Development Goals."
"I am particularly pleased that we are demanding a reappraisal of trade, development and agricultural aid."
"Our disgraceful practice of giving with one hand and taking away - indeed, often taking away more - with the other must cease."
"At the same time, the report refers to a whole range of extremely relevant areas of aid."
"That being said, it was only with difficulty that we got it through the Committee on Development."
"Many amendments by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats were voted down by only small margins, and if they had been adopted we should have ended up with a much watered-down report."
"Otherwise, the report contains nothing other than what, a long time ago, the Member States, solemnly and with much attention on them, promised the poor, together with severe criticism of the fact that the promises were not fulfilled."
"The report clearly points out that the practice of using debt remission as a smart way of fulfilling one's obligations is reprehensible."
"Debt is rightly often written down or often completely written off in the donor countries, and as a result the countries that obtain money by way of aid in this way are the rich donor countries."
"We cannot in all decency allow that to happen, and the whole of Parliament should unite in rejecting this kind of trickery."
"We should persist in the criticism and self-criticism."
"Our credibility is damaged, as promises should be kept."
"The Millennium Development Goals, as well as the goals set out in last week's pompous G8 speeches on the problems of Africa, are important, and the fact that the Council has not even taken the trouble to be in this House today does of course say something about how serious an attitude it has towards its promises."
"The fact is that it is difficult to see how we are to take the Council seriously when it does not take itself seriously."
"Attention should not, however, be directed only towards how the Member States can escape what is demanded of them or get away as lightly as possible from fulfilling the requirements."
"What we should all agree on is how we are to achieve our goal of halving poverty before 2015."
"If, moreover, we are to retain our credibility with developing countries, we must also keep a close eye on whether we are in actual fact doing what we promise."
"We should make efforts to find ways in which such monitoring can take place."
"None of us should in future be able to get away unnoticed with ignoring our obligations."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the G8 has been a resounding failure in the fight against poverty and global warming."
"The tired rituals of a summit that, although legitimate, is now anti-historical, given the resistance to the inclusion of new emerging countries such as Brazil, South Africa, China and India, are reflected in the lack of substance of its final declarations."
"In 2005, in Scotland, the rich countries solemnly undertook to increase public development aid to 50 billion dollars per year by 2010, half of which was supposed to be given to Africa, so as to ensure that the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations for 2015 would be achieved."
"Two years on, as shown by the Africa Progress Panel chaired by Kofi Annan, actual appropriations represent only 10% of what was promised."
"As though nothing were the matter, in Rostock the G8 countries issued a new commitment to grant funding of 60 billion dollars to combat AIDS, all in very vague and deliberately misleading terms."
"No deadline was set and half of the amount is in fact recycled from commitments already made by the US Administration up to 2013."
"The increase of 3 billion per year over the commitments already made by the other governments, including the European ones, is completely insufficient to tackle the humanitarian emergency of AIDS and other pandemics."
"On global warming a failure to make a decision was welcomed as a success."
"The result of three days of meetings, at a cost of 120 million euros, was to send back to the UN a possible agreement on restricting the quantities of carbon dioxide to be emitted into the atmosphere."
"It will not be possible to achieve any promise without calling into question the dominant economic and social models."
"(SV) Mr President, it is gratifying that the European Parliament's legal service has established that it is wrong to use the non-ratified EU Constitution as a reference in this report."
"The June List, which I represent, has consistently emphasised that it is reprehensible to refer to the EU Constitution, given that the populations in two of the EU Member States have clearly and unambiguously rejected it in referendums."
"If it is to be possible for the Constitution to be used as a legal basis or reference, it needs to be ratified unanimously."
"I would appeal to this House to respect this state of affairs in future."
"The world's rich countries have a moral duty to spread a part of their prosperity to developing countries."
"I wholeheartedly support, then, the urgent objectives laid down in the Millennium Development Goals."
"The June List believes, however, that aid issues should be dealt with exclusively by the individual Member State in cooperation with organisations that have broad international legitimacy and long experience."
"The EU's role in this connection should principally be that of phasing out the destructive fishing agreements that the EU concludes with poor developing countries and that of drastically reforming protectionist agricultural and trade policy."
"This makes it difficult for farmers in poor developing countries to sell their products on the European market."
"(SV) Mr President, we talk a lot in this House about how much we pay in aid at present and about how much we should pay in the future."
"We always maintain that insufficient money is provided by way of aid and that the Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved."
"It will not be possible to achieve them if the developing countries do not receive such aid as enables them to develop their economies and thus help themselves."
"Those here in Parliament who know me are aware that I represent Sweden but that I came to Sweden almost 14 years ago as a refugee from Bosnia."
"I know therefore that when people are in a weak position and need help, they want aid of a kind that will enable them, within a short period, to help themselves and, as quickly as possible, become independent and autonomous and no longer need help."
"What they definitely do not want are people who feel sorry for them and the kind of aid that leads to their becoming dependent on help in the future too."
"It is also in the light of this that we must look at the criticism that I make of the report and in which I want to see still more emphasis on trade and its positive significance for development."
"Another matter not sufficiently emphasised by the report is liberalisation."
"The view that aid should increase without the developing countries being required, for example, to reduce their debts means that aid is given without any demands being made in terms either of liberalisation or debt restructuring."
"Without liberalisation, debts increase still more, however, and then we arrive at the situation I described at the beginning of my speech in which aid leads to dependence on aid - a state of affairs that should never come about."
"Many thanks, Mrs Ibrisagic."
"From your name, one would not imagine you spoke such excellent Swedish: that sets a great example."
"(NL) Mr President, I should like to warmly congratulate Mrs Kinnock on a critical, but as I see it, particularly pertinent report."
"I should like to thank the Commissioner for his observations further to the G8 Summit held at Heiligendamm."
"In fact, I can tell you, Commissioner, that I largely share your scepticism about the outcome."
"In 2005 everyone was agreed that the Millennium Goals could be met provided the commitment and funds were there."
"Less than two years later, this idea is apparently being met with far less enthusiasm, as the Heads of Government of the G8 are not going any further than reiterating the pledges of 2005."
"As some of our fellow MEPs have pointed out, the G8 countries have not managed to draft a desperately needed schedule that would help deliver on the promises."
"There is no concrete funding plan in place that would make countries responsible for their commitments and any shortcomings, and it is already evident that the G8 countries will not manage to shift up the necessary gears to double the aid by 2010."
"In the fight against HIV/AIDS alone, there is a huge lack of funding."
"In 2007 the shortfall stands at no less than 9 billion."
"The promises that were made at the Summit in Gleneagles, namely to ensure universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care by 2010 have not been kept, not by a long way."
"Only one in six AIDS patients receives medication."
"Every twelve seconds, somebody dies of AIDS and 70% of new HIV infections occur in Sub-Saharan Africa."
"This is simply unacceptable."
"Commissioner, USD 50 billion for HIV, AIDS, TBC and malaria is simply not enough in order to get the G8 to deliver on a promise in the area of public health on time."
"I should like to make one last point."
"Meeting the MDGs is not simply a question of money, but also of rights."
"Without access, for example, to sexual and reproductive health care for everyone, poverty cannot possibly be fought."
"I hope, Commissioner, that Europe will continue to fulfil its pioneering role in this respect."
"(ES) Mr President, in 2005, in Gleneagles, the G8 leaders sent out an exciting message with their promise to assign 42 000 million in health aid to Africa, focussing in particular on AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis."
"In 2007 we have a new promise of EUR 44 000 million."
"Is this commitment really new?"
"We do not know."
"Or is it just a new way to disguise their failure to deliver, as all of the large NGOs that follow these calculations closely claim?"
"There is no concrete timetable and it is not clear how this new promise ties in with previous promises."
"We must tell the citizens that our governments are not acting in a manner that is consistent with the things they say."
"The very leaders who see people fleeing terrified to their countries from Africa, prepared to risk their lives only to die in the Mediterranean, express their great sadness at those dramatic pictures, but do not then live up to their promises when it comes to turning them into political decisions."
"There must be a commitment to more aid - particularly for health and education, undoubtedly."
"That commitment must also be taken to the negotiating table, however."
"In its communiqu√©, the G8 describes the success of the Doha Round as being vital to the economic growth of the African continent. Vital, says the G8."
"Well, when we talk about Africa, it would be hypocritical for us to separate the things we say about humanitarian and aid issues from our behaviour at the Doha Round negotiating table, and I am not just talking about the European Union, I am talking about the whole of the first world, that first world that has come together within the G8."
"We cannot separate free trade, the reality of commercial exchanges, the reality of what Doha may mean for those countries, from the things we say about humanitarian and aid issues."
"At the negotiating table, our promises must be turned into rather more than what is being offered in cash."
"Finally, aid must be rational."
"We must welcome the G8's support for the Infrastructures Consortium for Africa, the ICA."
"This is a concrete measure that I would like to highlight in particular."
"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock on her very fine report."
"It is difficult to speak on this issue in one minute, but I shall try."
"The difficulty, in my opinion, is not only the amount of money, or the lack of money, donated to Africa by the EU or the Western world."
"The problem is also the administration and coordination of this aid."
"We are all aware of the constraints posed by weak governance in African countries."
"Aid works in many cases, but aid donated without good governance will never make poverty history."
"One idea that could be looked at is the need for individual European states, or groups of Member States, to take on a coordinating role in the administration of aid in individual African countries."
"This would be a fundamental step towards making the donor countries accountable for the aid they spend."
"Equally, it would demonstrate the best practice in terms of implementing the Millennium Development Goals."
"I say this on the basis of my experience as a Minister in the Irish Government in dealing with poor communities in Dublin and in other European cities, whereby one government agency was responsible for coordinating everything we gave to those communities, and it was very successful."
"I believe the same thing could be done at European or world level with regard to Africa."
"I do not have enough time to speak on this, but the other big question is trade."
"Without trade, there is no way that Africa can pull itself out of poverty."
"That is another issue that must be addressed."
"In any case, I believe that we need far greater coordination of the way in which we implement and spend our money in Africa."
"If there is proper coordination we could make improvements in this area."
"As we all know, it is not a simple task and there are no easy solutions, but we need to make changes to the way we deliver aid to the poorest people in Africa."
"(NL) Mr President, whilst it is a good thing that attention has been drawn to progress in some regions here today, the situation in black Africa is still tragic, as previous speakers, including Mr Van den Berg, have pointed out."
"A distinction should be drawn geographically, but also one based on gender."
"President Bush is now convinced that more should be done to fight AIDS, as it affects women as well as men."
"I cannot get away from the impression that this is an important condition before money can be put on the table."
"Only women die from maternal mortality by the very definition of the term."
"There is no sign of improvement in the area of sexual and reproductive rights."
"It seems that to many, a woman's life is not as valuable."
"In Sub-Sahara, 1 in 16 women dies as a result of pregnancy, for example in child birth or due to an unsafe abortion."
"Sri Lanka demonstrates that investments actually save women's lives."
"Mr Szym√°nski, water and medicines alone are just not enough."
"Women must be able to decide for themselves whether they want to become pregnant."
"Difficult decisions about abortion, for example, should be taken on an individual basis rather than form part of a broad and general statement that is made from the comfort of our own chairs."
"Commissioner, you are right that the EU is an important money lender and also fulfils an important role in this."
"EU countries have not delivered on their Cairo promises either, though."
"What mechanism do you intend to put into motion for this?"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kinnock, for her report which, if it had been adopted in time, would have sent a clear message to the Heads of State gathered at the G8 and the entire international community about how vital it is to take decisive action to achieve a reversal of our course."
"This is the request of millions of people who are still dying of hunger, thirst and disease, or because of wars."
"Although it would not be enough, it would certainly mean a lot if the G8 countries and the international community kept faith with the commitments they have made."
"If no action is taken, however, on the structural causes of poverty and underdevelopment, people will continue to die."
"Commissioner Michel is right about the need for concerted and consistent strategies on several fronts, such as the quantity and quality of public development aid, debt cancellation and the revision of the rules of international trade and also, certainly, the assumption of responsibility, transparency and sound government by developing countries."
"I should like to highlight a few points: with regard to the quality of aid, it is particularly necessary to put an end to the highly damaging practice of aid linked to economic and geopolitical interests, as well as the inconsistency between the European Union's development, trade and agricultural policies."
"It is also necessary to review the EPAs and to seek alternative paths that are compatible with achieving the MDGs, overcoming the stalemate in the Doha round negotiations."
"The three Millennium Development Goals on health issues will never be achieved if there is no universal access to therapies and medicines."
"Too often international legislation on intellectual property rights infringes the priority of the rights to health and life of millions of people, to the benefit of the profits of the multinational pharmaceutical groups."
"The disappointing agreements achieved at the G8 also highlight the contradictions of the world's large powers, which spend on development 5% of what they spend on weapons of death and destruction."
"(EL) Mr President, I in turn should like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock on her own initiative report on such an important issue."
"It is interesting for the European Parliament, midway towards the deadline set for achieving the Millennium Development Goals, to see how far we are from achieving them and, by extension, to revise some of the means for achieving them."
"It is a pity that numerous countries in the poorest area of the world, in Sub-Saharan Africa, are a long way from achieving the Millennium Development Goals."
"Clearly the Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved unless the poorer, developing countries receive increased, improved aid to complement their own domestic resources."
"The United Nations, the African Union, the G8 and the European Union must follow current estimates about the need to increase aid to Africa by approximately EUR 3.7 billion a year."
"In addition, as the biggest donor of humanitarian aid, the European Union must persist with efforts to have the debts of developing countries wiped out."
"Nonetheless, I must admit that what concerns me most is the inability to achieve the target in education."
"One hundred and twenty-one million children, 65 million of whom are girls, have never been to school."
"In addition to Goal 2 on free compulsory primary education for everyone, the conclusions of the 1990 World Summit for Children included a goal for the year 2000 of universal access to education, with at least 80% of children completing basic education."
"Unfortunately, we are a long way from that goal."
"The developing countries must realise that, if they fail to invest in the quality of their human resources, they are condemned to the same development situation ad infinitum."
"Mr President, I want to talk about the G8 Summit and make two points."
"The first is on climate change."
"This was good news, because the US agreed to stay within the UN process, but bad news that no binding targets were agreed and worse news, in a way, that we made no progress on getting the emerging economies, like India, Brazil and China, within the process."
"Commissioner, we have a lot of work to do in the run-up to Bali."
"I know you are not the lead Commissioner for climate change, but as the Commissioner for Development, you have a key role to play in keeping the momentum on climate change going because, as you know, the poor in the developing world are already paying the price of climate change."
"Therefore, I hope you will be putting that at the top of your agenda."
"While the poor pay the price, if we look at the other key aspect of the G8, foreign aid, we see that the rich pay lip service."
"Looking at the figures, we see that the G8 is way off track on aid to the developing world and, amongst those, EU countries are some of the worst performers."
"Commissioner, my theory is that we will be back here in two or three years' time, lamenting yet again the failure to make progress on foreign aid."
"The pledge to double aid was made at an EU summit."
"Are you keeping a scoreboard on this, or do we have to rely on NGOs to give us the score?"
"In fact, we should be looking at scoreboards on climate change and on aid, because what Mr Mitchell said earlier about credibility and the EU is correct."
"People out there will judge us on how we perform on the issues they really care about: tackling climate change and poverty."
"The Constitution issue is important to us, but not to the public."
"Therefore, unless we deliver on those issues, we will not have much credibility with the outside world."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner Michel, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by thanking Mrs Kinnock for her report."
"Because of time constraints, I shall discuss just one point at this juncture, which - regrettably - is given hardly a mention in this report."
"In my opinion, the vital importance of decent work as a means of eliminating poverty is a tremendously significant factor in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"Where are we up to now with regard to these goals?"
"As I see it, the results of the mid-term review of this are disastrous."
"Most of the Millennium Development Goals have not even begun to be achieved and, according to realistic estimates, will not have been achieved even by 2015."
"This is an indictment of the donor countries."
"Newspaper reports of the supposed successes of the G8 Summit do not change this fact."
"Mr President, as usual, Mrs Kinnock has produced a good report, but producing a good report, as we all do in this Parliament, is not enough."
"I am very concerned that in paragraph 40 and, in particular, paragraph 41 of her report, Mrs Kinnock mentions the Maputo Plan."
"The Maputo Plan, as I understand it, promotes abortion and goes far beyond the Cairo Declaration."
"The United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child states that the child, by reason of his physical or mental immaturity, needs specific safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth."
"According to the UN, some 8.5 million people around the world die every year because of starvation."
"This is in contrast to the 46 million children who are aborted each year according to the WHO."
"That is about the same as or more than the population of Spain."
"That means that from the moment you are conceived, you are five times more likely to die through abortion than starvation."
"Contrast the 46 million abortions with the total of 56 million people who die in the world each year."
"Forty-six million abortions is also in contrast to the 70 000 women who sadly make the choice to have an illegal abortion and die because of it."
"Therefore, the ratio is that for every one woman who falls pregnant and then dies because of an illegal abortion, 650 viable children are aborted in the womb - what should be, as nature intended, the safest place in the world for a baby to grow."
"I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against paragraphs 40 and 41 which have nothing to do with maternal mortality, which is supposed to be the theme of MDG 5."
"Nor have these paragraphs anything to do with either sexual or reproductive rights because abortion has no connection to sexuality: it is not healthy, it is obviously not about reproduction - quite the opposite - and in my view, it is certainly not a right."
"(SV) Mr President, I was quite touched by what the previous speaker said."
"I therefore find it rather difficult to talk, but I shall try to stick to what I intended to say."
"When I was at school, I learned that people in Africa were starving because they had cut down the trees in the places where they lived so that nothing could grow there any longer."
"In a way they had, then, more or less brought the situation on themselves."
"Now, there is more and more to indicate that it is in actual fact we in the rich world who, through our life-style and our substantial emissions of carbon dioxide and other climate-affecting gases, have caused climate change in sub-Saharan Africa, as a result of which the inhabitants of that region are unable to provide themselves with enough food and water."
"This undeniably makes us see world poverty in a different perspective."
"Our responsibility for eradicating poverty is that much greater if it is we ourselves who have caused it."
"Mrs Kinnock has a special section on climate change in her report, emphasising our responsibility for ensuring that our carbon dioxide emissions do not affect the poorest people on earth."
"If we are to manage to do this, we need both drastically to reduce our emissions of climate-affecting gases and to support developing countries so that they might cope successfully with the huge adjustment that the world has to make."
"What is at issue is everything from dealing with, for example, raised water levels to ensuring that developing countries that are able to produce renewable energy have the opportunity to do so and thus also have the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty."
"If the world is to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, we must concentrate more on these considerations and give higher priority to them."
"Nor, if we seriously want to reduce mortality due, for example, to HIV, AIDS and unsafe pregnancies, should we allow religious notions to stand in the way of people's freedom of choice and their ability to protect themselves against life-threatening diseases and unwanted pregnancies."
"Reproductive rights, information concerning legal abortion and access to contraception are, and remain, necessary features of our work designed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"All other considerations are merely prejudices, and I am amazed to hear them expressed in this House."
"We should be more enlightened than that."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, today's debate makes us take a clear look at just how far we have still to go by 2015 in order to achieve the Millennium Goals."
"It should be pointed out in this House that these goals are vital in the context of development cooperation and that they must encourage aid that is effective and coherent."
"As the due date approaches, the slender results obtained, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, force us to be more demanding and to redouble our efforts in order to keep our promises."
"Faced with what is at stake, the European Union must play its political role fully in order to strengthen the means for development and the effectiveness of its action on the African continent."
"2015 is almost upon us."
"This, therefore, is not the time to run out of steam or to throw in the towel."
"As the leading global supplier of official development aid, the European Union has the means to help the countries of the South to achieve stability and to benefit from economic, social and human development."
"If we have the means, therefore, let us now think about the tools for effectiveness, so that the aid given is matched by tangible and lasting results."
"This requirement means mobilising all those involved."
"It is not a matter of charity towards these countries, but of aid for development."
"The promises made concerning the realisation of these fundamental goals are numerous."
"One can, therefore, note the commitments made during the very disappointing G8 summit, which decided to allocate EUR 44 billion in aid for the fight against the pandemics in Africa and which reaffirmed the commitment of 2005."
"Let us only hope and pray that these promises become more than mere words."
"For that to happen, these initiatives must now be translated into practical and measurable action."
"It is urgent that we take action."
"Let us intensify our efforts in a spirit of partnership so that we do not miss the 2015 deadline."
"Mr President, a minute is very little to address what is a huge subject."
"I have been a little bit distressed by some of the mood of this debate and I wonder whether, if we asked African women what they want, they would have had some of the answers that have come up here today."
"The women I spoke to in Malawi certainly spoke about the need for education, for food, for jobs and for hope, and I thought that is what the Millennium Development Goals would give them, but it is clear that we are not going to get there in time."
"In the 30 seconds I have left I want to address, in particular, the trade aspect of all of this: paragraphs 83 and 89 are particularly interesting."
"There is a suggestion that the WTO negotiations might be an answer to some of the problems of Africa and yet paragraph 89 states very clearly that the LDCs will benefit very little from extensive trade liberalisation, and I think Africans need to remove barriers to trade within their own continent and look very closely at that issue while we in Europe help them develop trade with the rest of the world."
"But we wish we could do more and I hope that this debate will help in that."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I need hardly tell you that it is always frustrating to have to respond within a very short time to an avalanche of comments, most of which have been very apt."
"I certainly agree very broadly with the comments, assessments and ideas I have heard."
"Let me begin with the G8."
"I must confess that I, too, have been extremely disappointed to see the G8 summits become more and more of an essentially ritualistic exercise, and I regret the fact that, the more ritualistic this exercise becomes, the less credible it is, and one day people will start asking whether it actually serves any useful purpose."
"I heard someone - from the left of the Chamber, I think - ask about the representative nature or legitimacy of the G8."
"I believe that question needs to be asked."
"There can be no denying that huge swathes of the real world in geopolitical and demographic terms remain unrepresented, and that is rather a pity."
"The G8 is becoming more and more of a beauty contest, and it is, of course, extremely sad to see the very concept being discredited by the participants' failure to honour the promises they repeat year after year."
"It is always possible to see some grounds for satisfaction in this type of meeting, but they are not enough to convince us that it is a very useful and wholehearted exercise."
"I must needs adopt an impressionistic approach in my responses to some of the more trenchant comments that have been made."
"First of all, on the question of HIV/AIDS, let me say that the two main channels for the provision of financial assistance by the European Community for the fight against HIV/AIDS are support given to countries to improve their health-care provision, particularly in Africa, and the allocation of funds under thematic budget headings."
"You can rest assured that we shall deploy all the resources at our disposal."
"The health programmes being conducted in 21 African countries account for EUR 396 million, with an additional amount of EUR 62 million earmarked for the coming months."
"I will not conceal the fact that it is through these thematic budget lines and the funds assigned to the ACP under the eighth and ninth EDFs that the Community is contributing to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, in which we have been holding the office of Vice-Chair of the Board."
"Following the creation of the Fund in 2002, the European Community paid a total of EUR 522.5 million into it for the period from 2002 to 2006."
"Added to the contributions from the Member States, this makes the European Union the largest donor to the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria."
"A word on climate change in answer to one honourable Member: I fully share your concern about the threat posed by climate change to developing countries and to their efforts to achieve the Millennium Goals."
"I believe that issues relating to climate change should be incorporated into development cooperation."
"Back in 2003 we adopted an EU action plan on climate change and development, which we are implementing jointly with the Member States."
"Progress in the implementation of this action plan is currently under review, and the findings indicate that, while it has been a good platform for joint action on the part of the European Union, the way in which the plan is being carried out is not really commensurate with the size and importance of the challenge."
"I therefore intend to launch a strategy for the intensification of our cooperation with the developing countries most severely affected by climate change."
"The aim is to work towards the establishment of a global alliance on climate change to underpin the dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and developing countries on the reduction of emissions and on adaptation to changes in the climate."
"I also intend to share details of this proposal with you fairly soon."
"That is one specific."
"As far as the economic partnership agreements are concerned, I will not dwell on these for too long."
"Suffice it to say that I am one of those who are convinced that no real development can take place - in the sense of creating the sort of wealth that can fund social services, that can fund all the main access channels to public services - in the absence of access to trade and of economic dynamism."
"Consequently, the economic partnership agreements as we envisage them, as we perceive them and as we are implementing them are, strictly speaking, development policy agreements."
"The priority is not the trade dimension but development."
"The differences of opinion that may exist between some people and myself on this matter will be common knowledge."
"I believe that their existence can be taken as read."
"The decision to conclude the economic partnership agreements before the end of 2007 was taken jointly by the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"The debate and the controversy to which this decision gave rise have been very worthwhile, particularly because they have led to acceptance of longer transitional periods, recognition of the specific nature of certain sensitive products and also acceptance of the principle of financing regional funds designed to offset losses of earnings that result from the elimination of tariff barriers."
"This is a question to which we shall return, but it is undoubtedly due to the debate that was launched here in this House, particularly by Mrs Kinnock and others, that the Commission, its partners and the other interested parties have come up with far more flexible proposals that take more account of reality."
"I am convinced that debt relief helps to fund development."
"There is nothing unusual about that position."
"It is quite simply based on our common reference framework in the field of development policy, on the European Consensus that the European Parliament and the Commission approved scarcely a year and a half ago."
"The European Consensus refers to the OECD definition of public development aid and includes debt relief."
"The European Union has also undertaken to find lasting solutions to the problem of unsustainable debt burdens."
"That said, Mrs Kinnock, you are undoubtedly correct."
"Everyone hopes there will be more debt relief, none more than I. You are also correct in saying that it is actually no more than one shot and that, if governments want to honour their pledges, they must increase the value in real and absolute terms of the amounts they devote to their development aid policies over the next few years."
"That, incidentally, is the message the Commission conveyed to the Member States in its communication in April."
"As for amending the OECD rules, which has been mooted recently, I do not consider that necessary."
"I may add that, in my view, there is a risk that challenging these rules would trigger a discussion on the eligibility of other financial contributions which, as far as I am concerned, have nothing to do with development policies."
"I do not intend to say any more on the matter."
"Everyone knows full well what I am thinking of."
"On the important question of social and human development, I must say - and I say this all the more readily because Mr Deva, who raised this point, is a man whom I hold in very high regard - that I do not share your point of view."
"The Commission supports policies and initiatives that enable men and women to make free and informed choices about the number of children they have and the intervals between their births and that give them access to high-quality family planning and reproductive health services and to skilled assistance during labour."
"I am afraid that I do not share your position, which appears far too radical to me and does not seem to take sufficient account of the concept of individual liberty."
"There is a philosophical divergence here which we have to acknowledge."
"People differ, Mr Deva. We are not necessarily all the same, and I believe that the authority argument and the submission argument cut both ways."
"While I can understand your saying that it is wrong to submit to abortion in practice or in principle, I do not believe we can submit to a religious precept either."
"That, at least, is my point of view."
"I would like to refer to another element that seems important to me, namely the effectiveness of aid."
"In my view, aid - whether international, European or other aid - will become far more effective when we become a little less obsessed - and I am not trying to impute blame - with the need to wave our own flag."
"Once we focus properly on the aim of alleviating misery and helping the poorest inhabitants of our planet rather than worrying about who is doing what and how each of us can raise the profile of our activities, that, I believe, is when we shall become far more efficient."
"That is what we are working for, and we are moving forward with a code of conduct in an attempt to induce the Member States to accept more coordination, more convergence and a more rational division of labour, because these things can only enhance our efficiency."
"I must say to you in all honesty, however - because I hear you very clearly, and I know that almost everyone shares this point of view and that, moreover, when we listen to the statements made by governments, ministers, prime ministers, this message is one of the threads that runs through all of them - that these aims are far from having been achieved in practice."
"We have carried out joint analyses in connection with the preparation of country strategy papers, and we have proposed joint programming."
"I can tell you today that, for the operational programming of the tenth European Development Fund, I would put the number of Member States that have decided to take part in joint programming at about ten, and even they will not take part in all the programming arrangements."
"I can cite very few cases of joint programming."
"That, however, is clearly the objective."
"The objective is not to know who is doing what but to know who does what best."
"As I have already had occasion to say, the Commission has no wish to pull all the strings."
"The Commission is prepared to delegate responsibilities and to part-fund those who take responsibility, in other words the countries piloting particular areas of activity or projects, provided there is more to be gained by delegation than could be gained from our acting alone."
"That is the direction in which we must try to move."
"I remain optimistic, because I believe that, as we progress, we shall furnish proof that efficiency comes with greater coordination, convergence and harmonisation; these are the keys to efficiency."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote on Glenys Kinnock's report will take place tomorrow."
"ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Thierry Cornillet, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2006."
"Mr President, I shall present you with a few figures on the activity of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly in 2006."
"It met twice, in Vienna and Bridgetown, as is the norm for the Assembly."
"Just to slip in a word about Bridgetown, it so happens that Bridgetown is in Barbados and that Barbados is regarded as a tourist destination, like the entire Caribbean."
"Needless to say, the press pounced on this engagement, proclaiming that the Members of the European Parliament were off on a jaunt to the Caribbean."
"It is difficult enough to make a joint assembly work without travelling to its member countries."
"Now it just happens that among the countries of the Caribbean and the Pacific, and even among the countries of Africa, are some in which tourism is a major economic activity."
"Is that a reason not to go there?"
"Avoiding those countries would be discourteous and would paint a distorted picture of the activity of ACP countries."
"Another statistic is that nine resolutions were adopted."
"I will not enumerate them all but simply point out that some highlighted future problems, such as tourism and development, bird flu and energy problems in ACP countries."
"My next statistic is that there were seven joint delegations, one of which - the mission to Malta and Tenerife - raised awareness of migration problems."
"I would like to emphasise some aspects of the year's activities."
"I must mention the arrival on the scene, and indeed the increased involvement in the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, of non-governmental players."
"That is an entirely welcome development, even if the involvement of these players often takes the form of parallel events."
"Be that as it may, their participation is undoubtedly a useful complement to the work of our Assembly."
"I have had the honour of being the Vice-President responsible for these matters. My term of office lasts until the next meeting of the Bureau, and I believe it is important that this post is filled."
"Another point concerns the economic partnership agreements."
"I noted Commissioner Michel's passionate support for these agreements."
"Here too, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has played a leading role by monitoring the negotiations and by creating a two-way information flow, through which European Members of Parliament can obtain fuller knowledge of the lie of the land in the ACP countries and our ACP partners can see through the fantasies concocted by some deranged individuals, who misrepresent the economic-partnership agreements as some sort of Trojan horse of Liberalism, and I thank Commissioner Michel for reminding us that they are instruments of development policy and that their terms have not been set in stone, contrary to the rumours circulating in the corridors of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"Lastly, we have held hearings with the chief negotiators and the competent Commissioners on this matter, which has enabled us to deepen our knowledge of the economic-partnership agreements."
"With regard to Darfur, I will not revisit the substance of this issue, which, I am sorry to say, is still far from having been exhausted."
"I simply wish to highlight an aberration, namely the use of separate voting colleges."
"At the first session, we had a common resolution on Darfur adopted in Vienna, whereas in Bridgetown a separate vote was requested; this blocked the resolution, because our ACP counterparts did not adopt it."
"They effectively yielded to pressure from a number of countries."
"In the report, I suggest that this practice be abandoned, so that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can function as a genuine joint assembly in which the democratic principle alone prevails."
"As for the parliamentary dimension - to which I shall return in my conclusion, Commissioner - let me simply remind you of the commitment you made on the transmission of the strategy papers to the ACP countries, of course, and to the European Parliament."
"I think it is important that our ACP counterparts should be involved."
"Finally, as regards the rise of the Pan-African Parliament, I believe it is very important that we should have a partnership with that Parliament and a parallel partnership with the African Union."
"I believe that a delegation went there and that we have undertaken to host a visit by its President."
"Another point relates to the strengthening of sub-regions within the ACP area."
"There are four regions in Africa plus the Caribbean and the Pacific regions, and it would be beneficial to strengthen the sub-regions, since only a regional approach will allow the economic-partnership agreements to be properly implemented in the interests of everyone."
"Lastly, let me conclude with the parliamentary dimension."
"It is absolutely essential that we, by which I mean the Members of the European Parliament but more especially our parliamentary counterparts in the ACP countries, explore the potential of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly as a source of information."
"Such a function would entail an upgrading of the secretarial capabilities of the ACP side."
"This would involve introductory training and a higher level of interest among our parliamentary counterparts in the European Development Fund and its implementation but also in the formulation of integrated national and regional plans, in the country strategy papers and in the economic partnership agreements."
"We welcome the allocation of some of the EDF funds to the training of Members of Parliament with a view to ensuring that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has recourse to people who have the structures, engage in the deliberations and possess the information with which they can make the Assembly a really useful body."
"Member of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is becoming an increasingly sturdy pillar of cooperation between the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries."
"I have attended all the sessions of the Assembly since I became the Commissioner responsible for development and humanitarian aid."
"I know exactly how far that institution has come."
"The Assembly is now increasingly parliamentary in stature and conduct, with debates that are more open and fewer regional tensions."
"The Assembly has proved capable of addressing a wide range of topics and of reaching agreement on sensitive issues such as post-conflict rehabilitation, sustainable resource management and the economic partnership agreements."
"The excellent report by Mr Cornillet and the Committee on Development presents a faithful portrayal of this development."
"You highlight the advances that have been made but without ignoring the problems that still have to be resolved."
"The report also identifies the challenges looming on the horizon."
"I thank you for your appreciation, expressed in point 2, of the Commission's desire to subject the strategy papers to parliamentary scrutiny."
"You naturally express regret that this has not been possible, but you are no doubt aware that, following the adoption of our position on this matter, the Member States managed to reach agreement on the insertion of a new provision into the implementing regulation for the tenth cycle of the European Development Fund."
"That provision prescribes the transmission, for information purposes, of the ACP country strategy papers to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly at the same time as they are sent to the Member States represented on the EDF Committee."
"I welcome this solution, which certainly takes account of the specific nature of the EDF, because the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is an institution which is explicitly recognised by the Cotonou Agreement and which is therefore best placed to monitor the proper functioning of the programming process under the tenth EDF, given that the latter is not part of the Community budget."
"This also provides an opportunity for the Assembly to demonstrate its ability to play a genuine political role in our cooperation."
"Lastly, let me take this opportunity to add my congratulations to the Government and Parliament of Barbados and to the Austrian Presidency for their excellent organisation of last year's Assembly sessions."
"I shall be seeing some of you again next week at Wiesbaden, in Germany, for the next session of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mr Cornillet on his report on the activities of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly pertaining to 2006."
"It was once again a fruitful year."
"Important topics were discussed, including the problems with energy, tourism, water in the ACP countries, the promotion of peace and security, problems surrounding fisheries in the different countries and the EPAs, of course, the new trade agreements."
"The format of this parliamentary delegation remains special and unique."
"The fact that 77 MEPs and 77 ACP parliamentarians - one parliamentarian from each ACP country - meet a few times a year to discuss development policy is important."
"Not forgetting the preparations, which are a combined effort between European and ACP countries."
"These meetings are also extremely important for our parliamentary work, because we are not only talking about them, but also with them regarding the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement and development policy in general."
"This should, of course, have been done from the start in the Europe-Africa strategy, but this strategy was conceived too unilaterally from a European viewpoint."
"Fortunately, we will now have a joint strategy from both the European and African Union for the development of Africa."
"This is a priority, rightly so."
"The poverty levels in Africa are the highest and the most worrying."
"It is good to see the Joint Parliamentary Assembly continuing to develop further and the dialogue between the ACP countries and the European Union gathering momentum. It is also good to see that it appears increasingly possible to broach sensitive issues, such as corruption or worrying situations, including those in the Horn of Africa and Sudan."
"Zimbabwe remains a thorny issue."
"As the situation in that country is unacceptable, we have to do everything in our power to protect the position of the citizens over there and to stop the human rights violations."
"Next week, we will be meeting once again, in Wiesbaden, Germany."
"I am looking forward to this meeting and I hope we will have another good dialogue where difficult issues can once again be raised."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I really enjoyed hearing the Commissioner say that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly was now a robust organisation."
"It certainly is."
"I would like to thank him for his loyal participation in each of the JPAs so far."
"I would also like to note that the President of Parliament will attend the session next week in Wiesbaden, as did his predecessor, President Borrell, who is now a member of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"This involvement is very important and gives status and importance to the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which, as others have said, including Mr Cornillet in his excellent report and presentation, continues to grow and to thrive."
"That is because it is nurtured by so many committed and active parliamentarians, from the ACP and from this Parliament."
"We enjoy very active collaboration in the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and, again as Mr Cornillet says, the parliamentary nature of our work has noticeably increased."
"We have a wide-ranging agenda and, whatever lists we may wish to make, all our work relates to the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, which is a binding, contractual agreement between Europe and the ACP member states."
"The nature of the partnership between all those countries is absolutely unique."
"What makes it so is the obligation within the Cotonou Partnership Treaty to have this parliamentary dimension."
"That is something we should be very proud of."
"Another important point is that we have worked very hard to improve the ability of parliamentarians from ACP countries to scrutinise the actions of the executive and the governments in their countries."
"They also have to hold their governments to account, because that is what parliamentarians are meant to do."
"But, quite frankly, in most of the ACP countries where we have talked and worked with parliamentarians, they are seldom brought into the ambit of the work undertaken by their governments."
"The Commission has been somewhat guilty in this respect as well, because in consultations, such as on the country strategy papers, they have had written into the agreements the need for negotiations and consultations with civil society."
"I have no problem with that; that is very good."
"On the other hand, parliamentarians are the elected representatives and I would like to see much more engagement by them in programming, in implementation, in monitoring and in evaluation."
"We also need to urge European national parliaments to scrutinise the European Development Fund."
"They can help us in that way."
"I think that the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly has changed over the 13 years I have been a member, and for the better."
"It used to be the case that it was completely dominated by European parliamentarians."
"I think all of us here can fairly say that is no longer the case."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mr Cornillet has written an excellent summary of the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA) in 2006, a JPA that is growing in credibility and power, which no longer avoids difficult debates, including migration, and which also dares make choices, even though the ambition remains to reach consensus as a rule."
"A typical example of this - which also represents one of the best moments for me - was the debate and the resolution on the status of the negotiations on EPAs."
"A resolution that has fundamentally served as a basis for Mr Sturdy's report which we approved here in this House."
"A report that was thus partly supported by our colleagues from the ACP parliaments."
"I would also like to make two observations that are less positive."
"Firstly, as Mr Cornillet already mentioned, an even-handed resolution on East Africa was rejected in Bridgetown, because it was preceded by separate voting, despite the fact that a huge majority in the Assembly were in favour."
"This is at odds with the spirit of solidarity and cohesion within the JPA."
"It begs the question whether it is time that the Rules of Procedure were reviewed so that blocking minorities on both sides can be done away with."
"Secondly - and we have to be honest about this - there is still pressure from the ACP Secretariat on the voting behaviour of ACP members of parliament."
"That too is unacceptable, just like the influence which ambassadors are systematically trying to exercise."
"What is promising is that the ACP countries have decided to organise a study in order to assess the activities of the Secretariat, but something will need to come of this assessment, of course."
"To sum up then, my conclusion is that 2006 was a good year for our JPA."
"Let us hope that we can take another step towards strengthening its parliamentary and political character."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (FR) Mr President, I also wanted to welcome the report on behalf of my group, the Greens and EFA."
"I believe, however, that any analysis of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly must be primarily political."
"In this respect, can we be satisfied with the state of the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries after years of a development policy in which the Union has been the largest provider of funds?"
"That is the question."
"And what progress has been made on the road to democracy?"
"In the course of our regular visits to these countries, we have been forced to conclude that human misery is growing there and that democracy is still very much in its infancy."
"Even if our work in the Joint Assembly is proceeding well, as Mr Cornillet assures us, it must not be the tree that hides the rest of the wood, for we have the means to go further, further in mutual respect of our European interests and, of course, in meeting the expectations of the ACP countries."
"There is hope - as illustrated, for example, by the process of transition to democracy that has begun in Mauritania."
"What the Union still needs to do - and I am addressing the Commission here - is to honour its commitments by helping the Mauritanians to make a successful transition and to re-establish decent living conditions."
"Support from the Joint Parliamentary Assembly for the Mauritanian National Assembly could be one step in that direction."
"Come what may, Commissioner, I would like to focus on the fight against poverty."
"We have discussed this at length."
"It has to be said that combating poverty involves the resolution of environmental issues, to which insufficient consideration is given in our work - and I am addressing Mr Cornillet here."
"I would also like to mention the report on sustainable development that was produced as part of our work on the action plans which are now being implemented by the ACP countries."
"What do we do to stop desertification, which is driving hundreds of African to flee into squalid shanty towns or to set out, even at the risk of their lives, for an imagined European El Dorado?"
"That is the question, and the world is waiting for an answer."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, representatives of the Member States and officials of the Commission, we are in agreement with the general thrust of the Cornillet report, which is characterised by common sense, goodwill and noble intentions, although most of these, I fear, are pious hopes."
"Let us nevertheless emphasise one point, namely the excessively sharp contrast between the importance and even the gravitas being attached today to the question of our relations with the countries of Africa and the indifference shown by the European oligarchies, particularly in this Parliament, towards the countries of the South."
"Yes, dear colleagues, we are sinning by indifference."
"There is no comparison between the significance, which is sometimes minimal, of the matters that take up nine tenths and more of our debates and votes and the seriousness of the growing imbalance between the continents of Europe and Africa."
"I say 'Africa', by the way, because I do not believe there is a need to spread the ACP effort too thinly; the brunt of it should be devoted to the original focal point of the Lom√© Conventions, which was and must remain sub-Saharan Africa."
"The issue is undoubtedly too authentically political, too crudely political, to be dealt with by supranational institutions, which are, by nature, too weak to deal with anything but technical matters."
"Accordingly, it is perfectly normal for us to turn to the Member States and to call, as the Cornillet report does exceedingly well, for greater involvement of the national parliaments, for by seeking to address the major problems on a European scale we would end up not dealing with them at all and at the same time releasing the Member States from their obligations."
"Yes, Mr Cornillet, the solution, here as elsewhere, is to trust the Member States and the truly democratic institutions, namely the national parliaments."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although this comes as no surprise, it is nevertheless to be welcomed that the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly recognises in its report that the immigration issue will be dominating future relations between the EU and the developing world, and Africa in particular."
"The activities and recommendations of this institution in question - because that is, after all, what this report is about to some extent - call for a few critical observations, though."
"Whilst fact-finding missions in Malta, Spain and Senegal may be useful, they brought few new insights this time round, unfortunately."
"What can we learn from a report about the effects of migration of educated employees in terms of national development?"
"The migration of educated employees leads to a brain drain in the countries of origin and is in any case detrimental to these countries."
"This is, after all, the great paradox, of course: those in favour of more migration to Europe in order to fill vacancies in so-called bottleneck professions all too often overlook the fact that this migration leads to the impoverishment of the countries of origin, with the effect that the weakest are at risk of being left behind alone."
"We should have the courage to say this out loud."
"In the final analysis, though, the Joint Assembly's vision and its response to migration are, of course, predictable."
"As a link between the European institutions, the Joint Assembly simply repeats policy from official Europe on migration."
"This is anything but effective and firm immigration policy, where clear messages are sent to the countries of origin and conditions imposed to suit the JPA's own needs."
"In terms of human rights, democracy and good governance, this forum is a faithful reflection of official EU policy and utterly fails to send out a powerful signal."
"A signal that demonstrates to the relevant countries that a refusal to respect human rights and apply democratic principles should be reciprocated with a reduction, or even scrapping, of all forms of development aid."
"Mr President, firstly I welcome this report."
"I think it is very timely, coming as it does on the eve of the meeting we are about to attend in Wiesbaden."
"However, - I do not know whether the Commissioner is actually listening to this debate - sometimes I feel we are like gadflies on the periphery, where we raise issues and they do not get much attention except from ourselves when we write very fine reports of this kind."
"But I do think that there is an opportunity for innovation and for change."
"I come from a country where we had famine, literally in recent history - I spoke to somebody who spoke to somebody who lived through the last Great Famine in Ireland: it is that recent."
"One of the things that made a great change in Ireland, as in the United States, was property ownership."
"I would like to commend both Nirj Deva and J√ºrgen Schr√∂der for constantly raising this issue."
"I think it is an issue we need to raise."
"We need to try to bring new ideas such as this one to the fore."
"If you look at the history of Ireland and how the partition of Ireland came about, in the north of Ireland a lot of people who came there were given small plots of land and ownership of that."
"From that, they grew flax and they gained capital and prospered."
"In the south of Ireland we had absentee landlords, and tenants who could not afford to pay their way and who had no ownership of their property."
"The same thing happened in the United States, a country that had huge difficulties in the beginning."
"People were given ownership of property there, and that made a great change."
"Particularly in Africa and in the Third World generally, we have to start looking at ways we can give people ownership of capital."
"I believe that, whereas I welcome and support the general thrust of this report, we need to start looking at new ways and added value that we - Parliament, the Commission and the Council - can bring to the issue of the Third World."
"I think in the area of giving ownership of property, there is an issue worth pursuing."
"(FR) Mr President, I must thank my honourable colleague Thierry Cornillet for his excellent report."
"He expresses clearly and forcefully the power of work that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly accomplished in 2006."
"Through the quality of its output, I believe the Assembly has established itself as a pivotal player in the dialogue on North-South cooperation."
"The Assembly has made its mark by expressing itself forcefully on Darfur in Vienna, by scorning taboos to apportion blame and by proposing a road map designed to end the crisis."
"It also made its mark by expressing its views on the crucial question of the economic-partnership agreements in Bridgetown."
"Its message, moreover, was a unanimous declaration that these agreements must remain instruments of development, as Commissioner Michel reaffirmed a short while ago during the previous debate."
"The political clout of the Joint Assembly will continue to increase over the coming months now that the Commission has undertaken to grant it the right to examine all country and regional strategy papers for the African, Caribbean and Pacific areas and now that the Assembly can convene regional conferences in order to come up with specific responses on major issues such as migration."
"In view of these new powers - even if they are not really powers - we must take care to ensure that the Assembly has the means to perform its tasks."
"I wish to say to the Commission and the Commissioner that we shall have to act together to find flexible and effective ways to work jointly on the procedure for the exercise of this new right to examine strategy papers."
"It is cumbersome, it is difficult, but we must rise to the challenge."
"I also appeal to the working group on parliamentary reform to take account of the specific characteristics of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly and the constraints affecting it, because, when the parliamentary calendar is compiled these days, some of our commitments clash with the work of the Assembly."
"Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock for the manner in which she has been co-chairing the Assembly."
"Mr President, I welcome this report from my colleague Mr Cornillet."
"It provides a concise and comprehensive summary of the work of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly last year."
"The annual report is a good moment to take stock and consider what is working well in the JPA and what could work better."
"We are answerable to our electors about whether non-legislative bodies, such as the JPA, are good value for money."
"I would suggest three positive indicators that the JPA is robust, as was said earlier, and that it is earning its keep and increasing in relevance."
"As the rapporteur said, the involvement of non-state players is a positive development, and so is the growth of fringe meetings."
"These bring together Members sharing common concerns, for example ACP delegates representing remote and arid areas and MEPs working on climate change."
"It is in these informal discussions that MEPs and ACP parliamentarians can often work together best."
"Secondly, I believe there is a desire on all sides to make the JPA more responsive, more capable of reacting to current events."
"The rapporteur refers to this in paragraph 17."
"Of course, there needs to be a structure to debate, but the formal structure of discussions and reports is very drawn out."
"We need to find ways of making the JPA more immediately engaged and reactive."
"That brings me to my third point: the level of participation by members of both houses has sometimes been disappointing."
"Naturally, the first duty of parliamentarians on both sides is to their own legislatures, so, inevitably, there are diary clashes."
"I am, therefore, really pleased that the European Parliament is looking at changing its timetable and earmarking some weeks - the new 'turquoise weeks' - for external meetings."
"I hope this will get rid of conflicts of duty on the European side and greatly improve active attendance by the 78 MEPs."
"This is something we should continue to monitor as the changes to the European Parliament timetable are implemented."
"Mr President, one of the issues that will be addressed at the forthcoming ACP-EU Council meeting in Germany next week will be a re-evaluation EU policy on Sudan."
"There is an ever-deteriorating security situation in Darfur, and let no one think otherwise."
"Without a safe and secure environment, we cannot access the people most in need."
"A full-scale humanitarian crisis is being faced by over four million people who are living in Darfur at this time."
"More than half a million people were displaced from Sudan in 2006 alone."
"The international community has simply not been tough enough when dealing with the Sudanese Government over Darfur."
"The Sudanese Government has played a game of cat-and-mouse with the international community so that the European Union and the United Nations would have as weak a role as possible in Sudan."
"I welcome recent moves to increase the presence of African Union forces in Sudan under what is known as the African Union Mission there, but the difficulty for these troops is that they are not well trained and there are not enough of them."
"Moreover, the European Union must look to tighten the sanctions regime against the Sudanese Government to incorporate a ban on travel into the European Union by key Sudanese Government members and officials and to block Sudanese Government representatives from making financial investments in Europe."
"Mr President, the JPA deals with more than Africa, but it is Africa that dominates so much of our attention."
"Two weeks ago, Archbishop Desmond Tutu was in Parliament talking specifically about Darfur and more generally about Africa."
"He said thank you for not succumbing to donor fatigue and Afro-pessimism and thank you for not allowing governments to turn a blind eye."
"But he shared our concerns about the Zimbabwe regime, which has destroyed a once-vibrant economy, oppressed its people and polluted the relationship between Africa and the European Union."
"The Southern African Development Community (SADC) has finally recognised that there is a problem in Zimbabwe and has mandated President Mbeki of South Africa to facilitate talks between the Mugabe regime and the Zimbabwean opposition."
"There has already been some progress."
"The first meeting took place between Zanu PF and the MDC last weekend in South Africa, but an enormous amount remains to be done."
"Let us remember that just a few days ago, two MDC activists from Matobo district were abducted and murdered."
"Just as SADC is beginning to understand that Mugabe's regime is a problem, so the ACP is also stirring."
"In March, the ACP-EU Bureau called on the Zimbabwean Government to re-establish respect for human rights and the rule of law in accordance with the Cotonou Agreement."
"Next week Zimbabwe is on the agenda of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"There is an urgent need for both colleges in the ACP-EU to speak as one on the appalling aberration that is Zimbabwe."
"After the JPA, the African Union Summit will be held in Ghana."
"We must do all that we can to encourage the African nations to go to this summit determined to support the Mbeki initiation and to do all that is possible to bring about rapid political change for the better in Zimbabwe for the sake of all the people of that country and, indeed, all the people of Africa."
"(PL) Mr President, in the field of development policy we often talk about taking local conditions into account."
"One of the regular ways of finding out what those representing our partners in the developing world want is the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."
"The report summarising the work of the assembly last year is a very interesting and important document."
"I would like to thank Mr Cornillet for his work."
"The assembly dealt with a range of issues that are important to developing countries, including energy, water, bird flu, the role of regional integration in fostering peace and security, the social and environmental aspects of fishing, the co-dependence of tourism and development, as well as progress in negotiations on economic partnership agreements."
"I would like to draw your attention to a certain problem."
"I think, that there is no real sense in maintaining a superficial dialogue with representatives of countries that regularly infringe human rights."
"It is a pure myth that participation or the opportunity to observe the work of the assembly will have a positive effect on their policies."
"For some, their presence at this forum simply serves as propaganda rather than dialogue."
"Propaganda cannot provide us with real solutions."
"This is something I experienced myself during the Communist period in Poland."
"Back then, the intention was to replace policies with propaganda."
"Countries which behave in this way are wasting our time, money and potential."
"They are also damaging the image of the ACP countries."
"They have very short-term goals, namely to prevent any criticism of their own internal situation."
"They do not want anyone to help them as they believe that their actions are correct and appropriate."
"If we want the assembly to be a real, joint centre for establishing political positions, the attitudes of countries such as Cuba, Zimbabwe or Sudan have to change."
"(FI) Mr President, as a member of the ACP-EU delegation, I attended both Joint Parliamentary Assemblies in 2006."
"The Assembly is of crucial importance to the establishment of political dialogue as referred to in Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement."
"The meetings in Vienna and Bridgetown were mainly successful and there was a lively debate at both."
"I am particularly pleased with the way their parliamentary nature was emphasised."
"At the meeting in Barbados I was one of those who drafted the resolution adopted on water in developing economies."
"The procedure whereby a parliamentary representative of the EU and one of the ACP together draw up a resolution for the Parliamentary Assembly is a fruitful one."
"The drafting procedure adds legitimacy to the decision-making process."
"I would like to stress the importance of following up important resolutions, in which the role of the standing committees is central."
"Enough time needs to be set aside for this for dialogue to deepen."
"It is of crucial importance to third countries how fundamentally society is rooted in good governance, the rule of law and democratic structures."
"They also lie at the heart of the expectations which the ACP countries have regarding development."
"I am therefore wholeheartedly in favour of the request made by the Parliamentary Assembly that a share of the appropriations in the European Development Fund should be spent on concrete projects which support administrative reform."
"The educational programmes organised for members of parliament is one example."
"Another problem is the few resources which many members of ACP parliaments have: there are few opportunities to respond to the ambitions of strong governments."
"The report fails to mention one essential issue: it is vital to respond to the intolerable situation in Zimbabwe."
"The country's human rights situation is one of the grimmest in Africa and Mugabe's Government is plunging the country into ever deeper despair."
"It will no doubt also try to block discussion of the state of the country at next week's ACP-EU Assembly in Wiesbaden."
"This should definitely be prevented: there needs to be a proper debate."
"Mr President, let me first say that I obviously cannot respond to all the comments which have been made, but the Commission shares the view that national parliaments must play a key role in the definition of national policies and development strategies in our partner countries."
"I say that in answer to Mrs Kinnock."
"I agree with her there, needless to say."
"The only thing is that we must find a way to achieve that objective."
"I doubt whether I would be within my rights to ask the national parliaments of our partner countries to respond to the country strategy papers."
"The principle of not intruding on the territory of another institution remains intact, and I am not very sure how this process can be organised."
"I was relying heavily on the Joint Parliamentary Assembly to be the interface with the national parliaments, but I can assure you that I am quite willing to examine any proposed solution to see how that aspect can be improved."
"I also wish to inform you that the Troika has opened the door to progress in the preparation of the joint EU-Africa strategy."
"That is an exercise, of course, with which the European Parliament has been closely associated."
"On the basis of the agreement reached by the Troika, the Commission will adopt a communication on 27 June on the objectives of the strategy and on the road map for its adoption at the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon, scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year."
"My departments are in permanent contact with Parliament, both on the content of these documents and on the organisational aspect."
"I attach great importance to the participation of the three main EU institutions in the formulation of these strategies."
"In this context, I must emphasise that one of the innovative aspects of this strategy would be the establishment of a genuine partnership of peoples."
"I would therefore like to involve the parliaments - the European Parliament, the Pan-African Parliament and the African national parliaments - in the implementation of this strategy on a permanent basis."
"I am open to all your suggestions."
"It is conceivable, for example, that there might be a joint hearing of the European Parliament and the Pan-African Parliament or a joint meeting of the European Commission and the Commission of the African Union."
"Logistical and political support could conceivably be given to the Pan-African Parliament - in fact, provision has already been made for that - and assistance to the national parliaments in Africa would be feasible too."
"There are, incidentally, parliaments of EU Member States which are already doing this."
"We have only just started."
"We can therefore work together to meet this major challenge."
"Let me respond to a couple of remarks chosen at random."
"Mr Van Orden, you referred to the case of Zimbabwe in connection with the EU-Africa summit."
"While I share, at least in fairly broad terms, the judgments you passed on President Mugabe, the important thing for me today is that the European Union and Africa should be able to hold this summit."
"I must remind you that there has not been a summit of this kind since Cairo, while an Africa-China summit has taken place in the meantime."
"So what matters to me is that our summit should take place."
"Someone also spoke of sanctions against Sudan."
"I have to tell you that I would not have any problem with sanctions if someone could demonstrate to me that they are useful and do not penalise ordinary people."
"Generally speaking, I am fairly sceptical about sanctions."
"I am a far greater believer in the carrot than the stick, and I put far more faith in the exertion of pressure."
"Besides, with President al-Bashir having accepted the hybrid peacekeeping force, particularly in Darfur, I am not convinced that this is the time to be raising the spectre of new sanctions."
"Sanctions, we know, can be applied at any time, and I am not sure that the sanctions some people have in mind would necessarily be useful."
"Mr Mitchell spoke of access to property ownership."
"This idea has been extensively developed by Mr De Soto, and I have been following this matter very closely."
"I am also a member of an informal working party in which, together with Madeleine Albright, we have been working on this idea of property ownership, with which you are no doubt familiar. I find the idea very appealing, and I am trying to see how we could contribute to such a scheme through the European Development Fund."
"Experiments are taking place, and I believe this is a very interesting and important approach in the quest for an effective solution."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid (debate)"
"The next items are:"
"the oral question by Marcin Libicki and Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to the Council on the fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid - B6-0127/2007), and"
"the oral question by Marcin Libicki and Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, to the Commission on the fact-finding mission to the regions of Andalusia, Valencia and Madrid - B6-0128/2007), and"
"Like all of my honourable colleagues, I believe that I cannot but deplore the absence of the Council, which will not be in attendance to answer Members' questions."
"author. - (PL) Mr President, I would like to check something."
"As far as I understand, I have two and a half minutes to speak because it seems that Mr Cashman is also going to speak on this matter."
"Am I right in believing that I have two and a half minutes of speaking time?"
"I wanted to check because you did not mention this earlier."
"Mr President, from the point of view of tourists and northern Europeans wishing to relocate, the Mediterranean coast is the most attractive destination."
"The coast of Spain has been particularly exposed to extremely intensive urbanisation."
"This extreme urbanisation has resulted in a number of conflicts."
"There seem to be three parties involved in this conflict, namely the developers, the authorities and the residents."
"What is more, and this should be highlighted, the conflict involves both Spaniards and citizens of other Member States who want to settle in these regions, or who have already moved there."
"As a result of the enormous number of petitions on this matter that were sent to the Committee on Petitions, we organised a special fact finding visit and, as early as December 2005, the European Parliament adopted a resolution, based on these petitions, on the infringement of directives on public procurement, water supplies, and the infringement of property rights."
"Another fact finding visit took place this year and on 11 April 2007 the Committee on Petitions drew up their position on the matter, with reference to the previous resolution passed by the European Parliament."
"In this context, I would like to address a question to both the Commission and the Council."
"What activities have been undertaken by the Commission and the Council to ensure that Community legislation is applied correctly and that the citizens' basic property rights are respected, as laid down in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union?"
"author. - Mr President, it saddens me to have to take the floor once again on this issue."
"More than 18 months after the adoption of the Fourtou Report in December 2005 by an overwhelming majority of this House, we are still debating the same issues, and nothing has changed."
"The Council is absent - that is shameful!"
"Citizens from many Member States, including my own, but also Spain, Germany, Holland and Belgium, are having their legally acquired lands taken by local authorities without due process, which I am convinced is in breach of EU law."
"Moreover, they are being forced to pay large sums of money - tens of thousands of euros - to pay for new infrastructure and new developments that they do not want and which are on their land."
"The situation I am describing sounds unimaginable in the 21st century EU but it is a sad reality for thousands of citizens in Spain."
"People have bought land or property in good faith only to see it taken away by what can only be described as, at best, administrative incompetence or, at worst, criminal negligence and corruption."
"This issue was brought to the attention of the Committee on Petitions in 2003."
"Back then, 15 000 citizens wrote to us asking for help."
"What have we done?"
"Well, we have adopted the Fourtou report, which brought forward a series of recommendations to the Valencian Government."
"The Valencian Government brought forward minor changes in the LUV, which do not address the key problems of land grab."
"It is worth mentioning that large numbers of projects in Valencia were rushed through prior to the entry into force of the new law."
"This is a clear sign that constructors and developers wanted to continue to exploit the loopholes of the previous law."
"We have now sent three fact-finding missions."
"The last came under shameful attacks from the Partido Popular, which were attacks upon the integrity of this House."
"It saddens me to say that the President of this House, Mr P√∂ttering, remains indifferent to the attacks upon the integrity of this House."
"The Partido Popular politicians say that the petitions in Valencia have been imagined."
"The pain is real, the pain is desperate, and that is why people have looked to us."
"The Commission is unhappy."
"It believes that possible infringements of EU law are under way."
"Therefore, I say this: to do nothing is not an option, we have exhausted what we can do in this House and this will be resolved in the Court of Justice or before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and it will be to the shame of the Partido Popular in Spain."
"Mr President, let me start by thanking Mr Libicki and Mr Cashman for their hard work in preparing the report on behalf of the Committee on Petitions on the third fact-finding mission to Valencia."
"This mission gave committee members an opportunity to meet the representatives of the administrations and the complainants and to gain first-hand experience of the situation on the ground."
"The urbanisation projects in Spanish regions at stake involve three main aspects: public procurement, fundamental rights and environmental rules."
"Let me give you a few indications of our actions in these areas."
"Firstly, on public procurement: the Commission takes the view that approval of integrated action programmes under the Valencia Land Planning Law involves the award of public works and services contracts."
"We consider that some activities were carried out in a way which infringes EU public procurement legislation."
"I informed Parliament about this in December 2005."
"We thus decided to launch infringement proceedings again Spain on this issue."
"The Commission challenged the existing law on land and town planning at the time."
"On 30 December 2005, the regional authorities approved a new land law which revoked and replaced the previous one."
"However, the new law does not correct some of these infringements, which relate to tender notices or the information required by tender notices and the unclear definition of the contract's object."
"It contains other provisions that are also incompatible with the directive on public works, supply and services contracts."
"We pursued the legal procedure during 2006."
"The replies we received from the competent authorities were not convincing."
"I therefore intend to propose that the Commission should refer this case to the Court of Justice."
"Secondly, with regard to fundamental rights, the Commission cannot intervene in this area."
"In our view, the alleged infringements of property rights do not involve any provision of Community law which would enable the Commission to intervene on these grounds."
"Thirdly, on environmental legislation: here too the Commission can only take legal steps when Community law is infringed."
"However, as far as the environment is concerned, land development policy as such does not fall within the competence of the Union."
"The departments under the responsibility of my colleague Mr Dimas do, however, investigate land development cases where these are alleged to infringe Community environmental law."
"I can assure you that the Commission will continue to see to it that the competent Spanish authorities comply with EU environmental rules when implementing urban development plans."
"The Commission has already taken action in other cases when they fell within its remit, i.e. when urban development projects breached environmental directives, for instance those on water or on environmental impact assessment."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (ES) Mr President, this matter has been discussed actively and passively, and I am not going to get into the fundamental issue, because it has been discussed on many occasions in the Committee on Petitions."
"I would, however, like to talk about an issue that I believe to be important, and that is that, by bringing this resolution to plenary, we are facing a problem of competences, because I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we are impinging on national competences."
"You want to replace the decisions of the regional parliaments, you want to replace the decisions of national parliaments, you want to replace the Constitutional Court, you want to replace the Spanish jurisdictional body."
"In other words, this resolution is an invasion of competences on an unprecedented scale."
"I therefore believe that Parliament's Legal Service should tell us whether we can vote on absolutely everything when national and regional competences are being trampled upon, as they are in this case."
"The truth is that the Commission's response has reassured me."
"It is reassuring to my political group to hear that it has not been possible, and it is not possible, to intervene, because, naturally, the Valencian Parliament and Government have always acted in accordance with the law, in accordance with the jurisdictional approach that that government has always defended."
"I simply wished to end with a question that we have also been hearing within the Committee on Petitions: We were told that the citizens would remember, that, when it came to voting, the citizens would express themselves and that they would make the Valencian Government or the Madrid Government pay for what was happening."
"Well, the citizens have spoken and they have shown clear support for a programme, for a well-known project, for what has been done in the Community of Valencia, for what has been done in the Community of Madrid, and they have given majorities, not relative majorities, but absolute majorities, to the governments of the People's Party, both in Madrid and in Valencia."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I do not believe that the fundamental objective of the Committee on Petitions' excellent work is to bring down any particular regional government in Spain, however regrettable its actions may have been."
"What the Committee on Petitions has done is to act according to a politically unquestionable principle."
"When it comes to defending the rights of citizens, national sovereignty and national borders do not matter."
"The point is that, in certain Spanish autonomous communities, not in the whole of the country, certain regional autonomous governments are damaging the environment, damaging the sustainability of the citizens' lives and hence violating individual and collective rights."
"This is happening in Valencia and it is happening in Madrid, which is my autonomous community."
"The President of the Community of Madrid has not just done it in the past, but she intends to continue doing so: just today, her projects were moving in that direction."
"We are not talking about houses, but, for example, she is determined to press ahead with a road project - previously the M-50, which she now calls the M-61 - which intends to destroy no less than the Monte de el Pardo, an area of crucial ecological importance."
"I would like to congratulate the Committee on Petitions and say that it has accepted the demands of the petitioners and citizens - and this resolution also does so - and furthermore I would like to express my support for this serious work and say that the insults to the integrity of this House and the members of that delegation were as unacceptable as some of the content that it is intended to maintained here."
"Doing what is right is more important than anything else."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, Mr Iturgaiz, winning elections does not give anybody the right to show disdain for European legislation."
"A mere vote by the majority of councillors of a municipality cannot lead to the public interest being used to justify a great misappropriation."
"A political majority cannot be used as an excuse to cancel out local democracy through the creation of parallel local councils whose protagonists are the insatiable town-planners and the omnipotent construction companies."
"The mere fact that a town-planning project is approved does not give anybody the right to jeopardise the conservation of water resources and valuable land of several generations by covering everything in an avalanche of concrete."
"What has been lacking is greater transparency and a minimum degree of respect for small-holders and public participation in all processes."
"Yes, the Valencian, Andalusian and Madrid building scandal is a European scandal that demands a European response."
"We demand that the Commission act vigorously and urgently in the face of flagrant violations of the Directive on public procurement, the framework Directive on water and the 'Habitats' Directive on the part of the Valencian authorities and other regional governments."
"Many of the 750 000 homes built in Spain last year, more than in France and Germany put together, have failed to respect Community Law."
"Why can the Commission not act straight away?"
"Mr President, clearly the issues that are being addressed in relation to Spain are not confined to Spain, and I offer that as some consolation to our Spanish colleagues on the PPE-DE side of the House."
"Similar problems, not in relation to property ownership but certainly in relation to impact on the environment, on heritage and, indeed, on people's quality of life are occurring as a result of major infrastructural developments in Ireland, and it seems to be an issue that we at European level have not been able to get to grips with because the European legislation is not stringent enough or, indeed, the Commission is not in a position to act fast enough in terms of addressing complaints when they are made."
"When I visited Madrid, for instance, I was made aware of the situation there, in which the regional authority redesignated a ring round around Madrid as a city street, decided to develop it as a motorway, broke it up into about a dozen different pieces and argued that it therefore did not need to have an environmental impact assessment applied to it."
"Now, the Commission eventually decided that this was wrong, but three quarters of the motorway had already been built by the time that decision was made."
"(ES) Mr President, this Parliament's missions to the region of Valencia have resulted from the reported cases of town-planning abuse, which have been reflected in the media and which have been of concern to many citizens."
"It is not the visits by MEPs that are scaring away potential home buyers."
"In fact, these missions help to enable the tens of thousands of European citizens who wish to live in our territory to do so in the confidence that they are investing in a place that has clear rules and that is respectful of the environment."
"Future customers are increasingly demanding and these two elements represent a competitive advantage that we cannot allow to be destroyed through uncontrolled town-planning."
"Over recent years, complaints about this kind of abuse have increased from citizens who believe that they have been victims of actions that have affected their properties or which have seriously spoiled the environment in which they live."
"In spite of this, I would also like to point out that I do not believe that they are generalised or that they happen every day."
"The promises made by the regional authorities prior to these missions have not been fulfilled, however, and they have not resolved the problems, reformed the laws, assisted the people affected or applied the recommendations approved by this Parliament in 2005."
"There were elections in the region of Valencia on 27 May and it is true that this is a good time to begin a new stage and, above all, to put right, and, to start with, to acknowledge, this problem, something that the regional government has not yet done."
"Also to accept the fact that it has not been capable of resolving it so far."
"It is also time to stop being arrogant and stop showing distain for the MEPs who visited the region."
"I would like to say, finally, that my party, the Socialist Party, is once again willing, as it has been on several occasions, to contribute to resolving this problem; in the case of the region of Valencia, therefore, it would say once again that a broad social and political agreement is needed which includes all of the parties affected and which involves the reform of Valencian town-planning law in order to bring it into line with the Treaties and in order to increase the legal security of all of the parties, and which also includes the establishment of assistance and dispute-settlement mechanisms for citizens who feel that they are affected by town-planning abuses."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, many petitions on this issue show that buying real estate can be a real challenge."
"The cases mentioned raise a number of complicated legal issues that relate to property law."
"This is the exclusive competence of the Member States; the Commission cannot interfere with this."
"Any redress in this respect must be brought before national authorities and we cannot create false expectations on the part of the petitioners."
"However, where cases raise questions of European law, the Commission takes its role as guardian of the Treaties seriously, where we establish whether there are infringements of Community law."
"In our view, this is the case regarding public procurement legislation."
"We have already started infringement actions about this."
"We intend to pursue these actions with a view to obtaining full compliance with Community law."
"In accordance with Rule 108(3) of the Rules of Procedure, I have received one motion for a resolution at the end of this debate."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"(The sitting was suspended at 5.35 p.m. and resumed at 6 p.m.)"
"Commission Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0125/2007)."
"The following questions have been submitted to the Commission."
"Part One"
"Subject: Insurance companies in the EU"
"Insurance companies will reportedly conclude insurance policies only in respect of vehicles which are registered in and have number plates issued by the State in which each company is based, despite the fact that EU legislation makes provision for the insurance of vehicles with number plates issued by another Member State."
"In the light of the third directive on direct insurance 92/49/EEC and the fourth directive on motor vehicle insurance 2000/26/EEC, will the Commission propose a review of the directives so that European consumers will be able themselves to choose their insurance companies and the State in which it is in their interests to conclude their motor vehicle insurance?"
"Does the Commission consider that this freedom will also promote competition and thereby appreciably reduce the cost of insurance?"
"Mr President, the principal aims of the EU legislative framework are a high degree of protection of road traffic accident victims, the promotion of free circulation of vehicles and the encouragement of cross-border activities of insurance undertakings."
"The EU legal framework for compulsory motor insurance is a major EU success story."
"Developed since the early 1970s, it has been a fundamental factor in making the free movement of motorists and their vehicles in the Union a reality."
"The motor insurance directives have permitted the abolition of border checks on insurance, so the vehicles can be driven as easily between Member States as between one country."
"They also allow for easy compensation for the thousands of accidents involving vehicles from more than one Member State."
"The motor insurance directives require that insurers have a local presence for claims settlement and oblige them to be members of the local guarantee fund and the local green card bureau."
"This is to protect victims, in particular from having to enter into cross-border negotiations with an insurance company established in another Member State."
"The membership of the local green card bureau ensures a smooth functioning of a system without a need to check the insurance certificates."
"All EU Member States, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Croatia and Andorra participate on the basis of the 'Multilateral Agreement'."
"The link between the country where the vehicle is registered and the insurer's membership of that country's guarantee fund is also an expression of the solidarity of the local motoring population."
"European consumers have the possibility to seek motor insurance cover EU-wide as far as the above specific conditions set for insurers are met."
"Whether insurers are prepared to enter into insurance contracts for cars registered in another country depends largely on the insurers' commercial policy and their willingness to cover risks largely or wholly situated in another country, where the risk structures may be substantially different from what they are familiar with in their home country."
"With this in mind, it is perhaps not surprising that the volume of cross-frontier business in this branch is very limited."
"However, some argue that there is a lack of competition and that a higher volume of cross-frontier business might bring down motor insurance premium levels."
"We are assessing this question as part of our ongoing public consultation on retail financial services."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your reply; however, I should like to insist on my question following this morning's debate and the huge Equitable Life scandal, with millions of victims calling for fair compensation on the grounds of the poor administration of the insurance company."
"Perhaps this example alone is enough to convince the Commission to liberalise the car insurance market and the way in which citizens themselves choose what is in their best interest, in which case they would be wholly and personally responsible for their choices."
"Buying residential property represents a difficult and time-consuming challenge for consumers."
"Legal and fiscal matters are big challenges, even in one's own Member State."
"These challenges are only exacerbated when consumers are purchasing a residential property outside their Member State: procedures often are completely different from the ones in place 'at home'."
"While the Commission is fully aware of these facts, there is no simple answer."
"Taxation and property laws that lie at the origin of the complexity fall largely outside the scope of Community competence."
"Nevertheless, the Commission supports initiatives that promote transparency in European housing and mortgage-lending markets."
"Transparency is particularly important for consumers, especially where rules vary from one country to the next."
"Consumers need full and accurate information to be able to make an informed choice when buying a property in another Member State."
"The request for an information leaflet for consumers purchasing property has also been made within our ongoing review of the European mortgage credit markets, where stakeholders suggested that the Commission create and maintain an online guide to the main legal and other issues relating to cross-border lending."
"I am in favour of such initiatives."
"Buying property across borders is a natural consequence of the freedoms that constitute the essence of the Single Market."
"Where consumers face practical problems or lack of information, we must try to help them, for example by pointing out what problems they may encounter and by pointing them in the direction of the relevant bodies and authorities that can assist them."
"The Commission will look into these issues and see what is feasible."
"But let me be honest: this is not an easy task."
"The Commission does not necessarily have access to all the information that would be required, nor would we necessarily have the means to verify that such information is accurate or up to date."
"Before moving ahead, we must be certain that we can overcome this challenge."
"Working together with third parties may also be an option."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response."
"I suppose in this area, as in all other areas, the clause caveat emptor should always apply first and foremost."
"However, there are complexities, as you rightly said, and I welcome the fact that you have looked at what the European mortgage providers are considering."
"However, there is another aspect - the need to have a second will."
"If you own a property outside your country of residence, it is necessary to have a second will to cover the execution of your estate in that scenario."
"So, even though there are differences across the 27 Member States, and further complexities within them, there are certain core values which could be put up on the Commission website, as you rightly say."
"I would encourage you to work further towards that goal, highlighting at the same time that caveat emptor should always apply first and foremost."
"I certainly agree with the honourable Member."
"As I said, it could be quite a difficult task to undertake this body of work."
"As Mr Crowley mentioned, the underlying principle must always be caveat emptor."
"In all these areas, whether you are buying property or financial products, it is something that everybody must be aware of."
"As I said earlier today, when someone comes along offering you a deal that seems too good to be true, it usually is too good to be true."
"That is something we must bear in mind."
"Mr Crowley mentioned the question of having a second will."
"Only last weekend I read an article in a professional magazine that was advising people who have properties in Spain, for example, that it was essential to make a will there covering that particular property and how to go about it."
"By the way, I do not have a property in Spain as of now, but many Irish people I know do, and are not aware of this requirement."
"This article was in a magazine that would only be read by people working in accountancy."
"What Mr Crowley says is very important."
"Only a very small percentage of Irish people who have homes in that very nice country of Spain would be aware of this information."
"One of the 48 recommendations set out by the expert group was for there to be an information leaflet."
"It will be a bit of a task to determine what we can cover adequately within the leaflet, but we will certainly have an attempt at it."
"The danger is that, since we will not be able to cover everything, we may face the moral hazard of not supplying all the information, but let us see what we can achieve."
"If we are trying to have a single market for all areas, the logical thing then is to provide the information that goes across these particular fronts."
"It would also help improve the image of the European Union if ordinary people were to say that was something very worthwhile had come from the European Union."
"We will make an attempt at it."
"How successful we will be, I do not know."
"(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, I agree that this question is complicated."
"I myself have written a book on how to establish a business in the 15 old European Union countries, including the purchase of real estate, taxes and other considerations."
"You mentioned that there are compendiums of information."
"Could you specify which compendiums of information there are?"
"If they are not complete, they need to be updated so that people circulating freely within the European Union could have all the information they need about these conditions, including the purchase of real estate."
"For fear there has been a mistake they do not exist yet."
"Mr Crowley's question was whether we could consider preparing an information leaflet and this action was also recommended by the Expert Group on Mortgage Credit."
"We are examining this and will attempt to see what we can do in terms of having a proper information leaflet, subject to the various caveats I myself entered about how this would be produced."
"I congratulate the Member for her initiative in tackling this in an obviously professional capacity I imagine it was a considerable amount of work."
"However, as I said in my former reply, we might endeavour to marry the expertise that is available out there among private organisations who might agree to having some type of joint approach, using what is already there rather then starting afresh ourselves."
"So perhaps the honourable Member would be willing to give some of the information she has to my departments and we might exploit her obvious talents in this matter."
"Subject: External Service of the European Union and immigration policy"
"Given the recent extension of the Union's powers in the area of immigration, and the implementation of Commission action in this area, does the Union's External Service have the resources to enable it to help the Member States with the new cooperation modalities which have been put into action in this field, on issues such as the hiring of legal immigrants or the repatriation of immigrants and their integration into their home societies?"
"The external dimension of EU migration policy and Commission action in this area has developed a lot over the last few years due to the needs regarding migration, in particular for the definition but also the implementation of a global approach to migration."
"We think this is important for the future and we are trying to do what we can to come to a global approach."
"In the context of this global approach, we are developing various initiatives relating to all aspects of migration."
"That means including legal migration, but particularly the fight against illegal migration, readmission and readmission agreements, return, reintegration, asylum, migration and development, and migration and integration."
"From the outset, I have personally committed myself to the 3% target in the Neighbourhood Policy Instrument."
"I am already beginning to give definite form to the commitment as regards the countries under my responsibility."
"Together with Mr Frattini and Mr Michel, I have just presented to the Commission for adoption the 2007-2010 thematic strategy for the thematic programme on cooperation with third countries in the areas of migration and asylum."
"The programme provides for an indicative amount of more than EUR 380 million over the period 2007-2013 for cooperation with third countries in the areas of migration and asylum, including on labour migration and reintegration of returnees."
"The Commission delegations play a key role in the implementation of this ambitious agenda, both at political but also at operational level, and Brussels-based Commission departments systematically inform the Commission delegations of, and involve them in, new developments related to migration."
"Political dialogue with third countries is conducted jointly by the delegations and Brussels-based departments."
"At operational level, delegations are also responsible, for instance, for identifying needs and constraints, to ensure that actions financed with Community external assistance are properly implemented."
"In addition, delegations in countries where migration has emerged as an important new topic in the context of Community external assistance are also assisted by the departments in Brussels through training measures, thematic networks at operational level and support missions."
"Through these measures, we in the Commission ensure that the delegations are able to interact with the Member States but also with third countries, and to implement migration-related Community assistance."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, over recent months I have listened to the statements by you and by Commissioners Michel and Frattini, and I have found the commitments that you have made very encouraging."
"My concern is that we in the European Union often express excessive amounts of will, we make statements but then they are not followed up by actions because we lack resources."
"For example, the Frontex system has faced immense difficulties controlling illegal immigration."
"The commitments made by the three Commissioners would require the establishment of a European Union external service of a new kind, not economic or political, but rather of a social and work nature, something similar to the work and social organisations that all of the Member States currently have."
"Does the Commissioner believe that that kind of external service can be established?"
"Do you have sufficient resources?"
"What can Parliament do to help the Commissioner to establish this new role?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Papadimoulis, the Commission is completing its analysis of Greece's revised GDP and GNP figures."
"It has used the same procedure for that analysis as for all of the other Member States."
"The procedure and timetable employed are as follows:"
"On 22 September last year, Greece presented the Commission with the revised figures on its gross domestic product and its gross national product."
"These figures represented a revision upwards of approximately 26%."
"At the end of October last year, therefore, a month after having received that information, Eurostat communicated those figures for an initial analysis by the Member States' GNI-Committee."
"The committee then issued a statement to the effect that it did not have sufficient information on the revised data and the changes in methodology communicated by Greece."
"The committee also pointed to the urgent need for Greece to cooperate fully with Eurostat and to provide a completely revised inventory of its GDP and its GNP, explaining in detail the new sources and methods used by Greece for its national accounts, in order to enable Eurostat to carry out a complete verification of the new data and inform the committee of the results of that verification."
"Greece presented the inventory to Eurostat on 6 February of this year, in the form of a 460-page document in Greek."
"Following the relevant translation, Eurostat is completing the analysis of that documentation and it will send a mission to Greece by the end of this month."
"Like those carried out in other countries, experts from other Member States take part in that mission, in order to ensure the necessary degree of transparency."
"The results of the mission will be analysed with Greece firstly and then any comments made within that context will be taken into account in the final wording of the report assessing the revised figures for Greek GDP and GNP."
"Eurostat will present this report to the committee for an in-depth debate."
"It is hoped that it will be presented no later than October 2007."
"With regard to the second part of your question: according to our spring forecasts, carried out on the basis of the non-revised Greek GDP figures, the public deficit for this year is expected to fall to 2.4%, compared to last year's 2.6 %."
"For 2008, on the assumption that current policies are not changed, the Commission foresees a slight increase in public deficit, from 2.4% to 2.7%."
"All of this is on the basis of the GDP figures prior to the revision."
"With regard to the level of indebtedness, it is calculated that it will continue to fall, from the 104.5% of GDP in 2006 to around 100.7% in 2007 and 97.5% in 2008."
"In view of these figures, on 16 May of this year the Commission recommended to the Council that the excessive deficit procedure, which had been opened up two years earlier, be ended, and on 5 June of this year the Ecofin Council adopted the decision to close the procedure, in accordance with the Commission's proposal."
"Furthermore, on 27 February of this year, on the recommendation of the Commission, the Ecofin Council approved its opinion on Greece's updated stability programme for 2006-2009 and in that opinion Ecofin recommends that Greece take advantage of the favourable economic situation to progress towards the mid-term objective - which is budgetary balance - in order to continue improving the budgetary process, increasing its transparency and defining a budgetary strategy within a longer-term perspective which effectively applies mechanisms intended for the supervision and control of primary spending."
"Furthermore, and in view of the high indebtedness and the expected increase as a result of ageing, it is recommended that the Greek authorities as soon as possible draw up future forecasts for spending linked to ageing and improve the long-term sustainability of the public accounts, providing the resources necessary to achieve the mid-term objective."
"On 20 April, following the meeting of the Eurogroup in Berlin, the Greek Minister for the Economy and Finance formally and publicly announced that the government had decided to bring forward from 2012 to 2010 the time limit for achieving that medium-term budgetary objective."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your detailed reply."
"In a statement after 5 June, you expressed the Commission's concern about the large deficit in the balance of payments of the Greek economy and recommended strict measures in order to achieve a sustainable and constant reduction in the deficit and the debt."
"My question therefore is: have you discussed the measures proposed by the Commission with the Greek Government?"
"Do you have replies and commitments from the Greek Government for the measures that you consider necessary?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the provisions of the euro zone's single monetary policy, Sweden is currently one of the Member States that are subject to an exception."
"At the moment there are 13 Member States subject to that exception and, furthermore, we have the case of the United Kingdom, which has the famous 'opt-out' clause and which is not therefore included amongst the States with exceptions."
"With the exception of Denmark, all of the other Member States with exceptions, that is to say, 12 Member States must adopt the euro as their currency, to which end they must seek to meet the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty."
"Nevertheless, the Treaty does not set explicit time limits for the Member States to comply with that obligation."
"Our last convergence report, which covers the States with exceptions, was published in December 2006, and in it the Commission concluded that Sweden met the price stability criterion, the criterion relating to the public budget situation and the criterion on the convergence of long-term interest rates."
"Nevertheless, according to that same convergence report, Sweden did not meet the exchange rate criterion, which requires the Member State in question to have remained within the normal margins of fluctuation laid down in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) without any serious tensions for at least two years prior to the assessment."
"Furthermore, in last December's convergence report, the Commission pointed out that the Swedish legislation was not fully compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty with regard to the regulation of the Central Bank and its integration into the European system of central banks."
"In view of this assessment, the Commission concluded that there was no need to modify Sweden's status as a Member State with an exception in this area."
"In accordance with the Treaty, the Commission and the European Central Bank will publish the next convergence report in 2008, in principle in May 2008."
"With regard to the final part of your question, which relates, by way of comparison, to the security of energy supply, the provisions of the Treaties in force have already led the European Parliament and the Council to adopt directives relating, on the one hand, to the security of natural gas supply, and, on the other, to safeguarding the security of electricity supply in investment in infrastructures."
"These directives must be transposed into national legislation, and in the case of the latter directive, it must be transposed by 1 December of this year."
"We are not therefore in two completely identical situations from a legal point of view."
"With regard to the obligation to join the euro, the Treaty does not stipulate any maximum time limit, nor the rules for implementation, but leaves it to the convergence assessment that is carried out every two years."
"In the case that you give as an example, however, that of energy security, there are directives that must be applied by the Member States, and in the event of non-compliance the relevant infringement procedures are applied."
"(LT) Commissioner, I am not happy with your answer because in Sweden's accession agreement it is clearly stated that Sweden must implement all agreements in force at that time."
"In other words, on the principle of closer cooperation, no exceptions are possible."
"Now the Swedes have decided, four years after a referendum on the subject, to again vote against the introduction of the euro."
"Does this mean that countries may choose which parts of the accession agreement to honour and which parts not to honour?"
"I have in mind the Lithuanian nuclear electricity generation plant at Ignalina, which is safe and which the Lithuanians do not want to close."
"Should we perhaps just refrain from closing the plant without bothering to consult anyone?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Sweden must apply the Treaties, of course."
"The fact that a referendum has been held does not excuse Sweden from its obligation to apply the Treaties."
"The Commission also has to apply the Treaty, and what it has done, and what it is going to continue to do, is analyse every two years, as the Treaty demands, whether or not the Member State in question in this case Sweden - fulfils the required conditions for entering the euro."
"For the time being it does not do so."
"Sweden has a problem because its currency is not included in the exchange rate mechanism and, therefore, it does not fulfil the exchange rate stability criterion, it does not conform to the criterion on bringing its legislation into line with the rules laid down in the articles of the Treaty that I referred to earlier, and we point that out."
"What all Member States must do is try to prepare for that moment."
"As the honourable Member knows, and as you all know, the results of the referendum held in Sweden in 2003 are not going to remain in force forever."
"We have well-known cases of referendums that delivered a certain position in a particular country, but that position changed over time because the will of its citizens, expressed by means of elections or new referendums, changed."
"I would insist that, from the point of view of the type of legal obligations laid down in the Treaty, the situation is not comparable if we analyse, on the one hand, the need to move towards Economic and Monetary Union and, on the other, the need to comply with the energy security rules that are included amongst our fundamental rules."
"We shall now proceed to supplementary questions."
"I have received more questions than I can accept. Consequently, I can only give two MEPs the opportunity to speak."
"I must comply with the provisions laid down in Rule 109 and Annex II of the Rules of Procedure, which cover the conduct of Questions to the Commission."
"I have chosen Mr Lundgren and Mrs Kauppi."
"(SV) Mr President, notwithstanding the Rules of Procedure, there is good reason for considering how this whole issue of Swedish membership of the currency union has been dealt with."
"When the referendum on Swedish membership of the European Union was organised in 1994, it was made clear that we were not obliged to join the currency union if we voted in favour of EU membership."
"That was an issue about which we had negotiated and on which we could decide later."
"That is the political background to this matter."
"I agree with the Commissioner that Sweden cannot be forced into ERM II as long as we do not fulfil the requirements for participation in it."
"What I would point out, however, is this: is it really imaginable - and this is my question to the Commissioner - that a country that has joined ERM II can ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, I am not sure whether Mr Lundgren has actually asked a question, but in any event he and I agree that there is at least that point that you mentioned in your speech, Mr Lundgren, and there are also the legal incompatibilities which make it impossible at the moment to say that Sweden fulfils the criteria for joining the euro."
"I would say once again that at no point does the Treaty lay down maximum or minimum time limits."
"It lays down a general obligation to prepare, to seek to fulfil the conditions, but it does not stipulate a specific timetable."
"The Treaty must therefore be interpreted with the same flexibility that was employed when it was drawn up, not according to criteria that are different to those laid down in the Treaty."
"In any event, I would say that we need to apply common sense, as we so often have to do in politics."
"If the Swedish citizens said no four years ago, we will have to ask them when they decide to change their minds, should they decide to do so."
"I do not believe that any country can be obliged to join a currency against its will."
"I would like to ask three direct questions."
"The first is a purely technical issue: is the Accession Treaty clause for the Swedish Accession Treaty completely identical to those of the 12 Member States which joined after 2004?"
"Secondly, I understand that Mrs Budreikaitis not as much interested in the euro as she is in the former interpretations of the Accession Treaties."
"If there is no deadline for implementing something in primary legislation, is it possible to postpone it forever?"
"Thirdly, do you think that the referendum is relevant to the debate?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr Czarnecki, being a Member State of the European Union, as we have just discussed in the last reply, brings with it the obligation to adopt the euro, except in the case of Denmark and the United Kingdom, which negotiated an 'opt-out' clause."
"The Member States that are not yet members of the euro zone are committed to adopting the single currency once they fulfil the conditions necessary in order to do so and to try to prepare for fulfilling them."
"When the Commission confirms, on the basis of its own assessment (the convergence report), and the European Central Bank does the same, that Poland meets all of the conditions laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty, Poland's exception can be removed, in accordance with Article 122(2), and the zloty can be introduced into the euro."
"For the time being, Poland does not entirely fulfil the convergence criteria with regard to the situation of public finances - because the Polish public deficit is higher than 3% - and nor does it fulfil the criterion with regard to the stability of exchange rates insofar as the zloty does not belong to the exchange rate mechanism."
"Furthermore, the legislation regulating the Central Bank in Poland does not yet conform to the Treaty's requirements, according to the analysis included in our latest convergence report of December 2006."
"The Commission does not make predictions concerning when the Member States will or may fulfil the required conditions, but it certainly encourages all of them to gear their policies towards achieving macroeconomic stability and to promote productivity growth."
"These policies promote sustainable economic convergence, which is the best basis for preparing the countries that wish to enter the euro and for enjoying all the benefits of belonging to the single currency once they are in the euro zone."
"(PL) Commissioner, thank you for your speech."
"However, I would like to say that we are obviously aware of the conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to join the Eurozone."
"My country has clearly stated that this is still not the right moment in economic terms, and that a decision will certainly be taken in a few years."
"I am very aware of the fact that the European Commission cannot discuss dates, but could we broadly state that 2012 would be a more or less suitable date for both sides?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, I would insist that it does not fall to the Commission to reply to that question."
"I believe that it is a question that should be addressed, and that I sometimes address, to the Polish authorities."
"When I meet with the Polish authorities, I ask them: have your intentions, timetable and objectives for joining the euro been established yet?"
"And I do not ask out of mere curiosity, but because I am convinced that, for an economy such as the Polish economy - and for many other economies of Member States of the European Union that do not yet belong to the single currency - it would be extremely useful to set that target date in order to guide macroeconomic policies and structural reforms in a consistent and coherent manner towards compliance with the conditions in order to prepare an economy to take the best possible advantage of the benefits of belonging to the euro."
"Since the enlargement, we have experienced some very positive times in terms of the behaviour of the currency markets and of the financial markets, but that is not always going to be the case, and the financial markets, the rating agencies, the investors, are also going to put those questions to the Polish authorities."
"Not only are you, the Members of the European Parliament, and we, the Commissioners, going to ask them, but the economic agents, observers and investors are asking them and will continue to do so with increasing insistence."
"I therefore believe that it is good for everybody that the countries that are going to join the euro, not just through obligation, but above all through conviction, and which are undergoing a process of convergence, growth and modernisation, through a very significant reform effort, clarify this element of the strategy; above all, because it is good for them and for their own interests."
"Would the Commissioner be willing to answer the same question again but in relation to the United Kingdom?"
"As you pointed out earlier, the UK has no obligation to join the euro but it has the right to do so, provided it meets the conditions."
"How close is the UK to actually meeting the conditions?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, it is true that the situation in the United Kingdom - as I have already said, and as you have repeated - is not the same."
"The United Kingdom has an 'opt-out' clause, and, therefore, the comments I made earlier with regard to the 12 countries that do not have that clause do not apply to it."
"Even with that clause, however, the day will come - and I hope that you and I will see it soon - when the British authorities, regardless of that clause, decide to prepare for joining the euro because they believe that it is positive for the British economy."
"When will that day come?"
"If you ask me whether I believe it will be this year, I shall say no, I do not believe that it will be this year."
"My impression is that, in the current phase of the economic cycle of the British economy and of the euro zone economy, the arguments in favour are not going to increase over the coming months or in the immediate future."
"I always respond to that question with a particular observation, however."
"I believe that the time will come when the circumstances that the British, being the good pragmatists they are, analyse each month with regard to the pros and cons of joining the euro will change, and will show the British citizens, British politicians and the City of London, to name three significant parties in this regard, that it will be good for the British economy to enter the euro at a particular time."
"I am sure that that time will come, but, to be frank, I believe that it will come after the next crisis."
"(LT) Honourable Commissioner, I also would like to link the last two issues and ask you a specific question."
"I personally do not doubt the advantages of the euro; however, in some countries, which do not yet have the euro, public opinion is different."
"How would the situation be affected by, for example, referendums in Poland or Lithuania, or Hungary or the Czech Republic, in which people voted against the introduction of the euro?"
"How it would affect the moral climate is clear, but what about the legal and practical situation?"
"Mr President, Baroness Ludford, according to EU law, it is up to the UK authorities to carry out impact assessments of infrastructure projects and to ensure that all applicable environmental standards are complied with before, during and after the realisation of these projects."
"Nevertheless, the Commission is closely monitoring the United Kingdom's implementation of the relevant provisions in Community law."
"The plans for the sustainable development of Heathrow involve an undertaking by the UK government not to build a third runway without prior public consultation and only to do so if noise and air quality conditions are strictly adhered to."
"A complete environmental impact assessment has therefore begun, which must comply with the provisions of the 1985 directive covering assessments of this nature, and with the provisions of the 2001 Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive."
"According to the 1996 Directive on the Management and Quality of Ambient Air and directives arising from it, air quality plans must, where necessary, be implemented in order that the set limit values are complied with."
"The impact of Heathrow Airport is covered by the air quality plan of the London metropolitan area."
"In 2005, however, air quality levels in the area often exceeded the limit values laid down for PM10 particles."
"Moreover, pursuant to the 2002 Directive on environmental noise, Heathrow must, before the end of this month, draw up a strategic noise map that includes an analysis of possible eventualities."
"A year after this map has been drawn up, an appropriate action plan must be drawn up following a process of public consultation."
"To sum up, the Commission is following the development of the EU's biggest airport with interest and is monitoring the implementation of the relevant provisions in Community law."
"However, the specific provisions on the extension of the airport, for example the provision relating to the building of a third runway, rests with the British authorities in this particular case."
"I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer."
"This will reassure Londoners that the Commission is indeed keeping a watchful eye, though, as you say, the main responsibility lies with the UK Government."
"However, an extra runway at Heathrow would allow an extra 500 flights a day to pass over London."
"The UK Government's optimistic claim that air pollution can be kept within EU legal limits appears to rest on hopes of cleaner planes and controls on vehicle traffic around the airport."
"Aviation already accounts for one third of all London's carbon emissions."
"Therefore, we would ask the Commission to keep that close watch on what is going to happen."
"We are expecting the consultation soon, but it needs the Commission to keep a very close eye to make sure that Londoners are protected."
"While it is easy to lambaste plans for new runways, is the Commission aware that last week, as an indication of just how essential a third runway is at Heathrow, the Chief Executive of British Airways said that without it there is no prospect of restoring BA flights between my constituency in Belfast and the capital city of my country, London?"
"Thus, should those who would jump to oppose progress not pause to reflect on the prejudice and the hardship which they would impose on citizens of the UK and elsewhere who need the modern, efficient flight connections that projects such as this would provide?"
"Mr President, Baroness Ludford, I must reiterate what I said in my reply to Baroness Ludford's question."
"The Commission must monitor compliance with Community law."
"As I mentioned, there are a number of applicable directives, and monitoring their effective implementation is our responsibility."
"In the particular case raised in Baroness Ludford's question, that is to say, the third runway at Heathrow, let me repeat that responsibility lies with the British authorities and, pursuant to the subsidiarity principle, the Commission may not interfere in issues for which responsibility lies with a particular Member State."
"Subject: European 'ecological governance'"
"Does the Commission intend to draw up a global, cohesive action plan for 'ecological governance', which will consolidate, simplify and highlight the existence of the existing regulatory framework for the parties concerned?"
"Will the plan include the new legislative initiatives on the environment, and reflect the EU's external commitments on environmental issues?"
"Will it also ensure cohesion between the EU's environmental, trade and industrial policies?"
"Mr President, Mr Papastamkos, since it published its White Paper in 2001, the Commission has always stressed the importance it attaches to the quality of governance in its actions, in order to ensure that the European institutions function effectively and democratically, in fruitful cooperation with civil society."
"Governance is an issue that cuts across all policy areas, not only the environment."
"We must acknowledge, however, that the citizens and NGOs place special emphasis on the quality of their environment and that civil society wants to be kept informed and to be involved as regards environmental issues."
"The 1998 Aarhus Convention is of particular importance in this connection, as it provides for access to information, public involvement in the decision-making process and justice when it comes to environmental issues."
"This Convention, to which the Community and the Member States are party, reinforces the commitments mentioned in the White Paper on European Governance."
"The Commission has applied principles of governance fully in its initiatives."
"As regards the issues raised by Mr Papastamkos in his question, I should like to point out to him that all important measures that the Commission is planning to present to other institutions are included in its annual work programme."
"This programme is presented to the other institutions - including, of course, Parliament, which debates it every year - and is accessible to the public."
"Most environmental measures are based on the Sixth Environment Action Programme."
"Furthermore, all of the Commission's proposals fully reflect the undertakings made by the Community in international agreements, including those relating to trade policy and the environment."
"Lastly, the Commission is playing an active role in the debate on improving international environmental governance."
"The EU has put forward a practical proposal to set up a UN environmental organisation, on the basis of a UN environmental programme."
"This body would have authority and clear legal functions as regards the early detection, monitoring and recovery of data, and would work on a consolidated scientific basis, thereby improving decision-making and the adoption of policies based on scientific evidence."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, the environmental acquis contains approximately 400 texts of secondary law and international conventions and they are, of course, used and applied by governments, local authorities, enterprises and the civil society."
"What has this famous 'better regulation' strategy yielded to date?"
"Two years ago I proposed here in this Chamber the need to establish an international environmental organisation."
"What is the Commission's position?"
"The environment, as we all know, is a public commodity and, as such, has no borders."
"What is the Commission's position on the establishment of an international environmental court?"
"Mr President, Mr Martin, the Commission bases EU climate policy and its scientific analysis of climate change on the most robust, up-to-date information available."
"The Commission is aware that, according to recent research, with greenhouse gases stabilising at 550 parts per million (ppm) CO2 equivalent, the chances of meeting the objective of limiting global warming to two degrees are dwindling."
"Accordingly, in its Communication entitled 'Limiting global warming to 2¬∞c' adopted this year, the Commission stated that in order to ensure that there is a 50% chance of not exceeding the 2¬∞c limit, it will be necessary to keep greenhouse gas concentrations at substantially less than 550ppm CO2 equivalent in the decades ahead. It also stated that emissions must then go down in order to achieve stabilisation at around 450ppm."
"This means that between now and 2050, worldwide greenhouse gas emissions must go down by at least 50% in relation to 1990 levels."
"The Commission's analysis demonstrated that this objective is technically feasible and economically viable if those mainly responsible for emissions take action quickly."
"This technical feasibility was confirmed recently by the report issued by Working Group 3 of the International Panel on Climate Change."
"The scientific studies carried out by Mr Meinhausen mentioned by Mr Martin in his question also underpin this ambitious objective."
"In order to limit climate change to 2¬∞c, to a 2¬∞c increase, developed countries must take the initiative of collectively reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30% in relation to 1990 levels by 2020, which is the objective we set in the proposals we adopted in January of this year in the Commission, and that subsequently received the Council's support."
"At the same time, emissions from developing countries must reach their maximum targets between 2020 and 2025."
"We are facing a global challenge, and the EU, which is responsible for 14% of the total greenhouse gas emissions on the planet, is ready to take the lead on the issue on the international stage."
"The EU is sure that the UN Conference on Climate Change to be held in Bali later this year will provide the impetus for negotiations on future international cooperation on climate change after 2012, which will lead to - or, rather, should lead to - an agreement on what must be done to achieve a global reduction in emissions."
"I should like to add that, on the basis of the conclusions of the last G8 Summit - taking account of both the progress and the limitations of those conclusions - we feel that significant progress was made on this agreement a few days ago in Heiligendamm."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his very detailed and, in some ways, encouraging reply."
"However, he has acknowledged in that reply that the 550 ppm target is unlikely to achieve his objectives."
"Will the Commission, in the run-up to Bali, put forward the idea of Europe taking a lead and going for a 400 ppm target as a way of setting a good example to the rest of the world?"
"I also accept his point that Europe acting alone will be insufficient."
"Mr President, as Europeans we are convinced that, as I said in my first answer to Mr Martin, enormous progress needs to be made and that the EU must play a leading role on the world stage."
"By moving forward together we can achieve much more ambitious goals, the likes of which others responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions are not prepared to undertake, at the end-of-year Conference on the post-Kyoto era, and Europe will find itself alone in making such commitments."
"Europe alone, as we said in our January proposals, must move forward in setting ambitious objectives."
"It will not be possible, however, to make the kind of commitments we wish to unless the other participants at the Conference do likewise."
"Subject: Waste tourism"
"What is the Commission's opinion of the developing waste tourism between Bavaria and the Czech Republic and what measures is it planning to reduce waste tourism within the EU and with the EU's closest neighbours?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Posselt, the European Union applies strict legislation to transfers of waste between Member Status and to transfers to third countries."
"Community legislation on the transfer of waste is aimed at preventing the illegal transportation of waste, including cases in which waste is transported illegally from one Member State to another in what is known, and what you have described in your question, as 'waste tourism'."
"The transport of waste is only authorised when subsequent recovery or elimination operations conform to the environmental protection requirements laid down in European and Member State legislation."
"European legislation lays down the strictest possible requirements with regard to the transport of dangerous goods and waste intended for elimination."
"According to this legislation, it is illegal to transport this kind of waste to another Member State unless there has been prior written notification to the competent authority of the originating country."
"Furthermore, in order to be able to carry out the transfer, authorisations must have been received from the competent authorities of the countries of origin, destination and transit."
"The Commission's main priorities include ensuring that Member States correctly apply European legislation on the transfer of waste, as well as preventing and reducing illegal transfers."
"The Commission has adopted a series of measures for achieving these objectives."
"This year awareness-raising events and meetings have been organised with the Member States, with a view to improving implementation and compliance with the rules on the transfer of waste in the Member States."
"Another important step will be the Commission's adoption of a proposal for a directive on environmental protection by means of criminal legislation."
"We cannot accept the illegal transport of waste from Germany to the Czech Republic or the illegal dumping of waste at the final destination."
"We are aware that similar situations may exist in other Member States, in addition to the one you raise in your question."
"The Commission will monitor the situation closely with a view to ensuring the correct application of European environmental legislation."
"Both the Commission and the Member States share the responsibility for guaranteeing the effective application of this legislation."
"The Member States must provide for inspections and controls of waste transfers on the ground and effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions in the event of infringements."
"(DE) I am much obliged to the Commissioner for that good, exhaustive reply."
"I now have two supplementary questions."
"Firstly, in the Commissioner's opinion, is enough being done to combat illegal waste tourism?"
"Secondly, is it true that the phenomenon is only shifting to the new external borders of the EU: for example to Ukraine or South-East Europe?"
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, I am no expert in this field, but I can tell you that when it comes to this kind of action, and given that both you in your question and I in my reply note that illegal transportation exists, anything that can be done in addition to what is already being done will be welcome, and this is applicable both to our own responsibilities for ensuring compliance with European law and - as I said in my initial reply - to the actions of the Member States, which have the monitoring and inspection instruments on the ground."
"With regard to the places in which this kind of illegal activity is taking place, according to the information available - as I pointed out in my reply - transfers of this type do not just take place between Germany and the Czech Republic, but also between Germany and certain other new Member States."
"And this transit may also exist beyond the borders of the European Union."
"In any event, with regard to transfers, to transport between Member States, it is particularly useful that this debate should confirm the intention and commitment of the European institutions to carry out our duties as vigorously as possible and call upon the politicians in the Member States to do likewise."
"Subject: Cancer screening"
"Cancer affects 2 million people in the EU, of which 276 678 reside in the UK."
"In light of the recent recommendations by the Council on cancer screening, does the Commission have any information on how effectively the Member States perceive this recommendation?"
"Mr President, I would like to thank the Member for the question, even though I have to be honest and say that I wish he was tabling it six months from now, because we are currently in the process of preparing our report on exactly this matter, i.e. the implementation of the Council recommendation, and we expect to have the report adopted by the end of this year."
"So we expect to have a discussion on the report, mainly under the Slovenian Presidency in the first half of next year."
"This report will provide information on the implementation and possible impact of the recommendation in the Member States, in the European Economic Area states and candidate countries."
"Additionally, wherever possible, the degree of national implementation will be reported in relation to the existing European screening benchmarks in breast and cervical cancer."
"We expect to derive the facts from two main sources: the Member States, which will be directly contacted by the Commission, and the European Cancer Network, which is responsible for obtaining evidence on the impact and the degree of implementation from independent experts in the field."
"I would like to take the opportunity, additionally, to inform you that we are also collecting cancer epidemiological data through the European Union Network for Information on Cancer that was established in 2005, which is co-funded by the Commission and managed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer."
"The aim is to compile information relevant to monitoring the cancer burden in European populations."
"The end of this project is scheduled for the end of August 2007 - two months from now."
"All the data, therefore, will in principle be available from that date."
"I asked the Commissioner the question because I was aware that on the horizon there are some very good activities planned, and I wish to thank him for that."
"I asked the question because I have been talking to doctors, consultants and oncologists in my own city of London, and in the United Kingdom we have a disproportionate number of cancer cases for what is a prosperous Member State."
"The question I want to ask you is: when I go back to those oncologists, what will I tell them?"
"Will I tell them that you will make every effort to ensure that the Council recommendation is implemented and that the Commission will take seriously the disproportionate figures we see from Member State to Member State, and that you will make a comparative example of Member States so that we can do something about some of these rates, which are far too high?"
"I can assure you that I will do my utmost to have the screening recommendations fulfilled and implemented as much as possible."
"They are recommendations, nevertheless, and we have to acknowledge this weakness in the European system."
"Therefore, in the end, it is up to each Member State to apply and implement them as effectively as possible."
"Perhaps the report will put some pressure on the Member States."
"However, the fact is that, from the information we already have, there is still great diversity between Member States as to implementation of their screening guidelines and, unfortunately, the worst situation is in many of the new Member States."
"Based on the report, there will be a discussion under the Slovenian Presidency which they will announce soon to Parliament."
"Cancer will be the main health theme during the Presidency."
"Therefore, I am sure we will have more opportunities to discuss this issue."
"From my part, I will do everything to have these guidelines and recommendations applied as effectively and as faithfully as possible."
"(DE) Screening is important, but prevention is better."
"In recent months, a vaccine against cervical cancer has been developed: a cancer that is always particularly problematic in young women."
"Member States have adopted completely different practices: some make it available on the national health service, whilst in others it is only available privately."
"This makes it very expensive and it becomes a social issue."
"Does the Commission envisage any prospect of putting pressure on Member States to give as many young women and girls as possible access to this vaccine?"
"Yes, I know about that, and in fact we had an opportunity to discuss this issue at the Informal Health Council in Aachen in April."
"We have now asked the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which is working on this issue, to produce guidelines and give advice on this subject."
"Of course, what is covered and what is not covered by the health system is, as you know, the responsibility of the Member States, but I believe that, based on the ECDC's guidance, we can discuss the issue further with the Member States and offer science."
"However, the final decision on finances will be left to the Member States."
"One of the great strengths of the European Union in the field of health is the ability to spread best practices."
"Apart from examining the outcome of the screening recommendations, will the Commission take as an example the country that comes out best in terms of screening, treatment and low mortality rates and analyse not just how they got there, but how this could be applied to other Member States?"
"There is no point in just gathering statistics and saying 'These countries are doing it well' or 'these countries are doing it badly'."
"We also need to know why the best countries are succeeding and how we might transpose that into other healthcare systems across the Community."
"Œúember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, the European Commission does indeed plan to approve a new strategy on health for 2007 and this strategy will be a general framework with quantifiable targets which take an integrated approach to all initiatives in the health sector at European level."
"I agree with what I might call the inference in the honourable Member's question that children and young people are a special priority for the European Commission."
"The strategy will refer to issues such as the importance of a healthy way of life and the need to combat obesity, smoking and alcoholism, but will also make special reference to sectors that affect children and young people."
"Of course, as I said in the previous question, our initiative on high-calibre health and safety services will be approved shortly and account will be taken within this framework of all the common fundamental values adopted by the Ministers of Health a year ago which support the European Union's health care systems."
"The values referred to in the decision by the Ministers include equality, universality and equal access to health services for everyone - and of course that includes children - regardless of their financial circumstances and these values will be taken into account in all the relevant initiatives by the European Commission."
"Of course, the provision of health services comes within the competence of the Member States, but the Commission will support the Member States in this endeavour and these values will also be taken into account in our initiatives wherever and whenever they refer to the health sector."
"We believe that all this will form a useful point of reference for all Community action in the health sector."
"(EL) Mr President, for children especially, as the strategy on children's rights is being debated and the competent commission has not expressed an opinion in the health sector, I wish to ask if provision has been made to introduce certain regular examinations throughout Europe, in order to safeguard the standard of health and the early diagnosis of illnesses."
"Œúember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, it goes without saying that this comes within the competence of the Member States but, under the various strategies which will be adopted and within the framework of the exchange of best practices in various sectors, of course the question of the best method of prevention will also be discussed and prompt examination is clearly an important preventive method."
"However, we assume that this will be addressed in each sector separately."
"I do not expect there to be a horizontal provision especially for children; however, in every health sector and in every health problem that can be avoided, the strategy and the initiative will refer specifically to children and to prevention."
"(DE) Mr President, the Commissioner raised the issue of alcoholism."
"In Austria, a rare - or not so rare - phenomenon has emerged among young people, namely that of 'binge drinking'."
"The aim seems to be to drink oneself unconscious in as little time as possible."
"In the Commissioner's experience, is this an exclusively Austrian phenomenon, or is there a trend towards this throughout Europe?"
"If it is a European trend, does he already have some measures in mind to counter such extreme drinking and prevent it in the long term?"
"Œúember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, this problem of excessive consumption of alcohol may indeed have started as a problem in the north or northwestern Member States of the European Union, but it is now extending to the more southern countries."
"We already know that this problem is being faced by Spain and I have had frequent opportunity to discuss this issue with the Minister of Health."
"This issue is addressed in the strategy to combat the harmful effects of the excessive consumption of alcohol adopted last year and supported by the Member States."
"We are in fact waiting for the European Parliament's position on this issue, but the question of young people and combating this form of excessive consumption of alcohol in general are among the strategy's main objectives."
"However, to a very great extent, and I must repeat again something I said earlier, the competence lies with the Member States."
"However, we believe that, through efforts to exchange best practices and transfer experience from one Member State to another and cooperation with all the agencies involved, we shall be able to achieve positive results."
"That is precisely why, last week, we had the first meeting of the European Alcohol and Health Forum and, of course, the problem raised by the honourable Member was one of the items addressed by the European Alcohol and Health Forum."
"(DE) The aim is to live a long, healthy life."
"Does the Commission have any suggestions as to how the existing EU programmes, such as the Seventh Research Framework Programme or the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, could be used to achieve these objectives, and what are the Commission's plans for the period up to 2013?"
"Œúember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, of course in the health sector in general, the basic strategy of the European Commission for this period is prevention."
"That is precisely why we are focusing on numerous efforts concerned with negative repercussions on the health sector, as I said earlier, such as alcohol, smoking, obesity, mental health and all these issues. However, this too will be part of the strategy; the approach will apply to all European policies in all sectors, especially the research sector you referred to, and to other sectors of the European Union, such as the agricultural, transport and regional policy sectors."
"In the research sector in particular, I work in close collaboration with my colleague and much of it is devoted to health research, such as research into cancer, research into avian influenza and in other health sectors, because we consider that it is one of the basic priorities and that is also acknowledged in the seventh financing protocol."
"Subject: Health services"
"On 20 April 2007, the Commission published the results of the consultation on health services it had launched in September 2006."
"As the majority of respondents were 'in favour of Community action in the field of health', can the Commission give an initial outline of the action it intends to take on the matter, in particular with a view to improving the provision of information to patients - making it possible for them to make informed choices - and ensuring greater clarity as regards the arrangements for and time limits in respect of obtaining healthcare in another Member State? What right of redress does the Commission intend to propose in cases in which national authorities refuse to grant prior authorisation?"
"On these health services, as I said earlier, we had the opportunity to discuss this in May during the debate on the report by Mrs Vergnaud, which was very helpful to us."
"I can inform Parliament that we are now in the process of drafting a proposal."
"After a few ministerial discussions this was endorsed by the Health Ministers in the latest Council, which expressed its expectation for the Commission to present the proposal in exactly the same way as the Parliament."
"So we expect to do this as soon as possible, definitely before the end of the year."
"We previously had a broad public consultation and the input from that will also be taken into account, but the basic outcome is that there is added value for initiative at European level."
"An important part of it will of course be the issue of information, and we would like this to be done in the most accurate and objective way."
"Our intention is to find solutions that add real value for patients, health professionals and healthcare providers, without creating new bureaucratic barriers, and respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"We will ensure coherence between the proposals on health services and the ongoing parallel Commission initiatives on social services of general interest, the wider issue of services of general interest, and the ongoing modernisation and simplification of the regulations on the coordination of social security systems."
"As I said earlier, information to citizens is an important part, so there will be efforts to access information; some have already been taken and have already been put in place with a recently launched website on meeting the costs for healthcare abroad."
"This website, which is already available in French, English and German, will be available in all official languages very soon."
"We will of course inform Parliament of forthcoming proposals as soon as they are finalised within the Commission, but I can broadly describe the main issues the proposals will address: improved information to patients, in particular about cross-border healthcare; the issue of the general quality and safety of health services; the rights of the patients to redress when they suffer harm; respect for privacy; procedural guarantees for patients in relation to cross-border healthcare; collection of data on cross-border health services; and support for European cooperation on issues such as European reference networks, developing quality and safety guidelines or developing comparable data and indicators."
". - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to know whether the Commission has annual statistics yet indicating the number of citizens of each Member State who wish to avail themselves of health care in another state and, if so, for what main reasons."
"In the absence of such statistics, does the Commission have the number of complaints that may have been filed by citizens of a Member State who have been refused authorisation to receive health care in another Member State?"
"One of the problems is that we do not have sufficient statistics on this issue."
"But we know from the evidence we have in front of us is that it is at least 1% of healthcare, so this will increase expectations."
"The main reason so far is the issue of the lack of information."
"People are not aware they have this right, and the more they become aware of this the more they will seek treatment abroad."
"This is an opportunity for us to regulate before it becomes too big an issue, before it is too late."
"I am afraid I do not have any indication of the complaints from people not being granted authorisation."
"As you know, we have had cases before the European Court of Justice where citizens were dissatisfied with a negative decision but, at the same time, the patients' lack of knowledge that they can seek redress at European level does not give us an accurate and clear picture either. That is why, when I was answering you question earlier, I only had in front of me the collection of data and cross-border health service which will be one of the priorities of the upcoming initiative."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.40 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.)"
"Derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on derogations from internal market rules for defence procurement on the basis of Article 296 TEC, by Arlene McCarthy, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection - B6-0122/2007)."
"author. - Mr President, I am sorry Mr Booth has gone because I would like to tell him that I am a music lover and perhaps next time he could perform a Euro-rap when my report is up!"
"As the Commissioner is aware, the defence procurement market accounts for a large share of EU public procurement, estimated at about EUR 80 billion out of a combined Member State defence budget of EUR 170 billion, and that is why we are tabling this question today: defence procurement is still being awarded within mostly fragmented national markets."
"The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, therefore, takes note of the Commission's interpretative communication on the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in the field of defence procurement, adopted on 7 December 2006."
"This helped clarify the existing legal framework."
"However, we also further note efforts by the Commission to propose new legislation, which should substantially contribute to creating a more competitive environment for the European defence industry and its suppliers."
"Therefore, we want to ask the Commissioner the following questions."
"What progress is being made on the draft directive on the procurement of defence equipment not subject to the derogations of Article 296?"
"What are the subsequent steps planned by the Commission in this area?"
"How does the Commission evaluate, from the perspective of a fair and efficient working of the internal market, the situation within the European defence industry, where in different Member States a significant number of highly skilled jobs appear to be at risk?"
"What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector, and what is the Commission's strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues, to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets in order to establish a well-performing and competitive environment for this sensitive sector?"
"We should also like to know what conclusions can be drawn from the code of conduct that was established in 2006, and how the Commission understands the future relationship between a potential directive and the code of conduct."
"Thank you, Mrs McCarthy."
"I would like to remind you that rap music and the Greek hendecasyllabic metre have the same rhythm."
"You and Mr Booth are closer than you think."
"Mr President, four years ago the Commission announced its intention to develop a European security and defence policy."
"Since then, we have been striving to establish a more open and fair European defence market through a number of initiatives."
"The new procurement directive for defence equipment is a crucial element of this overall strategy and is one of the Commission's strategic priorities for this year."
"At present, the vast majority of defence equipment tenders are conducted outside Community rules."
"Member States rely upon the derogation from the Treaty under Article 296."
"In the Commission's view, this derogation should be limited to the exceptional cases."
"We gave some guidance on the matter last December."
"Nevertheless, the derogation is still the rule more than the exception."
"Most defence procurement has therefore remained outside of the internal market principles."
"This means that all 27 Member States procure defence equipment in accordance with their own national regulations, often resulting in non-transparent and sometimes discriminatory practices."
"We recognise that current public procurement rules are really suited to the particular needs of the defence procurement."
"But we believe we can achieve important economic gains if we open up national defence markets, which represent 0.8% of the European Union's GDP and one quarter of public procurement at state level."
"Member States and industry widely acknowledge these advantages."
"Fair and transparent conditions would allow companies, especially SMEs, to tender more easily in other Member States and thus widen their access to business opportunities in a much larger home market."
"Longer production runs would allow economies of scale."
"This in turn would help to reduce costs and lead to lower prices."
"The final beneficiary of that would be the taxpayer."
"Our proposal would adapt certain Community procurement rules to the specific nature of defence and give awarding authorities greater flexibility for sensitive procurement procedures."
"This will also make it easier for Member States to use the derogation under Article 296 of the Treaty only in exceptional cases."
"As is the case under the other procurement directives, Member States will continue exchanging views on defence procurement issues via the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement, once the directive has been implemented."
"I wish to emphasise that the new directive will implement the code of conduct of the European Defence Agency."
"The code of conduct applies only to contracts which are exempted from the Community rules on the basis of Article 296, while the future directive will apply to contracts which are not exempted from Community rules."
"Together the code of conduct and the new directive will enhance transparency and fair competition on defence partners in the European Union."
"I am pleased to indicate that work on the proposal for a defence directive is well advanced."
"My services are currently finalising the impact assessment which will tell us more about the expected impact of the initiative on the market, including social issues."
"In parallel we are working closely with Member States via the Advisory Committee on Public Procurement and via the European Defence Agency."
"Industry is also involved in the impact assessment."
"The Commission is planning to adopt a proposal in the autumn."
"At this stage we aim to present it as part of a package, together with a proposal for a regulation on intra-Community transfers of military equipment and a communication on defence industries."
"Since we started the reference in the field of defence procurement, Parliament has always been one of our strongest supporters."
"This is clearly reflected in Parliament's resolution of 2005."
"I wish to thank you for this and hope that our fruitful cooperation will continue in the future."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming the Commissioner's clear commitment to producing the new directive as soon as possible and by thanking him for outlining a number of important measures on which he and his departments are already working. Clearly, this is a particularly sensitive area because of both its strategic nature and some of the industrial policy issues surrounding the whole defence sector."
"I should like to raise two particular points, to which the Commissioner could perhaps respond in his winding-up statement."
"Firstly, it is clear that in many areas of defence equipment procurement there are very complex contractual arrangements, in many cases also involving a significant amount of product development."
"In other words, the specification of the equipment may involve new technology evolutions."
"These arrangements will be very different in many cases from conventional buying contracts, although, as I indicated in my response to Mrs McCarthy's report, there is increasing interest in more transparent conditions for these types of contracts."
"I wonder whether the Commissioner could indicate or confirm that he will be taking these specific strategic needs into account."
"The second point, which is a difficult one, is that in many cases defence procurement agreements also have some form of offset agreement attached to them."
"For instance, the procuring countries may be looking for some form of local investment, involving local firms in assembling the equipment."
"Or, in some cases, there is a completely different sort of financial offset in terms of an agreement to buy products from a company in another market."
"These arrangements seem to raise difficult issues in the context of both competition and procurement law, and I should be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm that he will be looking at these in the review of the directive he has promised."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is not only a tricky subject but, astonishingly, also an area in which Member States are persistently infringing European law."
"The Green Paper was discussed in 2004, Parliament tabled a motion for a resolution in 2006, and now we have a new interpretation - yet, in reality, hardly anything has changed."
"Member States are continuing to do as they please."
"Has the CFSP failed in this respect?"
"I can see no real improvement since 2004."
"Member States and members of national parliaments seem to be completely unaware of Article 296 of the EC Treaty - as, indeed, it describes an exceptional situation rather than the rule."
"In addition, the European Court of Justice has found once again that this is not a case of a general automatic derogation."
"Yet there is no improvement to be seen, even though - and this, too, may still be worth mentioning - the group concerned consists of just six Member States."
"There, too, I do not currently see any improvement."
"To put it clearly, I do not want any increase in the defence budget; above all, my group wants to see savings by means of cooperation and the use of synergies."
"Parliament has made some recommendations in this regard, for example on the components the new Code of Conduct should have."
"Perhaps the Commissioner could add something in this regard?"
"We have also requested better cooperation from the Commission - and not only the Commission, but also the European Defence Agency."
"I cannot see much evidence of this in reality."
"I should like to reiterate that we have made suggestions on the mechanisms for the competitive award of contracts the Commission still needs to change for us to finally achieve what everyone in this House wants."
"After all, we agree with the Commission that a genuine European defence market is necessary to reduce military expenditure costs and to make production more efficient in the interests of the taxpayer and the public."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by giving my sincere thanks to the Commissioner for his speech clarifying the current position of the Commission on this subject."
"He pointed out that Parliament is a good ally of the Commission's, and indeed we do support his view that a more transparent, effective and open European defence market is an important objective, with a view both to strengthening the sector in Europe and to further objectives."
"I believe that what I have just said goes for all my fellow Members: I would point to the broad consensus we achieved on our resolution on the Green Paper."
"We learn with interest that the work on the Directive on the procurement of defence equipment is well advanced and that the Commission intends to present a proposal in autumn."
"Mrs Weiler has just pointed out that defence markets are still largely national in character."
"The State is the only relevant bidder for defence equipment, and it is true that, in the case of many award decisions, recourse is still taken to legal bases that are questionable, to say the least."
"However, I agree with Mrs Weiler: there is little support for increasing the defence budget."
"I believe that this draft Directive takes exactly the right course, namely increasing the efficiency reserve in the European armaments industry, ending the fragmentation of the market, and really improving efficiency and achieving economies of scale."
"That is why we welcome the Commissioner's remarks on expected growth and on increased competitiveness on the European defence equipment market."
"I believe that this will also have a positive effect on the trained labour market."
"We need a clear definition of the equipment covered by the derogation."
"The existing regulations are indeed insufficient to meet the particular needs of the defence equipment market."
"Therefore, we also welcome the Commission's initiative to adapt the rules to the state of affairs on the defence equipment market and to strive for greater flexibility in this regard."
"I would be grateful if the Commissioner could tell us why he decided to adapt general public procurement law instead of presenting a separate directive."
"This may well be appropriate, but I should like him to say a few words about this."
"The bottom line is that we agree with the Commissioner when he says that the opening-up of this market will increase transparency and competition and thus ultimately reduce the burden on taxpayers."
"Finally, I should like to emphasise that, as I see it, this draft Directive is far more important than any considerations of industrial or internal-market policy."
"It will contribute to the development of European security and defence policy, thus bringing about progress in what is traditionally a core domain of national sovereignty."
"The Directive will bring about progress that may not be revolutionary, but is hopefully measurable, towards a European Security and Defence Policy truly deserving of the name."
"I would like to add that I would be obliged if, in future, such debates were held in Brussels and not in Strasbourg."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, each year, around EUR 180 billion are spent on defence within the borders of the European Union's common market."
"Almost half of this amount is not subject to the public procurement legislation currently in force."
"We need to analyse this situation, which has resulted from the application of Article 296 of the Treaty in relation to public procurement in the field of defence."
"The Communication has partly clarified the issue."
"In view of the specific nature of the arms manufacturing industry and the need to integrate it into the defence policies of specific Member States of the European Union and NATO, we need to ensure the technical compatibility of the equipment and communication systems, as well as the proper compatibility of equipment and appliances."
"We need greater cooperation between individual countries, a properly functioning defence industry and well organised supplies."
"The objective of our activities should be to draw up a directive on public procurement in the defence sector."
"A stable arms market and stability with respect to the procurement procedures used will have a positive effect on the sector, in terms of employment and efficiency."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the basis for today's debate is the report by our former colleague Mr W√ºrmeling."
"It was on this basis that the Commission issued its communication at the end of last year, which was intended to clarify the application of Article 296 but in fact had little effect."
"After all, it was initially geared exclusively towards non-military goods, and thus the majority of military procurements inevitably fell within the scope of this derogation."
"Therefore, it is really up to the Commission to ensure that, firstly, the rules on public procurement in the defence sector really support the work of the European Defence Agency and, secondly, that they take account of the fact that, as many of the previous speakers have said, this is a sector that exhibits peculiarities."
"I have three questions for Commissioner McCreevy, therefore."
"Firstly, does a directive in this field not have the flaw from the outset that it is based on a communication that was originally intended to cover only non-military goods, and is consequently unable to achieve what we expect of it as regards the common security policy?"
"Secondly, would it not be possible to update the 1958 list, which sets out the derogations relatively clearly but is now out of date?"
"Has the Commission abandoned the task of updating this for good?"
"Thirdly, the Commissioner rightly said that normal public procurement law is not suited to the defence sector."
"Following on from Mr Lambsdorff's question, I would be very interested to hear how the Commissioner intends to take account of the peculiarities of the defence sector in a directive."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, each year, the 27 Member States of the European Union spend EUR 170 billion on defence."
"These 27 Member States have two million soldiers, 10 000 tanks and 3 000 fighter aircraft."
"In spite of this, they could not end the bloodshed in the Balkan conflict; we needed our American friends to do it for us."
"Why was that?"
"At that time there were not yet any common decision-making structures in the EU to enable the implementation of such operations."
"Another of the main reasons for the inefficiency of European defence is the lack of a common defence market."
"One of the reasons for this is Article 296."
"I am convinced that this Article will be retained in future."
"The reason that no common European defence market has developed is the excessive application of this Article in the past."
"First of all, the Commission issued its communication clarifying what is and what is not covered by Article 296: I think this communication is helpful."
"Then the European Defence Agency took action: in my opinion, the Code of Conduct it adopted was an important step in the right direction."
"We now also need EU legislation in this field, however - which is why I welcome the fact that this Directive is now envisaged."
"As MEPs, we keep hearing a great deal of criticism of the EU rules on the award of public contracts, particularly from local authorities."
"Therefore, we MEPs shall take very great care that the rules established here are indeed tailored towards the defence field, and that they improve rather than worsen the situation in that field."
"Our assent will be conditional on this."
"In addition, we keep hearing that we Europeans are spending too little on defence."
"If we continue working on this field and create a common market, we shall at least achieve more security for the same money."
"Mr President, in response to comments by Mr Harbour, Mr Lambsdorff and Mr Schwab, I can confirm that the very aim of a dedicated directive on defence procurement is to take account of the specificity of the defence market."
"We recognise that the existing framework is ill-adapted to the defence market."
"Clearly, the fundamental principles of public procurement rules will have to apply, but defence presents specific requirements in terms of security of supply, security of information or the need to have negotiated procedure."
"Mr Harbour also raised the question about offsets, which is a very complex issue."
"Offsets are economic compensations, which most Member States require from non-national suppliers when they buy military equipment abroad."
"They are legally problematic, politically controversial and economically questionable."
"Direct offsets are directly related to the subject of the procurement contract, they can sometimes be covered by Article 296, if the procurement contract itself is exempted on the basis of that article."
"However, the huge majority of offsets are indirect and non-military in nature."
"From the Commission's viewpoint, these offsets are not covered by Article 296."
"They must respect Community law, even if they are related to defence contracts exempted on the basis of Article 296."
"In other words, offsets are a problem in themselves, even in the area covered by Article 296."
"Addressing this problem via the Defence Directive would only cover the Community part of the defence market and would leave indirect offsets for contracts exempted on the basis of Article 296 untouched."
"In conclusion, as I said earlier, the opening-up of national defence markets will lead to important economic gains and will ultimately benefit all taxpayers."
"In order to achieve this we need to create a new legal framework, which adapts certain Community procurement rules to the specificities of defence."
"This new directive will give national authorities greater flexibility when they make sensitive procurements."
"The debate is closed."
"The banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Dimitrios Papadimoulis, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury - C6-0363/2006 -."
"Mr President, I am pleased to open this debate on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury."
"I should like to thank the draftsman and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety for their efforts so far."
"I should also like to thank the Committee on International Trade and its rapporteur, Mr Holm, for their contribution to this file."
"Mercury is internationally recognised as highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife."
"Initially seen as an acute local problem, mercury pollution is now also understood to be global, diffuse and chronic."
"High doses can be fatal to humans and even relatively low doses can have serious adverse neuro-developmental impacts."
"Against this background, the Commission developed a comprehensive Community strategy concerning mercury, which was adopted in January 2005."
"Its key aim is to reduce mercury levels in the environment and human exposure through a number of actions that address all aspects of the mercury lifecycle."
"The European Parliament welcomed the strategy and its overall approach in the resolution adopted in March 2006."
"The proposal that is now before you implements two key actions identified in the strategy, namely Action 5 (by banning the export of metallic mercury from the Community) and Action 9 (by requiring the safe storage of mercury that is no longer needed in the chlor-alkali industry)."
"The primary production of mercury came to an end within the Community four years ago when the last active mine in Almad√©n in Spain stopped its activities."
"The environmentally desirable phasing-out of mercury-cell technology into chlor-alkali industry results, however, in a new source of mercury supplies: some 12 000 tonnes of surplus mercury will come out of the sector over the next number of years until its transition to mercury-free technologies is completed."
"Most mercury is currently exported from the Community, and exports of up to 800 tonnes per year end up, at least partly, in unregulated and uncontrolled uses like artisanal gold mining."
"This is how EU mercury is adding to global mercury exposure."
"The basic aim of the proposed regulation is to stop these exports and to ensure that mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry is safely stored and cannot re-enter the environment."
"On the basis of the impact assessment, the Commission also proposes to apply the safe storage requirement to two other industrial sources of mercury - natural gas cleaning and mercury resulting as a byproduct of non-ferrous metal mining."
"The storage obligation is a logical development from the export ban, as the small remaining internal market for mercury will be unable to absorb the quantities at stake."
"Recycling and recovery will ensure that mercury is still available for remaining legitimate uses."
"Storage operations will fall under the legal framework of the Waste Landfill Directive, with additional safety requirements reflecting the specific properties of metallic mercury."
"The Commission aimed at proposing a straightforward, simple legislative proposal that is backed by a sound knowledge base and avoids, in line with the principles of better regulation, any excessive administrative burden for industry or for public administration."
"The proposal refrains from taking legislative action in fields where the impact assessment did not provide any solid justification for such action or any clear view on its possible impact."
"I should also like to underline that the industry concerned, namely the chlor-alkali sector, signalled its support for this proposal and is willing to sign up to a voluntary commitment."
"This commitment engages industry to select highly qualified storage operators and ensures that key data on mercury flows will be made available."
"The Commission intends to acknowledge this commitment, in line with the principles and procedures set out in the communication on the environmental agreements adopted in 2002."
"It is not the purpose of the proposal to implement the whole of the mercury strategy: its scope is deliberately more concise."
"Work on other actions of the strategy is ongoing."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic substances."
"Even in low doses, they have an adverse impact on our cardiovascular, immune and reproductive systems."
"In the environment, mercury can change into methylmercury and concentrate in the food chain, especially in the aquatic environment."
"In the city of Mina-Mata in Japan in 1956, 8 000 people died because they ate fish with a high mercury content."
"Mercury is a global problem and needs coordinated international action to resolve it."
"The European Union cannot argue persuasively for a reduction in the supply and demand of mercury and, at the same time, continue to be one of the main suppliers in the world."
"The Commission proposal for a regulation is a unique opportunity to break the cycle of exports of this dangerous substance."
"I am extremely satisfied that both the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Legal Affairs rejected the double legal basis and opted for Article 175 as the only basis, given that the objective of the regulation is to protect the environment and public health."
"As far as the starting date for banning exports is concerned, I am calling for something fair and simple: we in the European Parliament need to remain consistent with the resolution we ourselves adopted by a very large majority in March 2006 on the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury."
"That is why I call on you to vote in favour of Amendment 43, so that we are consistent with these stated positions of the European Parliament."
"I think that the compounds and mercury products already subject to restricted use and marketing in the European Union should also be included in the export ban, as we agreed in March last year."
"What message are we sending to third countries if we export to them the mercury products banned in the European Union because they are dangerous?"
"Will we remember the well-known phrase 'bon pour l'orient'?"
"As far as the ban on mercury imports is concerned, there is no sense in storing mercury from the European Union on the one hand and in importing mercury for use within the European Union on the other."
"We are calling for common sense."
"Besides, supply currently exceeds demand, according to the Commission figures, and this situation looks likely to continue in the future."
"As regards the storage obligation for metallic mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry, again my views are based on the resolution adopted by the European Parliament."
"I am calling, until such time as there are appropriate techniques for the final disposal of mercury, preferably in solidified form, for temporary storage in a recoverable form, either in underground salt mines or in surface installations used exclusively and equipped for temporary storage."
"Otherwise, the storage site for this toxic substance will be the human body itself."
"Anyway, we are not talking about millions of tonnes."
"In all, the surplus quantities of mercury in the chlor-alkali industry are estimated at approximately 12 000 tonnes, the volume of which - due to its high density - is approximately 1 000 cubic metres."
"At the same time, I am calling for the adoption of a basic framework of preconditions for storage ensuring continuous monitoring, safety specifications, regular reporting, exchange of information and penalties in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle in the event of non-compliance."
"Responsibility during temporary storage should remain with the owner of the storage installation, while the Member States should assume administrative and financial responsibility for safe final disposal."
"I am therefore calling on the Member States to create a fund on the basis of financial contributions from the chlor-alkali industry which will provide the necessary resources."
"I am also calling for a register of buyers, sellers and traders of mercury to allow regular monitoring of movements of imports and exports."
"Let us stand against a watered down regulation which will not provide the level of protection of public health and the environment wanted by the citizens."
"The call for a ban on exports and the problem of storage must be addressed on the basis of these criteria."
"The relative cost - for such an investment in the future - is comparatively very low in the face of the exponential benefits it will generate."
"The European Union, the European Parliament can and must stand at the vanguard of global efforts to withdraw mercury."
"I hope that our decisions tomorrow will contribute towards this."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - (SV) It is high time that we took this important decision concerning a ban on exports of metallic mercury."
"There are probably not many people who are aware of this, but the EU is in actual fact the world's largest exporter of the substance."
"More than 1 000 metric tons are exported each year from the EU to other countries."
"That is almost a third of the entire world trade in metallic mercury."
"Mercury, which is dangerous, ends up almost exclusively in developing countries, where it causes a very great deal of harm."
"I am pleased to adopt a position on a well thought-out report by my colleague, Mr Papadimoulis."
"This report is not only about banning exports of metallic mercury."
"It is also about obtaining safe storage of this dangerous substance, something that I think is very positive."
"I am particularly pleased that Mr Papadimoulis has contributed a number of considerable improvements to the Commission's proposal."
"These improvements include the following:"
"extension of this regulation to include products and mercury compounds,"
"extension of the ban to include imports,"
"entry into force of the ban on a date earlier than that desired by the Commission, that is to say 2010 instead of 2011,"
"setting up of a tracking system for the mercury trade in order to obtain increased monitoring of mercury,"
"support for developing countries as they convert to modern, mercury-free technology."
"These changes are precisely in line with what I proposed as draftsman of the Committee on International Trade, and I am very grateful for them."
"All that worries me is the demand by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe for a split vote."
"A split vote would threaten to undermine important parts of this otherwise excellent report."
"Stick, therefore, to the rapporteur's approach designed to safeguard the environment and public health and do not adopt the ALDE Group's market-based approach."
"Tomorrow the EU shall, then, assume its responsibilities and stop dumping lethal mercury in developing countries."
"It is really high time it did so."
"With our changes and improvements, the EU will also assume its historic responsibility to support countries in the South as they change over from using mercury to using cleaner technologies."
"This will safeguard the health of thousands of people and of our common environment."
"That would be no bad thing."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs. - (ES) Mr President, we had no difficulty in the Committee on Legal Affairs in dealing with the issue of the legal basis, because the aim of this measure is not the implementation of commercial policy - and Article 133 is not therefore applicable - but the protection of health - and Article 175 is therefore applicable."
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has therefore proposed that the sole legal basis be Article 175, with all of the consequences of that from a procedural point of view."
"Having said that, Mr President, as an MEP from a country that has very close historical links to mercury activities, I would like to point out that Mr Callanan's Amendment 40 on the storage of mercury is much more precise than the text that the Commission had proposed with regard to Article 3(1a)."
"Having proposed this legal basis, therefore, Mr President, I would also call for support for Mr Callanan's Amendment 40."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, as this House is well aware, this proposed regulation on the banning of exports and storage of metallic mercury is in line with the commitments contained in the Mercury Strategy which we passed in March 2006."
"The PPE-DE Group supports the broad aims of the regulation."
"Mercury must be disposed of and stored safely in order to protect human health and the environment."
"Mercury cell technology is being gradually replaced by the environmentally superior and energy efficient membrane cell technology and this conversion is releasing surplus mercury across the European Union."
"The aim of this regulation is to prevent this decommissioned mercury from entering the world market."
"In my view the Commission's proposal is broadly acceptable and the most workable approach."
"With regard to the date for the entry into force of the export ban, amendments have been tabled to bring that date forward."
"We do not support those amendments."
"The timing of the ban was debated at length prior to the Environmental Council in June 2005, and the 2011 date was agreed in the Council conclusions as contained in the Commission's proposal."
"In my view, nothing has changed since the Council took that decision and I would not wish to have those very difficult decisions reopened."
"This could only delay the introduction of the ban, especially if it encouraged the re-examination of whether an export ban is in fact the best way to achieve the EU's aims."
"The date that has been chosen is the date that appears to gain the most support from a majority of Member States and of course, equally importantly, from the many other stakeholders involved."
"That date has been set by the Commission with the agreement of the Spanish authorities and Minas de Almad√©n in order to leave enough time to reorganise and restructure that company, and I think it deserves all of our support."
"I am not in favour of the proposals to introduce a ban on the import of mercury and mercury compounds."
"Given the quantities of mercury rising from the decommissioned chlor-alkali plants within the Community, there would appear to be absolutely no commercial incentive for imports and thus no necessity for including an import ban at this stage."
"The market is quite capable of regulating itself."
"Similarly, we are also not in favour of extending the scope of the export ban."
"We accept the Commission's view that metallic mercury is by far the most relevant substance in terms of quantity, as compared to mercury compounds and products containing mercury, and that extending the export ban would be very premature at this stage."
"Furthermore, companies would simply relocate and continue producing."
"Is it really up to us to regulate what other countries in the world get up to?"
"I personally think not."
"Both extensions to the Commission's proposal require deeper analysis of better regulation principles and the cost and impact of existing business."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for you, mercury is just a toxic metal which we need to get rid of and which you have only seen in thermometers when you have had a fever."
"To me, mercury also brings to mind a place in my province, Almad√©n, whose mines were one of the birthplaces of the workers' movement in Spain."
"Mercury brings to mind thousands of men and women who lived from it for centuries, hundreds of names and faces, friends with whom I have worked as a Socialist Member of Parliament over the last 30 years, explaining to them, persuading them and supporting them with alternatives in order to overcome the paradox that human progress, which was getting rid of mercury, appeared to be heralding their disappearance."
"These people have appreciated our efforts and just the other day confirmed their faith in us by voting for Socialist Party candidates in their local councils."
"Today, thinking of those friends and re-stating my commitment to them, I would like to thank the honourable Members for their understanding, enshrined in the text approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and which we will improve tomorrow by means of certain amendments."
"There are three favourable pieces of information which will be received in Almad√©n with gratitude, interest and hope."
"Firstly, it is recommended that specific Community economic compensation be granted for the socio-economic progress of Almad√©n and its surrounding area."
"Secondly, it is recommended that we prioritise the study of Almad√©n as the location for the mercury store intended for the safe storage of all of the metal in existence in Europe."
"Thirdly, given the existing experience and familiarity in Almad√©n with treating mercury, common sense dictates that the store should be located where more than 80% of the European Union's mercury is already being stored in complete safety."
"Someone from my region told me that taking mercury from Almad√©n to anywhere else would be like taking the piano to the piano stool rather than taking the stool to the piano in order to play a concert."
"Finally, we are grateful for the consistency of those people who propose that exporting and other operations with mercury should be able to be carried out - as we had stated in the Matsakis report - until 2010, and indicating the date of 1 December, thereby allowing mercury to be in circulation for rather longer."
"I am sure that, with the resolution that we will approve tomorrow, Parliament will be in a good position to take on its codecision duties within the relevant negotiation with the Council."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I should like to express my sincere congratulations to Mr Papadimoulis for his excellent report, and I wish to thank him for cooperating with the shadow rapporteurs."
"In general terms, the rapporteur has sought to make the Commission's proposal somewhat more strict, rightly so in some aspects."
"However, in two areas, such a position seems neither entirely wise nor realistic."
"The first area relates to bringing the proposed deadline date forward to 2009."
"In our view, this is impractical and unobtainable."
"We feel that we should keep to the 1 January 2010 deadline, as we previously decided in the Mercury Strategy."
"The second area is more controversial, that of the storage of metallic mercury."
"In my view, the controversy arises largely because of the confusion as to what temporary and permanent storage really mean in practice."
"The line I support is that if storage can be achieved in local salt mines or other approved suitable places, under strict conditions with complete monitoring and safety guarantees for thousands of years, then this is good enough for me."
"There is no need to specifically stipulate in this piece of legislation the obligation to retrieve this mercury and transport it across Europe to a new, more permanent storage facility."
"If the legislators of the future take into consideration any new technological advancements which make it safe for stored mercury to be treated in a particular way or moved to a new location, then I am sure this can and will be done whatever we put in this legislation now."
"In conclusion, let us use common sense and keep things simple and in perspective."
"Until recently, mercury was and, in many cases, still is in every household and in every doctor's and dentist's surgery, as well as in every hospital in the form of thermometers, barometers, sphygmomanometers, tooth fillings, etc. We need to get rid of mercury, but it is neither a highly contagious lethal virus nor a nerve gas compound which is deadly on near touch."
"Therefore, in dealing with the amendments to this report, let us try not to exaggerate and not to go over the top with our demands."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the European Parliament and Council regulation on the banning of exports and the safe storage of mercury is a document that restricts the occurrence of mercury in the environment and its effect on people and animals."
"Between 1990 and 2000, the countries of the European Union reduced global mercury emissions by 60%."
"In the meantime, these emissions have risen by 20% across the world."
"In the 1940s, my friends and I found some mercury and were pleased when the coins we dipped in it became a silvery colour."
"Today, society's attitude towards mercury has changed dramatically, and the industrial sector is moving away from processes that use mercury due to its toxicity."
"Although I find this draft regulation to be positive, I do have a few comments to make."
"First of all, permanent storage facilities should be found for mercury waste as soon as possible, thus limiting temporary storage."
"Secondly, the storage facilities should be as close as possible to avoid transporting mercury waste around Europe."
"Thirdly, we cannot introduce new ways of using mercury waste without properly planning and testing them."
"We should be aware that, in view of the dangers of mercury, the industrial sector itself is trying to move away from processes that involve mercury."
"Amendments 11, 12, 15, 23-27 to the Commission's proposal are not justified."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) Metallic mercury is a danger to public health and to the environment, and we now have 12 000 metric tons of mercury that have to be stored."
"Perhaps that sounds a lot, but it is a volume that could easily fit into half of this Chamber."
"It would therefore be odd if we were to send this mercury here, there and everywhere and store it in a host of different places and in stores that were unsafe."
"That is why I am opposed to the attempt by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to get rid of mercury, because it would only be a temporary solution."
"A permanent solution needs to be completely safe."
"The only completely safe solution is to stabilise the mercury once and for all."
"Mercury sulphide is almost completely insoluble, which means that it can be stored safely."
"If it is not stabilised, we cannot have a whole lot of different, badly supervised stores."
"I am therefore opposed to Amendment 40, because it would undermine safety at work."
"It is important for us to agree on one and the same date: 1 January 2010, as stated in Amendment 43, proposed by my group."
"This prohibits both imports and exports of all products containing mercury, so creating a holistic view of the matter."
"Anything else would amount to the cynical export of mercury."
"We know that the chlor-alkali industry must cease exports."
"If it gets the chance to continue exporting one year after the ban enters into force, it will empty its stores of metallic mercury and be paid for doing so."
"The mercury will then be used by gold-washers in the Amazon basin and destroy huge river areas by contaminating them with mercury."
"It is important for the ban to be introduced on 1 January 2010. Otherwise, we would undermine the whole idea of the export ban."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, mercury is considered a heavy metal, and is very dangerous in the food chain."
"A number of other heavy metals, such as chrome, nickel, uranium and plutonium can also be classified in the same category."
"It is true that not only heavy metals but also a number of lighter elements in the periodic table can, in large quantities, be harmful to health."
"For example, beryllium is known to cause berylliosis."
"Mercury is not just a metal that can cause serious harm after consumption in its metallic state, it is also an important substance in the field of technology."
"In the past, electrolysis, dentistry and jewellery could not do without it."
"The instrumental method of chemical analysis using mercury drop electrodes is well known, and in 1959, the Czech academic Heyrovsk√Ω won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for this process, which he termed polarography."
"One important issue revolves around the potential uses of mercury and its compounds in industry, although this must, of course, involve the highest environmental standards."
"I am not sure whether storing mercury and its compounds in one place is the best solution."
"The same goes for how long the transitional period should be before the regulation enters into force."
"It is my impression that for some Member States the period laid down in Amendment 8 is too short."
"This is why I have reservations about the proposal, although in most Member States mercury and its compounds, including stockpiles, are strictly monitored by the relevant state bodies."
"I feel it is unacceptable to enshrine the role of unspecified NGOs in the regulation, regardless of any issues of tolerance and openness to the public, this does not belong in a regulation on the banning of exports and the safe storage of metallic mercury."
"The involvement of citizens in monitoring activities is covered in other areas of EU legislation."
"I fail to understand why salt mines or the mines in Almad√©n in Spain would be the best place to store mercury and its compounds."
"It is obvious that the end of operations in any given mine leads to social problems for the miners."
"In the Czech Republic and other Member States of Central and Eastern Europe, dozens of large mines have been shut down, without anyone drawing up EU regulations to deal with the massive unemployment that that has caused."
"It strikes me that the bottom of mineral mines might be a better storage place than salt mines."
"I strongly support the solution of addressing the issue of substances with less than 5% mercury content."
"Furthermore, heavy metals in rocks throughout Europe are at normal levels, and in the course of weathering, they - including mercury - find their way into European water supplies."
"This is why, for example, in the River Elbe concentrations of mercury and other heavy metals are always detected."
"This is of course a natural occurrence."
"There is also the issue of water from old mines, the extraction of mercury from old dumps and waste sludge, which is a potentially massive source of environmental pollution."
"This regulation cannot, however, cover this issue, of course."
"To conclude, I should like to thank all those who contributed to drawing up this regulation, a process that was conducted in a positive atmosphere of cooperation."
"Mercury and its compounds have a future in science and technology, as this regulation shows, and that is why we support it."
"(SK) First of all, allow me to thank the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, for highlighting in the report the need for banning exports of mercury, mercury compounds and mercury-containing products."
"This is very important to us in the European Union, since the EU is one of the world's biggest mercury exporters."
"Since this substance is extremely toxic, especially for children, we should take an interest in protection not only in connection with mercury production or use, but also during the storage or handling of mercury waste."
"High mercury doses are lethal to humans; smaller amounts of mercury accumulated in the body may cause severe diseases of the immune, cardiovascular and reproductive systems."
"Industry generates excessive quantities of mercury, for example, in the form of by-products in the chemical industry, in connection with the cleaning of natural gas, or in the extraction of non-ferrous metals and smelting in the metallurgical industry."
"One should consider whether, by exporting surplus mercury to third, notably developing, countries, which are the main mercury consumers, we will indeed dispose of mercury."
"Many developing countries lack funds to deploy modern environmentally friendly technologies, and their supervision is less stringent."
"I agree with the rapporteur and support his stance that the European Union should not be using double standards - that is, a product which may not be used in the European Union should not be exported to countries which have no legislation on the use of mercury."
"We should bear this in mind not only because of the need for environmental protection and nature conservation; we should also remember that this mercury might return in the form of residues in food or by way of polluted rivers, not to mention the risk of exposure for local workers and populations."
"With regard to mercury and mercury-containing products, the European Union must ensure that mercury supplies are consistent with needs and demand."
"Surplus mercury must be disposed of in an environmentally sustainable way in accordance with the Hazardous Waste Directive which we have adopted."
"At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen monitoring and to penalise strictly any instances of non-compliance."
"I agree with the rapporteur that manufacturers who produce mercury in the production process should be responsible for its safe storage or environmentally sustainable disposal."
"This is also important in ensuring continued growth in the industry and encouraging transition to new alternative technologies that are not dependent on mercury."
"As part of our aid to developing countries, we should put more emphasis on implementing such technologies where the environment has been devastated by this hazardous chemical."
"(FI) Mr President, the regulation before us is part of a whole based on the Community's strategy concerning mercury."
"EU environmental legislation has been brought up-to-date in line with that strategy this session."
"I am satisfied that we have now reached a stage where our attitudes towards the export of mercury are being reviewed."
"The EU is, after all, the world's biggest exporter of the substance."
"It is undisputable that mercury and its many compounds are toxic to humans and environment, and the cost to society for public health and environmental damage is much higher than had previously been thought."
"The bans under the regulation and the criteria for storage will also be a clear message to the world outside the EU."
"We are taking responsibility for this damage."
"Crucial to environmental legislation is the notion that the means selected are not only environmentally effective, but also socially sustainable."
"Environmental considerations mean the export ban on mercury should take effect quickly, as Mr Papadimoulis rightly says."
"We cannot, however, rush, in the light of other realities."
"The danger is, actually, that a solution made over here creates a set of new problems over there."
"The export ban in the Community should take effect at a time which is in harmony with other international measures on restrictions being sought."
"As it may still take several years to reach international agreement, it seems right to support the Commission in the scheduling of the export ban."
"The export of mercury, according to that, would be banned as from 1 July 2011."
"This has had the support of virtually every Member State."
"The same goes for the proposal to include mercury compounds in the export ban."
"We can ask the Commission for a proposal to extend its scope, when we know enough about its wide-ranging effects."
"It is at present unnecessary to force a move."
"Let us continue with the policy we have chosen and solve one problem at a time relating to mercury."
"Mr President, mercury is not only a metal but also an ancient part of our culture and civilisation."
"People have always admired it and believed in its magic powers."
"For many centuries, mercury had a crucial role in alchemy and the secret sciences."
"Mercury, the only liquid metal, is a beautiful material, and one can admire it as a unique piece of nature."
"However, according to new information, mercury is also a dangerous material and we should protect ourselves and future generations against its toxic effects."
"The workers in the traditional mercury mines, mostly in Spain, lead a hard and honest life but know that their former profession is over."
"We should respect the miners' traditions, but the need for a ban must be understood."
"The European Union has already banned the use of mercury and materials containing mercury on its territory."
"Now we want to ban the export of mercury as well."
"We do so because we also care about the health of other countries and continents."
"Hopefully, our decision will encourage other countries to reduce their use of mercury as well."
"As the shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group, I had consultations with our Spanish colleagues in the spirit of solidarity."
"Their understanding was crucial for me."
"My other guideline was Parliament's resolution of March 2006."
"Our decision should balance environmental concerns and the interests of the industry."
"As far as the date of the ban is concerned, different proposals were tabled: 2011 by the Commission, 2009 by the rapporteur and 2008 by the NGOs."
"I decided to suggest 1 December 2010 as an acceptable compromise, in accordance with Parliament's resolution of last year."
"Other dates and deadlines should correspond with this basic date."
"If we voluntarily ban the export of mercury, it is more than logical to ban its import as well."
"As far as storage is concerned, there were different proposals: Almad√©n by Spain, a salt mine by Germany and solidification by others."
"As we have not yet settled on a solution, we should not support amendments excluding specific potential solutions."
"We should support our Spanish Socialist colleagues' proposal calling for compensation for Almad√©n, the largest European mercury mine."
"The scope of the ban should cover every material with a mercury concentration of 5% or more."
"We have to close loopholes, as it is very cheap to convert mercury into calomel."
"It is very important to each of us to aid agreement by means of a simplified compromise package, otherwise we will run into chaos and, most probably, there will be no regulation before the next Parliamentary elections."
"As shadow rapporteur, I worked for a compromise."
"A good compromise serves our citizens better than postponed debates that do not lead to any kind of regulation."
"(DE) Mr President, mercury must be banned comprehensively and quickly."
"It is nothing short of cynical to take hazardous products out of circulation here but continue to permit their export to other countries."
"We know that mercury spreads worldwide via water and air."
"Ultimately, the mercury would also end up and harm people here."
"It is nothing short of absurd for us to issue warnings, as the Commission has done, that pregnant women and children should eat no more than 100 grams of tuna per week since it is so contaminated with mercury."
"We know - and a study published in The Lancet has demonstrated this once more - that heavy metals cause damage to the nervous system and also lasting, irreparable brain damage, particularly in children."
"It must be our primary objective to enforce this export ban, therefore, as we would lose credibility in the eyes of the international community if we were to say: we want to protect ourselves, but exports are allowed."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, mercury is everywhere: for example, it crosses the placental barrier."
"Mercury is a metal that is liquid at room temperature and readily evaporates."
"The limit value for metallic, inorganic mercury in blood is 25 micrograms, and that for organic mercury compounds is 100 micrograms. I shall not go into the effects of mercury poisoning here."
"I am sure you are all familiar with Minamoto in Japan."
"The issue here is not only the economic pros and cons for our Community, therefore, but also the protection of the health of our fellow citizens and the protection of an intact environment."
"The report by Mr Papadimoulis, whom I thank for this work, will mean that there is an end to the export of mercury compounds from Europe and that the EU starts work on the safe storage of the existing material."
"At the same time, it makes sense for all mercury compounds to be covered by the export ban where a substitute is available, which is the case for almost all uses."
"In addition, as far as we know, we as exporters of a hazardous substance are not able - and, pursuant to our WTO commitments, not entitled - to demand that the recipients make the mercury traceable, which means that the whereabouts of the mercury are unclear and that there is a very definite possibility that it could return to the Community."
"I consider Article 175 of the common treaties applicable to this Regulation."
"The tightening of the rules, the shortening of the deadlines and the inclusion of mercury compounds in the export and import provisions are both appropriate and toxicologically consistent."
"I am sure there is still room for negotiation to reach agreement on the deadlines."
"With regard to the final storage of mercury, attention is being paid to research, as it has not proved possible thus far to find a reliable storage method for this in use on an industrial scale anywhere in the world."
"The quantities involved run into the thousands of tonnes."
"I endorse the report in the original version presented by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"(SV) I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Papadimoulis, for his excellent work."
"Last autumn I took part in a study in which a sample of my hair was taken and investigated for its mercury content."
"Amazingly enough, I in actual fact had a relatively high quantity of mercury in my body, a state of affairs that is extremely worrying."
"I am pregnant and have high mercury levels which are now in danger of harming the child I am carrying and which may lead to the child having difficulty concentrating as an adult."
"The high mercury levels are also worrying because I come from a country that has come a very long way when it comes to abolishing mercury."
"We no longer use thermometers containing mercury, and amalgam is generally not used for repairing our teeth."
"Nonetheless, I have high mercury levels in my body."
"There are alternatives to mercury."
"In view of the serious health effects of mercury, we could phase it out, and not only here in Europe but also globally."
"This very evening, we are concerned with imposing an export ban and finding ways of storing used mercury safely, so ensuring that we do not contribute to spreading mercury around the world."
"So that the export ban cannot be circumvented, my efforts have been directed at ensuring that it enters into force as quickly as possible and that it is extended to include other mercury products."
"They have also been directed towards our not today committing ourselves irrevocably to any particular form of terminal storage, because we do not in actual fact know at present what is the optimum technology for terminal storage."
"In the present situation, mercury should, then, be stored in safe but temporary stores."
"I particularly hope that, in the future, it will be possible for all women throughout the world to eat fish from the water close to them, without being in danger of damaging their children's development."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, this is a battle that should have all of us rallying to the flag."
"It is a matter of public health and even of public safety."
"We know the dangers, the ravages of mercury on the health of those who come into contact with it."
"Since the start of the industrial age, the problems have only worsened to assume alarming proportions."
"Since Minamata and the chain of horrors emanating from that disastrous saga of industrial pollution, we have been even more clearly aware that mercury is dreadfully dangerous."
"Nevertheless, we have carried on regardless, almost as if nothing had ever happened."
"Throughout the intervening period, the God Mercury has continued to exact a heavy tribute from native populations in gold-washing areas, such as French Guyana, and the same applies to those on the other side of the globe who, in unimaginable conditions, recycle our industrial, electronic and other waste, not to mention the workers in Europe who operate in battery-recycling plants."
"Yes, it is high time we got rid of this poison, and the only solution is a pure and simple ban here in Europe and throughout the rest of the world, because this poison is everywhere, even in the organs of polar bears, for example, which live where it is neither produced nor used."
"I regret that my group's proposals for a more rapid prohibition were not adopted and that underground storage was not rejected."
"Be that as it may, this is no longer the time for regrets but for securing the largest possible majority in support of a definitive ban on this dangerous metal."
"(ES) Mr President, this proposal for a Regulation proposes banning exports of metallic mercury from 1 July 2011 at the latest, and in parallel includes provisions on the safe storage of the surpluses of mercury that are going to be produced above all as a result of the withdrawal of mercury cells from chlor-alkali factories; it is calculated that, throughout Europe, these cells contain approximately 12 000 tonnes of mercury."
"Bringing forward the time limit for the ban on metallic mercury exports goes against the consensus achieved both by Parliament when we debated the Community strategy on mercury and by the agreement that the Commission has signed with Euro Chlor, the European Federation of Chlor-Alkali Producers."
"The latter has accepted putting an end to mercury exports from 1 July 2011, and I believe that these agreements must be respected and under no circumstances must the date for banning mercury exports be brought forward."
"The surpluses from the chlor-alkali industry must be stored, because that storage is necessary."
"The resolution on the Community strategy on mercury, approved in March 2006, states that 'consideration should be given to the possibility of using Almad√©n for the safe storage of the existing metallic mercury stocks or metallic mercury sub-produced by industry all over Europe but not mercury-containing articles that have become waste, thus making use of the infrastructures, local manpower and technological expertise existing there'."
"I would also like to point out that the text of the Community strategy clearly acknowledges the historic importance of mercury to Almad√©n and the need for it to be compensated for all of this."
"I would like to end by saying that I am against the amendments that propose that only solid, rather than liquid, mercury should be stored."
"Given the current state of research, we are not in a position to solidify mercury, and liquid mercury will therefore have to be stored."
"Furthermore, it can be stored very safely, without creating any vapour, the vapour being the pollutant."
"Mr President, let me now turn to some of the key amendments in detail."
"Amendments 1, 7, 8, 9, 20, 21, 22 and 44 imply a significant extension of the scope of the proposal through the introduction of an export ban for cinnabar ore, calomel, mercury compounds and some mercury-containing products, as well as through the addition of an import ban."
"The Commission considers these amendments to be either unnecessary or not sufficiently justified."
"In the absence of mercury mining activities in the Community, there is no need for an export ban on cinnabar ore."
"In a similar way, the Community has been a massive exporter of mercury, but not an importer."
"The impact assessment concluded that secondary sources of mercury - recycling and recovery - will cover the remaining demand within the Community."
"As mercury compounds and mercury-containing products are concerned, we would need a much more developed information base to justify such an extension. For the time being, it is not possible to estimate in a reliable way the possible impact of such a measure on industry and society, within the Community as well as in third countries."
"Using legislation to prevent a hypothetical problem would not be considered good practice in terms of better regulation."
"Several amendments - numbers 12, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 45 - exclude the long-term storage or final disposal of metallic mercury, allowing for temporary storage only."
"It is worth noting that no environmentally and economically sound solution for the stabilisation of mercury prior to its disposal exists at present."
"Amendments 6, 24 and 36 imply that preference should be given to the former mining site of Almad√©n for the storage of mercury."
"The Commission is well aware of the economic and social implications of the mine closure and the end of trading activities on the site. It does not, however, want to prescribe a single storage site to economic operators."
"Amendments 8, 10, 13, 30 and 32 increase the administrative burden for industry, as well as for Member States and the Commission."
"The Commission has strong doubts about the potential effectiveness and benefits of these very detailed requirements as compared to their costs."
"As regards the legal basis referred to in Amendment 2, the Commission proposal follows the line given by the European Court of Justice in its judgments in cases C-94/03 and C-178/03 concerning the Rotterdam Convention on prior informed consent for imports of chemicals."
"Our proposal is very similar in character, as it proposes trade-related measures as an environmental policy instrument."
"We cannot, therefore, support the amendment to the legal basis."
"Amendments 17 and 34 calling for the introduction of an article on penalties are, however, acceptable to the Commission."
"In summary, the Commission can support eight of the proposed 50 amendments fully, in part, or in principle."
"I shall give Parliament's secretariat a list detailing the Commission's position on the amendments."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 noon."
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - It is clear that mercury is a substance that needs to be dealt with in a cautious and secure manner."
"This report deals with the important broad issue of handling mercury in import, export and the storage of the substance, while giving a timeline for export and import bans."
"I support the Commission's proposals for regulation on this issue and believe, broadly-speaking, that it is a good thing."
"I would like to echo the Commission's comment that this report follows the Mercury Strategy which was passed in March of last year, and want to encourage the Commission in its ongoing work on the Mercury Strategy."
"This is only one report of many that will deal with other issues such as the use of small amounts of mercury in the dental industry."
"I am sure work on other strategic issues is ongoing."

"Improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro area - Adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - Adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"the Council and Commission statements on improving the method for consulting Parliament in procedures relating to enlargement of the euro area,"
"the report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0151/2007 -, and"
"the report by Werner Langen, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a Council decision in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008 - C6-0150/2007 -."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as we begin this debate, which is about procedural issues, we should firstly not forget the pleasing conclusions of the Convergence Reports published by the Commission and the European Central Bank on Cyprus and Malta."
"The Presidency is delighted that the Commission was able to establish that Cyprus and Malta have reached a high level of durable convergence and that, on this basis, it has been able to table proposals for the euro to be introduced in these two countries."
"At the meeting of the Economic and Financial Council on 5 June 2007, ministers endorsed the Commission's assessment that Cyprus and Malta meet the conditions for the euro to be introduced."
"The Presidency would therefore be very glad if Cyprus and Malta's success were not overshadowed by procedural issues and if the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council could reach an amicable solution."
"It is in all of our interests to avoid delaying or creating any uncertainty about the technical and legal preparations that Cyprus and Malta need to make for the introduction of the euro."
"I should particularly like to thank the European Parliament for its willingness to cooperate."
"The Presidency has sympathy for the European Parliament's concerns and understands why it wants to have more time to examine the Convergence Reports and the Commission's proposals for Council decisions on the introduction of the euro."
"However, the Council and the Presidency are bound by the procedure laid down in the EC Treaty."
"The timetable is essentially determined by the rules laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact, including the Maastricht reporting regulation."
"The Council's obligation to consult the European Parliament on proposals for the euro to be introduced in Member States is laid down in Article 122(2) of the EC Treaty."
"The Presidency believes that the Council has respected this provision of the EC Treaty in the cases of Cyprus and Malta."
"The Council received both Commission proposals for Council decisions on 21 and 22 May 2007, each in three language versions."
"The remaining language versions were transmitted to the Council in the course of the subsequent two weeks."
"On 25 May the Council consulted the European Parliament on the two Commission proposals."
"In its request for consultation, the Council referred to the fact that it would be helpful if the European Parliament could adopt its opinions on the Commission proposals at its plenary session from 18 to 21 June."
"These opinions could then be made available to the Council, meeting at the level of Heads of State or Government, on 21 June 2007."
"Although it is not a legal requirement, the Presidency would be pleased if the discussion of the Heads of State or Government could also take into account the European Parliament's position."
"In any case, the Council cannot adopt its two decisions on the introduction of the euro until the European Parliament's opinions have been provided."
"In principle, the Presidency supports the proposals made by President Barroso in his letter of 13 June 2007 in response to President P√∂ttering's letter."
"The Presidency believes - as the Council President, Mrs Angela Merkel, explained in a letter to the President of the European Parliament on 19 June - that this matter primarily concerns the Commission and the European Parliament."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking this Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the speed with which they have examined the convergence reports on Cyprus and Malta approved on 16 May by the European Commission and by the European Central Bank."
"Tomorrow in Brussels, the European Council will debate the enlargement of the euro zone to these two countries and we all trust that on 10 July, following the positive agreement of the European Council tomorrow, Ecofin will take the final legal decision to enlarge the euro zone to these two countries."
"Both this Parliament and the Ecofin Council of 5 June agree with the analysis of the Commission and the Central Bank with regard to Cyprus and Malta's compliance with the convergence criteria laid down in the Treaty."
"At the meeting held with the coordinators of Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 7 June, I had the opportunity to explain to you that we in the Commission have been provided with full and reliable information on these two countries for the purposes of drawing up the convergence reports."
"There is confusion in certain documents accompanying the draft resolution between data relating to the quarterly financial accounts and the data that is notified twice a year by the countries under the excessive deficit procedure, data relating to deficit and to debt."
"I must say once again to this plenary of Parliament that, with regard to the information necessary in order to take decisions on excessive deficit procedures, the Commission has no reservations in terms of the quality of the data provided by Malta and Cyprus. No reservations of any kind."
"With regard to Malta, the Commission issued an opinion on the criterion on the sustainability of public finances, conditional upon the Ecofin Council's approval of the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure which had been opened up for this country in 2004 and the Ecofin of 5 June has confirmed this point, bringing an end to the excessive deficit procedure with regard to Malta."
"There are also precedents with regard to an approval in the convergence report conditional upon fulfilling conditions, either in terms of the stability of the exchange rate or the declaration of excessive deficit."
"With regard to Malta's compliance with this criterion, therefore, there is no kind of particular situation or exception."
"The general procedure applied has been the one applied in many other previous cases to many other countries."
"Over the coming weeks and once the Council's positive decision has been confirmed with regard to the enlargement of the euro zone to Cyprus and Malta, the Commission will issue the two reports on each country's state of preparedness for joining the euro."
"I am also aware of certain honourable Members' concerns in this regard."
"That report on the degree of preparedness for the change of notes and coins is not the same as the convergence reports."
"It is not a convergence criterion and the Commission regularly publishes, as we will do over the coming weeks, reports and communications focussing on this issue."
"Under these circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, we are able to predict that on 1 January 2008 the euro zone will have fifteen Member States with the accession of Cyprus and Malta."
"This is an extremely positive step for those two countries, for the euro zone and for the whole of the European Union."
"The euro is undoubtedly one of the greatest achievements of European integration and the greater the number of citizens enjoying its advantages, the more the Union's capacity to offer all of its citizens greater guarantees of prosperity and social wellbeing will be recognised."
"Ladies and gentlemen, with this debate on Cyprus and Malta's request to join the euro zone, this is the fourth time that the European institutions have given their opinion on the membership of the zone."
"The first of them took place in 1998 and it was aimed at identifying which countries would initially make up the euro zone on 1 January 1999."
"On that occasion it was decided that eleven Member States would join the zone."
"Two years later, in 2000, Greece's request was analysed and it was agreed that Greece could join the euro zone from 1 January 2001."
"Last year, all of the European institutions debated and agreed that Slovenia would join the euro zone on 1 January 2007."
"Finally, we have this request from Cyprus and Malta, which I hope will be definitively approved by the European Council and Ecofin on 10 July."
"In no way can it be said, therefore, that the euro zone is a closed club, as has sometimes been claimed."
"It is a club that is entirely open to all members that wish to join it and which are prepared and fulfil the conditions for reaching that stage."
"Following these four procedures for setting up and enlarging the euro zone, from next year it will have fifteen Member States, another two have an opt-out clause (the United Kingdom and Denmark) and a further ten Member States do not yet belong to the zone and I hope that they will join over the next few years."
"Without making any prediction as to when all of the conditions for joining the euro zone may be met, I believe that over the next few years, practically every year we European institutions are going to have to give our opinion on new memberships of the zone in accordance with the Treaty, which declares the euro the official currency of the Member States of the Union."
"In Articles 121 and 122 the Treaty also stipulates which criteria determine whether a Member State meets the conditions for adopting the single currency and establishes the procedure to be followed by the European institutions."
"With regard to the motion for a resolution that the honourable Members have prepared on these procedures for consulting Parliament with a view to the enlargement of the zone, I would like to refer to this aspect in the second part of my speech."
"According to the Treaty, the procedure must involve five actors: the Commission, the European Central Bank, Parliament, the European Council and the Ecofin Council."
"However, the Treaty does not contain any specific provision regarding the time limits for each of the institutions to issue their opinion."
"On the four occasions on which we have given our opinion, a similar timetable has been followed: firstly, the request for entry into the zone by the Member State or States, which is usually presented at the beginning of the year prior to the year in which they wish to join the euro zone; secondly, the Commission and the European Central Bank's assessment of whether or not the conditions are met, which is carried out in spring; thirdly, the Council's definitive decision, which takes account of the opinion of Parliament and the debate in the European Council, which normally takes place in the middle of the year prior to the introduction; and finally the adoption of the euro by the Member State or States on 1 January of the following year."
"There are a series of determining factors in these steps, and I would like to refer to them because they affect all of the institutions."
"Firstly, why is the euro introduced on 1 January?"
"In view of the enormous legal, economic, fiscal, accounting and practical implications of changing currency it would be extremely unwise to consider a date other than 1 January to adopt the euro and I believe that there is general agreement amongst everybody on that."
"Secondly, the Member State should be allowed a period of time to carry out the preparations for joining the euro in an orderly and effective manner and, on the basis of our experience of previous enlargements, we can state that, in the interest of the citizens of the country in question, who would suffer most from the consequences of a badly-prepared adoption of the euro, it is desirable for the process of decision-making by the European institutions to be completed several months in advance of the 1 January on which notes and coins are introduced and the irrevocable exchange rate in the country joining the euro takes effect."
"These are the determining factors in practice and neither of them are in the hands of the Commission, of course."
"What does fall to the Commission, however, in cooperation with the European Central Bank, is the adoption of the convergence report on whether or not the criteria have been fulfilled."
"The date on which the Commission must adopt the convergence report is determined, firstly, by when the Member State presents its request - the Commission cannot decide when a Member State is to present that request - and, secondly, by when the Commission has the reliable and rigorous data that it needs in order to carry out an appropriate, rigorous and accurate assessment of whether or not the convergence criteria have been fulfilled."
"The date of the Commission's convergence report therefore depends, on the one hand, on when the Member State presents the request and, on the other, on when the Commission can be provided with the appropriate, rigorous and accurate data required in order to carry out the assessment."
"In 1998 and 2000, the Commission generally adopted the convergence reports at the beginning of May."
"In 2006 and 2007, the approval took place in the middle of May because, since 2005, the time limit for the Member States to communicate the data on their budgetary situation has been put back by a month, from 1 March to 1 April."
"This has been done in order to acquire accurate and rigorous information on the budgetary execution for the previous year of the Member State applying to join the euro zone."
"Experience indicated that the notifications of 1 March did not include all of the accurate data required in order to provide a sufficient picture of how the previous budgetary year had been concluded."
"Under these circumstances, if we bear in mind that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the exchange rate stability criterion on 2 May of this year, the Commission has had two weeks, as happened last year in the case of Slovenia, to draw up and adopt the convergence reports."
"The point I wish to make through this perhaps overly detailed explanation, is that all of the institutions have tight deadlines within which to take decisions in this procedure."
"The time limit available to Parliament is determined, on the one hand, by the approval of the convergence report by the Commission and the Central Bank, but also, on the other, by the dates decided upon by the Council for its decision-making procedure, both in the European Council and in the meeting of the Ecofin Council, and that is clearly not in the hands of the Commission."
"In any event, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, has written a letter to President Poettering indicating that the Commission is willing to explore ways for each institution to be able to exercise the competences assigned to it by the Treaty in the best possible way within this procedure, and the Commission and I personally would like to say to you once again, in response to this Parliament's motion for a resolution, that we are willing to seek an agreement amongst the three institutions on a procedure that will improve the way in which we work, in view of the objective limitations we face when making decisions in this area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is perfectly aware, and all of you should be aware, that the Commission and myself are of course entirely at your service when it comes to providing any information available before these time periods elapse - with regard to the economic situation of the candidate countries and the degree of compliance with the convergence criteria - even before the Member States present their requests."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, Minister of State, Commissioner, before I turn to Malta, Cyprus and the procedure, I should like with your permission to make a few preliminary remarks about the euro."
"There is no doubt that the euro is a very successful project."
"It is stable internally and externally."
"We should not forget this in today's debate."
"Internally, we have low inflation rates; externally, the euro has become the second most important currency in the world and is very stable against the dollar."
"None of this has happened by accident. It is the result of a construction in which the Member States and the Commission bear the main responsibility: the Maastricht criteria in the Stability and Growth Pact - which has of course already been watered down under Commissioner Almunia's leadership - the deficit procedure, the clear statistical data and the independence of the European Central Bank."
"Only if all of these factors coincide will the euro remain a stable currency in the long term."
"I am saying this as a preliminary remark, because I still need to address the procedure."
"Of course the Treaty is clear, but the Treaty also states that the European Parliament has to be listened to."
"Commissioner, I will be quite frank: we will not allow our role to be reduced to that of an optional extra!"
"The Commission - so I have just heard - has done everything to the letter, and Parliament has to create its own window."
"If that is the case - and that is what we say in the motion - then, should an interinstitutional agreement not be concluded containing the points that we will subsequently be adopting by a large majority, next time we will break off our consultations, as we also do for agriculture policy."
"We will not adopt these opinions as quickly as we have been asked to do so now for the third time."
"Let me make it quite clear: Parliament will not be treated as an optional extra, not by anyone!"
"I will now turn to Cyprus and Malta."
"I am glad that we can support an enlargement from 13 to 15 participating countries."
"In February, Malta and Cyprus requested a Convergence Report pursuant to Article 121 with the aim of obtaining membership."
"Examination of the data available - the Commissioner has described the undeniable problems in this respect - tells us the following: Cyprus has participated in ERM II for a long time; as of 5 May it meets the requirements in respect of long-term interest rates; per-capita GDP is good, at 85% of the EU average, and its economy shows substantial convergence."
"Nevertheless, it had a problem with the data, and specifically with the quarterly financial accounts."
"This was also discussed on 3 May."
"We should also examine the clarity of the data from the point of view of the Commission's responsibility."
"It is not enough for the Commission to say that we are dependent on the data and that the Member States have to supply it."
"The Commission is also responsible for these data being correct."
"We saw this in the case of Greece, where the Commission did not carry out a sufficiently thorough examination and six months' later we had a nasty surprise."
"Cyprus meets the conditions and Cyprus - and it had been criticised on this score - has also brought its Central Bank law into line, although it only did so some time after requesting the Convergence Report, namely on 15 March, that is over a month later."
"However, the law has now been amended, inflation is low, and although government debt is still over 60% it is heading in the right direction."
"We can therefore say today that we unreservedly support Cyprus's accession to the euro zone."
"I am sure that the European Parliament will do so."
"In Malta's case the picture is similar, but with one exception."
"We support Malta's accession."
"On Monday, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted in favour of the accession of both States by a large majority, almost unanimously - for Malta with 39 votes in favour and for Cyprus with 38 votes in favour and one abstention."
"With Malta, however, we had the problem that at the time that the Convergence Report was tabled the deficit procedure had not yet been closed."
"The Commission therefore tabled a Convergence Report that did not comply with Article 2 of the Protocol on the Convergence Criteria."
"This states that at the time of the examination the deficit procedure must be closed."
"That is a fact."
"We accepted the report nonetheless, but the Commission should not say here that it has done everything to the letter and that it is just this interfering Parliament that is disrupting its consultations with the Council."
"Turning finally to our motion for a resolution, we have received the reports and letters from the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and Angela Merkel."
"Mrs Merkel has a difficult procedure to complete, as she has to listen to all 26 other Member States."
"Mr Barroso only needs one Commission decision."
"I agree that we should take a decision, despite the fact that many of our requests have not been met, but that is why we are now calling for an interinstitutional agreement."
"In this agreement, which should be adopted by the end of 2007, we call on the Council and the Commission to be more accommodating on the timing."
"Otherwise next time round - and it will probably be Slovakia - we will insist on our right to a period of at least two months for consultation."
"Next time we will not tolerate the schedule that we have gone along with now for the third time."
"With this in mind we welcome the fact that Cyprus and Malta can become Members, but we demand reasonable consultation conditions from the Commission and the Council for the European Parliament."
"on behalf of PPE-DE. - (MT) Mr President, I cannot begin without first expressing my appreciation towards the Maltese and Gozitan population for the great strides they have managed to take in these three years since Malta became a member of the European Union."
"These were three difficult years that presented numerous challenges."
"In these three years the Maltese have shown themselves capable of adjusting to the future."
"It has been an extremely interesting time for my country, and I can say outright that the results have begun to show."
"The introduction of the euro this January confirms this."
"Malta has clearly shown itself capable of fulfilling all the necessary criteria so as to ensure that this important transition occurs smoothly."
"This transition will strengthen the country's economy and, in turn, competitiveness."
"Change is never easy."
"However, I believe that Malta is fully prepared to face up to this new challenge in January."
"We must keep in mind that Malta was given a restricted time period in which to conform to, and adopt, the measures required for this changeover to take place."
"In less than three years, Malta has reduced its inflation rate to 2.2%, and the ratio of national debt compared to the Gross Domestic Product is decreasing towards the reference rate of 60%."
"There has been a sustainable reduction in the budget deficit, which now stands at less than 3%, and one must also consider the fact that, as from Malta's entry into the ERM2 programme, the Maltese lira did not undergo any devaluation and at no point was there ever an air of uncertainty in the country."
"As Commissioner Almunia said, Malta has achieved a high level of sustainability and convergence."
"Malta and the Maltese are used to facing and overcoming their challenges, challenges that, in the past, were far from small and that nonetheless led to a string of successes throughout history."
"This is an historical moment for the European Union because it will lead to a larger eurozone, one that incorporates more countries and more people."
"It is also an historical moment for Malta because it will contribute to the further integration of its citizens with the European Union."
"I would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work in this area, which proved to be very useful."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, first of all, I would like to say that I welcome the fact that, on 1 January 2008, the eurozone will have two new members, namely Cyprus and Malta."
"Both countries have fulfilled the convergence criteria stipulated in the Treaty."
"I would like to warmly congratulate our Cypriot and Maltese colleagues."
"Expanding the eurozone is an important process which fosters deeper integration in the European Union."
"This process also has a positive effect on candidate countries and the eurozone's economic position."
"Countries preparing to join the eurozone are developing at a much faster rate than those in the zone."
"Their macroeconomic situation is also better, especially in terms of public debt and budget deficits."
"The new members will strengthen the whole zone and the single currency."
"At the same time, I would also like to state that I do not welcome the fact that a great deal of time pressure is being placed on Parliament in its work to assess these new countries' eurozone membership."
"Our current work schedule does not allow Parliament to properly prepare an opinion."
"This is why the resolution which I hope we will adopt today, aims to initiate a debate on an interinstitutional agreement which will, in the future, facilitate the efficient and effective analysis of convergence reports."
"I welcome the open and constructive position that President Barroso and Commissioner Almunia have just declared, on behalf of the Commission."
"Minister Gloser, I hope that the Council's position will also be constructive."
"I am counting on the creation of an efficient mechanism for a problem-free expansion of the eurozone in the future."
"In the debate on the expansion of the eurozone, it should be stressed that certain compulsory Maastricht convergence criteria do not apply to the current situation."
"This is particularly the case for inflation."
"First of all, it does not seem appropriate for the eurozone membership criteria to be defined according to the average inflation rate in countries which do not belong to the eurozone."
"Secondly, the current criterion does not take into consideration the fact that rapid economic growth in the new Member States naturally translates into a higher inflation rate, which is by no means a sign of economic weakness."
"In fact, quite the opposite is the case."
"It reflects the fact that the new Member States are catching up with the developed economies of the old Union."
"Thirdly, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the definition of stability applied by the Commission and the European Central Bank in convergence reports is different to the definition of price stability used by the European Central Bank in the field of monetary policy."
"Meanwhile, the Treaty text only contains one definition of price stability and we cannot have two different interpretations of this term."
"The inflation criteria currently means that some of the new Member States may not be able to join the eurozone for many years."
"This permanently divides the Member States into two categories, namely the eurozone countries and those which remain outside the eurozone."
"This situation threatens the cohesion of the Union and is at odds with the spirit of the Treaty."
"The convergence criteria were drawn up 16 years ago, in entirely different circumstances."
"They should be adapted to the current situation."
"I appeal for an in-depth debate on this subject."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Mr Langen, the rapporteur, for the excellent work he has achieved despite the short length of time available."
"In fact, on 16 May 2007 the Commission adopted its convergence report on the criteria for Malta and Cyprus to join the single currency and on 25 May the European Parliament was invited to express its view on the proposal for a Council decision on the adoption by Cyprus and Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008."
"Because of the short time available Parliament was not able to make a thorough assessment of the situation of these countries and the reports put forward by the Commission."
"I would nonetheless express a favourable opinion on the adoption by Cyprus and Malta of the single currency, since the convergence criteria have been met."
"In fact, with regard to Malta, in the last 12 months the inflation rate has been 2.2%, which is less than the reference value of 3%."
"The excessive deficit has been corrected through a sustained reduction in the budget deficit under the threshold of 3% of GDP and the debt rate is falling, coming close to the reference value of 60% of GDP."
"Until March 2007 Malta's average long-term interest rate was at 4.3%, which is below the reference value of 6.4%."
"The Maltese economy is highly integrated into the European Union and the balance of payments deficit fell to 6.3% in 2006, partly thanks to direct foreign investments."
"With regard to Cyprus, in the last 12 months the inflation rate has been 2%, which is lower than the reference value of 3%."
"For 2007 the forecasts made by the Commission in spring this year are for an unchanged deficit of 1.4% of GDP."
"Since its entry into ERM II, the European exchange rate mechanism, the Cypriot pound has been exchanged in a stable manner at a satisfactory exchange rate."
"In the last 12 months the average long-term interest rate has been 4.2%, which is below the reference value of 6.4%."
"The Cypriot economy is highly integrated into the European Union's economy. The Commission considers that economic integration has been achieved, despite the increase in the balance of payments deficit."
"In order to avoid problems arising again in the future on procedural timetables, it is necessary to improve the method for consulting the European Parliament, by setting up interinstitutional cooperation between Parliament and the Commission."
"This will make it possible to have the time necessary to make a proper assessment of the proposals by the Commission and the European Central Bank."
"On this point, I believe that the exchange of views with Commissioner Almunia and the reply by Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, to the letter sent to him by Mr P√∂ttering, President of Parliament, were fairly positive."
"The Commission ought to notify Parliament very early of all requests for convergence reports submitted by the Member States and should decide together with Parliament and the Council on the timetable for the procedure."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, by taking the floor in the debate on expanding the eurozone to include Cyprus and Malta, I would like to draw your attention to the following issues."
"First of all, the Commission is once again reminding us of the need for the new Member States to meet all the Maastricht criteria before joining the eurozone."
"At the same time, it is turning a blind eye to the fact that, when the euro was introduced, many of the old Member States did not meet these criteria."
"Secondly, despite the revision of the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission has remained lenient towards the biggest Member States in terms of their adherence to the Maastricht criteria."
"In the past, the Commission has tolerated, and appears to still tolerate, significant budget deficits and a level of public debt in particular, which often exceeds 60% of GDP."
"Statistics confirm this."
"In 2006, public debt in the countries of the old European Union was as high as 63.3% of GDP and, in as many as half of the eurozone countries this debt exceeded 60% of GDP."
"Thirdly, the Commission's attitude towards countries wishing to join the eurozone varies greatly."
"Very recently, Lithuania's application to join the zone was rejected, in spite of the fact that it had met the Maastricht criteria, and its inflation rate barely exceeded 0.1% of the reference value."
"Therefore, the Commission's quick approval of Cyprus and Malta's membership of the eurozone might seem surprising in view of the fact that both countries' public debt clearly exceeds 60% of GDP."
"In 2006, Cyprus' public debt amounted to as much as 65.3% and Malta's debt stood at 66.5% of GDP."
"Moreover, both countries are finding it difficult to provide Eurostat with statistics pertaining to their financial situation."
"In spite of the doubts I have just expressed, I would still like to congratulate both Cyprus and Malta on joining the eurozone."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, both Malta and the Greek part of Cyprus meet the Maastricht criteria."
"It is therefore logical to enlarge the euro zone to include both countries."
"If it were up to me and my group, more Member States of the European Union would be welcome to join the euro zone, provided that they met the criteria."
"That can only be good for the European Union."
"This event is, however, tinged with sadness and I should like to explain why: unfortunately, in Cyprus an opportunity has been missed to involve both parts of Cyprus in the euro zone and to blaze the trail for a reunification of the island of Cyprus on the basis of a bicommunal and bizonal solution."
"That is very regrettable, because as a result the wall in Cyprus will be reinforced rather than weakened."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, economic experts seem to agree that the euro zone is enjoying a general economic upturn."
"They are even talking about a sustained rise in employment."
"It is my belief, however, that all too often it is only a rise in part-time employment - or the new forms of work, as they are euphemistically known - that has been recorded, which can hardly compensate for the full-time jobs that have been lost."
"Under these conditions the dwindling birth rate should come as no surprise."
"You cannot feed a family on a McJob!"
"Enthusing about an upturn is a slap in the face for every single one of the millions-strong army of jobless in the EU."
"It mocks all of those millions of people who are labelled as the working poor."
"We are facing a problem that should not be underestimated: the fact that existing differences within the euro zone are widening, for example the southern European countries are seeing a continual worsening of their competitive position."
"The fact that the euro is not a universal remedy is proved by the example of the United Kingdom alone."
"As we know, the British economy is in good shape, even without the euro."
"The United Kingdom has the sixth largest manufacturing sector in the world and the eighth largest services sector."
"For this reason alone, no EU Member States should, in my opinion, be forced to introduce the euro."
"Fears about, for example, handing over sovereignty to the European Central Bank should be treated just as seriously as the price rises feared by consumers."
"Many millions of citizens have in fact found the euro to have inflationary powers, since it has been a decisive factor in the increased price of everyday necessities."
"Neither official statistics showing the contrary nor image campaigns will do anything to change that."
"Any EU country that is considering introducing the euro should as a general rule, in my view, always let the sovereign power, that is the people, decide."
"(EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Langen, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for their positive report on the integration of my country, Cyprus, and of course of Malta into the eurozone."
"I also wish to thank Mr Almunia for the assistance he has given Cyprus all this time in achieving this objective."
"Despite the tight timeframe which the Commission allowed Parliament and despite the reactions voiced, Mr Langen has demonstrated a huge sense of responsibility, has circumvented procedural issues and, I repeat, has demonstrated his ability to get to the heart of the matter in his positive report."
"My thanks once again to Mr Langen."
"The European Parliament is today rewarding Cyprus's long-term efforts to put its economy in order and converge with the indicators of the European Union. The European Parliament is giving the third institutional green light to the adoption of the euro in Cyprus."
"The adoption of the euro in Cyprus will bring the euro to the Middle East and forge a monetary link between Europe and Arabia via Cyprus."
"The monetary area of the European Union will extend from Brussels to the far end of the Eastern Mediterranean."
"Cyprus has always had a strong economy; even during the difficult years after the military invasion and the occupation of the north of Cyprus by Turkey and the loss of its basic economic resources, it has managed to develop a strong economy."
"Thus, everything that needs to be done by 1 January 2008 on the part of Cyprus for full economy integration and convergence will have to be done and you can be sure that it will be done."
"As far as Eurostat's comment on the provision of imperfect data is concerned, Mr Almunia's clarification satisfies us."
"I trust that by 1 January 2008 the necessary basis will be in place for a proper resolution of the Cyprus problem and for Cyprus to reunite politically, socially and economically, so that the euro becomes the currency of all Cypriots, both Greek and Turkish alike."
"The European Union has an obligation to take an initiative in this direction."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, this is actually the fourth time that the European Parliament has been called upon to make a decision on the euro area, in its initial setting up or on the occasion of its enlargements."
"The issue of the euro is no small matter for our fellow citizens: it is, in their hands, one of the European Union's most valuable assets."
"Since last year, however, since the opening of the debate on the accession of Lithuania, we have had the impression that it has become a debate from which any political issue must be removed and where only purely technical arguments can be raised."
"In this debate, the European Parliament is asking to be able to come to a decision of this kind in the normal way."
"For that to happen, like any other institution, it needs time."
"That is the spirit of the letter that our President sent to the Presidents of the other two institutions."
"The answer we have received from the President of the Commission springs from a spirit of cooperation and conciliation, we appreciate that."
"On the Council's part, it is a work in progress."
"We need to go beyond that, Mr Gloser."
"We need you to show the same spirit of consultation and conciliation as the Commission, otherwise we shall find it difficult to carry on in this way."
"Beyond the technical arguments, I should not want the whole of the discussion to take place without at any time our raising the problems of governance of the euro area."
"What situation are we in today, after all, with two countries that have a permanent opt-out clause and countries that have to sign up and belong to this area, without at any time our questioning the governance of the area?"
"We are approaching the time when rotation of the authorities of the European Central Bank (ECB) takes place."
"It is a mechanism that we have criticised here, in this Parliament, and that, I think, we continue to criticise."
"We think also that the functioning of the Eurogroup is not quite satisfactory and that we must do even better."
"Tomorrow we shall have the accession of Slovakia and then after that, until 2012, our timetable will be noticeably lighter."
"Let us take advantage of this time to improve the governance of the euro area, otherwise our fellow citizens will no longer have confidence in their own currency, the geographical extent of which is being enlarged without first of all improving its functioning."
"With your permission, Mr President, I shall say a word finally about the inflation criterion."
"I know that this criterion was defined in 1992, at a time when Europe was very different from what it is now."
"If, however, we want to revise the Maastricht criteria on a strictly economic basis, independently of any political conditions which would allow this debate to be reopened, then there are other aspects of the Maastricht criteria that ought to be revised."
"Mr President, the eurozone is another important institution, bringing European nations closer to each other and further connecting our people's wellbeing and prospects in the common future of a united Europe."
"For this reason, the citizens I represent as a Cypriot MEP rejoice at the decision of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to approve the Commission's proposal to proceed with the adoption of the euro by Cyprus on 1 January 2008."
"I of course note with regret that paragraph 7b of the report's explanatory statement somewhat erroneously states that the Cypriot Government has infringed the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 501/2004 of 10 March 2004 on providing Eurostat with full information on quarterly accounts for general government."
"Yesterday, I wrote to the Cypriot Finance Minister and to the Commission on this subject."
"I welcome the speedy correction made by Commissioner Almunia, both to me in writing and here this morning."
"I wonder whether it would also be possible for a suitable correction and clarification to be made in the report, even at this late stage."
"I should appreciate the assistance of the rapporteur in doing this."
"Cyprus's adoption of the euro will, in addition to everything else, have two further beneficial effects."
"Firstly, it will bring Turkey closer to Europe as, on a practical level, the euro will replace the Turkish lira as the currency used in the Turkish-occupied northern part of Cyprus."
"Secondly, it will bring Europe closer to the United Kingdom, as the euro will be the currency used by the civilian population living in the two British colonies in Cyprus, Akrotiri and Dhekelia."
"In these areas, the pound - albeit the Cyprus pound, a colonial version of the mighty British pound - will be replaced by the euro."
"These colonies will be the first official British territory on which the euro will be the currency of general use."
"In the future, the euro may even gradually extend from the colonies to the British mainland, undoubtedly to the joy of all the British MEPs in this House, of whom, incidentally, I do not see many."
"In conclusion, I call on all my colleagues to support this report and I take this opportunity to extend an invitation to you all to visit Cyprus in 2008, to enjoy Cypriot hospitality and to spend your euros freely in the sun."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will confine my remarks today to the procedure and will not comment on the many other points that have been addressed."
"In terms of substance I can quite frankly echo Mr Langen's assessment of Malta and Cyprus and his comments on Parliament's approval."
"I will therefore concentrate on the procedure."
"Here I will simply take the words of the Minister of State, Mr Glosar, as my starting point."
"He said that we should not primarily consider the procedure."
"There was talk of sympathy, requests and considering. For the next procedure I should like to say: we will sympathetically consider Council and the Commission's requests to make our decisions quickly."
"Next time, however, we will also use the procedure that Parliament provides for such matters."
"We fully understand the Council's constraints with its meeting schedule."
"The Commission's constraints too, and the 1 January deadline: all of these things are well understood in Parliament."
"However, if there is no understanding the other way round, that we in Parliament also have a particular procedure and that we are now unable, and not for the first time, to observe one of the basic rules of that procedure properly, for example the translation deadlines, then next time round there will be consequences."
"We can therefore only press for an appropriate agreement to be adopted between the institutions."
"Otherwise the Council would have to see to it that Parliament were no longer consulted in the future."
"It has of course been mentioned that this is enshrined in the relevant Treaty, and if it is enshrined in the Treaty then it has to be respected."
"The German Foreign Office and all European foreign ministries have made repeated attempts to stop Parliament becoming too powerful."
"This, however, applies to other fields."
"Nevertheless, one area that is very important to me is data provision."
"That is why we in Parliament want to have sufficient time to deal with this."
"We have seen what happened with Greece and Hungary."
"We hold the Commission responsible for guaranteeing that the data on which the decision for an accession is based is also scrutinised as thoroughly as possible, so that we can assume that it is correct."
"I need only refer to the comments of the Hungarian Finance Minister, who, following what happened in Hungary, publicly philosophised about the various possibilities that are actually open to a finance minister when supplying data to Brussels."
"The ECB President, Mr Trichet, has also pointed out that collecting data in the European Union is problematic."
"For us it is crucial that the Commission does not pass the buck to Eurostat in such cases but that it takes responsibility itself."
"However, we should also like to strengthen the Commission vis-√†-vis the Member States."
"It is unacceptable that the Commission should have to comply with such requests when the Member States continue to use all of the means at their disposal to restrict the Commission's supervisory powers in areas where they really do need to be exercised."
"(MT) Thank you Mr President, today's vote is a significant one for Malta, because aside from the important and legitimate arguments that have been put forward regarding when would have been the best time to adopt the euro, there is, notwithstanding, a political consensus and a commitment to ensuring that the changeover happens on 1 January 2008."
"Once the European Commission has accepted the statistics and methodology put forward by the Maltese authorities, then these will be accepted by all European authorities when the same basis is used by successive governments."
"In the next few years, considerable work will have to be carried out on the sustainability of the public finances if the Maastricht criteria are to be complied with."
"As both the Commission and the European Central Bank have stated, the Maltese Government has, until now, resorted to the one-off sale of public assets, while continuing to add fiscal pressure, mainly on the workers and the middle class."
"This is not sustainable."
"The National Committee is doing a good job in preparing for the changeover to the euro, but more has to be done to directly involve consumer representatives in fighting the perception that the euro will lead to a higher cost of living."
"More basic information needs to be given, including information on interest rates."
"The 'FAIR' initiative, which allows individual businesses to enter into agreement on dual pricing, should be praised."
"However, currently little more than half of Maltese and Gozitan enterprises have taken part in this scheme."
"I strongly urge those other businesses that have not as yet joined this initiative to do so, without delay."
"Let us make a success of the changeover to the euro, although one must not be fooled into thinking that this will solve the country's economic problems."
"The solution to these is to be found within ourselves."
"In recent years, Malta's Gross Domestic Product has fallen from 78% to 71% of the European average."
"The progress registered in this period came mostly from large bank profits and government projects with direct expenditure."
"This kind of policy will become extremely limited in view of the convergence criteria."
"Meanwhile, the sectors that ought to be drivers of our economy, such as tourism and manufacturing, have gone downhill."
"This was clearly proven by the economic and social shock that hit our country yesterday, when 570 persons lost their job in one day, due to the closing down of the VF factory."
"This is why a national effort is needed that genuinely favours competition in these areas."
"Mr President, I also have to apologise to my Cypriot and Maltese colleagues for spoiling this historical moment of accession to the eurozone with this debate on our institutional problems with dealing with accession issues."
"However, it does not take anything away from our support for their adoption of the euro and for both Mr Langen's reports."
"We did not want to burden the accession of these two countries with the issue of the future procedure, but I hope that we can come to an agreement with the Commission and the Council today to ensure that, in future, there is a better procedure and a more serious opportunity for Parliament to give its opinion on this issue."
"That is why we have drawn up this non-legislative motion for a resolution on the procedure."
"We would like to be invited to meet with the other two institutions to produce an interinstitutional agreement on several issues, which are listed in our motion for a resolution."
"This text calls for a pre-announcement system, whereby those Member States wishing to accede notify us in advance so that we can begin studying the situation, and concerns the assessment of the quality of the statistics and data provided."
"My last point concerns the scheduling of the dates for the formal procedure."
"We recognise that everything has to take place in a very short period of time."
"However, if we are better prepared then we will have a better opportunity for serious discussion."
"The Commissioner said that he was willing to sit together with us to conclude an interinstitutional agreement of this kind."
"I would like to ask Mr Gloser to give us that commitment as well, on behalf of the Council, the German Presidency and future presidencies."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Cyprus and Malta's request that its degree of convergence be assessed was presented less than two years after it joined the exchange rate mechanism, on 2 May 2005, and the reports of the European Central Bank and the Commission have been presented according to the same pattern as the reports requested by Greece, Lithuania and Slovenia."
"Though it is always useful to improve the processes for enlarging the euro zone and improve the European Parliament's involvement, my central message is addressed to our fellow citizens from Cyprus and Malta, so that they may hear our view that Cyprus and Malta can join the euro zone and must be able to enjoy all the advantages of the monetary union from the beginning of next year."
"This enlargement of the euro zone will be a significant step in the process of European integration."
"For the first time since reunification, the majority of Member States of the European Union will be part of the euro zone."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my warm thanks to you, Mr Langen, for the two parts of your contribution as rapporteur."
"You recommended the entry of Malta and Cyprus into the eurozone in spite of the reservations about the time factor which you expressed in the second part of your remarks."
"It is important that we should be able to achieve this within the various time limits, as Commissioner Almunia said before."
"Both countries need a certain amount of time to prepare for this step so as to ensure that the people of Malta and Cyprus do not ultimately bear the brunt of an excessively long drawn-out preparation process."
"I would like to re-emphasise that the European Council indicated to the President of the European Parliament that a difficult situation obtained and that time might be too short."
"Let me also deal with the question of what is feasible, of what can still be done before particular official deadlines."
"The timetables have been laid down."
"We cannot deviate from them, because provisions of the EC Treaty are involved."
"The other question is to what extent, in the consultations between Ecofin and your committee, you are receiving the information you need in order to monitor the situation continuously and thus to be prepared."
"Another question concerns the extent to which you are being given advance copies of reports from the countries that have applied for membership."
"May I also say this in response to various questions that have been asked in the course of the debate here: on the one hand, many things are prescribed, but in areas where changes may be possible - and this was explained by Mrs Merkel in her letter to Mr Poettering and was also referred to by the President of the Commission - if we are to recognise these possibilities we must remain engaged in the discussion through appropriate proposals from the Commission."
"In all other respects, it is a matter of awaiting developments."
"I therefore hope you will appreciate that I cannot make any promises today on behalf of the Council in respect of this item."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, in this final speech in the debate I would like once again, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Commission, to congratulate Cyprus and Malta on the efforts they have made to bring us this far and on the efforts they are making to introduce the euro successfully, both for their economy and for their citizens."
"I believe that this demonstrates once again that the euro zone is not a closed club and that joining the euro is not just an obligation for the Member States, but an excellent opportunity for those who wish to share the single currency with 318 million other Europeans and for the countries that already belong to the Economic and Monetary Union."
"I therefore believe that it is a good decision to support the entry of Cyprus and Malta into the euro, as Mr Langen's report does."
"I would like to make two comments on compliance with the criteria."
"In his speech, Mr Langen called into question the way in which Cyprus and Malta fulfil the criteria or the way in which the Commission's convergence report has assessed the compliance with those criteria."
"I must say that the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure for Malta, which took place at the last Ecofin Council on the proposal of the Commission, is a necessary condition in order for Malta to fulfil the Maastricht criterion on this point and the Commission's convergence report of 16 May said that, if the Ecofin Council approved the abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure, Malta would comply."
"We have done that in order not to delay the convergence report, because if not we would have had to wait until 5 June in order to publish the convergence report and you would have had even less time to debate it."
"The assessment of compliance conditional upon definitive approval is therefore intended to help the work of Parliament and the Council, not to hinder it."
"So to the figures: Cyprus and Malta's deficit and debt figures notified within the context of the excessive deficit notification procedures that take place twice a year, on 1 April and 1 October, are as reliable - having been analysed by Eurostat, which published its opinion on 23 April - as those of the other Member States."
"Eurostat has no reservations regarding the deficit and debt figures notified."
"There is no foundation for calling into question the figures for Cyprus and Malta and not calling into question the figures for France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Sweden, Denmark or any other Member State."
"No foundation whatsoever."
"There are difficulties with other figures: there are difficulties with the quarterly financial account figures in the national accounts, with the unemployment figures at this time of the enquiry into the German workforce and with the French figures, but that is everyday statistical work, and if Parliament wants to give Eurostat more resources, they will be welcome."
"If Parliament wants to support the work of Eurostat, the honourable Members know that I, as the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, am always grateful for Parliament's support of the Commission and of Eurostat, but I do not wish there to be any doubt about the validity and the quality of the figures on the basis of which we are assessing whether Cyprus and Malta fulfil the convergence criteria."
"With regard to the procedures, I wish to address you directly, Mr Langen."
"The Commission is not marginalising Parliament or hindering its work in this debate in any way, and it has no desire or reason to do so."
"Quite the opposite, and I have expressed, and President Barroso has also done so in his letter, the Commission's and the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs' total willingness to work with you."
"I would like you to listen to me, Mr Langen, because I am telling you and I am repeating what the President of the Commission said in the letter to Mr Poettering and what I said on 7 June in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in your presence - we are entirely willing to share information with you and to forward any information available."
"But what you cannot ask of the Commission is that it take the view that a country has definitively fulfilled the deficit criterion when the Council has not yet abrogated the excessive deficit procedure."
"Next year, if Slovakia presents a request, we are going to have that problem again, because Slovakia is currently under an excessive deficit procedure that can only be abrogated - in the event that that abrogation is appropriate once the definitive figures for the 2007 budget have been validated by Eurostat."
"We are not therefore going to be able to anticipate, and nor is the Ecofin Council, the decisions on abrogation of the excessive deficit procedure for Slovakia before the time of year that Malta's excessive deficit procedure has been abrogated."
"We can anticipate the convergence report by saying that, if the Ecofin Council approves the derogation, Slovakia will fulfil the criterion."
"That is a hypothesis."
"We cannot say in February that Slovakia fulfils the deficit criterion, however, when the abrogation can only be approved in May or June of next year."
"Likewise, we cannot carry out a rigorous assessment - and you are right to demand that we carry out a rigorous assessment - of whether countries fulfil the Maastricht criteria, the convergence criteria, before we know the spring economic forecasts in May 2008, which cannot be approved or published beforehand by the Commission and its services, because if we anticipate the spring forecasts they will be winter forecasts and they will not provide a view of the economic situation and the economic data for the spring."
"I therefore wish to make it clear to this Parliament that next year's convergence report cannot be anticipated before May."
"The Commission, Parliament and the Council must therefore talk and agree on a way in which we can work rigorously, coherently and cooperatively in order to come to correct decisions that enable all of us to work rigorously and take decisions at the appropriate time so that the citizens of the next countries to join the 13 current members of the euro zone do not suffer the consequences of a belated decision and of a lack of preparation for the introduction of euro notes and coins."
"This is the Commission's attitude and conviction."
"There should be an agreement amongst the three institutions."
"That is desirable."
"It makes no sense that, for each enlargement of the euro zone, we should be discussing the procedures rather than the countries that are entering and the beneficial consequences for their citizens."
"We must resolve this problem, but we will only resolve it by maintaining an attitude of cooperation amongst the three institutions and taking account of the objective limitations with which the institutions must take this decision."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, I must come back to Commissioner Almunia's last remarks."
"I am rather disappointed at the way he interpreted rather than faithfully representing what I said."
"Firstly, I did not say that the data from Cyprus and Malta were worse than those from the other countries."
"Indeed, in the cases of Portugal, Hungary and Greece, the Commission sold us bad data as good."
"That is a fact."
"Secondly, it is not a matter of us attacking specific countries but of the Commission taking responsibility."
"Thirdly, on 3 May 2007, the Commission presented to the European Parliament and the Council document COM(2007)230 - the quality report on quarterly financial accounts for general government."
"That document found fault with Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus."
"No more and no less than this is set out in the explanatory statement of my report."
"Member of the Commission."
"(ES) Mr President, Mr Langen, with regard to the last aspect, I would say once again that it is clear that, with regard to these quarterly accounts, the Commission and Eurostat are asking a number of countries, including Cyprus and Malta, to supply information, to improve it and to supplement it."
"I would repeat, however, that these statistics are not relevant in terms of assessing whether or not a country fulfils the convergence criteria."
"There are thousands of statistics, many series of statistics that the countries have to send to Eurostat, which make up the statistical apparatus of the European system of statistics."
"Those statistics, however, which are incomplete and deficient in the case of Cyprus and Malta, are not the statistics which we have used and which we must use in order to assess the convergence criteria."
"They are different statistics."
"With regard to your previous comment, Portugal, Italy, France, Greece, Hungary and many other countries have received revisions from Eurostat of the GDP figures, deficit figures, debt figures and many other factors."
"We are clearly talking in particular about deficit and debt, however."
"You, Mr Langen, and all of the honourable Members, know that these revisions have taken place and you know that the figures that we are using thanks to the work of Eurostat and of the Commission, work that has improved considerably over the last three years, are now more realistic and more in tune with reality."
"Together with the Council you have approved a Regulation that provides for better instruments and more capacities for revising the figures that Eurostat receives from each Member State."
"We thank you for the support that Eurostat has received and which is enabling it to produce work of a higher quality than it previously produced, and if I, as Commissioner responsible for Eurostat, need new legislative instruments for improving the quality of its work, I shall ask you for it."
"I can tell you today that, if I compare the credibility and quality of the Member States' budget, deficit and debt figures with which I had to work three years ago, then things have clearly improved in that respect, and that is something we should all welcome."
"Please do not blame the Commission for doing its work properly by offering you and everybody else better deficit and debt figures."
"(FR) Mr President, I invite Mr Langen and all his colleagues to take part as actively as today in the discussion in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, when we apply ourselves to improving, in the scope of the discussion currently in progress, for example, the way that Eurostat functions, and when we adopt texts about which the Commissioner has just spoken, which should make it possible to improve the governance of Eurostat."
"At these times I do not see you."
"I should like to ask Mr Gloser if he is willing to commit himself, on behalf of the Council and in the spirit of Mr Barroso's reply to Mr Poettering, to sitting round a table with us in order to reach an agreement on a common timetable for all three institutions when the time comes to consider a new request for accession to the euro area."
"President-in-Office of the Council. (DE) We have heard in the debate what options exist."
"The Commissioner and Mr Barroso have made proposals."
"The task now is to sit down together and clarify what is still possible within the existing Treaty provisions."
"We should use the available time for that purpose."
"in writing. - The Maltese public's support will also be influenced by the impact of eurozone membership on ordinary citizens, the business community and the economy itself."
"Three major factors stand out."
"The first is the success of the transition."
"After perhaps a low start, preparations seem to be gathering pace and no doubt it is imperative that consumers and operators keep tight control of the process."
"So far we have tended to hear only about the pros, in terms of the benefits to Maltese consumers when they travel abroad, the improved competitiveness of Destination Malta for tourists, lower transaction costs for businesses engaged in intra-EU trade, and so forth."
"But we have heard very little about the potential disadvantages."
"On the one hand, Malta needs to adapt to policies, adjustment mechanisms, and measures taken by the European Central Bank, such as on interest rates and monetary aggregates, that will strongly influence our destiny."
"On the other, our fulfilment of the membership criteria cannot rely on the results of a crash economic diet but must be based on sustainable economic policies that ensure that we do not infringe the rules."
"in writing. - I am interested to see that more countries, the latest now being Cyprus and Malta, are choosing the join the euro, which makes Britain's position look increasingly conspicuous."
"Bearing in mind that the euro is rapidly establishing itself as the world's strongest currency and has now displaced the US dollar as the main denomination for world trade, accounting for 45% of the global market compared to 37% for the dollar, it is becoming increasingly clear that for the UK, staying out means missing out."

"About three months ago, on 28 March, I submitted a question on the statements made, in the presence of the President of our Parliament, by Cardinal Angelo Scola, who said that it was not appropriate for the current European Parliament to make continual pronouncements on issues such as marriage, family and life."
"In the face of such an attack on this Parliament I decided to submit the question I have mentioned, and I think it is important for Parliament's Bureau to defend this House and its deliberations against attacks by a foreign State such as the Vatican City State."
"Mr Cappato, if what you say is true - and I do not doubt that it is - you must, of course, be given an answer."

"Residence permits: uniform format (vote)"
"- Coelho report"
"- Before the vote:"
"rapporteur. - (PT) Mr President, in 2003, Parliament rejected two Commission initiatives on this issue."
"I congratulate the Commission on accepting Parliament's idea of separating the issue of residence permits from that of visas."
"Quite apart from technical issues involved in radio collisions between the different chips used, these are indeed separate issues."
"It is one thing to have an identity document to be used within the Schengen area, but having a travel document to be used outside the Schengen area is quite another."
"This will enable all third-country nationals living legally in the Schengen area to be identified in the same way."
"I should therefore like to congratulate the Commission on proposing to us the introduction of biometric identifiers containing an image and fingerprints in interoperable formats."
"The use of these biometric data is the best way of preventing the use of false identities and identity theft."
"I should like to draw the Commission's attention, however, to the need for such changes of residence to meet the same high levels of security required for the issuing of national identity cards."
"I also wish to draw the Commission's attention to the gaps regarding the way in which data are gathered, especially in the case of children, or people who are unable to provide fingerprints due to various forms of incapacity."
"Lastly, let me draw the Commission's attention to data protection standards and to the need to draw up a detailed list of the authorities that will have access to those data, and of the authorities permitted to carry out checks on residence permits, in order to prevent the misuse of the most sensitive data."

"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (PT) As our group says, this proposal, which introduces biometric data information into the uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals, 'raises several concerns as regards its technical feasibility, financial costs and risk of its abuse'."
"As we have highlighted, it is highly debatable whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security, or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection"
"This is a disproportionate measure that forms part of a supranational dynamic, a measure that is aimed at setting up EU-level monitoring and control instruments. It is not in any way accompanied by 'particularly consistent and serious safeguards, especially regarding the way they are collected and used' and it is completely impossible to guarantee its use in a 'relatively safe environment'."
"This proposal is both a consequence and an integral part of the trend towards excessive preoccupation with security pursued by the EU institutions, and as such we reject it."
"in writing. The second modified proposal introducing biometric data information into Regulation 1030/2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third country nationals raises several concerns as regards its technical feasibility, financial costs and the risk of its abuse."
"It is still not clear whether the introduction of biometric identifiers really does increase security or whether it is rather a threat to security through the risks of abuse, technological flaws and lack of transparency and sound data protection."
"The original Commission proposal has also turned out to be technically impossible and the financial resources destined for its development have been partly wasted."
"Due to these reasons, we cannot support the Commission's modified proposal, which would again only raise the financial costs and technical difficulties and would be entirely inadequate to the aim of added value in security."
"in writing. (DE) Thanks to the visions of some multi-cultural dreamers, a situation has arisen which is becoming increasingly difficult for the native population to endure."
"In many cases, immigrants and their children have no consideration for the native population; on the contrary, they demand more and more rights for themselves and seem bent on eradicating our Western Christian heritage; conversely, they simply turn a deaf ear when it comes to civic duties or to obligations of any incomer, such as willingness to integrate."
"The widespread provision of social housing for nationals of non-EU countries and for neo-citizens of the Union who are not integrated has not only created a profound sense of insecurity among the indigenous population but also led to a massive deterioration in people's housing conditions and quality of life, a situation in which outbreaks of violence are almost a daily occurrence."
"In the light of these realities, a general tightening of the right of immigration is needed."
"The Coelho report does not offer a basis for such action, which is precisely why I voted against it."
"(SK) My formal background is that of a dentist."
"Mercury is used in dentistry for amalgam fillings, and I have been watching with interest the EU strategy concerning mercury and the elimination of mercury from all areas of life where there is an appropriate alternative."
"In principle, I agree with many of the measures the Commission has been submitting in the form of draft legislation in line with the mercury strategy."
"However, I am anxiously waiting to see how we deal with the opinion that mercury should also be banished from dentistry, where mercury amalgams have been used for 150 years now and quite successfully at that."
"There are no conclusive indications or evidence of the toxic effects of amalgams if used appropriately."
"At the same time, there is no clear opinion on whether there are appropriate alternative filling materials."
"I believe that if amalgam waste is properly separated in dentistry departments and if we dispose of it properly, safely and on a permanent basis, as proposed in the report, there will be no need for the time being to do away with amalgam as a filling material."
"(DE) Mr President, I wish to give the report my firm backing, and I have voted in favour of it."
"It is important that we should have a European strategy for mercury, because it is one of the most toxic environmental pollutants, and Europe must certainly lead the way here."
"I did vote against some proposals designed to tighten the rules, because I believe it is necessary to provide incremental arrangements for businesses and to allow for a smooth transition so as not to jeopardise the general level of competitiveness."
"I am also wary of creating too much red tape, and a steady hand is needed if we are avoid that risk."
"On the whole, this is a very encouraging report."
"in writing. We have voted against amendments suggesting that liquid mercury should be stored in above-ground facilities."
"No impact assessments have been carried out by the Commission on the safety of such storage and there is no technology available to solidify liquid mercury."
"Storage of mercury in an above-ground facility is therefore questionable in terms of safety and in terms of time (the amendments suggest that this storage would be temporary)."
"Without new technology, storage would not be temporary."
"On the other hand, impact assessments have been undertaken by the Commission for the storage of liquid mercury in salt mines and deep underground hard rock formations and has been confirmed safe."
"We are very much aware that technology could be developed in the near future."
"We very much welcome the Council's agreement to a European Parliament request to include in the proposed regulation a review on extension of the scope of the regulation and a review of other options available for the storage of mercury in 2010."
"in writing. - (PT) In 1990 the Oslo-Paris Commission (OSPAR) recommended that all mercury cell chlor-alkali plants (MCCAPs) be converted to mercury-free technology by 2010."
"Parliament's March 2006 resolution on the Community strategy concerning mercury urged the Commission to take action to implement OSPAR."
"Apart from ongoing mercury emissions from MCCAPs, when these plants convert to mercury-free technologies, the vast quantities of mercury in their cells need to be managed in an environmentally appropriate manner."
"To prevent this surplus mercury from flooding the world mercury commodity market, a proposal for a Regulation banning exports of metallic mercury by 1 July, 2011, was adopted in October 2006, and attempts have been made to bring that date forward."
"The proposal includes parallel provisions on safe storage of the excess mercury which will mainly be coming from decommissioned MCCAPs, to prevent its re-sale. Currently there are around 12 000 tonnes of mercury sitting in mercury cells in Europe."
"To that end Euro Chlor (the EU chlor-alkali industry federation) has been asked by the European Commission and has agreed to develop a Voluntary Agreement for the storage of surplus chlor-alkali mercury."
"in writing. - (FR) The management of mercury is an important issue for the conservation of the environment."
"If Europe has more waste mercury to store, it is because our industries did not foresee the risks involved in the use of this metal, in particular for the production of chlorine."
"First lesson: we must very quickly rethink our production methods in order to be prepared for a vital ecological revolution."
"Next, it is necessary to constantly monitor the storage of waste, by setting up regular checks."
"That is why I voted in favour of Amendment 25 which rules out permanent storage above-ground and underground."
"Alas, it did not receive a majority of votes."
"Nonetheless, the other improvements in the text justify a vote in favour of the final report."
"Even though it recognises that there is currently no absolutely safe method of storing metallic mercury, the report endeavours to legalise a special type of territorial 'racism', by imposing the choice of the Spanish province of Almaden as the site for permanent landfill of the most toxic element on the planet."
"The worst thing is that it endeavours to justify the imposition of this specific area with the existence there of infrastructures and 'manpower'."
"In other words, it is using unemployment as a means of blatant coercion of the workers, so that they agree to turn their area into a landfill for toxic mercury waste from the entire EU, with incalculable risks to the health of the inhabitants and the environment."
"The proposal in the report for the involvement and funding of all sorts of NGOs in the crucial question of the application of mercury-free technologies in developing countries and in so-called 'economies in transition' comes under the same dangerous policy by circumventing the rules which derive from binding bilateral agreements in this sector."
"That is why the Greek Communist Party abstained from the vote."
"The Greek Communist Party maintains that the question of where metallic mercury should be stored and managed is a subject for science and the application of its conclusions and not of choices that reflect the interests and profits of business."
"(SK) Supplementary pension schemes, collectively referred to as the 'second pillar of the social insurance system', are an inseparable part of modern society."
"We have witnessed in the past the reform of labour markets and social insurance systems in several Member States, and these have included pension system reforms."
"Let me use Slovakia as an example of a country which introduced supplementary pension schemes within the context of reforming the social security system."
"A large number of Slovak nationals have already joined the second pillar."
"Savings generated in the second pillar are privately owned."
"They are more secure than the promises of the state to pay out pensions from public coffers."
"An advantage of the second pillar is that pension benefits no longer depend on the country's demographics but on savings accumulated in one's own account."
"For these reasons and in the spirit of encouraging worker mobility in Member States, I have welcomed the draft directive designed to improve the portability of supplementary pension rights, and I believe that this will make it possible to reduce the number of problems associated with eligibility for pension rights, retaining suspended pension rights and with the portability of acquired rights."
"(DE) Mr President, the single market and mobility depend on social security, which must extend beyond a person's working life."
"It is important in this respect to maintain the balance between employers and employees on which the acquisition of pension rights depends."
"This was the first reading, and we still have numerous discussions ahead of us."
"The delegation from the Austrian People's Party has given the Oomen-Ruijten report its unreserved support, because we believe that this is the right way to continue developing mobility and the single market."
"(LT) Mr President, first I would like to thank the rapporteur Ria Oomen-Ruijten and other colleagues who prepared this report concerning the improvement of portability of the right to a supplementary pension."
"I voted for this document, as I believe it will positively affect most European Union Member States, especially the newest EU members."
"In the Baltic countries, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Malta, supplementary pensions have not yet been legislated, whereas in the Scandinavian countries and Slovenia, by contrast, the majority of workers participate in such pension schemes."
"Our Parliament's urging to oblige EU countries to gradually seek easier portability of pension rights should provide a new impulse above all to the new Member States, and likewise to Greece, Italy and Portugal, to amend their legislation in such a way that the mobility of people in the European Union be encouraged, not penalised."
"(IT) Mr President, it is with pleasure that I take the floor to say to Europe: 'if you are there, let us see some action'."
"Europe must show greater courage, it must have the heart of a lion and not be a chicken."
"The Directive on the transferability of pension rights is absolutely crucial for all European citizens and workers."
"By approving this proposal we are doing something for workers, but we will not really succeed in obtaining a result for which European citizens can applaud Europe."
"Therefore, Mr President, let us not mourn over the referendums in France and the Netherlands that rejected the Constitution."
"Europe must be more courageous."
"in writing. (SV) As a Liberal, I find it difficult to vote against a proposal aimed at improving Europeans' opportunities to move around more freely."
"It is not made any the easier when the proposal is also aimed at encouraging people to take more active responsibility for saving for their pensions, this being one of the genuinely key issues for the future."
"Nonetheless, I was unable to vote in favour of the original proposal."
"The problem is twofold."
"Firstly, it is debatable whether this complicated issue is suited to being raised at European level, given the various Member States' very different systems for pension savings."
"Secondly, I could not help but note that Sweden, in common with Germany, has systems particularly ill-suited to this type of changeover."
"The Swedish model, in which the social partners decide about the issue, is incompatible with the rapporteur's proposal."
"Considerable problems could also arise if huge sums by way of invested funds could suddenly be released in a short period in order to guarantee the ability to transfer pensions."
"I am, in the long run, in favour of a system in which people can change jobs and move from one country to another and still not need to worry about how doing so might affect their pensions."
"I therefore in the end voted in favour of this House's amended version of the report in which national derogations are permitted."
"in writing. - (PT) On the issue of the transferability of pension rights, there are at least two key aspects that must be taken into account: ensuring workers' rights and guaranteeing the sustainability of public social security systems."
"The issue before us is specifically supplementary pension schemes and not public social security schemes."
"With regard to these two aspects, we are opposed to the amendments tabled in the report amending the Commission's original proposal. These amendments propose, for example, to increase from 21 to 25 the age of access to supplementary pension schemes and to make the acquisition of pension rights conditional on a minimum five-year period."
"Supplementary pension schemes must not, however, replace public schemes."
"Public social security schemes based on solidarity and universality are among the cornerstones of any state and something that must be guaranteed in a fairer and more egalitarian society."
"Lastly, we are very disappointed at the rejection of the amendments we tabled, including the proposal to combine the Commission's original position on the minimum age of 21 with a two-year period of acquisition of rights, which would have been more favourable to the workers."
"Hence our final vote against."
"in writing. (SV) We have chosen to vote against this report."
"The June List wholeheartedly supports an efficient internal market."
"We thus support the principle whereby an employee must be able without difficulty to transfer earned pension points between the Member States."
"We do not, however, believe that the EU should have views on the form to be taken by the Member States' respective pension systems, provided that all EU citizens are treated equally within the system in force."
"We are thus critical of quite a few individual proposals in the report, such as the views on vesting conditions for policyholders in supplementary pension schemes, the views on minimum ages for earning pension rights or EU rules on the qualifying period for entry into a pension scheme."
"How the Member States choose to design their respective pension systems needs to be an entirely national matter, provided that all EU citizens are treated equally within the system in force."
"in writing.- (PL) I am voting in favour of Mrs Oomen-Ruijten's report on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights - C6 0331/2005 -"
"Demographic changes and an ageing population have made us aware of the need for supplementary pension and social security insurance systems, which will ensure dignified living conditions."
"The new directive and Mrs Ria Oomen-Ruijten's report both aim to improve the mobility of workers, within and between the Member States of the European Union, by establishing minimum requirements concerning the acquisition and retention of supplementary pension rights."
"The report aptly highlights the role of the Member States in providing consistent support for the transfer of acquired pension rights, especially in the event that new, supplementary pension systems are established."
"Over the five years following the implementation of the directive, the European Commission will draw up a report which will take into account the conditions governing transfers of capital corresponding to employees' supplementary pension or social security entitlements."
"in writing. (DE) I voted against the report on the portability directive."
"The report goes well wide of the real target of increased cross-border mobility of labour between Member States."
"On average, only 10% of all employees in the EU receive company pensions."
"Because of the cost increase of at least 20% that can be expected to result from the high minimum standards which have just been adopted, there will scarcely be any interest in the creation or expansion of company pension schemes."
"My fear is that what employers and employees have achieved to their mutual advantage in the national context over several decades is now being put at risk."
"The minimum age for the acquisition of company-pension rights has been entirely scrapped."
"The five-year vesting period has been abolished."
"The minimum standards are to be applicable retroactively, which is in outright contradiction to the principle of safeguarding legitimate expectations."
"I also voted for the deletion of index-linking, which would most probably be interpreted by the European Court of Justice as 'equitable adjustment' and as an obligation."
"The German Bundesrat has calculated that treating employees who have changed companies on equal terms with those who have not will increase the cost of supplementary pension schemes by 30%."
"European Commissioner Vladim√≠r ≈†pidla has announced the presentation of a new proposal."
"Following the failure to reach agreement in the Council, the proposal will be largely based on today's parliamentary resolution and will thus jeopardise company pension schemes - and not only in Germany."
"Directive 98/49/EEC guarantees the rights to supplementary pension for workers and the self-employed who move within the EU, but provides no guarantees in the area of portability of supplementary pensions and flexibility of the acquisition conditions."
"This is something which the Commission proposal addresses."
"It lays down terms and puts forward three minimum rules regarding the portability of rights: either they remain within the business (dormant rights), they are transferred within a certain period of time, or they are paid in cash (up to a certain threshold)."
"According to the Commission, the new directive must apply to all supplementary pensions that are work-related."
"I particularly regret the fact that the Oomen-Ruijten report excludes the proposal of portability of pension rights from the directive."
"As it stands now, it only deals with dormant rights."
"As I see it, the new directive should do everything in its power to support workers who invest in supplementary pension rights."
"Accordingly, nobody should be excluded by imposing minimum conditions in terms of age or period of time."
"I can only endorse the report if the directive retains the broad scope proposed by the Commission."
"If not, I will be voting against."
"The proposal for a Commission directive, as formulated with the anti-labour changes voted jointly by the Christian Democrats, the socialists and the liberals, supported by the New Democracy and PASOK MEPs, blows national supplementary insurance schemes sky high throughout the EU."
"It marks a deterioration in the terms of insurance and retirement of the workers, a reduction in pensions and an increase in the retirement age."
"It speeds up procedures for private insurance companies to increase their share of this sector."
"The basic direction of these reactionary changes is the so-called 'three-axis' system of main state pension, with a supplementary and occupational pension from private companies."
"The blow to the workers' rights in the supplementary pension sector is linked to the ambition of the monopolies to use the reserves in these insurance funds to fund their investments, while at the same time legalising the acceptance of the 'investment risk' or possible loss of the workers' money."
"New Democracy and PASOK vote in favour of all the anti-grassroots measures in the European Parliament, on the one hand, and harangue and deceive the workers in our country, on the other hand, by endeavouring to show the people a supposedly friendly mask."
"The Greek Communist Party calls on the workers to step up their fight against the anti-labour, anti-grassroots EU policy, to defend state social insurance schemes and to demand satisfaction of their contemporary needs, higher pensions and a lower retirement age."
"in writing. - (DE) I voted against the portability directive, because it misses the real target of increased cross-border mobility of labour between Member States."
"The rules on the transfer of company-pension rights only have the force of a recommendation for the Member States."
"For this reason I had repeatedly advised outright rejection of the directive, since it has become superfluous."
"(DE) Mr President, even though the introduction of the euro has made life easier in many respects, as in the case of cross-border trade, it would be wrong to overlook its less savoury aspects, such as the surrender of sovereignty and price increases."
"As in the case of any enlargement of the EU, the introduction of the euro in new Member States will ultimately affect the fragile stability of the entire system."
"This is why I believe it is imperative to ensure that the overall balance is not upset by the inclusion of weak national economies."
"Now it may well be that Cyprus and Malta are ready."
"In the past, however, governments have all too often played with marked cards in order to qualify for the euro club."
"In my opinion, such an important decision must on no account be taken over the heads of the population, and that is why I have abstained in this instance."
"in writing. - (PT) We abstained from the vote on account of the fact that it is entirely up to each Member State to make the sovereign decision on whether or not it wants to join the Eurozone."
"Our opposition to the creation of Economic and Monetary Union and to the Eurozone is well known. The example of Portugal has amply demonstrated how the euro is a tool for promoting wage moderation and flexibility in the labour market."
"By sustaining nominal and not real convergence, it has been to the detriment of growth, employment and living standards, and to the benefit of the large European multinationals and financial groups."
"I wish to point out that the issue of speeding up the enlargement of the Eurozone is also based on the political criteria of strengthening both political integration and the Eurozone itself."
"With two new Member States - Malta and Cyprus - the Eurozone will boast over half of EU Member States."
"This is a significant psychological barrier, when dissatisfaction among the workers and the people as a whole in the Eurozone is on the increase and when the future Constitutional Treaty is under discussion."
"The majority therefore accept the idea of joining, even though Malta does not fulfil all the nominal convergence criteria."
"As in the past, this is not an 'economic' decision, but a political one."
"in writing. (DE) On the basis of economic criteria, the decision is no doubt justified."
"From a political point of view, it is nevertheless a regrettable decision."
"It squanders an opportunity to let both parts of the island of Cyprus enter the eurozone."
"Instead of bringing North and South closer together through a single currency, it will only deepen the divide between the two parts of the island."
"(MT) Thank you, Mr President."
"The government has adopted as its policy the target of introducing the euro by 1 January 2008."
"In order to do so a number of criteria had to be reached, for example regarding deficit and inflation."
"Obviously these had a negative impact on the government's financial policies, as well as on the more vulnerable section of society."
"Indeed, we believed that there was an alternative, which still entailed adopting the euro, but adopting it at a slower pace."
"Obviously, our entry into the eurozone will have a number of positive effects, yet it will also have adverse effects in other areas."
"However, in view of national interests, the Maltese Labour Party delegation has voted in favour."
"(PL) Mr President, today we debated and voted on the expansion of the eurozone and Malta and Cyprus' membership of this zone."
"I leave the sovereign decision on the abolition of the national currency in Cyprus and Malta to the citizens of these countries."
"However, as a representative of the League of Polish Families in the European Parliament, I am opposed to Poland's membership of the eurozone and the negative economic and social impact this would have on Poles."
"All current public opinion polls confirm that the majority of Poles do not want the euro."
"I think that we should not only avoid acting hastily, but we should also not introduce the euro in Poland at all."
"I also disagree with the opinions expressed today that the Member States have a duty to join the eurozone."
"Poles should decide on this issue in a national referendum and I hope that the Polish zloty will remain a national currency in Europe, alongside the British pound and the Danish and Swedish currencies."
"in writing. - (PT) It is well known that we opposed the creation of European Economic and Monetary Union and the euro. Indeed, we voted against Parliament's resolution of 2 May 1998 establishing the Eurozone, which was originally made up of 12 countries, including Portugal."
"We feel that monetary policy, and the prerogative of issuing currency, lies exclusively with the Member States, and therefore reject this transfer of sovereignty, which will make it impossible to address the economic and social problems in each country, including Portugal."
"At this time, the enlargement of the Eurozone is based on political criteria - for example the strengthening of political integration and of the Eurozone itself - as this issue amply demonstrates, given that Malta does not fulfil all of the nominal convergence criteria."
"However, with two new Member States - Malta and Cyprus - the Eurozone will boast over half of EU Member States."
"This is a significant psychological barrier, when dissatisfaction among the workers and the people as a whole in the Eurozone is on the increase and when the future Constitutional Treaty is being discussed."
"In our view, it is entirely up to each Member State to make the sovereign decision on whether or not it wants to join the Eurozone, and this is why we abstained from the vote."
"in writing. British Conservatives have always opposed the entry of the UK into the euro zone."
"Nevertheless, we have never opposed the right of other sovereign nations to form a common monetary system."
"Our abstention reflects our belief that it is for the members of the euro zone to decide how best to conduct monetary policy in the interests of a stable currency."
"in writing. - (FR) Our vote concerning the adoption of the euro by Malta and Cyprus will be identical to the one for Slovenia: we shall abstain."
"We will not go against what we hope will be the conscious will of sovereign peoples."
"We must, however, recognise that a threshold has been crossed: it is not at their express request, but because they almost fulfil the 'stupid' Maastricht criteria, as Mr Prodi would have said, that these countries have to adopt the euro."
"Have their citizens been told about it?"
"At least one of these countries does not meet these famous criteria and neither of the two, it seems, has supplied the statistics necessary for a proper assessment of their state of preparation."
"Why rush?"
"The practical and technical measures for actual transition to the single currency are a great unknown."
"Also, the euro zone's capacity for absorption, which at another time was a matter of concern for Mr Langen, has disappeared from the picture and from the analysis."
"Here we are again faced with the bicycle syndrome, from which European construction appears to suffer: if it does not go forward, it falls down."
"The euro zone must be enlarged at all costs."
"Full stop!"
"The truth is that it is the citizens of Europe who will have to pay the price!"
"in writing. - (SV) We have chosen to abstain in the final vote on these reports."
"It is up to the people of Cyprus and Malta to decide, preferably through a referendum, whether they want the country to be part of EMU."
"We do not believe that Sweden should be part of the currency union. Nor do we recommend other countries to participate in it."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the introduction of the euro in Malta and Cyprus, because it is a matter of supporting strengthened integration of these countries in the sense given by the European Union."
"Nonetheless, this decision ought to have been accompanied by measures enabling more democratic control of the single currency (establishment of real economic government of the euro zone capable of balancing the power of the European Central bank (ECB), changing the Central Bank's objectives so as to include research for growth and full employment, changing the criteria of the Stability Pact so as not to penalise public investment policy in the future)."
"Let us take care not to pursue endless enlargement of the euro zone without any new perspectives."
"in writing. The British Conservative delegation supports the Committee on Budgets resolution calling on the Commission to resubmit its proposals for financing the Galileo project."
"However, we have grave reservations about proposals to fund it through the existing European budget."
"in writing. - (PT) We are very disappointed at the significant rejection by the majority in Parliament of the amendments tabled by our group, which were aimed at ensuring that 'the Galileo programme must not, under any circumstances, by used for military purposes', and that 'safeguards must be put in place to prevent the programme from being privatised' thereby guaranteeing that its implementation is funded entirely with public money."
"Does this rejection mean that, following much-vaunted public investment, the unacceptable option of tendering the programme out to the private sector is already being considered?"
"Our position is clear."
"We feel that the Galileo programme (European programme of satellite radionavigation) will be able to contribute towards cooperation, scientific and technical advancement and to foster the exchange of, and access to, information."
"This is a project that should be based on a strategy of public investment and public control, so that a public service can be provided. That way, there can be equal access and the free use of available information for all users."
"It is a project in which the citizens' rights, guarantees and freedoms must be guaranteed. It must also be ensured that it is not used for military purposes and/or as part of the trend towards an excessive preoccupation with security."
"in writing. In order to conclude GALILEO, the European satellite navigation system, EU member states are asked to pay another ‚Ç¨ 2 400 000 000."
"For many years it has been argued that this project would bring technological innovation, satisfaction of consumers' needs, employment, and independence from the United States."
"These assets could justify the spending of community funds, instead of leaving it solemnly to profit-orientated multinationals or the American war industry."
"As long as GALILEO remains a peaceful process, we do not principally reject it."
"Unfortunately, GALILEO will be developed 10 to 20 years too late, and in the meantime GPS, the American counterpart, has conquered the world market."
"This makes GALILEO into a costly prestige project."
"Spending a lot of community money on this, might sound attractive to big business, but voters and consumers will increasingly regard this as a scandalous waste of money."
"European companies refuse to participate in Public Private Partnerships, because they do not expect any profit due to the arrears with GPS."
"They do hope to receive a large community investment in 2012 for free."
"Consequently, we do not want to spend even more money on GALILEO."
"If there are no real perspectives, we should dare to stop."
"in writing. (SV) EU Member States will be technologically dependent on current and future military superpowers, such as the United States, Russia and China, if we cannot develop our own satellite-based radio navigation."
"Galileo is undoubtedly needed, but this expensive project should for the most part be funded by private actors with political support."
"Paragraph 6 of the resolution states that, in the European Parliament's view, the Galileo programme should be funded entirely from the European Union budget."
"I am not prepared to go so far and therefore choose to vote against the resolution as a whole."
"in writing. - (FR) We support the Galileo project, even if we had a few reservations about supporting it."
"We cannot, however, support this resolution."
"It is deplorable that, after the predictable failure of the public-private partnership, this Parliament should be saying it is prepared to give up an independent GPS system if it ceases to be purely a Community project to include direct funding by Member States."
"Galileo is useful!"
"By whatever means, it must be financed."
"The Commission cannot find EUR 2.4 billion, from the hundreds of billions that it intends spending, not always usefully, by 2013?"
"Then what?"
"Why should the Member States be pushed aside?"
"Galileo is not a toy, nor is it the exclusive, symbolic project of Brussels' Europe that wants us to believe that it is not concerned only for itself, its competences and its sustainability."
"Just for once, leave aside dogma."
"Put into this industrial venture a quarter of the political willingness that a handful of Member States put, a few years ago, into building a European aeronautical and space industry, and prove what you refuse to admit: intergovernmental cooperation works."
"In Brussels, on the other hand, it is at a standstill."
"in writing. The clear intention of the resolution is for Galileo to be financed with a blank cheque from public funds to further EU political ambitions."
"Collaborative technological projects have a dubious track record."
"They do not require EU involvement and should only be undertaken for clear economic, strategic and industrial motives - not to further EU ambitions to be a global actor."
"British Conservatives want opportunities for British industry and British R[amp]D, but this resolution does not guarantee that."
"It supports the Commission's proposal to use public funds - through the EU budget - for the entire Galileo project."
"This course of action will be another drain on taxpayers in the United Kingdom and other EU Member States, and one in which they have had absolutely no say."
"Whereas, in the past, there was reluctance by the EU to admit military applications, this coyness has now been dropped."
"In the Commission's Communication on European Space Policy (26 April 2007) the aim of meeting 'Europe's security and defence needs as regards space' is one of the key objectives."
"As long-standing opponents of ESDP, the British Conservatives oppose proposals that extend the Commission's hand into the defence arena."
"in writing. - (PT) All it took for us to decide to vote against this report was the first recital."
"Community law on public procurement aims to open - liberalise would be a better word - public markets in the Member States to cross-border competition, in order to support the development of the internal market, in keeping with the liberalising agenda contained in the Lisbon Strategy."
"We are of course in favour of national rules on the transparency of tendering, provided they do not block opportunities to use public markets to boost the economic fabric and national SMEs, bearing in mind their size and importance."
"There is a substantial difference in this case, however, leading us to vote against, which is that responsibility for this issue should continue to rest with the Member States."
"Public procurement is also an important instrument in promoting social and environmental policy, given that it may contain criteria relating to social and environmental issues involved in awarding contracts."
"It cannot be restricted to supranational level, with rules on non-discrimination or on other economic interests used as a pretext."
"in writing. We voted in favour of part one of paragraph 40 and against part 2 of paragraph 40."
"Similarly, we voted in favour of the first part of paragraph 41 and against the second part. We abstained on the vote for the resolution as a whole."
"The reason for this is that we did not wish to indicate that we support any interpretation of the word 'rights' as indicating a support for abortion."
"We do, of course, support the general thrust of the Millennium Goals and therefore did not vote against the resolution as a whole."
"in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the Kinnock report 'On the Millennium Development Goals - the midway point' because I feel that we need a broad partnership in order to be able to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"It is therefore desirable for the national parliaments and civil society in all the interested countries to become involved."
"One of the key factors in achieving the Goals is that of a 50% reduction in poverty by 2015, with special focus on issues such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria."
"Gender inequality and discrimination against women are further points that must be taken into account in development programmes."
"in writing. - (PT) I welcome the fact that the report acknowledges the seriousness of the world situation."
"As the UN report on the Millennium Development Goals revealed, progress in the fight to reduce hunger has been too slow. Indeed, the figures have worsened in recent years: 854 million people (17% of the world's population) per day suffer from hunger and almost 16 000 children die every day due to hunger-related causes."
"Nevertheless, once again the report glosses over the causes at the root of this intolerable situation."
"It is important to highlight the fact that, at the same time as 16 000 children die every day:"
"The US Administration has earmarked USD 600 billion for military spending in its budget;"
"The 691 richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to USD 2.2 billion, which is equal to the combined wealth of the 145 poorest countries;"
"The 500 richest people have a combined income higher than that of the 416 million poorest;"
"The 8 million richest people in the world have a net fortune equivalent to 80% of the GDP of all the countries in the world."
"This is the root of the problem."
"in writing. The rapporteur's approach to this highly important subject is to be commended."
"There is urgent need for efforts to reach the MDGs to be redoubled."
"This means wholesale debt relief and scaled-up, better coordinated and better targeted aid."
"in writing. - (PT) In the space available in an explanation of vote, there are two points that deserve to be highlighted."
"The first paragraph of the resolution says: 'the overarching aim of development cooperation is and must be the fight against poverty; stresses, however, that this fight is not limited to material growth and therefore, democracy-building and the promotion of basic human rights, rule of law and the principles of justice, equity, transparency and accountability must always be central themes of any such cooperation.'"
"I did not oppose this resolution because I understand that these concerns require us to contribute as much as we can, but I feel that the idea must be stressed that the fight against poverty cannot be effective unless the causes of poverty are combated."
"Among the structural causes of poverty is always bad governance."
"It is for this reason, and not out of a desire to impose some sort of model, that it is so important to fight on these two fronts at the same time."
"Otherwise, we will be resolving a problem today only for it to come back tomorrow."
"Lastly, the report tells us that 'Portugal, which is due to host the EU-Africa Summit during its Presidency, achieved only 0.21% ODA/GNI in 2006', which is terrible."
"in writing. (PL) I was forced to vote against the report on 'MDGs at the Midway Point'."
"Including proposals to fund abortion using EU budget aid will inevitably lead to divisions concerning the aid strategy for Africa."
"This will undermine the effectiveness of our actions."
"From both a moral and a medical point of view, abortion does not hold the key to solving the problem of maternal deaths during childbirth."
"Using European Union resources to fund abortion in Africa is contrary to the principle of providing support."
"It forces all European Union citizens to become indirectly implicated in this matter."
"It also represents a kind of moral imperialism towards Africa."
"The consistent support of this House for funding abortion in developing countries is the biggest mistake we have made in terms of shaping humanitarian aid policy."
"in writing. The UKIP does not recognise the legitimacy of the ACP-EU JPA and therefore cannot support this amendment."
"However, we agree with the spirit of the text and sincerely hope that the international community as a whole will ensure that the international travel bans on key figures in the Zimbabwean regime are fully respected."
"in writing. The UKIP does not recognise the legitimacy of the ACP-EU JPA and therefore cannot support this amendment."
"However, we agree with the spirit of the text and sincerely hope that the international community as a whole will ensure that the international travel bans on key figures in the Zimbabwean regime are fully respected."
"in writing. The work of the ACP-EU JPA is vital when we consider the large number of least developed countries within that grouping and the volume of development assistance the EU targets at the ACP countries."
"I support many of the demands made in the report, such as those calling for national parliaments and civil society to become more involved in the process of national aid programming in the ACP."
"in writing. - (PT) The report clearly reveals how the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly - both in 2006 and before - is an excellent instrument for creating the crucial structures, relationships and dialogue necessary for the creation of sound foundations for good relations between both sides and for the development of genuinely useful projects."
"That being said, although it should be noted that whilst progress so far has been laudable, our concerns should be based on what lies ahead."
"We have an obligation - one that is, on the one hand, both moral and ethical and, on the other, in our own interests - to support development in associated countries, to help them develop mechanisms to open up their economies and together to turn globalisation into a virtuous movement; it is up to us to circumvent, reduce and remove the potential pitfalls involved in this movement."
"Against this backdrop, in relation to some of these partners, it is vital that the forthcoming EU-Africa summit, set to take place during the Portuguese Presidency, yields results."
"Realism with results is preferable to utopian ideals without history."

"Towards an arms trade treaty (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements - Towards an arms trade treaty."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, illicit arms trading and the irresponsible export-control policies of some states are fuelling conflicts worldwide, undermining respect for human rights and encouraging crime and terrorism."
"Moreover, they are hampering the sustainable economic development of entire regions."
"It is against this backdrop that the idea of enshrining binding principles for arms dealing in an international agreement was conceived a few years ago."
"The concept of an arms-trade treaty was born."
"The Member States of the European Union campaigned for such an agreement from the outset, and the current Presidency of the Council also attaches great importance to this process."
"At a meeting on 18 June the General Affairs and External Relations Council re-emphasised the importance of an arms-trade treaty."
"I was very pleased that Mr Romeva i Rueda, the European Parliament's rapporteur on the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, accepted the invitation to attend the informal seminar for the members of the Conventional Arms Exports Working Party COARM Group in Berlin at the beginning of January, where he explained in detail the views of the European Parliament on a global arms-trade treaty."
"The Presidency shares Mr Romeva's view that such a treaty would serve the extremely important purpose of subjecting the global arms trade to legally binding and responsible rules."
"An important step was taken with the adoption of resolution 61/89 by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 6 December 2006."
"The resolution asks the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States of the United Nations and to appoint a group of experts by 2008."
"It will be the task of that group to assess the feasibility, scope and draft parameters of such a treaty."
"In the lead-up to the session of the General Assembly, numerous Member States of the EU were involved in the drafting of the resolution and in canvassing other states to approve it."
"About 80 states, including all Member States of the EU, have so far answered the UN Secretary-General's call."
"In a separate EU opinion submitted to the Secretary-General, the Presidency of the Council cited the EU Code of Conduct as a good example of international cooperation in the control of arms exports and made the case for an arms-trade treaty."
"Together with other EU Member States, the Presidency also continues to press for the submission of country papers."
"A large number of favourable opinions will be of paramount importance in demonstrating the strong worldwide support that exists for the project."
"The success of such a treaty will be crucially dependent on whether it binds not only all the major arms exporters but also the countries that import arms."
"The United Nations is therefore the right forum for these negotiations."
"Let me cite two examples of issues to which the group of experts must devote particular attention in order to pave the way for an effective treaty. First of all, the scope of the treaty must be spelled out in detail."
"To this end a separate checklist will be necessary."
"This must not be confined to the categories used in the UN arms register but must also apply to materiel such as small and light arms, ammunition and man-portable air-defence systems (MANPADS)."
"Manufacturing equipment and technology should also be included in an appropriate form."
"Secondly, the treaty must contain a comprehensive catalogue of criteria to be applied when decisions are taken on arms exports."
"Among these criteria are compliance with arms embargos, respect for human rights in the country of destination, preservation of regional stability, prevention of internal or regional conflicts, promotion of sustainable development and prevention of any undesirable redirection of the goods."
"Numerous regional organisations around the world have already been examining these issues."
"The European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports is the most fully developed international instrument for the control of arms exports."
"Thanks to its experience with the Code of Conduct, the European Union can make a special contribution to the discussion of these issues."
"At the same time, however, it must avoid creating the impression that it seeks to impose the EU Code of Conduct on other Members of the United Nations."
"The fact is that support for this project in all parts of the world is remarkably strong at the present time."
"Nevertheless, an important role in this process devolves on the European Union, to which several major exporting nations belong."
"Let me also pay particular tribute to the role of civil society, for non-governmental organisations, scientists and scholars and the media have played a significant part in persuading hesitant governments of the need for an arms-trade treaty."
"From the very start they have made valuable suggestions and contributions, and I urge non-governmental organisations to maintain their active involvement in this process."
"The Presidency is pleased to note that the European Parliament has expressed itself on various occasions in favour of the conclusion of a global arms-trade treaty and that it is using its interparliamentary contacts for that purpose."
"I read the latest draft resolution with great interest and warmly welcome the persuasive proposals it contains."
"I very much hope that we can continue and intensify our vigorous dialogue with the European Parliament on this important issue too."
"(Applause)"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would just like to add a few words to those of the President-in-Office of the Council."
"Over the last few years, the fight against the illicit spread of weapons has been the focus of much political and public attention and the issue remains of great importance to all of us."
"Let me commend the honourable Members on the leadership they are showing on the legally binding arms trade treaty to regulate the international trade in conventional arms."
"It is an ambitious approach proposing common international standards."
"I understand your motion for a resolution has already been submitted."
"The Commission also welcomes the Council conclusions of two days ago;"
"I need not go into those in detail, because they have already been mentioned."
"We all recognise the negative impact of irresponsible exports of military equipment on regional security, economic development and human safety in some of the most vulnerable parts of the world."
"An arms trade treaty would be of great value, for instance in reducing the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons."
"These weapons result in considerable human misery and, in making the world less safe, they affect our own security and prosperity."
"The illicit trade in conventional weapons also has global consequences, which means we must enhance the coherence between EU security policy and Community development assistance."
"Development and security are linked more closely than ever, and the threat these illicit weapons present goes beyond the immediate violence they cause."
"In this globalised world of ours, lost GDP and reduced foreign investment, for instance, represent failed opportunities few countries can afford."
"Even with an arms trade treaty, countless illicit weapons would remain in circulation around the world."
"In addition to the Union's strong political engagement, we are therefore providing practical support for legislative and administrative capacity-building, giving the EU a significant role in the fight against the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons."
"We are fully engaged in the implementation of the 2005 EU strategy against the illicit spread of small arms and light weapons."
"This area, as you know, is not new to us."
"The Commission has been fully involved in it for many years and has also gained experience working with international organisations, academia, NGOs and civil society in dealing with the consequences of inappropriate or illegal arms sales."
"Much remains to be done, both through the treaty and outside it."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) In recent years, there has been little cheer for those in favour of arms control and disarmament rooted in multilateral legal instruments."
"Last December's decision by the UN General Assembly officially to launch the process of drawing up a global arms trade Treaty (ATT) gives rare cause for celebration."
"Although it came as no surprise, the solitary vote against the resolution that launched the process, by the United States, was sad."
"The Treaty is aimed at finding a common legal denominator for the import, export and transfer of arms, at offering a global response to a completely globalised trade and at creating uniform criteria that make the arms trade subject to the imperatives of human rights, stability and sustainable development."
"It is also intended to mobilise public opinion in developed countries against the opacity that characterises the millionaire legal contracts governing arms sales to allied countries."
"The United Kingdom's scandalous decision to block the latest investigation into the country's arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and into the accompanying high-level corruption, is a perfect example of the true nature of the arms trade."
"Only in this field would a European government dare to block a serious investigation in the national interest."
"It is because of special treatment that governments the world over have taken special measures to control the arms trade. The EU can and must take the lead in this area."
"It must fight for the lessons learnt from the interpretation and implementation of its code of conduct - in particular as regards the criteria of sustainable development and human rights - to be applied to the new Treaty, because these two aspects are especially pertinent, as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner pointed out."
"In this regard, I welcome the conclusions of the last 'General Affairs Council', which highlighted the importance of joining forces with other countries and regional organisations to draw up a new Treaty."
"All that remains is for the EU to transform this good will into a diplomatic strategy, properly rooted in a Council common position, in relation to the ATT."
"While reason and scruples are not around to dignify the White House with their presence, European leadership in this area is particularly urgently needed."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is truly shameful that, despite the perils brought to humanity by the numerous irresponsible arms transfers carried out for so many years, we still do not have a legally binding UN treaty on international arms trade."
"However, even if we had, I doubt if we would have had the means, or that those who matter would have had the will, to closely monitor and implement it properly, but we should concern ourselves with this once we have a UN Treaty in place."
"Today, the most unscrupulous and murderous worldwide may easily possess arms."
"With enough money and the right connections, anything may be purchased, from a hand gun to a jet fighter plane."
"It is probably only a matter of time before even nuclear weapons may be purchased on the open market."
"Why, you may ask, should there be such a despicable state of affairs in our 21st century society?"
"The answer is quite simple: there will always be deranged individuals in this world who want to inflict their pathologically criminal plans on others and, similarly, there will always be evil traders who supply the means for death and destruction to anybody, as long as they are able to make a handsome profit."
"I must be mentioned here that the arms industry's highly lucrative enterprises continuously produce more advanced killing machines in greater numbers and at an ever-increasing pace."
"I know that we cannot change the world overnight and the forces of evil will always have their share of determining the fate of our fellow human beings."
"However, one must at least try to make a start to change things to some extent."
"In this way, I support this motion for a resolution which calls for the establishment of common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons."
"After all, it is better than nothing, and let us hope that one day human beings will have enough common sense to realise that there is no need to produce weapons at all."
"In conclusion, I find it noteworthy to mention that, of the 17 leading arms exporters, more than half are EU Member States."
"Let this statistic be food for thought for all of us."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (ES) Mr President, this House has spoken out in favour of an international treaty on the transfer of weapons on many previous occasions."
"What makes this debate and the resolution that we have presented special, however, is that the United Nations are now getting to work."
"A resolution that was approved in December 2006 with the support of 153 countries has been the departure point for our debate today."
"It is right that we should remember that 153 countries signed it, because that gives the process genuine legitimacy."
"Within this context, we must stress certain points of the resolution that we are presenting today."
"Firstly, the 153 countries are being asked to forward their reports to the Secretary-General of the United Nations indicating what they believe the treaty should contain, its scope and, in particular, their opinion with regard to its viability."
"Secondly, those reports should be based on current international legislation, particularly with regard to international humanitarian law and human rights in general."
"There are important existing treaties that must be taken into account."
"Thirdly, the governments of the States must commit themselves to carrying out a thorough study of the degree of compliance and, above all, of non-compliance with the current rules, international embargos and, in the case of Europe, strict application of the Code of Conduct on arms exports."
"One of the cases that deserves to be highlighted in particular is that of arms exports to Sudan, an issue that we will discuss specifically during the July part-session."
"Fourthly, the governments must also pay attention and give every possible support to the setting up of a group of experts that will have to be created in 2008 with a view to defining the content of the treaty."
"Finally, we must be aware that, although the process of drawing up an international treaty on the transfer of weapons is already under way, it will be a slow process, and in the mean time arms sales in the world are still increasing."
"According to the SIP, in 2005, sales, around a third of which come from the European Union, rose to USD 290 000 million."
"In the mean time, therefore, we must be particularly rigorous and demanding with regard to the existing control mechanisms and pay particular attention to the control of intermediaries, compliance with embargos and increasing the transparency and parliamentary control of those exports."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (DE) Mr President, I warmly welcome the fact that we have this joint motion for a resolution on an international arms-trade treaty, because time is running out, as arms expenditure and arms exports spiral throughout the world."
"According to the study conducted by SIPRI, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the equivalent of EUR 900 billion was devoted to military spending last year, which represents EUR 137 for every man, woman and child on the planet."
"That was three and a half per cent more than in 2005."
"Over the past ten years, global arms expenditure has increased by 37%."
"As for the international arms trade, in its new Yearbook of Armaments, Disarmament and International Security, SIPRI reports a 50% increase in the volume of trade since 2002."
"Once again, the United States and Russia have been far and away the top arms exporters."
"Germany, with USD 9.2 billion - EUR 6.9 billion - between 2002 and 2006, has pushed past France into third place."
"Member States of the EU are up there among the global leaders when it comes to arms exports."
"Last year alone, Germany's arms exports were worth USD 3.9 billion, more than double the 2005 amount of USD 1.5 billion."
"France has armed Sudan, and Belgium is supplying weapons to the autocrat Joseph Kabila in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, partly so that he can massacre the opposition."
"Once a conflict has been fuelled, along comes the EU with its military missions in Africa - in the Congo, Sudan and so on. The fire-fighters are dousing the flames with petrol."
"It is high time the EU and its Member States put a stop to these deals."
"Arms exports are violating human rights all over the world."
"Arms exports are killing people all over the world."
"Let us finally put an end to this traffic in death."
"(LT) Mr President, the European Union, which always speaks for conflict resolution by negotiation rather than by force, is interested in muzzling the unrestricted growth of business in trading instruments of death."
"Last year, as has been mentioned, EUR 900 billion was spent for military purposes."
"This is EUR 137 per capita for the total population of the world."
"On the basis of military spending, we are back in the Cold War."
"Almost half of this enormous sum is made up by the United States' expenditure on military armaments."
"The scope of spending on weaponry is growing dangerously, having reached almost EUR 40 billion last year."
"The largest exporters in recent years have been the United States and Russia, each one accounting for 30% of the global arms trade, with the EU not far behind at 20%."
"The greatest concern is caused by the flow of ultra-modern weapons to conflict-torn regions in unpredictable countries."
"Last year 153 countries supported a United Nations resolution on a process to create a treaty on Trade in Arms."
"For the moment it is difficult for all countries to agree on a legally binding document that would provide for the international regulation of imports and exports of weapons; however, steps in that direction in the United Nations are essential."
"At the same time, it must be stressed that individual countries are the first-line combatants against irresponsible arms trading and the damage it wreaks on peace, security, development and human rights."
"The international community, and likewise the public of any country that uses arms trade for dealings in dangerous and corrupt ventures, has a duty to bring appropriate pressure on such governments and parliaments."
"(NL) Mr President, every year, approximately one million people are wounded by hand-guns, machine guns or grenade launchers."
"The extent of firearm violence globally is enormous, as is the human suffering."
"In recent armed conflicts, small lightweight firearms are often the only weapons that are used."
"In southern Africa alone, some 30 million light firearms are in circulation; in the Middle East, estimates range from 60 to 110 million."
"The majority of these weapons are produced and sold legally."
"For dozens of years, international Treaties have been in place to control biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and their spread, but despite the enormous number of fatalities, this is not yet the case for the sale of and trade in conventional weapons."
"This results in human rights violations, long-term wars and countries that are becoming more impoverished."
"The large majority of these weapons are produced by five rich countries."
"In 2005 Russia, the US, France, Germany and Great Britain jointly accounted for 81% of the worldwide arms trade."
"More than two thirds of these weapons are intended for Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America."
"Not only human lives are being destroyed, also economies, infrastructure, health care and education."
"In Northern Uganda alone, 2 500 children have not attended school during the last 20 years of armed violence."
"The UN resolution of 6 December 2006 sets the scene for a treaty against this free circulation and in favour of control of the trade as a whole."
"This is, of course, of the utmost importance if we want to curb conventional weapons."
"I would therefore urge the Council - and I gather from the acting Chairman, Mr Gloser, that something is being done - to get a massive, rapid and positive response from Europe and, for our part, to tackle the serious shortcomings in the application of the European code of conduct from 1998."
"EU weapons still wheedle their way into countries such as Sudan, China and Sierra Leone."
"It is high time we made this code legally binding, as this would give the UN process an enormous shot in the arm."
"Mr President, last year I spent two weeks in the Democratic Republic of Congo on behalf of this Parliament."
"Four million people died in their civil war and, of course, an international arms embargo on that country failed to prevent arms from all over the world - including from Germany and France, for which there is clear evidence - getting into that country and contributing to the strife that took place."
"There cannot be a more graphic example of why the international community needs to do more to enforce its will and its values in this area."
"As we say in our resolution, we want to see a comprehensive, rigorous and fully implemented arms trade treaty."
"The European Union can play a pivotal role in the international community to make sure that the text achieves just that."
"I am very proud that the European Parliament text put before us today refers to the arms trade causing 'unacceptable human suffering and exacerbating conflict, instability and terrorism'."
"I thank Mr Gloser, the German Presidency and the Council for taking a similarly tough line in their resolution and speaking of 'an undesirable and irresponsible proliferation of conventional arms'."
"Let us carry those words through so that we really can influence what is happening in the United Nations."
"The next stage must be to engage civil society."
"I think we are in our present position as a result of those NGO campaigns of the mid-1990s that were finally successful in working with us to get the EU Code of Conduct."
"I am very proud that experts at the Lauterpacht Centre at Cambridge University in my own constituency drew up the first draft of this treaty to be put forward to the international community."
"I appeal to parliamentarians to sign the declaration in favour of the Treaty on the controlarms.org website."
"Our work with civil society to engage the people of this world for a strong treaty is essential."
"Finally, I am very proud that my own country, the UK, together with Finland, proposed this in the United Nations and that every single EU Member State has submitted its willing support to the UN."
"We should be proud of Europe too."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council I would like to express my sincere thanks to you for your contributions and suggestions but also for the initiatives you have taken on this very important matter as well as for the warnings that were sounded by some speakers."
"Let me just respond to two points."
"Firstly, unless human rights and international humanitarian law are being respected in the recipient country, arms exports can never be licensed."
"I have stressed that we are engaged worldwide at various levels in promoting respect for human rights."
"That is another matter which has often been on the agenda of this Parliament."
"The right to life, the prohibition of slavery, political and social participatory rights, equality before the law, freedom of speech and assembly and the prohibition of discrimination continue to be flouted in too many countries of this world."
"It is therefore our duty to ensure that these violations of fundamental values are not fostered by the supply of armaments."
"Secondly, there is the issue of embargos."
"The United Nations Security Council, the OECD and the European Union have imposed embargos on a number of countries, and the present draft resolution of the European Parliament places special emphasis on the need to uphold the embargo against Sudan."
"It is absolutely essential that observance of embargos be made one of the key criteria for export licensing in an arms-trade treaty."
"It is no coincidence that this criteria is listed at the very start of the catalogue of criteria in the EU Code of Conduct."
"I can assure you that we shall continue to make every effort during our presidency to secure an effective arms-trade treaty."
"The key role that the European Parliament is playing in this discussion has also been a great source of help and support."
"I hope we shall be able to maintain this cooperative approach throughout the subsequent presidencies."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I thank Parliament for its support, for its initiative and for its motion for a resolution."
"As I mentioned before, the Commission, as part of wider EU efforts, strongly supports the opening of negotiations on a legally binding arms trade treaty, within the UN framework - this is important to highlight."
"An international instrument promoting high standards of responsibility is clearly desirable and, for this enterprise to be successful, we need to build the broadest possible consensus and encourage all states to support this initiative."
"We would wish it to be a legally binding, separate and self-standing initiative that would cover all conventional arms transfers, set out the principles defining illegal transfers, include monitoring and be broadly based."
"We know that it will not be easy to persuade all suppliers worldwide, and it will therefore be very important for all the major arms producers to avoid having a situation such as we had with the ICC or with the mine ban treaty."
"We will, therefore, seek the broadest possible consensus."
"I have received a motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 103(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 21 June 2007."
"MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation, implementation and control."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, there are many reasons at present which make the report we are debating today highly important and topical."
"The poor results of the Euro-Mediterranean process and, at the same time, the huge challenges in this area are forcing us to take serious stock and adopt serious policies and financial commitments."
"The tragic situation in the Palestinian territories is getting worse and developments are sounding the alarm for a deterioration in the situation and calling on us to take stock of our actions and become aware of our responsibilities for the future."
"We also have to give convincing answers to the concerns of European citizens about the management of resources in areas which are lagging behind in democratic commitments and management and evaluation mechanisms."
"I should like to remind the House that the MEDA programme is our principal financial instrument for the implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership supporting measures for the political chapter and the economic chapter, in the aim of creating a free trade zone, and for the cultural and social chapter which forms the third pillar."
"MEDA II, which is the most recent MEDA programme we have applied, was scheduled to provide the sum of EUR 5.3 billion from 2000 to 2006."
"The MEDA regulation came to an end in 2006 and today we have a new European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument which entered into effect in 2007 and we believe that our experience from MEDA will be very useful for the new instrument."
"I should like to remind the House that annual commitments under MEDA ŒôŒô, to which most of our report is devoted, varied between EUR 569 million in 2000 and EUR 697 million in 2004."
"In other words, there was a steady increase, although we need to bear in mind that between MEDA Œô and MEDA ŒôŒô our commitments increased for Palestine, Syria, Algeria and Morocco and for the regional activities, but decreased for Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia."
"Similarly, increases varied according to implementation sector."
"There was a marked increase in funding for actions which include education, training and economic institutional support, while less funds were committed for other sectors, such as agriculture, local development and private reforms under MEDA IŒô than under MEDA Œô."
"In light of our experience in the European Parliament and the information received and the report by the Court of Auditors, the Commission's management of the MEDA programme has clearly improved since the early years and we can say that, given the political circumstances that play their role in the area, the evaluation is satisfactory and a great deal of effort was made, gradually resulting in an even allocation of resources, with shorter preparation times and faster disbursement."
"We might urge the European Commission to take account in future activities of the fact that there is a steady increase in the number of projects and programmes, that there is an even larger share of budget support in the total programme, that the role played by our offices and the apportionment of responsibilities at local level has been judged satisfactory and important and must be increased and that cooperation with the local authorities played a role and we must enhance this."
"We must also do whatever we can to enhance cooperation between the Mediterranean countries (South-South partners) in order to achieve the much sought-after objective of regional cooperation and integration."
"As far as the funding sectors are concerned, we take the view that the economic aspect of the partnership must be directed towards social cohesion and sustainable economic development, not forgetting that overall monitoring and enhanced action in all sectors are needed if we are to achieve our objectives."
"The question of funding for Palestine is an important part of our report and was the subject of increased interest on the part of our honourable friends."
"From 1994 to 2006 the Commission provided about EUR 2 300 million to the Palestinian people."
"Payments to Palestinian areas have been quite stable at between EUR 232 and 260 million from 2002 to 2005."
"In 2006 alone, EUR 700 million was provided, which is our record so far."
"As we know from the decision by the Quartet on 9 May 2006, we have the temporary international mechanism and the European Commission used this mechanism to deliver the sum of EUR 107.5 million to its three windows, one for emergencies, one for infrastructure and one for payments to the poorest, vulnerable social groups."
"Our committee has considered our relations with the Palestinian Authority and the best way of addressing requirements, both for political and economic aid to the Palestinian Authority per se and for channelling humanitarian aid and, in order to update the report, I have proposed two oral amendments, one to paragraph 38, which is now out of date and can be deleted or radically amended and one new paragraph referring to the Council decisions both on support for the new government and on the commitment through the international mechanism to take the action needed for humanitarian aid to Gaza."
"I wish to state that our political group supports our undertaking and I believe that I also have the support of the rest of the House on this new paragraph."
"(Applause)"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, ladies and gentlemen, let me express my sincere thanks to the rapporteur."
"We have analysed the recommendations and largely agree with Parliament's assessment of the MEDA programme and, of course, with its conclusions."
"The report concludes that the support provided by the MEDA programme served its intended purpose and rendered an important contribution to the achievement of the MEDA objectives."
"It also recognises that the aid was consistent with the development plans and needs of the recipient countries."
"I want to be quite emphatic about that, because I still recall certain discussions."
"The Council acknowledges the Commission's efforts, which have led to perceptible improvements in the speed and efficiency of planning within the MEDA II framework."
"The MEDA programme has now been completed, and the first of January 2007 marked the switch to the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument."
"The ENPI is a tailor-made instrument for the implementation of the European neighbourhood policy."
"The European Parliament has called for the development of cooperation among Europe's partner countries in the Mediterranean region, and this is being done through the ENPI Southern regional programme, to which EUR 343.3 million is being allocated by 2010."
"We share your view that the continued pursuit of the Barcelona process is of vital importance to the whole region."
"The fact that we have managed, in spite of the tensions in the region, to address substantive issues and make further progress together shows that the Barcelona process, our Euro-Mediterranean dialogue, is still the right framework for the pursuit of change in the Mediterranean region."
"The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly makes an important contribution to closer North-South relations through its interparliamentary dialogue."
"All of us, whether in civil society, government or parliament and in spite of our diverse structures and responsibilities, have the aim of nurturing our partnership with the Mediterranean region and the will to work together to that end."
"Let me now move on to the part of the report that deals with financial assistance for the Palestinians."
"Before discussing the report, however, I would like to mention that we have been following the latest developments in the Palestinian territories, and especially in the Gaza Strip, with deep concern."
"The violent clashes between Fatah and the radical Islamist movement Hamas in the past week have claimed more than 100 lives and left many people with serious injuries."
"The Hamas militias have effectively taken control of the territory, using brute force against the legitimate national security forces, civilians and aid workers."
"In this situation, President Mahmoud Abbas has been compelled to dissolve the Unity Government, declare a state of emergency and appoint an emergency government."
"The deal that was struck between the Palestinian factions with Saudi Arabian help in Mecca in February has thus collapsed, and the involvement of Hamas in the government of the country has been ended."
"The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, which was difficult enough before, has further deteriorated."
"The hospitals are completely overcrowded and are short of medical supplies."
"The vast majority of the population of Gaza are dependent on food aid."
"Aid organisations have had to suspend some of their activities because they fear for the safety of their staff - and rightly so, I am sorry to say, as was shown by the deaths of two UNRWA workers caught in crossfire during gun battles."
"At Monday's meeting of the General Affairs Council, the Foreign Ministers of the European Union called for an immediate end to the violence and assured President Abbas of their full support for his decisions."
"They decided to resume normal relations immediately with the new government under Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and declared their intention to create conditions in which the provision of direct financial and practical assistance could also be resumed."
"The Foreign Ministers also reaffirmed that they did not wish to leave the people of the Gaza Strip without humanitarian assistance in their present distress."
"Other conclusions that may have to be drawn in the light of the new situation are currently being discussed."
"The introduction by the European Union of the temporary international funding mechanism TIM in June 2006 has played a significant part in meeting the most urgent needs of the beleaguered Palestinian population."
"The structure of TIM is transparent, and the mechanism has proved to be a flexible and effective instrument."
"Last year alone, the European Commission and the Member States provided more than 300 million euros' worth of direct aid to the Palestinian population through TIM and are continuing to make their payments in the present situation, in which these funds have become even more crucial."
"This needs to be underlined and emphasised time and again, because a different picture is occasionally painted, even in the media."
"For this reason we also welcome the decision of the Middle East Quartet to extend the TIM mandate for another three months until the end of September."
"In your report you rightly call on Israel to release the tax and customs revenue it has been withholding from the Palestinians."
"The European Union has also made repeated calls to this effect, most recently in the conclusions adopted by the General Affairs Council at its meeting on 18 June."
"The Israeli Government has announced - as you know, we had talks with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni - that it is now ready to release the funds."
"We very much hope that this will give the Palestinian economy a desperately needed boost too."
"This is another area in which the prospect of a political solution depends on a perceptible improvement."
"The European Union is already active in another area to which you referred, namely the essential reform of public finances, including financial control and auditing."
"The Commission is assisting the Palestinian Ministry of Finance in the ongoing development of transparent structures for the Palestinian budget."
"The aim of the European Union is, and will remain, two states - Israel and Palestine - living side by side in peace with each other and with their neighbours in the region."
"We want to help in the long-term creation of better living conditions for the Palestinians instead of engaging in crisis management."
"The last few weeks have made it crystal-clear why this is an urgent necessity."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her excellent report."
"It comes at a key moment as it concerns cooperation with the southern Mediterranean area, whilst the strengthened Neighbourhood Policy is also being implemented."
"I shall speak first about the main findings before turning to the current situation in the Palestinian Territories and our response to that."
"Firstly, with regard to the performance of MEDA over the last 10 years, I am pleased about Parliament's positive appreciation of how this programme has contributed to realising the objectives of the Barcelona Declaration."
"Further progress can and should still be achieved, but I share Parliament's view that the Barcelona Process remains the most appropriate framework for the Mediterranean policy."
"This process is now supported by the Neighbourhood Policy which will help to develop bilateral relations and put into practice many of the aspirations of the Barcelona agenda."
"In terms of effectiveness and thoroughness, the findings of Parliament and those of the Court of Auditors encourage the Commission to continue further improving its performance."
"It is clear that we will also take into account the different suggestions from the two institutions."
"I undertake to continue the efforts of the Commission in this regard, and we have already launched a final evaluation of the MEDA Regulation."
"The results should be available in early 2008."
"All our efforts need to be seen in the context of the ongoing and progressive management improvements which have been introduced by the Commission since 2001."
"I entirely share Parliament's view on the issues of fostering greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development."
"Equally, I share your willingness to pursue the objectives of the Barcelona Process as identified in the report."
"We have taken numerous initiatives in this regard through thematic support, for instance in the areas of good governance, democracy and gender."
"Lastly, as regards visibility, I have made a great personal priority of visibility, on which we are making progress."
"Your report, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, clearly analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the MEDA programme."
"It acknowledges the improvements that have been achieved, but also points out where it is still necessary to make further progress."
"The new ENPI regulation, in force since the beginning of this year, offers enormous new opportunities."
"Therefore, we are looking forward to continued dialogue and your constructive support."
"Turning to the current situation in the Palestinian Territories, we are more than ever at a critical juncture."
"We are following the situation day to day, even hour to hour, and for the moment we are addressing the urgent needs and will probably have to continue doing so."
"As our Council President said at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday, we had a long and intensive discussion on the Middle East."
"There was broad agreement on the need to support President Abbas and his new government led by Prime Minister Fayyad."
"This has also been the line taken by the Quartet."
"It has already been said that the EU will resume normal relations with this government immediately."
"At the same time, we cannot abandon the humanitarian needs of the population in Gaza, and we will never let the Palestinian population down."
"With regard to assistance, there was a strong wish to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial support."
"That includes: extending the emergency relief under the Temporary International Mechanism for another three months, this time with the complete cooperation of Salam Fayyad; continuing humanitarian assistance, including to Gaza; exploring options to relaunch direct financial support, including the building of institutions; supporting the Palestinian civilian police through the resumption of the EUPOL COPPS; and hopefully resuming the EU Border Assistance Mission, EU BAM Rafah."
"I made it clear to the Council and to Prime Minister Fayyad that resuming direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority implies certain technical conditions - that means controlling conditions - in terms of audit control and verification."
"I can tell you that we are already in touch with Prime Minister Fayyad and his staff on how this can be achieved."
"Indeed, a meeting took place yesterday with my head of delegation and the Prime Minister."
"As a first step, we intend to pay EUR 22 million directly from a reserve to help towards clearing the arrears of the Palestinian Authority, particularly to the private sector so that it sees there is some movement."
"The TIM will also continue for the moment to channel funds vital for the Palestinians in both an accountable and transparent way."
"It will operate, as I say, in support of the Fayyad Government as of now."
"In this regard, let me thank you and welcome the political agreement on the extra EUR 90 million for the TIM."
"I also hope that the procedures for adoption can be accelerated."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has already said, the most important thing is that the withheld Palestinian funds, for which we have called so often on the Israelis to release, will hopefully finally be sent to the government of Mahmoud Abbas."
"Finally, let me take this occasion to thank Parliament once again for its support, which has been, and will continue to be, essential."
"Under the TIM, a European initiative, we have provided high levels of support reaching more than one million Palestinians - medicines, hospital supplies, fuel for essential public services, allowances both for the poor and the public sector."
"That would not have been possible without your support, and now for the future we also need your support for all the items I have just mentioned."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - (FR) Mr President, this excellent report by Mrs Kratsa, whom I thank for her work, contains two important statements."
"Firstly, the aid given to Palestine since 2003 has been well managed and without fraud."
"That is an essential element, which will silence the persistent and groundless rumours about corruption in the executive team."
"Secondly, the temporary aid mechanism put in place after the sanctions in 2006 against the Hamas government has not, alas, despite the sums invested, succeeded in preventing a humanitarian tragedy with an increase in infant mortality, the appearance of new diseases and extreme poverty in the occupied territories."
"Having said that, since the emergency government was set up and the National Unity Government was dissolved, aid seems miraculously to have been reestablished and even the taxes withheld by the Israelis could be paid back to the new government."
"I am delighted."
"While the country, however, plunged in civil war, is divided in two, this spectacular turnaround demands that we look at things differently."
"The European Union has been responsible for its policy in the Middle East since January 2006."
"This policy is aimed at isolating Hamas and depriving it of its electoral victory."
"It has ignored the advances of its political platform, on which the National Unity Government was built; it has refused to condemn Israel for taking and imprisoning 45 Palestinian Members of Parliament."
"Today, the extremists have won and a no-go area has been established in the region."
"Any faith in justice and democracy is dead for Palestinians and the image of the European Union tarnished for a long time."
"No, of course, we do not support today the activities of Hamas."
"We condemn them."
"When chaos takes over, however, when civil war breaks out, it is the time of bloodshed and outrage and I would say that we have contributed to bringing about this chaos."
"Months ago the European Parliament raised cries of alarm that the NGOs were calling for help."
"Even the UN is no longer silent. Read the do Santos report."
"We are accountable for this disaster in the eyes of international opinion, and if the United States has had the courage of a Baker-Hamilton Commission to examine their policy in Iraq, I am asking today for the setting up of a Parliamentary commission to assess our European policy in the Middle East and its consequences today."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, may I express our sincere thanks to the rapporteur."
"It is rather a pity for your report that it is now entirely overshadowed by a single issue, namely whether or not it is reasonable to keep putting money into this difficult region now that the whole focus is on Palestine."
"I would like to thank you for your sterling work, because we believe that we still have far more to learn from past experiences for our future programmes."
"Commissioner, one of my requests would be that we do not let major disruptions occur in our programmes in future."
"The EU specialises in complete makeovers after seven years."
"I believe the budgetary controllers could achieve far more progress in the long term if we could rely on greater continuity in our programmes."
"We can see today that our rapporteur's report was overtaken by events several times."
"She took a lot of trouble with this difficult issue, particularly as regards Palestine, with visits to the region and an investigative report by OLAF as well as hours of discussion on what is surely the most troublesome area of the world."
"For the third time, we are confronted by the question whether it is reasonable to put EU money into that area."
"In spite of the reservations of many of my fellow members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, we decided in committee that it was reasonable, chiefly on humanitarian grounds, because we were aware of the good that had been done locally with this money, and we knew that the funds would be sorely missed if they were no longer available."
"Two days ago the Council also answered this question once again."
"We would like to issue a reminder that, as the budgetary legislator and the discharging authority, the European Parliament is sitting in the same boat."
"We do want to support the lawful Palestinian Government, and we naturally have no wish to turn our backs on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but precisely because a civil war is taking place there, the European Commission has a special duty of accountability to us and must come to terms with its obligation to give us this account of its stewardship, particularly in view of the fact that budgetary aid is the riskiest form of support."
"I was pleased to hear Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner's assurances that EU funds would be increasingly linked to successful reform policies in that part of the world too, for there is one thing we find inexcusable: for humanitarian and political as well as economic reasons, we cannot tolerate our assistance being systematically undone time and again."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, Mrs De Keyser, ladies and gentlemen, we are here to discuss the report by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on the European Court of Auditors' report on MEDA, the European programme on the countries of the Southern Mediterranean."
"The report before us focuses in particular on Community aid granted to Palestine."
"The Court of Auditors' report did not cover aid to Palestine."
"The only European institution to have carried out a thorough analysis of this financial mechanism, the Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), has refused to reveal its report. The members of the Committee on Budgetary Control have not been shown the report, not even confidentially."
"That being the case, we cannot make any guarantees on the proper use of Community funds in the country."
"Politically, however, we are faced with a serious dilemma; on the one hand, to provide development cooperation and humanitarian aid to people who are victims of leaders who have little or no regard for their well-being, and, on the other, to ensure that Community funds are not diverted for the purpose of purchasing arms, terrorism, propaganda, indoctrinating children in particular, racism, xenophobia and hate, and suicide bombings, as has come to light in the case of funds granted to Lebanon."
"This is a question of the highest importance that requires a robust political response, based on the humanitarian conviction that all human beings are entitled to life, regardless of the religion or ethnicity to which they or their forebears belong; that is to say, a policy that is able to stand up to demagogy and hypocrisy."
"I therefore wish to applaud most warmly this morning's gesture by the Israeli authorities to grant free passage to the West Bank to hundreds of Palestinian refugees who spent several days blocked in the Eretz tunnels, having escaped from the wave of terror sweeping Gaza."
"I should also like to make a sincere, fraternal call to the Israeli and Egyptian authorities to make as much effort as possible to work together with international forces and with the new Palestinian Government appointed by President Abbas to rescue the Palestinians escaping persecution in Gaza, which has already cost the lives of many Gaza inhabitants."
"I hope we can count, as on many occasions before, on the collaboration of the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) to help alleviate the suffering in Gaza, provided this does not stop ECHO from carrying out no less urgent humanitarian actions to help Iraqi refugees not only in Syria and Jordan but also in Egypt, Lebanon and various Gulf countries."
"Palestine is at the moment being targeted by a fanatical ideology that uses religion to conceal its greed for power and that is currently laying waste to Lebanon and Iraq."
"Anyone who still refuses to grasp this reality will once again have to face facts that it was impossible to predict."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Gloser, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly thanking the rapporteur, Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou, for her report."
"The section on MEDA in particular has been very well formulated and highlights all the steps that will have to be taken."
"Congratulations on a truly solid piece of work!"
"In the light of events and since time is short, I intend to confine myself to TIM, the aid fund for the Palestinians."
"The draft report shows clearly that the Commissioner has pulled off a real master stroke here."
"I congratulate you on that, Commissioner, because the EU had been compelled to call a complete halt to its aid payments to the Palestinian Authority."
"We had no option."
"We cannot assist terrorists."
"We never have done in the past, and we never should."
"There is always a duty to act, however, when individual suffering occurs."
"With TIM the European Union has found a solution that meets the high moral standards applied by Europeans to the payment of aid."
"In these circumstances, I believe that, while criticism of minor accounting errors and inaccuracies should be noted, it certainly must not be made the focus of this debate."
"After all, we are dealing here with a project that was put together somewhat hastily."
"We all know that we were subject to certain constraints."
"I do not agree with the critical undertone regarding the Israeli strategy of suspending the release of tax revenue."
"We cannot blame the Israelis for not having run after the terrorists with the money, and for that reason we should let the matter rest."
"Besides, subsequent events have shown that it was right to keep back the money as security, since it can now doubly benefit President Abbas and the forces of moderation."
"In this context I must also commend Israel's decision to open the Erez border crossing on humanitarian grounds, thereby directly helping the Palestinians who were fleeing from Hamas."
"In conclusion, let me express my gratitude to the aid workers on the ground, for aid has to be delivered to the local people."
"The European Parliament is grateful for the humanitarian mission they are accomplishing."
"Theirs is no easy task."
"Our sincere thanks go to them."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Œöratsa-Tsagaropoulouon her hard work, even though I disagree on certain issues."
"I do not agree with Mr Chatzimarkakis; I will oppose Mr Chatzimarkakis and I will point out your responsibilities, Commissioner, as a representative of the Commission, for the chaotic situation prevailing today in Palestine."
"You are responsible because you did not allow a procedure for channelling any financial aid to a government called National Unity to work."
"Furthermore, you alone are responsible for the present situation, because you insisted - selectively and groundlessly - on circumventing the institutional channels and the direct channelling of financial aid to a national unity government which had accepted the agreements of the PLO and, as such, met the Quartet's preconditions."
"And lastly, from now on, we must be clear that under no circumstances can the resumption of direct financial relations depend on terms which split the Palestinians and serve Israel's expansionist policy."
"I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to acknowledge your responsibilities and to assume them."
"(MT) Thank you Mr President, I too would like to join my colleagues in congratulating Vice President Kratsa for her extremely interesting report."
"This report is especially important and useful at this particular time, because this is a time when we are facing the challenge of how to send out a message of hope in a situation that seems completely hopeless."
"This is the challenge ahead of us, and our answer, despite everything, should be that we are still persevering in our efforts and that we must take heart."
"I am in no doubt, Commissioner, that in your enthusiasm this is exactly what you are doing; that you continue to be our ray of hope in these difficult circumstances."
"That is why we support the initiatives you have adopted, such as the TIM mechanism, which we now know will be renewed."
"You have our full support because we feel that this mechanism will cater for the basic requirements."
"You also have our backing when it comes to the ability to provide direct assistance to the Palestinian authorities, naturally on condition that financial transparency is guaranteed, because it is the duty of this Parliament to ensure that the money is spent in a transparent manner."
"It is a pity that we do not have time to talk about the other aspects of the Mediterranean because we know that the MEDA funds were spent in other countries and that they were spent in a way worthy of praise."
"For example, the rate at which the money was spent in countries such as Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia has improved greatly over time."
"Mr President, I want to thank Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for an important report, which reflects the excellent work the European Union is doing through the MEDA programme."
"I have one caveat, however, relating to recital N, which does not reflect the realpolitik of the situation following the formation of the National Unity Government."
"I believe that particular reference should be amended to more accurately make that reflection."
"The European Union and the Quartet did not respond quickly or pragmatically enough, in my view, to the achievement of the formation of the Unity Government by the democratically elected representatives of the Palestinians."
"I believe that this failure on our part was the straw that broke the camel's back."
"We now have a coup d'√©tat in Gaza which threatens the longed-for peaceful future of the Palestinian people."
"Yes, it has to be condemned, but any novice politician could have predicted this development."
"Indeed, many of us who are more long-toothed did so last month in this very House."
"After 40 years of brutal occupation and constant humiliation by the Israeli authorities, coupled with the world's refusal world to act in accordance with its own democratic norms and to recognise the democratic choice of Palestinians, it is not surprising that Palestine is undergoing this crisis now."
"Even at this late stage, Europe must seek to act in partnership with all the elected representatives of the Palestinian people to restore confidence in politics, in negotiations and in elections."
"We must do what we can to help restore law and order, which is just as important to the Palestinian people at present as humanitarian aid."
"(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union has dedicated a lot of time, effort and budgetary aid to cooperation amongst the countries of the Mediterranean."
"The two MEDA programmes add up to more than EUR 7 000 million in commitments and more than EUR 600 million per year."
"We believe that the MEDA actions have been one of the European Union's great successes and they have contributed not just to economic development but also, crucially, to democratic development and the defence of human rights throughout the Mediterranean Basin."
"I believe that the majority of the entire network of civil society associations in the Mediterranean countries owe their existence to the work of the MEDA programme."
"We are therefore very proud that the execution of all the aspects of this programme is very good."
"Palestine has always been controversial from a budgetary point of view; it is the aspect of the MEDA programme that creates most conflict."
"Direct aid to Palestine is very difficult to control, as certain Members have said, both in terms of its destination and in terms of its application."
"I would like to mention that during the last term in office we had a committee of inquiry on direct budgetary aid, of which I myself was a member."
"Its results and conclusions led to a series of doctrines and measures that, amongst other things, made it possible to create this transitional intervention mechanism."
"Of course, today we are faced with a situation in which the humanitarian and political reality goes beyond any budgetary aid predictions we could make from the point of view of budgetary control."
"I therefore share this Parliament's practically unanimous view and we are entirely in agreement with this vote of confidence in the Palestinian Government."
"We know that direct budgetary aid is very difficult to control, but we are expressing our confidence so that, with everybody's help, we can move ahead with it."
"(PT) Mr President, although the MEDA programme is quite new, it has already had positive results on the ground, on the other side of the Mediterranean."
"There is some way to go, however, before it becomes genuinely effective and is recognised by the people who benefit from it either directly or indirectly."
"Having seen at first hand what MEDA has done in Gaza and the West Bank, I welcome many of the suggestions made by Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou in this report, and I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate her."
"I agree that support and efforts need to be targeted at specific areas, but should be expanded to cover other areas that may prove fruitful in the short term without major investment, as in the case of microcredit."
"We are going through a period of change in Palestine, which should, at the earliest opportunity, be the precursor to the resumption of international financial aid and ultimately to the end of Israel's illegal confiscation of customs revenue from a people and a government that is literally being strangled, without food, without economic revenue and without a future to fight for."
"Salam Fayad has given us guarantees of political competence and responsibility."
"It is up to us, the European Union, to give them the resources, both via financial aid that we channel into the territories and by lifting the blockade on the movement of persons, goods and services in the West Bank - any multiplier effect arising from this aid is rendered useless by the blockade."
"For this to happen what is needed is a proactive, rather than reactive, European Union."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, may I once again express my special thanks to the rapporteur but also to all of you for the debate and your contributions, which have certainly underlined how important it was to launch the Barcelona process more than ten years ago and to formulate a policy for that purpose."
"It was also an attempt to find new instruments."
"Some of you made clear that the MEDA programme also served to promote improvements in the political situation and infrastructure in our partner countries."
"When we look at certain countries on the southern fringes of the Mediterranean, it sadly becomes apparent that a good few aims have not yet been achieved."
"Some of you referred to the need for greater efficiency here."
"The continuation of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, however, will play a major part in consolidating this Euro-Mediterranean dialogue."
"Allow me to return to the point about the particular situation of the Palestinians."
"Several of you emphasised that the Commissioner had found a way through this difficult situation, and for that she was rightly praised."
"It is also important to say that we must help, but when we do help - and sometimes our approach will be driven by pragmatism - the procedure must not suddenly come under fire after three months."
"I do believe, Commissioner, that a way has been found in which we can actually provide help in the current situation."
"As I said yesterday at the meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, there is certainly a need to distinguish a little between cause and effect."
"The European Union has repeatedly said how it intends to support the process in the wider Middle East, but it has also said that its recognition of newly elected governments depends on the fulfilment of certain criteria, namely renunciation of violence, adherence to the Road Map and acceptance of the State of Israel, all of which are long-established requirements."
"It is important to be aware of that."
"We too have made corresponding efforts, of course."
"I would not keep putting all the blame on insufficient recognition of governments or on inadequate resources."
"In the Council of Foreign Ministers the European Union has just pressed for and secured an important pledge from Israel to release the frozen funds."
"That certainly involved negotiations with the Palestinians too."
"As the Commissioner stressed in the debate with the Foreign Ministers on Monday, very rapid results will be achieved here, because it is important to provide assistance both on the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, it is highly important to recognise that there is an important connection between MEDA and the new Neighbourhood Policy."
"It is true that we have achieved a great deal: the Mediterranean countries are now working together with us, for the first time, not only multilaterally but also bilaterally, i.e. not only the Mediterranean and Barcelona programmes but also bilaterally in the Neighbourhood Programme."
"The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is a special instrument which builds on MEDA as regards programming and implementation."
"However, we have tried to concentrate and focus a little more in order to increase efficiency."
"With regard to ECHO, Mr Michel, who is responsible for ECHO, has made everything possible;"
"EUR 60 million from ECHO funds has already been allocated this year to the Palestinians via UN organisations and NGOs."
"Allow me to speak briefly about OLAF."
"As you know, the Director-General mentioned that he has to respect the various rules and regulations of OLAF."
"At the same time, however, he has delivered a r√©sum√© of the main conclusions, around ten pages approximately, in a special report to the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"He has also offered to attend that committee to answer questions in a closed session."
"However, I must make it clear that this would concern money for the years 2001-2003 only and not the last period."
"Allow me to return to the difficult question of Palestine and of our funding there."
"First of all, you know that this is a European Union policy, not just a Commission policy, and therefore it is the Member States in unanimity which have decided on policy, and we have then tried to support this as much as we could."
"Therefore, when the National Unity Government was formed, it did not take us long;"
"I held my first meeting with Salam Fayyad the following week."
"I had already met him before he was in government, and we tried to see what could be done."
"It was he who said that we have to take some time: you have the Temporary International Mechanism so use it for the time being."
"However, I am obliged to issue an order to the Finance Ministry, to the single treasury account."
"He then also opened a special PLO account, but this was never the account that we used."
"This was intended to be used for money from the Arab countries, in particular, and perhaps also for Israeli money which, in the end, did not materialise."
"Therefore, it should be clear that this was an EU policy."
"Now there is a new situation, to which we reacted immediately, and so has and had the Quartet."
"I have just outlined what can be done as regards this policy."
"In response to the Member who mentioned micro-credits, we want to assist in jumpstarting the economy and, for that reason, we are paying arrears to the entrepreneurs from the EUR 22 million that was a reserve programme."
"This has not been done for a long time and we have now activated that, therefore we will also have good financial control over it."
"On the whole, we have done what we can and have always taken into consideration that the Palestinian people should not suffer."
"We try to at least assist them."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 21 June 2007."
"External dimension of the area of freedom, security and justice (debate)"
"The next item is the report (Œë6-0223/2007) by Mr Klich, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on an area of freedom, security and justice: Strategy on the external dimension, Action Plan implementing the Hague programme (2006/2111(ŒôŒùŒô)."
"rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, this report was initially supposed to be a review of the Commission's Communication from 2005 on the strategy drawn up by the Council that year."
"However, during the course of the work it turned out that great progress has been made in creating an area of internal security, freedom and justice and that the work has gained new momentum."
"New documents have been drawn up, new decisions have been made and new action has been taken."
"Our situation today is very different to a year and a half ago."
"That is why I have decided to look forward, rather than look back."
"This is also the attitude that both the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which have worked on this report on closer cooperation, should take."
"Therefore, it should not seem strange that the report actually amounts to a set of recommendations for the Commission and the Council."
"The report is based on two assumptions."
"First of all, in the modern world, internal and external security are intertwined, they influence each other and are really inextricably linked."
"Secondly, our legal systems and political attitude need to maintain a balance between civil liberties and the safety of our citizens."
"This means that if we want to ensure that our citizens are safe and free, both of these values must be promoted beyond the borders of the European Union, but a balance should always be struck between them."
"Thus, our foreign policy must always take into account these principles and adapt its instruments, namely our common positions and actions, bilateral and multilateral agreements, accordingly."
"In other words, we should, for example, include both anti-terrorist and human rights clauses in our agreements with third countries."
"In its current cooperation with these countries, the European Union should promote both respect for human rights and the joint fight against international terrorism."
"Here, in Parliament, we are also aware of the current limitations and barriers which restrict the effectiveness of the European Union in this field."
"They partly result from our complicated and unclear institutional structure, and partly from a lack of willingness to deepen European integration."
"Different procedures apply under each pillar to decisions concerning cooperation and external agreements."
"The joint Community police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters that we have been hearing about for a long time has yet to materialise."
"It must appear soon."
"We expect the forthcoming EU summit to lead to an international conference which will, by the end of the year, produce a new draft treaty and that this treaty will give the Union a legal personality, abolish the current pillar structure, reduce the number of categories that apply to legislation and simplify and unify decision-making procedures."
"However, before all this takes place, and before the treaty comes into force, as it may only come into force in 2009, the report proposes the application of a temporary clause, a passerelle, in accordance with Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, in the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and the policy on legal immigration and the integration of foreigners."
"This would allow the Council and all of us to introduce the new Community mechanisms into these very important fields."
"In view of the pressure of immigration on our southern borders and the threat of organised crime on our eastern borders, the failure to make these decisions would be a serious political mistake."
"As we are discussing the issue of borders, I would particularly like to draw the Commission's attention to paragraph 42, which mentions the need for a visa to enter the Unites States, and is particularly galling to European Union citizens."
"Once again, Parliament calls for this matter to be settled."
"Finally, I would like to warmly thank all of my collaborators, including those from my political group, the shadow rapporteurs from other political groups and Commissioner Franco Frattini, for their excellent and fruitful cooperation."
"Madam President, Vice-President Wallstr√∂m, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has set itself the task of providing its citizens with an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Union, however, cannot achieve this aim on its own."
"Free movement of persons and goods and Europe's economic strength and democratic stability have made the European Union a magnet for illegal immigration, organised crime, international drug-trafficking and even Islamist terrorism."
"This means that we must reflect on how we can develop the existing mechanisms and approaches in the field of justice and home affairs and, as the rapporteur just mentioned, integrate them into the external relations of the EU."
"I warmly welcome the great interest shown by the European Parliament in the external dimension of justice and home affairs and particularly in the aforementioned strategy, and the recommendations contained in your report, Mr Klich, provide important food for thought for the Council's deliberations on how to strengthen the role of the Union's policy on justice and home affairs in its external relations and make it even more effective."
"The strategy for the external dimension of our justice and home-affairs policy sets out the objectives and line of approach in detail."
"One element of our cooperation with countries outside the EU is the support provided by the European Union to institutions and to capacity-building efforts."
"This is a long-term task, and progress in its performance is discussed within the joint institutions."
"The direct neighbours of the European Union play a particularly important role with regard to the security of the Union."
"This is why the action plans adopted jointly with our partner states as part of the European neighbourhood policy contain very comprehensive chapters on cooperation in the domains of justice and home affairs."
"Among the countries involved in the European neighbourhood policy, Ukraine has a very special status, not only on account of its long common border with the EU."
"Cooperation with Ukraine in the fields of justice and home affairs is already far advanced."
"Another cornerstone was laid in Luxembourg on 11 June with the signing of a working agreement between Frontex and the Ukrainian border-guard service."
"In addition, visa-facilitation and readmission agreements were signed on 18 June."
"The Union attaches special importance to close cooperation with neighbouring regions in the realm of migration."
"On the basis of its Global Approach to Migration, the European Union has greatly intensified its cooperation with the countries of Africa and the Mediterranean region over the past year and a half."
"The results are encouraging."
"Only two days ago, on 18 June, the General Affairs Council decided to extend the Global Approach to Migration to the neighbouring regions on the eastern and southern borders of the EU."
"Besides our direct neighbours, cooperation in the realm of justice and home affairs assumes particular importance in the context of the European Union's relations with its strategic partners, the United States and Russia."
"Accordingly, the report also deals with many aspects of this partnership."
"In May 2005, Russia and the EU adopted four road maps for the creation of common areas."
"The common area of freedom, security and justice is the one in which the greatest progress has been achieved to date - a view shared by the Russian side."
"This, of course, includes the agreement on visas and readmission, which entered into force at the beginning of June."
"At the last EU-Russia meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, Wolfgang Sch√§uble, the German Minister of the Interior, also openly addressed the issue of the Russian security forces' heavy-handed response to the demonstrations staged by the opposition in talks with his Russian counterpart, Rashid Nurgaliyev."
"Shortly after the Troika meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers, the regular human-rights consultations with Russia also took place."
"During the German presidency, human-rights issues relating to Uzbekistan have also played a key role in the deliberations of the Subcommittee on Justice and Home Affairs."
"Our last meeting with the United States focused sharply on the fight against terrorism, visa issues and issues of data protection, including the transmission of airline passenger data."
"In the last few days the German Presidency has been continuing to do its utmost to bring about the conclusion of a new agreement on the transfer of passenger name records."
"The United States is not an easy negotiating partner, as we have learned from these discussions."
"In addition, the German Presidency has also brought Europe's two strategic partners, the United States and Russia, round the table to discuss common security challenges."
"These include combating the drug trade, fighting terrorism and managing border security."
"Another part of the report is devoted to the reinforcement of police and judicial cooperation."
"I believe the German Presidency has made considerable headway in improving cooperation within the European Union."
"Special mention should be made in this context of the agreement to bring many of the provisions of the Pr√ºm Convention into the legislative framework of the EU."
"Political agreement was also reached on the incorporation of Europol into the legal framework of the European Union."
"Frontex has also been considerably strengthened over the past six months."
"Let me also highlight the framework decision on exchanges of data from criminal records between Member States, which was referred to in the Klich report."
"The extent to which cooperation is possible with non-EU countries such as Russia depends on the level of data protection in those countries, and that will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis."
"Global threats and phenomena can only be effectively combated through international cooperation."
"This strategy for the external dimension of justice and home-affairs policy is therefore indispensable to the creation of an area of freedom, security and justice."
"The Council will continue to rely on close cooperation, conducted in a spirit of mutual trust, with the committee and the European Parliament in the implementation and further development of this strategy."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, undoubtedly we all agree on the principle by which people's fundamental rights and freedoms can know no territorial borders."
"Unfortunately, organised crime and terrorism know no borders either."
"It is for this reason, as the rapporteur and the President-in-Office of the Council have said, that there is a growing link between the internal and international dimensions of European Union policies in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"This means working together towards an important two-fold political objective: firstly, to strengthen an internal area of security guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms to citizens and residents of the European Union and a harmonisation of systems and rules to provide justice to those who need it, and secondly, to guarantee an international dimension that in some way provides an instrument for European Union foreign policy by strengthening the role of the law and the institutions, by promoting democratic values outside of our borders and by consolidating the institutions."
"These are ambitious foreign policy objectives for the European Union, to be achieved through measures on security on the one hand and respect for fundamental freedoms and rights on the other."
"These two values can and must go hand in hand."
"As has been said, there can be no contradiction between guaranteeing security for citizens and all human beings, and at the same time guaranteeing respect for their fundamental freedoms."
"I believe that these common values must form the basis for our agreements, relations and partnerships with non-EU countries."
"When Europe plays a role on the international stage our policies must therefore include the promotion of human rights and democracy."
"The report before us concerns fundamental matters that I fully support: improving democratic accountability, strengthening security and rights, guaranteeing citizens a higher level of protection against terrorism and organised crime, promoting cross-border cooperation among police forces and judicial authorities and developing an effective European Union immigration policy characterised by solidarity that must go beyond the borders of the European Union, a European asylum policy for those in need of international protection and a concerted effort to clamp down hard on people trafficking, which exploits the desperation of immigrants."
"We are already part-way to achieving all this."
"European immigration policy is growing."
"Over the last few weeks I have put forward documents to Parliament and to the Council on opening up to economic migration and circular migration, promoting mobility and thus abandoning the solely repressive approach to migration policy, although it remains essential to combat all forms of illegality."
"Just a few days ago I proposed a Green Paper on asylum policies, which will enable this Parliament and all interested parties to participate, so that by the beginning of next year I can present an action plan creating, as promised, a single European system on political refugee status by 2010."
"There are thus many issues regarding immigration and asylum policies in which Europe already plays a role in the international arena."
"I believe that the Euro-Mediterranean dimension of Europe should be further strengthened in this area, just as Europe plays a part in the east, as regards the Balkans, the Caucasus and relations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine."
"We are already conducting activities in various sectors in this region, from people trafficking to the fight against the sexual exploitation of children and women and the fight against cybercrime, another issue that obviously knows no boundaries or borders and which must be tackled at international level."
"Much has already been said on terrorism."
"Clearly, the fight against terrorism must continue using the means of the rule of law, but it is certainly necessary to pursue and improve international cooperation with the major world players."
"For this reason, I very much welcome the fact that the rapporteur has highlighted the importance of decision-making processes that enable the European Union to make its own decisions."
"I very much welcome the reference to Article 42 of the Treaty, known as the 'bridging clause', but I believe that it is extremely important not to waste the opportunity presented by the next European Council to discuss the future institutional framework of the European Union and not to forget that, in the area of security, justice and fundamental freedoms, Europe cannot remain at a standstill."
"Europe must have the means to make decisions quickly, effectively and with greater democratic legitimacy, for example by assigning a greater role to this Parliament and to the European Union Court of Justice."
"Finally, I would like to say a few words on Euro-Atlantic cooperation."
"As the President-in-Office of the Council has said, with the United States of America we have two sets of difficult negotiations in progress."
"One of these concerns the transfer of information on financial transactions, born out of the SWIFT affair, and the other concerns the transfer of information on passengers on flights to and from the United States."
"I hope that in both cases agreements can soon be reached guaranteeing both the certainty of our legal positions - therefore a European legal basis rather than reliance on bilateral relations - and a balance between the needs of the fight against terrorism and ensuring the confidentiality of personal data, both of which are key human rights."
"I hope that the United States will accept the balanced position that the German Presidency, with the Commission's support, has tried to put across and that these agreements will be reached by the end of this month, before the German Presidency comes to an end."
"I have briefed the Chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the status of the negotiations."
"There are aspects that cannot yet be made public because the negotiations are still in progress, but I have endeavoured to provide the Chairman and the parliamentary group coordinators within the committee with frequent updates on the outcome of the talks."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. - Madam President, this report was prepared under enhanced cooperation between the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"I am pleased to inform my colleagues that Mr Klich and I have agreed on a comprehensive text which, I believe, reflects the views of both committees."
"I very much thank Mr Klich for his time, cooperation and flexibility."
"In addition to the many points made in the report, my main message to the Council and to the Commission would be as follows. Firstly, it is obvious that the internal stability of the EU is to a degree dependent on external factors, such as the situation in neighbouring countries."
"Secondly, no standard approach will work to improve the political situation in these countries, as the countries differ greatly in their economic, political and social realities."
"Thirdly, I therefore stress the need for a tailor-made approach towards neighbouring countries in EU policy in the area of freedom, security and justice."
"This debate is now adjourned until 9 p.m."
"Council Question Time"
"The next item is Question Time (B6-0125/2007)."
"The following questions are addressed to the Council."
"Subject: EU taxation policy"
"The taxation policy pursued by the Member States should be consistent with the Community's objectives in terms of job creation, EU competitiveness, the single market and free movement of capital."
"The 27 Member States are solely responsible for the planning and implementation of direct taxation policy, while the Community rules governing individual areas of taxation policy in the Union require the unanimity of the 27 for any decision-making."
"Value added tax (VAT) on products has become quite a complicated matter in recent years."
"In particular, VAT in the Member States ranges from 3% in Luxembourg to 25% in Denmark."
"Will the Council say whether the EU is moving closer to adopting a common system for value added tax, what stage has been reached in discussions to date and what the Member States' intentions are concerning the adoption of a common rate of VAT?"
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, the common system of value-added tax was established in 1967 by the first and second VAT Directives."
"These two directives prescribed the general structures of the system."
"The detailed provisions governing the application of the common VAT system were introduced in 1977 with the adoption of the sixth VAT Directive."
"This directive has since been subject to numerous amendments, most of which were occasioned by the creation of the single market and the accompanying removal of tax barriers between Member States."
"On 1 January 2007 the sixth directive was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value-added tax, which incorporates all of the statutory amendments to the original directive."
"As far as VAT rates are concerned, the directive establishes the principle of applying a standard rate plus one or two reduced rates."
"The standard rate must be at least 15%."
"This minimum rate is fixed until 31 December 2010."
"The reduced rates, which must amount to at least 5%, are applicable to goods and services defined in the directive."
"The directive also provides for certain exceptions to this general rule and for transitional arrangements, allowing the Member States to respond to specific situations."
"So that the effects of the reduced rates can be more accurately assessed, the directive also lays down that, by 30 June 2007 at the latest, the Commission is to present to the European Parliament and the Council an overall assessment report on the impact of reduced rates applying to locally provided services, focusing especially on job creation, economic growth and the proper functioning of the internal market and based on a study carried out by an independent economic think-tank."
"(EL) Madam President, Minister, as the Commission has said, you must have information on the impact on economic prosperity and job creation in the Member States from different value added tax rates at your disposal and make it known by 30 June 2007."
"It is only to be expected that different VAT rates have a strong impact on sectors of the internal market and on the flourishing of the economies in the Member States, with the result that individual economic indicators are affected and inequalities in the economy and society are exacerbated."
"I ask you, Minister, do you already know the impact different VAT rates have and, if you do, what is it?"
"Finally, what policies is the Council considering in order to mitigate the adverse repercussions of these differences?"
"Mr Mavrommatis, I also said that there has been a variety of developments and decisions within the scope that exists for this in the European Union."
"It should be particularly useful in that, when the report of the expert group is presented, we shall have the facts on the table and be able to assess whether or not there are obstacles, as it were, to the functioning of the internal market, and what has been the impact on certain sectors to which reduced rates have applied in the past."
"I am sure you will understand that we ought to wait for this report."
"After that, we - the Council and Parliament - must conduct an assessment together."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, I should like to extend the question a little."
"The attempts to achieve uniform or harmonised VAT rates in Europe are admirable, but surely the objective of European tax policy should be the ultimate achievement of uniform, or at least comparable, taxation rates and taxes throughout the European Union."
"I should be interested to hear what kind of discussion there has been on this issue in the Council in general, whether this issue has been approached, and if so, how."
"The Council has discussed in detail the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium with a view to the adoption by the Council of a Framework Decision on the recognition and enforcement in the European Union of prohibitions arising from convictions for sexual offences committed against children."
"Following this discussion, the Article 36 Committee decided at its meeting of 22-23 March 2007 to deal with these issues in connection with the Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States, and to amend this draft Framework Decision accordingly."
"On 13 June 2007, at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg, the Council reached agreement on a general direction for a Framework Decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States, and brought the initiative of the Kingdom of Belgium to a conclusion consensually."
"In so doing, the Council took account, in particular, of the important aspect of the Belgian initiative that Member States should have access to information on the relevant convictions pronounced and prohibitions imposed in another Member State, so that each Member State can draw such conclusions from this information as are necessary to protect children from the risk of sexual abuse."
"I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for that answer, but I should also like to ask him to acknowledge in the German Presidency the real concern across the European Union about recent incidents of possible child abduction for the purposes of exploitation."
"I would ask him to acknowledge that this is now a major issue in the European Union, for his country, for mine and for others, and to ensure that we come to a conclusion, before the end of the German Presidency, on the exchange of criminal records on people who work with children and will be a danger to them."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Moraes, as I said before, we have indeed taken up the initiative, and the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs, too, have recently agreed to implement the key concern at the heart of the Belgian initiative."
"Notwithstanding certain differences concerning the information permitted to be passed on, the EU has now found a joint solution to the core issue forming the basis of Belgium's initiative, which I believe is a significant step forward."
"I am sure you appreciate that the time remaining to the German Council Presidency will presumably be insufficient to bring about agreement in other fields."
"Is it not a pretty dire situation that, three years on from the proposal and when everybody agrees that making cross-border information available on sex offenders is one of the most urgent priorities and one very much supported by the public, we simply have no agreement?"
"And the Council says it will look at this soon!"
"Is it not also pretty shocking that the UK Government is seeking an opt-out from this law enforcement area of European cooperation so that, even if it were agreed, our children would not even be protected by measures to track sex offenders?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) I should like to start by saying that the Council Presidency considers this a very important, valid question."
"The Council is fully aware of the importance of guaranteeing the welfare of disabled people and of children with learning difficulties."
"The Council would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the general legislative framework for the fight against discrimination in employment and occupation on grounds of a person's religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation."
"The Directive, which is based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty, lays down the minimum requirements to be met by all Member States."
"The problem is that this legislative framework extends to neither insurance nor the education system."
"Nevertheless, Member States may introduce or retain provisions that do even greater justice to the principle of equality than those of the Directive, and which envisage protection against discrimination in fields subject to national competence."
"Concerning the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the Council notes with satisfaction that the Commission is intending to publish a number of studies relevant to the honourable Member's question."
"These studies are intended to highlight the social situation of disabled people, including with regard to education and training, and to summarise the statistics on disabled people provided, in particular, by social-security institutions, with a view to obtaining a realistic overview of the situation of disabled people, including with regard to the educational dimension."
"(EL) Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for your reply."
"I wanted to point out that, as a country, Germany is already demonstrating understanding for people with disabilities and there is legislation allowing them to obtain insurance, so that they are treated equally in employment."
"European schools do not have the same measures to help children with disabilities as the Member States and that is why I am asking for initiatives on the part of the Council."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - (DE) Madam President, I crave the House's indulgence, as I shall have to refer to many technical aspects in my reply that may not always be easy to follow, but those actively working on the subject matter are of course aware of how important the principles are in this regard."
"Currently, measures in this field - that is, the field of migration - can be taken pursuant to Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"The fields in which measures are taken by means of codecision with the European Parliament are extended by Council Decision 2004/927/EC of 22 December 2004 providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty, in accordance with the second indent of Article 67(2)."
"Most measures referred to in these provisions are now taken by means of codecision."
"However, the European Council took the view that, until the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Council should continue to act unanimously with regard to the measures referred to in Article 63(3)(a) and (4) of the EC Treaty in the field of the legal migration of nationals of third countries into and between Member States."
"These and other issues are still being examined in the course of the ongoing process of Treaty reform."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for the information that he has given us, of which, despite its technical nature, this Parliament is clearly very well aware."
"At the moment there is immense concern in Parliament at the Council's inability to resolve immigration issues by means of intergovernmental cooperation."
"I shall refer to a single case, that of the maintenance of the Dublin II Regulation, which currently prevents us from showing solidarity towards the Republic of Malta in order to deal with the immigration problems, something which could be resolved in a Community fashion."
"My worry is that the intergovernmental method is not sufficient and that we should move over to the first pillar."
"One example of this is the issue of the Dublin II Regulation."
"Mr Medina Ortega, the migration issue has been the subject of frequent discussions in past rounds."
"I have pointed out many times, including in connection with another of today's debates, that the global approach to migration will undoubtedly play a key role in the Council conclusions tomorrow and the day after, and that it is not just an issue, but rather is being dealt with."
"The honourable Member is right to ask how we can help Member States of the European Union such as Malta."
"However, we shall also endeavour to find solutions to the issues surrounding, and causes of, migration, particularly illegal migration, together with the countries of origin."
"The other question is of a technical nature, but of course this all depends on how we deal with the issue of the future of the Constitutional Treaty."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, mass legalisation of illegal immigrants in various Member States has often been interpreted as an invitation, and has led to veritable waves of refugees, as well as gift-wrapping a boom for people-smuggling gangs."
"To what extent are there plans to extend readmission agreements, particularly with countries receiving financial support from the EU?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Readmission is an important issue, one that has been on the agenda of the joint debates between the European Union and African countries, and most recently of last year's joint conference on migration in Tripoli."
"This is true of many areas, of course, as - even though this has not had a decisive influence on the present discussion - there is currently a wave of migration not only from South to North, but also from East to West."
"In that regard, the very issue of whether it is possible to arrive at regulations for the respective readmission agreements is always included in discussions on visa provisions."
"This is also the case in the talks with African Union countries, for example."
"I cannot give you any figures at present as to the countries with which such agreements have already been concluded, but I am sure we shall be able to provide these at a later date."
"(MT) Although I agree with the President that what has to be discussed are the causes of emigration, I would like to know what the German Presidency's position is regarding Malta's burden-sharing proposal."
"We agree that, eventually, this will have to be discussed in the light of the Constitutional Treaty, but this is an urgent catastrophe and requires urgent action."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) At the 2007 EU-USA Summit, the European Union and the United States agreed the following: consistent with our common values, we confirm that we have long been working to ensure that efforts to combat terrorism are in line with our obligations under international law, including human rights standards, refugee law and international humanitarian law."
"We shall continue and intensify our ongoing dialogue on the fundamental rights under international law that are relevant to our common fight against terrorism."
"This dialogue has helped us obtain a better knowledge of each other's legal framework and should promote cooperation between us on fighting terrorism."
"The Presidency informs Parliament regularly about transatlantic relations, including about issues connected with international law."
"One such briefing was given here in the run-up to the EU-USA Summit on 24 April 2007."
"On the subject of transatlantic dialogue, the legislator contributes to the transatlantic dialogue on security."
"The Council noted the European Parliament resolution of 14 February 2007 on extraordinary rendition on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 5 March 2007."
"The Presidency has neither sought nor received any responses from the Member States to the said European Parliament resolution."
"The post of counter-terrorism coordinator is currently being assessed, and the search for a suitable candidate is under way."
"It would have been preferable to have a full debate on the CIA renditions and European complicity this part-session, as the Liberals wanted, but unfortunately the largest groups on the right and left strangely refused to support that idea."
"We could then have pressed the Council collectively to respond at last to Parliament's and Dick Marty's reports."
"How is the Council ensuring human rights compliance, as stated in the summit conclusions, when we know that US efforts are directed at persuading EU Member States to dilute legal protections?"
"Is the Council going to let MEPs into those ongoing secret discussions given that we are supposed to have a high-level trialogue on terrorism?"
"We have never been consulted on the action plan, and I think it is about time the Council improved its partnership with Parliament on these matters."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) If I remember rightly, I have already explained, in the debate on the subject, the importance of transatlantic dialogue and what the European Union and also the Council Presidency have contributed to that debate."
"It is indeed the case that many an impetus has been given and that the relevant talks are currently being held - admittedly not high-level talks, but talks at working level."
"I hope you will understand that these are confidential talks."
"Regularly including the subject of transatlantic relations on the agenda, however, ensures that the possibility of exchanging views on how far both parties' efforts towards a resolution have progressed will continue to exist in future."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, allow me to express my opinion that your efforts in certain part-fields have not yet proved entirely successful, particularly - with regard to my area of competence - in the field of the checks on European passengers at US airports, which I consider shameful and without doubt in violation of human rights."
"I believe that this state of affairs is unacceptable in the long run."
"I should be interested to hear what the President-in-Office intends to do about these measures, which have been taken in the United States under the guise of combating terrorism?"
"Mr Papadimoulis, the US missile defence system and the planned stationing of 10 rockets in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic has not yet been discussed in the Council."
"The bilateral cooperation between the United States and some EU Member States in connection with the stationing of elements of the US national missile defence system falls within the national competence of the Member States concerned."
"Consequently, the Council has not considered raising the issue of missile defence in talks with the USA or with NATO."
"Ballistic missile defence is the subject of consultations within NATO and the NATO-Russia Council."
"On 19 April, special meetings of the North Atlantic Council and of the NATO-Russia Council were held on the subject of missile defence."
"This subject was also discussed at an informal meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in Oslo on 26-27 April."
"(EL) Madam President, I am surprised by the Council's reply."
"Fine, you do not want to discuss it with the Americans and ŒùŒëŒ§Œü."
"Do you intend to discuss it in the Council, with your Czech and Polish colleagues?"
"Or have you handed everything over to ŒùŒëŒ§Œü?"
"The German Minister of Foreign Affairs has expressed his concern."
"Mr Solana likewise."
"Germany wants smooth Euro-Russian relations."
"Do you intend to discuss the matter during this summit?"
"Do you intend to discuss it at some point?"
"What is the point of the Council talking if it does not talk about issues which worry all the citizens of Europe?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) I should like to refer once again to the starting position."
"A few years ago, at the North Atlantic Council in Prague, the partners agreed on the new challenges presenting themselves and on the answers - possibly new ones - NATO had to find to these."
"NATO has set up the relevant working parties."
"This debate was continued in Riga, but no definitive result has been achieved as yet."
"For example, we agree on the joint threat analysis."
"At this stage, however, the United States made its proposal for a national missile defence system."
"We take the view that, as a rule, the subject of the missile defence system should be discussed within NATO rather than within the European Union."
"I can only reaffirm that this neither has been, nor will it be, discussed within the Council."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, you say - rightly - that the Council does not wish to deal with this issue, but I should like to ask, against the background of surveys according to which 51% of Poles oppose the planned stationing of this US missile defence system, why calls by citizens' action groups for a consultative referendum have been dismissed on grounds that referendums are unsuitable in this case."
"What is the Council's position on the subject of public participation in such important decisions?"
"Does the possibility of negotiating on this, at least, still remain?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) As far as public participation is concerned, this is a national decision, and no guideline is required on the part of the Council Presidency."
"This is a matter for Member States on their own responsibility."
"In this connection, however, I should like to reiterate that there has indeed been movement on this issue in general terms, particularly between Russia and the United States, who have agreed to an intensive exchange of views on the subject and to confidence-building measures."
"This currently remains open."
"As the honourable Member is aware, Mr Putin recently made proposals to this end to the USA, too."
"I believe that we should await these talks."
"(DE) My question follows on directly from this."
"Has the EU Council Presidency taken a position on Vladimir Putin's proposal to involve Azerbaijan in this missile system?"
"Secondly, does the position of the EU, or rather the Council, on the US missile system correspond to NATO's position, or is there a difference?"
"If the latter, what is the nature of this difference?"
"Thirdly, does the Council intend to deal with the issue of the missile system at any stage?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) I would point out that there is no legal basis for the Council to formally approve or reject projects such as those mentioned in the honourable Member's question."
"In other words, such projects can go ahead without the need for the Council's prior approval."
"As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, Decision 1364/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down guidelines for trans-European energy networks and repealing Decision 96/391/EC and Decision 1229/2003/EC makes reference in several places to a gas pipeline between Russia and Germany running across the Baltic Sea via the offshore route."
"I also assume the honourable Member is aware that, in accordance with Annex I to this Decision, a North European gas pipeline is categorised under 'projects of European interest': the category of projects given the highest priority."
"With regard to the special provisions governing projects of this standing, the Council would draw attention to the operative part of the aforementioned Decision, which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by the codecision procedure."
"I should like to refer Mr Lundgren, in particular, once more to Article 13 of the Decision, which reads as follows: 'This Decision shall be without prejudice to the results of the environmental impact assessment of projects, plans or programmes which define the future framework for such projects."
"The results of the environmental impact assessments, where such an assessment is requested in accordance with relevant Community legislation, shall be taken into consideration before a decision on the carrying out of the projects is actually taken in accordance with the relevant Community legislation.'"
"Regarding the second part of the question, in accordance with the Treaty, it is up to the Commission to ensure the correct application of Community legislation and, in the case of infringements, to take such measures as it deems appropriate."
"Naturally, this principle also applies to the Community legislation in force for environmental impact assessments."
"(SV) Madam President, as an EU country and as the country holding the Presidency right now, Germany is appealing for a common energy policy for the EU."
"In spite of that, it is concluding a bilateral agreement with Russia concerning a very considerable investment in infrastructure in the form of the gas pipeline and is doing so without consulting other EU Member States around the Baltic Sea."
"What are there by way of comments on this?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) This issue has also been the subject of a previous Question Time."
"I can only reiterate that this is a private rather than a State project, and that any enterprises carrying out this project have to submit all the relevant documents, including in the countries in which this pipeline is ultimately to be laid, where they have to carry out this examination in accordance with the relevant provisions."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office, as we know, this gas pipeline has been severely criticised by various politicians, experts and scientists, particularly from Scandinavian and Baltic countries and Poland."
"Perhaps the Council could help bring the competent experts and politicians together to discuss the problem and perhaps reach a practical compromise?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Paleckis, it is primarily the task of the parties planning and wishing to carry out this project to keep the countries concerned informed as appropriate - which is done by making the appropriate application."
"This application will undoubtedly be followed by an examination of all possible aspects, particularly those of the environment and security."
"I am assuming that the appropriate talks will also be held."
"However, first and foremost, it is entirely up to the parties involved in the project to take the initiative on this - and these parties are private and not State enterprises."
"(LT) Madam President, Minister, this is not the first time we are discussing this issue."
"Talking about its ecological consequences evokes all sorts of concerns and fears."
"Now Russia, implementing the project, is carrying out its own environmental impact assessment, saying that the weapons on the seabed are not dangerous."
"Do you not find it illogical that a private project manager is carrying out the environmental impact assessment?"
"The Council has not discussed this issue in terms of the aspect which has been mentioned by the honourable Member."
"The physical distance or proximity to the 27 Member States is not, in itself, decisive as regards relations between the individual countries and regions of the European Union."
"Relations with overseas countries and regions are regulated in the fourth part of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, as well as in Council Decisions."
"The currently valid Council Decision, which was adopted on 27 November 2001 and amended on 19 March 2007, will run until 31 December 2013."
"The Council will review the situation again before then."
"My point really was that what we decide in this Chamber - as you said in response to the last question, when you referred to EU laws that have to be respected - applies in places like Martinique, or Guadeloupe, or French Guiana on the coast of South America, thousands of kilometres away, far removed from this place, but it does not apply in places like the Channel Islands, which are between France and Britain, or the Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Andorra - I could go on."
"There are all these peculiar little tax havens and exemptions that we seem to allow and where EU law does not apply."
"Does the Council not consider this position to be such an anomaly that we ought to look at it again and consider a more modern way forward, rather than trying to legislate thousands of kilometres away, and not on our own doorstep?"
"I presumably do not need to make specific reference to the fact that the areas associated with your question concern regions outside Europe but which are part of the European Union because, as it were, they are members of the European Union in view of their links to the mother country."
"You are aware, of course, that countries such as Andorra or Liechtenstein are not members of the European Union even though they are situated in Europe."
"A corresponding review in Council will establish whether these regions will continue to be affiliated and whether legislation will continue to be transferred to the areas mentioned."
"(DE) Overseas territories where military bases of EU Member States are located are certainly a frequent occurrence."
"I would like to mention another specific case: Cyprus has designated sovereign military bases which belong to Great Britain but which are not part of the European Union."
"My question here is as follows: Is it a tolerable situation where an EU Member State has areas belonging to another EU Member State which are not part of the European Union?"
"Mr Bushill-Matthews, you are aware, of course, that monitoring of the proper transposition of EU legislation by Member States is the responsibility of the European Commission in the first instance."
"The Council does not therefore wish to comment on the specific case mentioned."
"Well, that was a very short answer, but not very sweet."
"I am aware that the Commission has certain responsibilities, but are you saying that the Council has no interest whatsoever and does not care about age discrimination?"
"Because that is the clear message you are giving."
"You have just said that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties."
"It will review this accordingly."
"Furthermore, the opportunity exists for the parties in question to have a corresponding review carried out in the event of discrimination."
"(DE) I believe that air travel basically requires reorganisation."
"The question to the Council is therefore justified: In future, is it envisaged proceeding more within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation or on a bilateral basis in this area in the event of discrimination, or do you consider it right that the Commission takes an initiative in this area?"
"Mr Posselt, the entire political situation in Kosovo continues to be determined by the status process."
"When the UN's Special Envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, forwarded the Comprehensive Proposal for a Kosovo Status Settlement to the UN Security Council, this process became the definitive responsibility of the Security Council."
"EU Foreign Ministers have repeatedly given their unequivocal support to Special Envoy Ahtisaari as well as expression to their conviction that the Ahtisaari package represents an important basis for sustained, economic and political development in Kosovo and can also contribute to the consolidation of stability in the region as a whole."
"Following the G8 Summit of Heads of State or Government, at which agreement could not be reached in relation to Kosovo, the EU Presidency called on participating parties to intensify their efforts in order to adopt a new UN Security Resolution at the earliest possible juncture."
"The European Union is also continuing to follow the Status process intensively."
"The preparations carried out by the European Union in terms of its contribution to a future, international, civilian presence in Kosovo following a solution to the status issue have, by and large, made headway."
"The European Union is prepared to assume an important role, in close cooperation with other international actors as regards a possible future, international, civilian presence."
"To this end, planning teams are to be found on site which are making preparations for possible future work undertaken by an EU special envoy and an ESDP [European Security and Defence Policy] mission in the areas of policing and the justice system."
"The conclusion of these preparations will depend on how the status process itself and the actual status solution continue to progress."
"As in the past, in future too, substantial assistance will be required from the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, in order to improve the economic framework conditions and the social situation in Kosovo."
"This can only be achieved in close cooperation with international financial institutions and partners on site."
"As soon as a precise cost estimate is available, which naturally also depends on the status solution, the Commission will draw up an overall finance package which will also be the subject of a donor conference."
"This donor conference will only take place once Kosovo's status has been clarified."
"(DE) My supplementary question to you is as follows: Can the issue of Kosovo's status not be resolved in terms that the European Parliament can agree to?"
"Is the Council aware that 75% of the European Parliament came out in favour of the Ahtisaari plan, international independence and provision of an immediate warning system concerning further delays?"
"Does the Council consider this to be a course of action which should also be adopted by other institutions?"
"What does the Council mean by suddenly coming out and advocating the postponement of the entire matter for a period of six months, something which the European Parliament expressly warned against by a significant majority, and what does it mean by the statements made by Mrs del Ponte, who has no jurisdiction whatsoever in this field?"
"Naturally, we are aware of the debates which have taken place in the European Parliament and the resolutions adopted by this House."
"However, I would again make reference to a detailed discussion which took place last Monday in the Council of Foreign Ministers and which will continue tomorrow evening in Brussels."
"In the course of this, unambiguous clarification was again provided in relation to the fact that although the Ahtisaari proposals constitute a basis, we do need a UN decision to assist in finding an acceptable solution."
"It would now be completely wrong, and this has also been discussed with the governments of neighbouring regions, to take a unilateral decision."
"I believe that we should also be able to convince our partner, the United States, that a multilateral decision under international law is required."
"To this end, further talks will soon take place at a bilateral meeting between Mr Putin and Mr Bush."
"These talks will also certainly involve Kosovo."
"However, I am now giving due notice that a unilateral decision would not represent a sound basis for other decisions which are in the pipeline."
"I am aware that impatience also prevails in the region."
"We have, for example, particularly thanked the Albanian Government for its influence over recent weeks and months and declared that a decision under international law is necessary and not just unilateral acceptance by individual countries."
"(DE) Mr President-in-Office of the Council, what initiatives are planned by the Council Presidency in the area of economic policy, above all, in the sphere of energy policy as well?"
"Could you envisage the SME Charter or the Energy Charter, for instance, being used as a starting point for also counteracting unemployment in the economic process as well as for transposing the Lisbon agenda there in an attractive manner?"
"Mr R√ºbig, we are certainly aware, and Mr Posselt's question has also helped trigger this awareness, of the importance of establishing economic stability alongside political stability."
"A precondition is now a basic decision."
"We all know the circumstances."
"As regards future prospects (you have mentioned the Energy Community which already exists in the region), decisions must then be taken if the preceding political decision has been taken."
"However, you are also aware following other debates, including those relating to neighbouring regions, of the opportunities afforded these countries by the European Union in terms of promoting regional cooperation."
"The aspect you have mentioned certainly has far-reaching implications."
"Article 28 of the Treaty on European Union lays down the principles for financing civilian and military crisis management operations."
"Military or defence policy-related operations cannot be financed from Community funds."
"Athena is the mechanism created by the Council in 2004 to manage the financing of the joint costs of such operations."
"The joint costs are less than 10%, which amounts to the total additional costs of an operation."
"The remaining expenditure is financed directly by Member States according to the principle whereby costs are borne where they accrue."
"Athena is managed under the supervision of a special committee made up of representatives from Member States who are accountable to their own national parliaments through their respective ministers."
"As far as the Althea operation is concerned, both the European Union and NATO pay for their share as regards jointly used facilities, personnel, etc."
"NATO does not receive any reimbursement from Athena for the services rendered."
"(FI) Madam President, Secretary of State, this is a peculiar system, which has no democratic supervision."
"By democratic supervision I mean parliamentary supervision, not supervision by the European Parliament or the national parliaments."
"This is the way to recycle the rules of the Treaties, as you just said."
"I would now like to ask if the new Constitution, regarding which the Presidency has drafted a proposal, will alter the Treaties in such a way that this money could be granted out of the EU budget without the Athena system?"
"Mr Sepp√§nen, on the eve of the European Council, I do not wish to speculate today on the future of the European Constitutional Treaty."
"We will see which debates will be held and the consequences in terms of the contractual provisions."
"On the second point, I would like to say that the respective ministers from the Member States are represented in committee and these ministers, in turn, are ultimately accountable to their own parliaments since the contributions come from the Member States."
"As far as I am aware, parliaments either have relevant specialist committees which can pass judgment and question the respective minister on the use of funds, or there are budgetary control committees which examine how these funds are used."
"(DE) Unfortunately, the reality is somewhat different."
"In the security and defence sub-committee, I am told that the EU has paid money to NATO."
"You are now saying that no money has been paid."
"This is very interesting."
"The problem is that we do not receive any figures when enquiring about them in the individual national parliaments, nor do we receive figures through the Committee on Budgets or in the security and defence sub-committee."
"Would it be possible for the Council Presidency to compile a summary of the expenditure effected hitherto in relation to this Athena mechanism?"
"As Council President, I can inform you that no initiatives have been taken in order to provide the Commission with a mandate to start negotiations on corresponding agreements with Georgia."
"However, provision is made at any time in the EU-Georgia action plan within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy for the initiation of a dialogue on issues connected with the transit of persons, including issues of readmission and the issuing of visas."
"In connection with discussions on the possible unequal treatment of citizens living in Abkhazia who receive visas there on the basis of the new agreements, as well as in connection with the issue regarding whether imbalances may indeed exist in this area between the rights of people living in Abkhazia and those of people living in Georgia itself, I would like to add that this debate, which has also taken place at another level within the European Parliament, will continue to bring about a solution."
"(LV) Mr Gloser, you just referred to Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and it is well known that Russia is currently issuing Russian passports on a massive scale to inhabitants of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, thus artificially reducing the proportion of Georgian citizens in those regions."
"The European Union, in hesitating with regard to the allocation of this visa facilitation to Georgia, is indirectly creating an additional incentive for Russian passports to be acquired, since Russian citizens currently have more opportunities of travelling to the European Union than Georgian citizens."
"I would like to ask a second question: why were these talks on visa facilitation for Georgia not begun in the Council?"
"What specific solutions do you see that might resolve this situation which is, in my view, unacceptable?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr Rutowicz, you enquired as to the status of the Regulation on roaming at the part-session back in February, and so I am pleased to be able to give the following answer to your further enquiry - even though you should already be aware of the subject matter, as the subject of roaming concerns us all given that we can no longer do without mobile phones."
"As I am sure you are aware, the Regulation on roaming, which is based on Article 95 of the EC Treaty, is subject to the codecision procedure pursuant to Article 251 of the EC Treaty."
"I can assure you that all three institutions have set themselves the objective of adopting the Regulation on roaming as quickly as possible."
"At the European Council on 6-8 June, the Council reached a political consensus on the proposal, and thus approved the opinion of the European Parliament at first reading."
"The legal and linguistic experts are already carrying out the final revision of the text, so that it can be adopted under an expedited procedure."
"It is anticipated that the legal act will be adopted at the end of June."
"It will be published in the Official Journal immediately afterwards."
"(PL) Madam President, unfortunately, the question was asked when the situation was quite different."
"Therefore, I imagine that we should at this point applaud the fact that these directives have been adopted so quickly and that European society will benefit from this work."
"Incidentally, this is a great success for the whole European Parliament, the Council and the Commission."
"However, the rates set out in this directive are not such a great success."
"According to experts from the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, these rates were previously lower."
"The rapporteur increased them during the consultation process and, finally, they were increased in the directive itself."
"However, I do have a question I would like to ask."
"Roaming remains, if I may say so, something that is unacceptable in Europe."
"My question, therefore, is when might roaming be abolished altogether in European Union Member States?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) action plans consist of political documents that represent a political consensus between the European Union and the individual partner countries on an agenda of political, economic and sectoral reforms and contain both short- and medium-term priorities for action."
"They are adopted between the EU and the respective partner country by the Association or Cooperation Council."
"ENP action plans have been concluded with five of the six partner countries in the East, the first being that with Ukraine on 21 February 2005 and that with Moldova on 22 February 2005."
"These were followed by individual ENP action plans for Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia on 14 November 2006."
"No such action plan has been adopted with regard to Belarus, as the EU has no contractual relations with that country."
"Belarus will not be able to enjoy the extensive benefits of the European Neighbourhood Policy until it introduces a democratic system following free, fair elections."
"The following ENP action plans have been adopted with regard to partner countries in the South: that with Israel on 11 April 2005, with the Palestinian Authority on 4 May 2005, with Jordan on 2 June 2005, with Morocco on 22 June 2005, with Tunisia on 4 July 2005, with Lebanon on 19 January 2007 and with Egypt on 6 March 2007."
"No action plan has been concluded with Algeria as yet, and no action plans have been adopted for Libya and Syria as the EU has no contractual relations with those countries."
"The EU will provide a total of EUR 12 billion in Community funds for the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in the 2007-2013 period, representing an increase of 32% in real terms."
"Following discussions with the EU Member States, and pursuant to Regulation No 1638/2006 of 24 October 2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the Commission decided on the financial breakdown and adopted strategy papers and indicative programmes covering countries, regions and cross-border programmes for the 2007-2010 period."
"The multiannual appropriations for the country programmes under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, ENPI, for 2007-2010 are as follows: EUR 220 million for Algeria, EUR 98.4 million for Armenia, EUR 92 million for Azerbaijan, EUR 20 million for Belarus, EUR 558 million for Egypt, EUR 120.4 million for Georgia, EUR 8 million for Israel, EUR 265 million for Jordan, EUR 187 million for Lebanon, EUR 8 million for Libya, EUR 209.7 million for Moldova, EUR 654 million for Morocco, EUR 632 million for the Palestinian Authority, EUR 130 million for Syria, EUR 300 million for Tunisia and finally EUR 494 million for Ukraine."
"It should be remarked that no strategy papers or indicative programmes have been adopted for Libya and the Palestinian Authority, as medium-term programming is not possible in those cases, and therefore the appropriations stated are only position numbers."
"(LT) Madam President, thank you for the comprehensive response."
"I would like to clarify one thing."
"In the implementation of this policy, certain agreements and action plans are made with particular countries: the European Union and Ukraine, the European Union and Georgia."
"Are the Member States neighbouring these countries involved in drawing up the action plans?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) This afternoon, we held a debate on MEDA and the European Neighbourhood Policy, but more in relation to the South."
"I should like to underline that saying that the EU now has an external border, but that it also has neighbours and is interested in the political, economic and social stability of these countries, has given the Member States who joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 an impetus."
"When we developed the ENP, therefore, we also established a priority, particularly with the important aspect that a programme can be drawn up for each neighbour having the appropriate relations with the EU, depending on the progress made in the individual case, with the result that there are customised programmes for Ukraine or Moldova, for example."
"I can only say, Mrs Budreikaitƒó, that the countries you mention are cooperating on drawing up these action plans and have every interest in these."
"The content of these plans and this neighbourhood policy can play a vital role in certain fields, for example access to the internal market."
"The fact that the European Council is to give its blessing to this new approach of neighbourhood policy in its conclusions tomorrow and on Friday will mean that the subsequent Council Presidencies are hopefully able to use this programme as a basis for their further work."
"(FI) Madam President, you said that there are no Neighbourhood Policy programmes in effect for Belarus, because no free elections have been held in the country."
"A programme of this sort has nevertheless been agreed with Azerbaijan. Do you think that the elections in Azerbaijan were free and above board, and do you think it is logical that such a programme has been agreed with Azerbaijan but not with Belarus?"
"Mr Nicholson, in accordance with Community law, it is the Commission who bears responsibility for the application of the protective clause, and thus the Council has no direct influence on the decision that the Commission has taken with regard to Brazilian beef."
"Thank you, Mr President-in-Office, but I am a bit frustrated by that reply."
"I also put a question last night to the Commission, which was not very helpful either."
"I would like to put to the President-in-Office that, when the Irish Farmers' Journal and a representative from the Irish Farmers' Association visited Brazil, they found clear evidence that rules were not being followed in Brazil."
"Traceability is non-existent."
"There are no controls at regional borders."
"Animal movement in Brazil from foot-and-mouth areas is taking place every day."
"There is evidence that substances banned in the European Union are being used in Brazil."
"Is it not beyond time that we in Europe stopped paying lip service to this type of problem - when our consumers could have the possibility of being affected by this - and have a ban on Brazilian beef, which everybody in the European Union wants for the betterment of the producers and the consumers?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) I do not like having to say that the Council does not have competence in this area, but you said yourself that you have taken the opportunity to raise this problem with the Commission, too."
"The Council is also aware of the problem, of course, but it is now up to the Commission to look into the relevant information."
"Subsequently, the Commission is also responsible for making the relevant proposals and taking precautionary measures."
"This really does not fall within the competence of the Council."
"President-in-Office, you say this is a matter for the Commission, but the health of European citizens must be a matter in which the Council has more than a passing interest."
"The United States of America has imposed a total ban on all fresh beef imports from Brazil because it says traceability is non-existent, illegal growth hormones are in widespread use and, generally, controls are alarmingly weak."
"Is the health of EU citizens less important than the health of American citizens and, if not, then why have we not already banned Brazilian beef?"
"I have heard what the Council has said, but I think it is sidestepping the issue here."
"At the moment we are negotiating with the G4 in Potsdam and I would like to know whether we can ignore the recommendations of the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which called for a ban on the import of beef from Brazil."
"Can we ignore the conclusions of the final report on a mission carried out in Brazil by the European Food and Veterinary Office, which tell us quite clearly that the present system of residue and veterinary medicine control is not adequate?"
"Major shortcomings remain in the design, scope and implementation of the National Residue Control Plan."
"I should like to ask the same question as the others."
"Do you not agree that now is the time to take action and to protect European consumers?"
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) I agree with you that the European Union has to take action where there is information such as you have just described, but we have laid down rules for ourselves in this area."
"All I can do is take up your calls in the interests of consumers and encourage the Commission to inform the relevant bodies of the extent of its examination and what measures it is able to take, but I regret that we cannot constantly swap roles."
"We have clearly defined fields of responsibility, and this is the Commission's."
"I cannot anticipate the answer of the Commission, which does not need to be present for today's Question Time."
"I can only offer to make a renewed enquiry, so that you, as citizens' representatives, receive a suitable, clear answer from the Commission."
"I should like to take this opportunity, President-in-Office, to thank you very much for your cooperation and courtesy during your country's Presidency at our Question Times."
"Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers (see Annex)."
"That concludes Question Time."
"(The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m.)"

"Exchanges of information extracted from criminal records (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Agust√≠n D√≠az de Mera Garc√≠a Consuegra, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council framework decision on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from criminal records between Member States C6-0052/2006."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, at present information on criminal records does not circulate efficiently between the Member States of the EU."
"This is not acceptable in a European area of freedom, security and justice and that is why the objective of the EU in the area of criminal records is twofold: firstly, to improve the circulation of information on criminal records between the Member States and, secondly, to use this information outside the territory of the sentencing Member State."
"As you know, in 2005 the Commission adopted two legislative proposals dealing with these aspects respectively."
"A proposal dealing with the second aspect - circulation of information - was adopted in December 2006."
"Political agreement on the proposal dealing with the circulation of information was fortunately reached by the Council of Interior Ministers in Luxembourg on 13 June."
"This instrument is another important step forward."
"In improving the way in which information is exchanged and made available to Member States, it radically overhauls the outdated, inefficient system of information exchange under the Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance of 1959."
"In its place, it establishes a streamlined system that will ensure that information stored in a single Member State is updated and then accessible to other Member States."
"In addition, the information will be easier to understand and, therefore, of greater value to the end users."
"I note, with regret, that Member States have decided that the follow-up work should take the form of Council decisions and, even more regrettably, Member States do not trust each other enough to accept that these implementing measures will be adopted not by qualified majority but by unanimity."
"I know that there are some amendments and I thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report."
"I share the spirit of the great majority of all the amendments proposed."
"I have a reservation concerning the amendments that propose the introduction of general provisions on data protection."
"Why?"
"Because this instrument is a sectoral one: it contains a small number of provisions on data protection which are specific to criminal records and therefore they are more restrictive."
"Therefore, my worry is that the application of general provisions on data protection will be too flexible and less restrictive."
"That aside, personal data handled as part of the implementation of the framework decision should be protected in accordance with the provisions of the future framework decision on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"You all know perfectly well that I am urging the Council to find an agreement on such an important framework decision on privacy protection by the end of this year."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank all of my colleagues in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs for their cooperation on this report and particularly the shadow rapporteurs, Mrs Buitenweg, Mrs VƒÉlean and Mrs Grabowska."
"Information on criminal convictions circulates between Member States under the mechanisms of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance on Criminal Matters of 1959, but there are serious difficulties with that mechanism."
"These deficiencies were demonstrated dramatically by the case of Fourniret, a French man sentenced in the 1980s to seven years in prison for the rape of a minor and then released after just two."
"We would discover years later that, between his release and his re-arrest in June 2003, Fourniret had murdered nine girls and was suspected of killing a further twelve."
"He had managed to evade judicial action for more than 14 years, simply by changing his residence from one Member State to another, and furthermore, to top everything, he even managed to get a job in a school."
"It was clear that the mechanisms for exchanging information on criminal records had to be modified and improved."
"The proposal for a Council framework decision intends to replace the information exchange mechanisms regulated in Article 22 of the Convention of 1959 and repeal the decision of 21 November 2005, all with a view to guaranteeing that the Member State of nationality is in a position to provide a correct, rapid and exhaustive response to requests for information that it receives with regard to convictions of its nationals."
"Of the measures included in the Council's proposal, we must highlight the following:"
"the principle of centralising information is retained;"
"a framework is established for contributing to, designing and implementing a computerised system for the exchange of information on criminal convictions, based on the use of a standard European format that makes it possible to exchange information in a standard, computerised and easily translatable form by means of automated mechanisms;"
"the principle of obligatory forwarding to the Member State of nationality is taken up, eliminating the dispensation of notification when the person also has the nationality of the Member State passing the sentence; and, finally,"
"the obligation to conserve the information forwarded to the State of nationality is laid down."
"With regard to the parliamentary measures proposed, I would highlight the following:"
"with a view to guaranteeing the integrity and authenticity of the information forwarded, the Member State handing down the conviction shall be considered to be the owner or proprietor of the data relating to the sentences passed by their courts and tribunals;"
"the future framework Decision must provide for a range of additional guarantees in the field of the protection of personal data;"
"with regard to the definition of convictions, for the sake of consistency with other reports by this Parliament, the definition contained in the report by my esteemed friend and colleague, Mr Demetriou, must be retained;"
"the inclusion of sentences in the register of criminal records of the Member State where the sentence was passed is a prior obligation, since it guarantees the authenticity and accuracy of the information forwarded; the information on sentences will therefore only be forwarded once it has been registered, but not before;"
"it must be made clear that the deletion of criminal records depends not just on completing the sentence, but also on compliance with other additional conditions, such as fulfilling the civil responsibilities arising from the crime, or not re-offending within the time period laid down in law;"
"it is necessary to establish clearly which legal framework will regulate the deletion of data, that is to say, whether the legislation of the Member State where the sentence is passed is applicable, or that of the State of nationality of the convicted person."
"With regard to the conditions for use, Mr Frattini, I genuinely share your concern regarding personal data."
"The proposal is much more restrictive than the provisions in force in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, which is justified by the speed with which information on criminal records can become out of date."
"Therefore, each time information on a person's criminal record is required for the purposes of a new criminal procedure, it will be necessary to submit a new request for information."
"I would like to end, Mr President, by calling upon the honourable Members to vote in favour of the proposed report, and I thank you for listening."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating this evening is a necessary step towards the development of judicial and police cooperation between the Member States of the European Union, a step towards promoting the strategy to develop an area of justice and security and I congratulate Commissioner Frattini on promoting proposals such as we are examining today, which promote the Hague programme."
"Recording convictions and passing them on for recording in the Member State of which the convict is a national and exchanges of information on convictions in general will undoubtedly help in combating both national and cross-border crime."
"There are, of course, gaps in the proposal."
"There is no Community method for regulating the question of recording administrative convictions which, in most Member States are not entered in the criminal records."
"There is no Community regulation of the question of recording convictions extracted from criminal records."
"Unfortunately, the variety of national regulations is still needed. There is still no approximation whatsoever of laws even on these procedural issues."
"Nonetheless, the coupling of national systems for recording and using information on convictions in the framework proposal goes some way towards dealing with the lack of a single Community policy on all aspects of the matter."
"However, we must emphasise the need for respect for the right to protection of personal data, not only theoretically, but also in practice."
"This will become clear in the natural course of events."
"We hope that respect for this right will be real and constant."
"I support the report by my honourable friend Mr D√≠az de Mera and I congratulate him on the interest which he has always demonstrated in the European Parliament in the promotion of this strategy to create an area of freedom, security and justice."
"I believe that the report will be supported by a large majority in Parliament tomorrow."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Mr President, the Member States have their own guidelines for collecting data on those convicted in criminal trials."
"Sentencing data is stored in national criminal registers."
"Each Member State is responsible for the central storage and management of information on court sentences."
"However, we are crossing national borders ever more frequently and, as we are no angels, we sometimes come into conflict with the criminal law system in another Member State, and are tried and sentenced there."
"What should we do with these sentences?"
"Should we register them or not?"
"The Member States have different, not very cohesive practices and that is why we need to harmonise this field."
"We need closer cooperation between judicial bodies, we need a better and more efficient exchange of information and we need to ensure that the Member States exchange accurate, comprehensive and exhaustive information in response to each request for information from criminal records."
"This is what the framework decision proposal aims to do."
"We need a European system for exchanging information in a standardised, computerised format, where interpretation is facilitated by automated procedures and a standardised format."
"That is why my political group support this report."
"However, my group does have one serious doubt concerning the report, which discusses judicial cooperation and the exchange of information."
"Bearing in mind the importance of telling the whole truth, respect for the rights of and fairness towards the victims of the terrorist attacks in Spain on 11 March, we would like to express our concern regarding the choice of rapporteur for this report."
"He has also drawn up other reports on the issue of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters."
"The European Parliament must be seen to be an institution based on the principle of transparency and which serves the citizens."
"That is why the authors of specific reports cannot be seen, in view of their activities at a national level, to be controversial figures."
"To conclude, I would like to indicate that my political group welcomes the good compromise that has been achieved in this report."
"We support this report and we intend to vote in favour of it."
"We also believe that the implementation of this decision will mean that Member States will trust each other more, and that this much-needed basis of trust will also apply to criminal proceedings."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr D√≠az de Mera Garc√≠a Consuegra, for his very good work that led to this report."
"I will recall, as he has already done, the terrible story which took place three years ago in Belgium."
"A Frenchman, aged 62, was given a job at a school."
"He was then arrested and confessed to nine murders on both sides of the Franco-Belgian border."
"It was then learned that he had previously been convicted of rape in France but that no one in Belgium was aware of his criminal record."
"We all remember the Fourniret case."
"This case, among others, demonstrates how urgently we need a functioning European criminal records system in a Europe composed of so many different legal systems."
"I congratulate the Commission on this very valuable proposal."
"This is a clear case of much-needed legislation that could bring tangible improvements to citizens' security in their day-to-day lives."
"I therefore salute last week's agreement in the Council, but I urge the Council to adopt this important text as soon as possible."
"For the first time, we now have uniform EU-wide rules which will ensure a faster exchange of information on criminal records and bring more legal certainty."
"It is also a first step towards online data communication between the EU countries."
"I am satisfied that the option chosen was an interconnection of records rather than having another central EU database."
"This is a positive step as far as cost and above all data protection are concerned."
"I should like to insist again on the privacy issue."
"In the absence of any agreement on the framework decision on procedural rights in criminal proceedings and on data protection in the third pillar, I urge the Council to adopt the additional data protection provisions included in this report."
"We cannot continue adopting such instruments without giving additional guarantees to our citizens that their fundamental rights are respected."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr D√≠az de Mera Garc√≠a Consuegra rightly notes that information on investigations shared between countries should have a standardised format and should be shared as flexibly as possible."
"The report is also aimed at ensuring the exchange of other information that in certain situations may prove useful."
"Every time such information is exchanged there are, of course, potential pitfalls: at the very least there are the different legal systems in the Member States and the different classifications of the same acts."
"In extreme cases this may involve the boundary between a crime and a minor misdemeanour."
"Personally, I am not happy that Mr D√≠az de Mera Garc√≠a Consuegra was appointed rapporteur for this report despite being accused of non-cooperation with the Spanish police in connection with misleading information implicating ETA in the Madrid train attack."
"Where is the political and human responsibility of the former head of the Spanish police?"
"To conclude, my group has significant reservations regarding this report."
"(PT) Mr President, I must begin by referring to the last speech."
"It is unacceptable here in this Chamber for attempts to be made at curtailing the parliamentary and political rights of any MEP whose rights have not been curtailed either by decision of this Parliament or by legal decision in his or her own country."
"We cannot accept this kind of political persecution of Mr Diaz De Mera Consuegra, who has a distinguished record in combating crime and defending justice as a professional in his own Member State and who has been an outstanding Member of this House."
"The report before us today is further proof of his political ability and of the rigour that has characterised both his parliamentary work and his professional life."
"I should like to say to Mr Frattini that I am firmly behind everything he said in relation to the Council's attitude."
"This measure is a much-needed one, and it is a great shame that the Council did not go further, in terms of both trust between the Member States and Parliament's involvement."
"In any event, I share everything that other speakers have said regarding the need to look into criminal background in detail and regarding the fact that the sharing of this information between the Member States constitutes a value-added in combating crime, in terms of identifying suspects, supporting criminal investigations and determining the severity of a punishment."
"I should like to finish by saying that I also agree with those who say that the Council must act more quickly in adopting, on the one hand, the framework decision on procedural guarantees for suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings and, on the other, the framework decision on data protection in the third pillar, for which the rapporteur was Mrs Roure, a further essential element in striking an appropriate balance in the legal measures in the sector."
"(ES) Mr President, I have requested the floor in order to rebut some unacceptable personal remarks, but I have essentially requested the floor in order to thank my colleague, Mr Coelho, who has spoken not just as a friend, but also with knowledge of the facts."
"I will just make one comment demanding a correction and an apology from Mr Kohl√≠ƒçek."
"Mr Kohl√≠ƒçek, the only possible explanations for your extremely unfortunate comments tonight in this House are ignorance, bad faith or some immoral purpose."
"I am sure, Mr Kohl√≠ƒçek, that you have heard - I hope you have heard - of something called presumption of innocence."
"I am sure you have heard of the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 48 thereof."
"I am sure you have heard of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and Article 11 thereof."
"I do not imagine that you are familiar - and there is no reason why you should be familiar - with Article 24 of the Spanish Constitution."
"But all free and democratic Constitutions contain their Article 48, Article 11 or Article 24."
"I therefore hope that, when you are in a position to understand what the presumption of innocence means, and, in particular, when you are in a position to properly understand a case about which, to judge from what you have said, you clearly know absolutely nothing, you will be capable of making a private and public apology, and I shall be willing to accept it."
"Yours was an unfortunate and unacceptable intervention with which to end the debate tonight, Mr Kohl√≠ƒçek."
"(Applause from the right and from the centre)"
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Martine Roure, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council concerning the progress of the negotiations on the framework decision on action to combat racism and xenophobia."
"rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, the European Union is based on humanist values, of tolerance, multiculturalism and protection of fundamental rights."
"We share strong values that should be protected."
"The fight against racism and xenophobia is one of our priorities, but we must bear in mind Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is devoted to freedom of thought, conscience and religion while respecting the inalienable right to freedom of expression, in accordance with Article 11 of this same Charter."
"The Commission presented a proposal for a Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia in November 2001, in order to bring closer together the legislative provisions of Member States in relation to racist and xenophobic offences and to fight more effectively against racism and xenophobia in Europe."
"Until now, and despite an initial opinion issued by the European Parliament in July 2002, this Framework Decision has been at a standstill."
"In spite of the efforts of several Presidencies, Member States have still not been able to reach an agreement on the definition of punishable behaviour and the level of corresponding penalties to be imposed."
"It is, therefore, absolutely essential to have a European instrument that makes it possible to combat racism and xenophobia."
"Recent statistics show that racism and intolerance are on the increase."
"The growth in extreme right-wing parties in Europe and, unfortunately, within our own Parliament, obliges us to strongly condemn any speech that incites hatred."
"This Framework Decision obliges us, however, to find a fair balance between freedom of expression and sanctions for offensive behaviour."
"The freedom to mock and criticise certain excesses, be they political or religious, are necessary in all democracies."
"The European Council has finally come to an agreement on this subject and we are pleased about this."
"Indeed, the European Union must spread a strong political message to fight against public expressions of racism or hatred."
"We cannot allow ourselves to fail again on a text that is symbolic for the European Union."
"I should like to thank the German Presidency for this strong message, which confirms that Europe is not just a great market, but is working for the defence of the fundamental rights of all European citizens."
"This new compromise is the fruit of long and difficult negotiations and we are aware that, of necessity, it has its weaknesses."
"Nonetheless, I want this political compromise to constitute a minimum level of harmonisation that will allow Member States to go further in future, and I am particularly pleased by the addition of a review clause which will make it possible to achieve a higher level of harmonisation in future years."
"Having said that, in order to compensate for these weaknesses, I call on the Commission to present in parallel a proposal for a directive on the fight against all the forms of discrimination listed in Article 13 of the Treaty, in order to strengthen European legislation in this area."
"I know, in fact, that Mr ≈†pidla is working towards this, I think."
"I hope that we shall soon have a proposal for a directive."
"Finally, this political agreement on the framework decision has brought about substantial changes in the text in comparison with the Commission's first proposal on which Parliament gave its opinion."
"Consequently, Parliament should be consulted again in the next few weeks."
"We will issue our opinion quickly, you can be sure of that, because we have all worked hard for several months."
"We are all set."
"This instrument is absolutely necessary for us to live in a world at peace, in which everyone is respected with their differences, beliefs and ways of life."
"This instrument is essential if we are to put an end to hatred and racism in a united and fraternal Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her speech and for her report."
"The political agreement reached at the Council last April, after five years of negotiations, was certainly highly significant."
"This agreement, albeit on a less ambitious version of the framework decision than the Commission's original proposal, in fact ensures that from the moment the framework decision enters into force and is transposed in each Member State, there will no longer be any safe haven in Europe for those who incite racial hatred, racism and xenophobia."
"This represents a political success."
"I appreciate that the text of the framework decision contains penal provisions that could have been much harsher."
"I would have preferred stricter legislation."
"However, as the rapporteur has just said, we had to accept a compromise because, it being a framework decision, the principle of unanimity meant that we could not set our sights as high as we would have liked to."
"Nevertheless, for the first time we have a common rule, stipulating that behaviour inciting hatred or discrimination based on race, skin colour or religion must be punished with criminal sanctions in all Member States."
"Consider how important it is to punish behaviour inciting anti-Semitic or Islamophobic hatred at a time in which we are talking about integrating immigrants from outside the European Union into our communities."
"One of the main issues has certainly been to find the balance between criminal punishment for such behaviour, which is not free expression of thought but concrete incitement to commit violent acts and must be punished as such, and due respect for freedom of expression."
"We have worked hard on this aspect and I believe that the final result is satisfactory."
"The measure is not intended to punish ideas, but behaviour inciting other people to commit criminal acts, to attack, to wound, to kill and to commit real acts of violence."
"All this has absolutely nothing do with freedom of thought."
"We are not punishing ideas, but those who, on the basis of a mistaken, if legitimate, idea, move from this idea to behaviour inciting others to attack and to commit criminal acts."
"This is the boundary between freedom of expression of thought, which must be safeguarded, and concrete incitement to violence."
"This is why I believe this decision to be significant."
"It is for this reason that we have established the principle - which is highlighted in Mrs Roure's report - by which a racist motive shall be considered an aggravating circumstance in all offences."
"If an ordinary offence involving physical violence is committed for racist motives, it must be more severely punished, since not only incitement as such, but also racist motives, make a given offence more serious than the act itself."
"This is an important principle, and I believe that the fact that all 27 Member States have accepted it unanimously puts the European Union in a better position to uphold this key value listed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I wish first of all to apologise for Mrs Esteves, shadow rapporteur for my group, who unfortunately will not be able to take part in this debate."
"I thank Mrs Roure for her work, her application and her perseverance because, yes, perseverance was needed to keep on demanding that the Council reach an extremely necessary agreement."
"More than five years of negotiation to reach a proposal for a framework decision on racism and xenophobia: is it really reasonable to have stalled for so long measures that are so fundamental to the lives of our fellow citizens?"
"I should like also to warmly thank the German Presidency for succeeding in breaking the deadlock on this text."
"The European Union is founded on communities with values, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity."
"By uniting, we have all decided to share those values."
"Ladies and gentlemen, declarations of good intentions are not much use, if they are not followed up with strong actions."
"That is why it was necessary to act, to act practically, so that intolerance, in all its forms, should no longer poison our continent."
"Harmonisation of the legislation of Member States in relation to offences of a racist nature was vital."
"Henceforth, every Member State will have to make it an imprisonable offence to publicly justify, deny or crudely trivialise crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and I am satisfied about that."
"Nonetheless, I will not hide from you that my satisfaction is not absolute: yes, the adoption of this text sends a strong signal, especially in this European Year of Equal Opportunities, but I am afraid that its added value may be minimal."
"In fact derogations are anticipated and flexibility accepted."
"Therefore, behaviour will be penalised only if it could incite to violence or hatred towards a group of people."
"How, then, is it tolerable for a revisionist to be able to express his views in some European countries in the name of freedom of expression?"
"Freedom of expression stops when the rights of others are flouted."
"I completely understand that there are different cultural and legal traditions in our Member States, but the fight against racism must not be the subject of any compromise."
"Tolerating certain expressions of hatred is, in actual fact, accepting them."
"Ladies and gentlemen, as elected representatives, we shall have to be clear and condemn forcibly these acts of violence."
"We must remain vigilant because our fight in defence of human rights and for respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights is far from over."
"I ask you, tomorrow, to vote very broadly in favour of this text."
"This battle is ours."
"It is an honour to our European democracies and an honour to our Parliament."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am not only indebted to Mrs Roure for her report, it also receives my unqualified support."
"Racism is a persistent and growing problem in European societies."
"This is why more and better instruments are needed to address it, including at European level, should this prove necessary."
"As racism knows no boundaries, neither should measures to address it therefore."
"Last year, my resolution on racism in football met with overwhelming support in this House, and I hope that this will also be the case for Mrs Roure's report tomorrow."
"In the resolution on football, we called for a tougher approach, but a European stand on racism should not confine itself to football alone."
"Europe must promote the safeguarding of equal treatment for all its citizens."
"This is why proper education is needed, as is Europe's active commitment in favour of social inclusion in a bid to isolate those advocating racism and xenophobia and to strive towards a tolerant and diverse society."
"I am pleased that hate crimes are being highlighted in particular in Mrs Roure's report."
"I also endorse the appeal not to introduce a hierarchy among the different grounds for discrimination."
"All forms of discrimination, including Islamophobia therefore, should be addressed in the same tough way."
"The report mentions 9 million victims of racism and xenophobia."
"This is probably an accurate figure, but as I see it, 494 million citizens are the victims of racism, because if racism goes unpunished, then this has a damaging effect on society as a whole."
"Europe is there for everyone, and we should, above all, keep it this way."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to pay my compliments to Martine Roure, who has once again done a great job."
"I would also like to commend the German Presidency for having secured this deal, but again I note with deep regret that the Council is absent during this important debate."
"However, I am very happy that this legal instrument has finally been adopted."
"It is long awaited and very welcome, but now much depends on whether and how it will be used in practice, because a legal instrument making hate crimes a criminal offence is only the last resort."
"A legal instrument will not eliminate racism."
"Only our own attitude and our own mentality can do that, and we need much more than just this framework decision."
"We need to promote equality, respect and tolerance, and that should be more than just words."
"Each of us has a responsibility in Europe."
"Legislation is not enough and we should lead by example."
"I very much concur with Mr Gaubert, who made reference to statements by people in public."
"That does not just apply to the average citizen but, even more so, to prominent politicians and religious leaders - in short, opinion leaders."
"It is therefore regrettable that even prominent people in Europe have recently made statements that incite hatred and violence."
"They contribute to a climate of intolerance and hatred."
"I refer, for example, to the President of one of the Member States, who made very denigrating remarks about Roma people."
"It is unacceptable and I think that Parliament at least should speak out against such unacceptable statements."
"I am also referring to a Member of this House, Mr Giertych, who issued an anti-Semitic leaflet."
"Fortunately we reacted very strongly to that."
"I am also thinking of Mr Wilders in my own country, who made the most outrageous remarks in a debate yesterday, to which nobody reacted."
"That is another problem: we allow these extremists to set the political agenda."
"Even the mainstream parties have adapted their language to the language spoken by extremists."
"So we should look very carefully at our own statements and our own behaviour."
"Finally, I very much agree with the call for the legislation to be extended to cover other groups, because we all know that hatred and violence against homosexuals is rampant in Europe, even in my own country, unfortunately, as it is against women."
"Sometimes we tend to forget that, but there are many statements that somehow seem to make violence against women acceptable."
"The next step should be to create a legal instrument that condemns incitement to hatred and violence against all groups of society."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her commitment on this ongoing dossier, which should have been on the statute books before now."
"As others have said, we also think that action is important."
"Last year, we saw a rise in anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hate crimes in many parts of the European Union, or at least those parts which record such crimes effectively."
"As others have said, it is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and many of our citizens, residents and visitors still face discrimination and hate crimes simply because of the colour of their skin, their beliefs or because they have committed the perceived crime of being foreign."
"The Director of Human Rights First stated that 'victimising one member of a particular group threatens all members of that group and causes immeasurable harm to society at large'."
"My group sees this framework decision as a complement to existing legislation, but we also want to see existing legislation fully implemented."
"We support the call to be reconsulted on this dossier, and we have some concerns, for example that provisions for mutual assistance between Member States have been removed, which may make it more difficult to combat cross-border racism."
"We know that there is significant international organisation, for example, among groups based on despicable concepts of racial supremacy."
"We have co-signed the constructive amendments to this report."
"Other amendments represent to us part of the problem, but we look to the Council for constructive and forceful action in conjunction with Parliament."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Mrs Roure for her persistent work with the Council in putting together this framework decision."
"It has taken a long time, but we can say that we have at last reached an important milestone."
"It is quite right that we should combat racism and xenophobia with legal instruments, but I think that above all we must implement widespread cultural action."
"I believe that this Parliament also has the means to initiate an effective information campaign in Member States, to ensure that this framework decision can be organised into a great cultural battle of ideas."
"I believe that it is necessary to fight against racism and xenophobia, because the data provided by the European Monitoring Centre are alarming."
"There are increasing reports of racist and xenophobic behaviour, and it is my belief that we must tackle those who frequently attempt to incite racial and religious hatred."
"This can be achieved primarily through the media, which are all too often used to communicate messages that are highly dangerous for society."
"I believe that the initiative adopted by the Council, but above all the work carried out by Mrs Roure in this Parliament, will serve as an effective tool for the political efforts and for continuing this work."
"As Mr Frattini has said, we need to establish the limits within which there is a balance between freedom of expression and the fight against racism and xenophobia."
"I believe that this is vital and that we need to implement strong political measures and important cultural action."
"(LT) Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, in the Berlin Declaration adopted on 25 March this year it is stated: 'European integration has shown that we have learned from our history full of bloody conflicts and suffering'."
"I believe this is so, and one proof thereof is the document we are considering today."
"The basic resolution defines the following as crimes: fomenting hatred and violence, public endorsement of genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and refusal to acknowledge these crimes or immense trivialisation of these crimes."
"The basic resolution limits itself to crimes perpetrated on the basis of race, skin colour, religion, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin."
"However, it does not deal with similar crimes committed for other reasons, such as hate and violence against certain people because of their political beliefs, or their affiliation with a certain social group, or the social situation of groups of individuals - for example, the crimes perpetrated by totalitarian r√©gimes."
"I think the time is coming for a supplementary document which could deal with fomenting hatred and violence, public endorsement of genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes directed against groups of individuals defined by criteria other than race, skin colour, religion, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin, which I have already mentioned."
"Such a document might address, for example, social situation or political beliefs, refusal to acknowledge these crimes, or trivialisation of these crimes."
"Criminal responsibility could be laid down in these instances."
"The European Commission's initiative in fostering public discussion at the European level of genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity, and war crimes perpetrated by totalitarian r√©gimes and those who endorse them, grossly distort them or diminish them, is welcome and worthy of support."
"On the basis of these discussions, after two or three years it should be possible to submit another proposal concerning a fundamental resolution on these crimes."
"(LT) Mr President, I congratulate the author of the report, Martine Roure, on her courage, and extra loud praise goes to Germany, which has proclaimed adoption of a resolution on the fight against racism and xenophobia to be a priority of its presidency."
"The idea of the European Union is based on tolerance, trust and peaceful coexistence of nations."
"Unfortunately, in recent times the number of racist and xenophobic attacks is not diminishing; instead it is getting close to 10 million per annum."
"Racist, xenophobic and anti-Semitic elements are being used not just by extremist parties - even the apparently more stable mass-membership parties and their leaders do not shy away from them."
"Even in this Chamber and in some national parliaments it is not uncommon to hear speeches steeped in extreme nationalism and xenophobia."
"I agree with the rapporteur that in a culture based on rights and freedoms, criminal law is the last resort to be used desirably as little as possible."
"However, it is inevitable that penal policy will have to be used to tighten up this area."
"I fully support Commissioner Frattini's opinion that a racist motive in a crime should mean an increased penalty for that crime."
"No less a priority is education, likewise dialogue between different religions and cultures, and a measured and thoughtful look at the past."
"Even when people are feeling their most tolerant, if discussions start about whose tragedy is the greatest and whose pain hurts the most, this is the road to the trampling of tolerance and lack of trust in one another."
"For the new countries of the European Union the issue of restoring historical justice is particularly sensitive."
"The time is coming for an attempt to reconcile the attitudes of old EU members and the new countries to the tragedies and painful events of the 20th century."
"This needs to be done without some parties feeling a monopoly on morality, able to force their opinion on other nations."
"The most important aim is not to exacerbate, but to heal wounds, to learn from history and to block the path for any rebirth of racism and xenophobia."
"Mr President, whether it is the increase of Islamophobia or the sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks, intolerance in Europe is on the rise."
"It is long overdue and more important than ever for the EU to remain firm by adopting legislation to counteract these worrying phenomena."
"This text does not, in itself, constitute the concrete action needed to address the persistent problems of racism and xenophobia in Europe today."
"It could be stronger by using the International Convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination as a benchmark."
"Secondly, this legislation must reaffirm Europe's commitment to our core values of respect for diversity and intolerance of discrimination, a commitment that must amount to so much more than the sum of the political compromises of the Council's text."
"In the current political climate, where support for right-wing extremism across Europe has brought racism into the mainstream, moderates must use this legislation and the dialogue that will surround its implementation to take back ownership of the diversity debate."
"We must rebuild the bonds of trust between divided communities and we must ensure that feelings of alienation are replaced with a much-needed sense of security."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, first, I am delighted to say that I share Mr Gaubert's kind words for Mrs Roure."
"She is an MEP to whose outstanding work we have become accustomed, and she has once again proved this and, as Mr Catania correctly pointed out, her tenacity."
"Crimes of a racist nature continue to be a constant, persistent problem in all Member States."
"The first step must always be that of prevention."
"It is necessary to try to prevent racism and xenophobia by means of a policy of education as early as possible and by means of political and social discourse aimed at preventing the dissemination of hate and the promotion of xenophobia and racism."
"The figures from the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia confront us with this reality in the EU."
"Whilst it is important to recognise, in legal terms, that the Member States have legal provisions at their disposal, it is also necessary to point out that there are major differences between these provisions, and that harmonisation needs to take place."
"This framework decision is therefore welcome insofar as it comprises a certain level of harmonisation of the Member States' criminal law and improved mutual assistance in combating racism and xenophobia."
"With this initiative, Parliament has presented its recommendations and adopted its positions on an issue on which - let us not forget - it has been much more consistent than the Council."
"(LT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Nazism and communism are two banks of one river."
"Nazism has been studied in detail by academics and politicians; it is well known and condemned by the international community."
"Germany itself has contributed to this process, understanding and acknowledging its historical mistakes."
"We know little about the other bank of the worst crimes of the past century - communism."
"It is hardly discussed; therefore, its crimes against humanity have not yet been acknowledged on a global scale."
"About 20 million people died during the Nazi period and the Holocaust; but 100 million people of various nationalities became the victims of communism."
"I support the Council's basic resolution and the declaration adopted with the basic resolution, in which the Council condemns the crimes committed by totalitarian r√©gimes."
"I invite Member States to continue the work of exposing the crimes committed by communist r√©gimes, assessing them appropriately and supplementing the basic resolution."
"I invite the European Parliament to initiate discussions about the crimes of communism and to make its own input by acknowledging communism to be a crime against humanity."
"Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Roure, for her excellent report on this important but, it seems, highly controversial subject."
"It is important since it is estimated that millions of people fall victim to racist crime each year."
"It is controversial since it involves striking a balance between effective action to combat racism and xenophobia on one hand and respect for freedom of expression on the other."
"In fact, the subject apparently seems to be so controversial that the text currently under discussion has been the product of several years of negotiations."
"This of course begs the question, was it strictly necessary that so much time was and still is spent before arriving at a suitable solution?"
"Let us think of the millions of people who have suffered as a result of this serious time lag."
"Is the reason for this extreme delay purely technical politics, or even negligent indifference?"
"Or is there some underlying attempt not to proceed speedily as some influential political forces are not so favourable to such action and are themselves bordering on being racist and xenophobic?"
"Perhaps the Commissioner can reassure that the latter is not the case at all and that my fears are utterly unfounded."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 142 of the Rules of Procedure)"
"in writing. - I have become increasingly concerned by the rise of racism and xenophobia across the EU, both in new Member States and established Member States."
"In a Union which has the free movement of people as a central pillar, this is doubtless an issue which requires Community action."
"Indeed, initiatives like the European Year of Equal Opportunities, which we are currently in, are key to spreading best practise in eradicating discrimination."
"It is important that these efforts are redoubled in order to counter the rise in Islamophobia, Anti-Semitism and discrimination against other minority groups, especially those from new Member States."
"We, as a House, and all of the European Union institutions and Member States must do our utmost to rid Europe of the scourge of racism and xenophobia, and make clear that it will not be tolerated."
"Decision-making in the common European asylum system (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Hubert Pirker, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on asylum: practical cooperation: quality of decision-making in the common European asylum system."
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, the proposals we have drawn up in this report take us one step closer to a common European asylum system."
"The report, which - I assume - will receive broad support from Parliament, represents a clear declaration of commitment by the European Parliament to a functioning European asylum system that aims to take speedy, fair, sure decisions in the interests of those concerned."
"It is based on closer cooperation between authorities, cooperation that should have the objectives of building and increasing trust between Member States, of speeding up decisions and thereby providing help more quickly than before to those with a genuine claim to asylum, and of enabling us to combat abuses of the system accordingly."
"I have been able to highlight 10 core demands, and I should like to express my particular thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their support and to the Commission for its excellent proposal, on which this discussion has been based."
"These 10 core demands are as follows."
"The first concerns the establishment of uniform procedures so that speedy, sure decisions can be taken."
"The second demand is for the introduction of a list of safe countries of origin, to enable a very clear decision, depending on the individual case, as to whether or not a claim is justified."
"The third is the drawing-up of a joint database on the situation in countries of origin, so that all the competent civil servants in the various Member States have the same information at their disposal regarding this situation and thus are all in a position to take sure decisions on the basis of the same information source."
"The fourth is that we need highly skilled civil servants to take the decisions."
"This is the rationale behind the proposal for the development of a European curriculum, so that qualifications are acquired according to the same standards in all Member States."
"The fifth demand is that we help Member States who are under particular pressure from migration flows by temporarily - for as long as necessary - providing teams of experts comprising members from the various Member States, to enable the speedy completion of asylum procedures."
"The sixth point is that we need to improve measures for the repatriation of persons, more particularly those who have not been granted refugee status or whose refugee status has been revoked."
"The seventh point concerns prevention, and I have already mentioned it many times. We have to launch intensive information campaigns to inform potential migrants in countries of origin and transit of the risks inherent in illegal immigration and the consequences of denial of refugee status, and also inform them of legal means of entry into the European Union."
"The eighth point concerns the European Support Office."
"The committee disagreed with the Commission proposal on this."
"I think it would be better to provide the Commission with more staff and funds than to set up yet another agency, as I believe this would be more efficient and economical."
"The ninth point is that we must demand that Member States do indeed transpose the directives or regulations adopted at European level."
"In this regard, a 'table of equivalences' has been proposed - namely one in which Member States set out the measures with which they believe they have transposed the corresponding Community requirements."
"The tenth and final point concerns the sharing out of the burden that is afforded by, for example, teams of experts providing support to enable faster completion of procedures in exceptional situations."
"Indirectly, the fact of having uniform procedures would also share out the burden to a certain degree, as it would avoid people heading in larger numbers for countries where procedures are lax or based on incorrect information."
"This should not be the case."
"We have endeavoured to present a catalogue of points highlighting in specific terms how we believe that, in future, help can be provided quickly to genuine refugees to whom refugee status has been granted and, equally, it can be made clear to others that they cannot attain this status."
"I should like to express my thanks for the cooperation and support I have received."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should especially like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, for the report, which contains a series of very useful recommendations."
"Many of these recommendations address the level of ambition that a truly comprehensive common European asylum system should have."
"Many of the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in this report are addressed in our Green Paper on the future of asylum policy, which I proposed on 6 June and which the Commission has adopted, and on which I intend to launch a broad European debate."
"The ultimate objective pursued at European level is thus to establish a level playing field."
"Asylum seekers should have access to protection under equivalent conditions in all Member States - that is the first precondition."
"The goal pursued in the first stage was to harmonise Member States' legal frameworks on the basis of common minimum standards, but the goal in the second stage should be to achieve both a higher standard and greater equality of protection across the EU, as well as greater solidarity between Member States."
"It will be necessary to identify existing gaps and deficits and to pursue further legislative harmonisation while guaranteeing high standards."
"For example, models need to be explored for the design of a single procedure for assessing applications for refugee status and for subsidiary protection."
"It is also necessary to reflect on the need for fuller harmonisation and clarification of the European rules regarding the reception conditions granted to asylum seekers."
"Reflection is also needed on whether the criteria for allocating responsibility currently applicable under the Dublin system should be complemented in order take other factors into account, such as more equitable distribution between Member States on the basis of their capacity to process asylum applications and to offer long-term prospects to recognised refugees."
"This is a very important point, raised by a number of Member States, particularly by our Maltese friends, who stressed the importance of integrating the current Dublin regulation."
"I am studying this point."
"Based on the results of this wide debate and after a public hearing to be held on 18 October with the full involvement of Parliament, I will issue a policy plan at the beginning of 2008."
"The policy plan will set out further measures to construct the comprehensive asylum system along with a timeframe for adoption."
"I am confident that with the due institutional framework which will fully involve the European Parliament in the legislative process - I refer to the codecision procedure - we will be able to match this high level of ambition."
"On the specific issues addressed in Mr Pirker's report concerning practical cooperation, there is a need to enhance converge of practice between Member States."
"Training is certainly one of the areas where practical cooperation is taking place."
"At the moment, the development of a common curriculum is under way."
"We will establish a first pilot European-wide portal on the exchange of country of origin information by the end of this year, in a few months' time."
"For the time being, this will only connect some of the existing databases and will be accessible to selected national authorities, but my services also intend to carry out a feasibility study on how to provide a better structural support to practical cooperation activities; the idea is to have a European support office."
"It should be remembered that the European Refugee Fund can provide, through Community actions, financial support to Member States to implement projects, in cooperation with the United Nations, to improve the quality of their asylum systems."
"In the new World Programme for 2007, specific mention is made of this point."
"The Commission has also proposed to amend the European Refugee Fund, precisely to provide rapid financial support to those Member States that face particular pressure because of sudden arrivals of migrants at their borders, some of whom are in need of international protection."
"In addition, the new budget line 'Preparatory action: Migration management - Solidarity in action', which is the name of the project, will be used to assist Member States faced with particular difficulties."
"We will fund it with a supplementary amount of money of about EUR 7 million."
"Finally, of course, as the rapporteur has just said, one of our main political objectives is to make a clear distinction between economic migrants on the one hand and true refugees on the other."
"Thus, there will be credible European policies for the return of third-country nationals who are staying illegally, in full respect of their human rights and fundamental freedoms."
"rapporteur on behalf of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has always been committed to setting up a common asylum system by 2010."
"The report by Mr Pirker, whom I congratulate for his excellent work, points out the necessity of maintaining this objective."
"The purpose of creating a common asylum policy must be the protection of the individual and not the reduction or externalisation of asylum applications."
"European policy must be based on the obligation to admit asylum seekers and the principle of non-refoulement, in accordance with the Geneva Convention."
"Working out a uniform status, improving the quality of decision-making, single European procedures on compilation and examination, common use of information on countries of origin, and improving cooperation between Member States will, I hope, allow people whose situation requires urgent protection to enter European territory in complete safety and to see their application examined as it should be."
"Nonetheless, the need to improve cooperation in relation to information on countries of origin should not be limited to keeping a generalised list of third countries, as the reliability of such a list would be uncertain."
"On the contrary, assessment case by case on the basis of the rights of the individual needs to be introduced."
"Europe must also share between the different Member States the burdens and responsibilities of its asylum and immigration policy by helping countries such as Malta, which are no longer capable of absorbing further influxes."
"Furthermore, I pointed out with concern, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the total absence of gender issues in the European Commission's communication."
"Aspects relating to women's rights as well as protection of minors are completely ignored."
"The same goes for the rights of homosexuals and transsexuals."
"I consider also that gender-based persecutions, that is marital and domestic violence, female genital mutilations, sexual abuse, crimes of honour, rape, forced marriages and crimes resulting from enforcement of Sharia law, must be legally considered as sufficient reason for granting asylum."
"The Commission must establish practical criteria for granting asylum or a special humanitarian status for women suffering violence of this kind."
"I also highlighted the need to put in place special training for people authorised to admit asylum seekers, in particular women, children and older people, and to provide reception centres suitable for these people."
"I am delighted that the rapporteur has taken note of this, although I regret that his report devotes only one paragraph to these concerns relating to gender, which seem to me to be of vital importance's the more so because we can no longer ignore the lack of respect by most reception centres for the basic human rights of the individual."
"I realise, however, after listening to the Commissioner, that this is a subject he feels strongly about, for which I thank him, and so I have high hopes."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Pirker and to say to him - although I am sure Mr Weber will do so with greater authority - that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will of course support his report, which is aimed at improving cooperation and the decision-making process in asylum policy."
"I wish to congratulate Mr Frattini on his speech and I must tell him that this is an issue that very much reflects the difficulty we are having in making decisions."
"In an area without borders, an area of free movement, asylum is perhaps the clearest example of an area in which there needs to be harmonisation between the Member States and the creation of a common system."
"The point is that we are working towards 2010 and, if all goes according to plan, we should have a common asylum system up and running by then."
"I am aware that this is a tricky issue on which a lowest common denominator, 'race to the bottom', strategy has been adopted, which leaves the way open for differences between Member States and for the continuation of so-called 'asylum shopping'."
"I should like to raise three brief points on issues that I feel are essential."
"Firstly, I feel it is necessary to create a single EU-wide procedure to ensure that decisions are taken quickly and are duly substantiated and fair."
"Secondly, I wish to echo the view expressed by Mr Frattini, that the quality of decisions depends on the quality of information."
"It is therefore necessary to deliver the best possible procedure in terms of gathering and exchanging information."
"Lastly, I feel it is necessary to strengthen cooperation between the Member States, which also means addressing the issue of solidarity and burden-sharing."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome this report because over recent months we have clearly seen a fall in the overall number of asylum-seekers coming to the European Union from the key asylum-producing countries."
"But that number is of course now increasing, partly as a result of Iraq, and the number of people coming to the European Union because of extreme poverty - the people that we see coming to Malta, Lampedusa and so on - is a huge issue for this House and for the European Union."
"Because of this, any report which moves towards a better procedure and a better common policy on asylum is welcome."
"The compromises which we have had in this report are very welcome and the cooperation from the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, is very welcome also."
"What are we trying to achieve in this report?"
"In referring directly to what Mr Pirker has listed, and to Mr Frattini's speech, we believe that the single procedure is extremely important."
"Decision-making with one operation for the assessment of applications granting refugee status and granting access to subsidiary protection is extremely important."
"This kind of efficiency in asylum decision-making is vital."
"We also believe that the quality of asylum decision-making is extremely poor across the European Union."
"To increase the quality of asylum decisions - and I speak from my own experience as a lawyer having dealt with asylum applications - is vital."
"We know that, in creating this quality of asylum decision-making, we need open systems with information that can be genuinely assessed: sophisticated information, information which can be cross-referenced."
"What we probably do not want to see are databases which are, perhaps, for officials only, but ones that can be examined by outside experts."
"Many Member States currently have this quality of decision-making, and it is extremely important."
"In terms of the role of the Commission, we also want to see the door kept open to a European agency, because we want to see the Commission's role being full and resourced."
"We cannot have it both ways; we cannot have a role for the Commission in the issue of asylum for the European Union and, on the other hand, not pay for it and resource it."
"Finally, there will be differences between our parties on the common safe list, but the compromises we have sought to create, I think, are worthy of support in this House."
"On Dublin II, we know that there are imperfections in burden sharing, one of the most vital issues in this report, and on the issue of asylum in the European Union."
"We need to strive towards making Dublin II and burden sharing a reality."
"If this report can move us towards a better common asylum system, then it is worthy of support in this House, and we in the Socialist Group will be supporting this report fully."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the rapporteur's intent is commendable; he has put together an excellent report aimed at rationalising asylum practices and making them more efficient."
"Nonetheless, we must continue to work along these lines, not least to correct the legal and practical interpretation of this institution, which, precisely because it is so crucial from a humanitarian point of view, must not be subject to abuse or be confused with other areas and other concerns such as economic migration, which have nothing to do with the inalienable principle of the right of asylum."
"Furthermore, for reasons of decency, we cannot allow an institution of such importance to be used by criminal organisations, as was shown recently by the highly significant findings of an investigation carried out by our police in Italy, which routed an extremely dangerous gang active in various criminal sectors and using the very asylum system itself to recruit people to carry out crime."
"I am sure that the Commission is deeply concerned about these problems, which we must never tire of highlighting, in order to protect this institution that is so important."
"I would also like to point out the need to create reception areas for asylum seekers in safe third countries outside of the European Union, since Dum Bruxelles o Strasburgo consulitur, Saguntum expugnatur [while Brussels or Strasbourg talk, Saguntum falls], in the sense that the landings continue, the assault by criminal organisations continues and, above all, this tragedy of trafficking in human flesh continues, the consequences of which we are all aware of."
"We must also be on full alert to ensure that asylum is not granted to members of fundamentalist Islamist organisations."
"This does in fact happen and it is often in this way that the threat of Al Qaeda and its presence in Europe increases."
"I do not agree, however, that the European Court of Justice should be given greater powers on asylum, thus taking jurisdiction away from Member States."
"In particular, I would like to invite the Council to restore to the Court of Justice all of its powers on preliminary rulings."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I am not quite sure how we got from the subject of the need for high standards of protection to al-Qa'ida;"
"I will try to concentrate on the report rather than what is not in it."
"My group would also like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this report, even though, on some compromises, I think all of us could feel the eggshells cracking as we moved towards agreement."
"As has already been said, the report covers a number of important points: the high standards we expect, the primacy of protection, the issue of raising the quality of decision-making, the availability of sound country information to all those involved in the process, effective staff training, the use of the quality initiative (recently seen in the UK, which certainly needed some help) and the involvement of the UNHCR."
"All these points are necessary, because the people making decisions are deciding on what are matters of life and death for many of the people they see."
"We welcome the recognition of the need for a single procedure in all Member States and find it very interesting that we are talking about reviewing the role of the Court of Justice this week."
"This might be a good time to pass that point on to the Council."
"We are also looking forward to the debate on Dublin II, although our group will support Amendment 17 on that."
"We agree that the Commission lacks sufficient resources to monitor effectively the implementation and quality of the common asylum policy."
"We hope that our political groups will take up that message when looking at the budget and decisions in that area."
"We know that there is disagreement on the Support Office, but, like the Socialists, we would welcome the opportunity to hear the Commission to spell out its intentions in that regard in order to see whether we want to move ahead with that proposal."
"We have tabled no amendments to this report, but we shall support the constructive amendments relating to the issue of safe third countries."
"However, there is no way that we can support some of the amendments."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today, 20 June, is World Refugee Day, which makes this debate particularly fitting."
"There is however great hypocrisy in our debate, as just two days ago this Parliament decided to remove the issue of Iraqi refugees from the list of urgent matters."
"This is an extremely important issue, given that we are talking about over four million people fleeing an infamous and illegal war."
"We should in fact be discussing this matter and the difficulties that the European Union has in receiving these refugees, the majority of whom are received outside of the European Union, and considering how these refugees are often received in our territory."
"A European Parliament delegation recently visited Samo and noted that within the detention centre on that island - a horrifying place - there were Iraqi, Palestinian, Lebanese and Afghan asylum seekers, all people from war zones."
"I therefore believe that we must think long and hard about the need to guarantee respect for the right of asylum, in order to prevent that which has unfortunately occurred frequently in Europe in recent years, namely mass expulsions and failure to honour the right of non-refoulement."
"We have witnessed too many symbolic cases; the fact is that over the last few years migratory pressure has increased and successful applications for asylum in Europe have decreased."
"I believe that this is indicative of a problem that we have within the European Union."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, I could not agree more with the 10-point emergency plan by Mr Pirker, whom I should like to warmly congratulate on this."
"Last week, we were again shocked by the fact that people are drowning on their way to Europe."
"Eleven people drowned near Lampedusa."
"Today's Dutch newspaper, Trouw, features the harrowing account of Somali refugees who tried to reach Yemen under adverse conditions."
"We should therefore try to set up a better asylum procedure and at the same time take measures to distinguish asylum seekers from illegal immigrants as a matter of relevant urgency."
"Whilst achieving better asylum policy thanks to practical cooperation may sound like a very good idea, it is unrealistic."
"Practical cooperation is not enough."
"We also need the political will to take the necessary steps."
"When I read the Dutch newspapers about the Justice Ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday of last week, I get the impression that this political will is absent, because the ongoing issues in the discussion are the real deployment of people and equipment."
"While we cannot agree on the common Frontex deployment, a common admission policy for refugees from Iraq, for example, is unlikely."
"Without a common position on third country security, European official reports cannot be compiled, which is, after all, a precondition for moving harmonised asylum policy forward."
"I anticipate major problems surrounding the implementation of the plan to compile a list of safe countries of origin."
"Which sources are reliable?"
"Can the sources of information from countries that are unsafe be made public?"
"After all, it is highly dangerous to collect evidence against regimes in the grip of a dictatorship."
"This is a double-edged sword though."
"A list of safe countries includes countries with which we can forge trade relations, but if a country does not feature on the list of safe countries, refugees should be welcome."
"It is then necessary to suspend trade relations with unsafe countries in order to promote human rights."
"This is where big problems will arise."
"It is unlikely that former French or British colonies that are currently in the grip of a brutal regime will be excluded from relations with the European Union."
"I should like to hear from Commissioner Frattini how he will avert this problem."
"In addition, harmonised asylum policy benefits from clarity."
"Mr Catania has tabled an amendment in which he pleads in favour of open reception centres for asylum seekers and other immigrants."
"In my country, asylum seekers stay in open asylum seeker centres."
"Illegals are brought to closed centres, with good reason."
"It strikes me as unwise to set up open reception camps on the Union's external borders."
"Support for asylum policy is bound to be undermined if people can move around freely without any valid documents."
"If the European Union seeks to formulate a charitable and fair asylum policy, there must be a political will to back this up."
"I call on the Council and Commission to display this will in a bid to prevent new victims."
"(SK) First of all, I too would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for drafting the report on this serious topic."
"I welcome the strengthening of practical cooperation between Member States in view of the need for solidarity in dealing with problems which Member States without internal borders cannot address effectively."
"I concur with his view that decisions on granting refugee status should be taken more quickly, more fairly, and more predictably, which in itself is the ultimate objective of introducing a common European asylum system."
"As a rapporteur expressing an opinion on EU strategy in the area of children's rights, and specifically on the situation of children in developing countries, I deal with the issues of the children of refugees, children of immigrants without nationality and internally displaced children."
"Many children of refugees and children seeking asylum are treated like adults, which leaves behind a lasting trauma."
"Children suffer in refugee camps, where they very often become victims of neglect, violence, abuse, intolerance and inadequate legal protection."
"Immigrants, refugees and displaced children account for 5% of all asylum seekers."
"This suggests that on their arrival in the country, such children should be assigned well-trained legal representatives who will be in a position to best represent their interests."
"Mr President, I want to congratulate Mr Pirker for his excellent report and I am also glad to hear that the Commission supports the call of my country, Malta, for a fairer share of responsibility, even with respect to the Dublin Regulation."
"In fact, any review of the Dublin Regulation must surely take into account the unintended effects of the current rules, whereby countries such as mine are being obliged to carry a disproportionate responsibility simply because they are border Member States."
"To establish a fairer division of responsibility we need to ensure that solidarity is truly rendered meaningful."
"So far, it has to be said that in EU policymaking 'solidarity' has always meant granting financial assistance."
"Now this is no longer sufficient."
"We need to go beyond that."
"A true meaning of solidarity must also mean something beyond throwing money at the problem; beyond merely writing a cheque."
"It must also mean sharing the burden, sharing the responsibility."
"It must also mean opening up our borders to share with border Member States the responsibility of dealing with asylum seekers and others who make it often perilously, but alas illegally, to EU territory."
"So in reviewing Dublin, I agree with the report that we need a fairer share of the burden."
"Finally, one issue regarding timing: we are discussing the establishment of a common asylum system by 2010."
"It is urgently needed today."
"So we should ask ourselves, how many lives will be lost before 2010?"
"How many things will go wrong before Member States rise above their national egotism and get there?"
"(SV) Mr President, Commissioner Frattini, I wish to begin by thanking Mr Pirker for a constructive report."
"Following the discussions in the committee, the feeling is that we can support it."
"Asylum policy is an area that EU citizens expect us to deal with together, because the problem concerned is a cross-border one."
"Here in plenary and in the committee we have often discussed the current situation in the Mediterranean, which we MEPs have still not succeeded in resolving."
"It is scandalous that people are still dying there every day."
"There are both immigrants and asylum seekers in the group I come from."
"Since the start of the war in Iraq, my own country of Sweden has welcomed more refugees - approximately 10 000 - than any other country in the whole of the EU, and we are not even one of the larger EU countries."
"As Mr Pirker said, we must share the burden."
"I therefore believe that we cannot just make declarations and pledges that we do not fulfil."
"Instead, we must, as is proposed in the report, not only speed up our procedures for handling cases and make a considerable investment in exchanging and gathering information but also have the courage to say that we believe in an open Europe in the future."
"Human trafficking must be brought to an end."
"There must be an end to the trafficking of women and children led into prostitution and the sex industry."
"It must no longer be possible to provide the EU with cheap labour whenever employers need it, only then to send the workers back home when the jobs concerned have been completed."
"These are difficult issues, but we have an obligation to solve the problems if we are serious about introducing a common asylum procedure in 2010."
"For me - coming as I do from Sweden, which has always been generous in welcoming refugees - it is still absolutely crucial for us to talk in terms of an inventory of third countries, but every refugee's case must still always be examined individually."
"Otherwise, many refugees will continue to be discriminated against because they belong to a minority or because of their gender, background or sexual orientation or because they are fleeing a war where they perhaps belonged to the group that is not going to win."
"I hope that this report means that we are now taking the next step and that all the EU countries and we MEPs will together assume responsibility not only for solving these urgent problems but also for finding long-term solutions."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the right to asylum is universal, and that is why we need a European response - which, to some degree, we have already given."
"The Commission proposals are very good, and I should like to place on the record officially here that we can be very proud of our Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, who is doing a very good job."
"The proposals our rapporteur, my colleague Mr Pirker, has presented are excellent."
"Anyone managing to achieve support across the group divide for such a difficult issue has clearly done an excellent job, and I should like to thank the rapporteur for this."
"Even though none of its representatives is present, I should like to thank the Council."
"This evening would not have been possible, and we could not have taken all these decisions, if we had not had an active German Council Presidency in recent months."
"Therefore, I should simply like to say 'thank you'."
"Judging by the lateness of the hour, the politicians working on home-affairs policy are the hard-working ones: we are still at work."
"Therefore, I should like to express my sincere thanks, and refrain from using up my full speaking time so that we can go home earlier."
"(PL) Mr President, it is very important, in terms of cooperation and improving the quality of decision-making process within the framework of the common asylum system, to create greater flexibility in the use of the European Refugee Fund."
"The rapporteur, whom I would like to thank for his excellent report, refers to this problem in a number of the points he raises."
"Last year, we finished work on the legal basis for the forthcoming version of the Refugee Fund for the years 2008-2013."
"At the time, we already supported the additional proposal put forward by the Commission during the course of this work."
"The Commission suggested that we should change the existing operating principles of the Fund and aim its activities more at areas such as harmonising practical cooperation between the Member States, providing aid in the event of pressure resulting from a particularly large influx of immigrants, as well as intra-Union migration and regional protection programmes in third countries."
"This meant increasing spending on Community action from 7% to 10%, making the procedures for providing financial aid to countries experiencing sudden mass influx of asylum seekers more flexible, and allocating specific amounts within the distribution chain."
"These sums vary from three to five thousand euros per person for intra-Union transfers and within the framework of regional protection programmes."
"Special financial incentives have been introduced to provide aid to those particularly affected, namely children, those in need of medical aid or women."
"Therefore, the Commission and Member States need to make effective use of the Fund."
"We are waiting for guidelines, action plans and specific results in relation to the use of the Refugee Fund, which will significantly improve the situation of refugees in Europe."
"I would like to once again thank the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."

"Consumer confidence in the digital environment (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Roithov√° on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on consumer confidence in the digital environment."
"rapporteur. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that, after a year's work, I and the shadow rapporteurs can now present to you the complete report on consumer confidence in the digital environment."
"With this report Parliament is sending out a strong political plea to the Commission and the Member States to update the conditions for online business and to take steps to enhance consumer confidence as regards the most recent trends in the digital environment."
"Businesses and consumers are waiting for unequivocal, simple, enforceable rules that will enhance online business culture in the European market."
"The report is merely the start of the whole process."
"I am aware that implementing it would involve a considerable amount of work for the Commission, which is already limited in terms of financial and human resources"
"Public hearings and studies have revealed some telling facts, to which we cannot turn a blind eye."
"Just 6% of consumers buy online from suppliers in other Member States."
"One third do not receive the goods or services they order on account of their nationality, their country of residence or the country in which their payment card was issued."
"Some modern electronic services providing digital content are only available to customers in the old EU-15."
"Users are bound by any number of digital contracts that they have simply clicked on and have not read."
"They are therefore unaware that these contracts may contain a number of unfair and misleading contractual arrangements."
"We have discovered that not even legal experts are capable of deciphering the exact content of digital contracts, for example, licensing arrangements with the end user."
"Small businesses are unaware of their obligations in e-commerce and have difficulty in making their way around 27 different legal systems."
"Consumers do not know their Internet rights, and indeed, there is no document summarising these rights."
"Users are not sure what they can and cannot do with the digital content they have purchased."
"They are afraid of resolving claims in another country and do not know about counterfeit medicines sold on the Internet."
"We therefore propose the following: a worldwide campaign to be launched by the Commission to highlight the dangers of counterfeit medicines; the creation of a Europe-wide early-warning system to combat fraudulent activities on the Internet; and an extension to the scope of contracts on which bans are to be imposed due to unfair contractual arrangements."
"The principle of the single market is less restriction and more opportunity."
"Paradoxically, however, it is as though this principle did not apply to the electronic environment, despite the cross-border opportunities."
"I would venture to say that 27 separate national markets are hampering the development of the information society in Europe, which lags behind that of the USA and Asia."
"If we are to demolish the artificial or natural obstacles to e-commerce we will have to overcome the fragmented rules of the Member States."
"This will be possible in the long term if the political will is there to achieve complete harmonisation."
"Such a dynamic sector, however, calls for a quicker and more flexible solution."
"This is why in the report I opted for coordinated work on voluntary standards, or rather super-standards, for example an optional standardised contract geared towards cross-border e-commerce."
"The content must be agreed upon by business and consumer organisations, in which the Commission will have a vital role to play in terms of coordination."
"Holders of the European trustmark for cross-border e-commerce must adhere to these standards."
"Consumer organisations welcome the implementation of the trustmark and are committed to revealing and disclosing any misuse, with the help of existing technical and legal resources."
"We also call for the formulation of a European Charter of Users' Rights in the information society."
"The European Parliament is one of the first parliaments in the world seeking to clarify consumer Internet rights."
"If the Charter is widely accessible and available in all official languages, consumers will begin to demand their rights and businesses will begin to uphold the Charter and not to risk having to spend money on resolving disputes."
"I feel that the report will act as an inspiration for improving standards in the digital environment."
"I should now like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their outstanding help: Mrs Herczog, Mrs R√ºhle, Mr Schmidt and Mrs J√§√§tteenm√§ki and the assistants, in particular Mr Jirsa for his invaluable expert advice."
"I also appreciate the support of the coordinators, the chairman and the secretariat of the committee and the services."
"I was delighted with the constructive communication from consumer organisations, businesses and individual members of the Commission staff."
"I should in particular like to commend Mrs Kuneva on her obliging and very open attitude."
"She has embarked on her new post in the Commission in an outstanding fashion."
"I believe that we will be able to overcome any difficulties that may arise when our proposals on increasing confidence in the European digital environment are put into practice."
"Mr President, I am really very pleased to be here today to discuss with you this very important topic of how we can improve consumer confidence in the digital environment."
"I would like to start my speech by thanking Mrs Roithov√° and all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent and very close cooperation - and this is not just a matter of courtesy, but a sincere recognition of very hard work."
"I am glad that the Commission and the European Parliament agree on a common line in approaching this very important and challenging issue."
"This is clearly an important and ambitious report, and I think we all broadly share the same objectives and analyses of the problems."
"The digital economy - and more specifically e-commerce - has great potential to improve consumer welfare by making a greater range of products available, boosting price competition and developing new markets."
"It is also central to completing the retail side of the internal market."
"At present, retail markets are still fragmented along national lines into mini-markets, as Mrs Roithov√° indicated."
"This makes no sense in the age of e-commerce and the internet."
"E-commerce is changing the face of retail, but only at national level."
"The internet is borderless but consumers, businesses and regulators are not."
"Fifty per cent of European consumers who have a computer at home have made an e-commerce purchase in the previous 12 months, but only 12% of those with a computer at home bought cross-border."
"This indicates the need for action to increase consumer confidence on the retail side of the internal market and the necessity to solve the fragmentation of the market to achieve finally a citizens' market."
"As you know, since the beginning of the year we have launched two major initiatives for consumers: the consumer policy strategy and the consultation on the review of existing consumer protection legislation."
"Our objective as a Commission is to help the EU rise to the challenges of growth and jobs and reconnecting with its citizens."
"This objective will be met if, by 2013, we can credibly demonstrate to all citizens that they can shop from anywhere in the EU - from corner shop to website - confident that they are equally and effectively protected."
"The need to improve consumer confidence in the digital economy runs through every aspect of this strategy."
"Mrs Roithov√°'s report shows that the obstacles - including regulatory obstacles - are numerous."
"My predecessors made progress in tackling some of them with the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the Regulation on Consumer Protection Cooperation, which established the European Consumer Centre (ECC) network. My priority now is to tackle the remaining obstacles, with the reform of existing consumer protection legislation related to consumer contracts."
"As you know, we have initiated a broad consultation on the future of consumer protection, and we have started to analyse reactions from the stakeholders."
"We are looking forward to Mrs Petre's report after the summer."
"Your views and your support will be an important reference for our follow-up work and for specific proposals."
"The Commission's follow-up to the review of the acquis is a basis on which build consumer trust."
"The development of standardised consumer contracts may be something to investigate further once this solid base is established."
"One of the aims of this exercise is to reduce the regulatory fragmentation of the internal market by targeted harmonisation of issues that cause particular problems for consumers and businesses."
"We will, inter alia, consider whether standards and standardisation can play a role in this process."
"Similarly for self-regulation."
"The Commission has done some important work to establish a best practice model for self- and co-regulation, and we will continue to do so in the future."
"I share your concerns about the interplay of different legislation governing online transactions or digital goods."
"There are many precise laws, and consumers and businesses may not be sufficiently aware of their rights and duties in the digital environment."
"I will examine how best to clarify these issues with my colleagues, Mrs Reding and Mr McCreevy."
"Thanks to your input, we will explore the idea of a practical guide which would cover information society services and help citizens to understand their rights better."
"I would also like to thank you for insisting on the importance of enforcement - I fully agree with you."
"Quality legislation is not enough if it is not backed up by effective enforcement."
"We have set up a network of national enforcers in the European Union and we will now gradually enlarge the network to third country partners in order to enhance its efficiency."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your commitment to helping European citizens to enjoy all the benefits of the internal market and the digital economy."
"I look forward to working with you to fulfil our common goals and to achieve a citizens' internal market."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to thank Mrs Roithov√° for such a wonderful report."
"Consumer confidence in the digital environment largely depends on our ability to provide consumers with protection and clarity within that environment."
"We must bear in mind that SMEs are also consumers, and the European Union must promote the use of these new technologies and encourage SMEs to participate in on-line markets."
"At the same time, we must promote consumer confidence on these platforms by ensuring that transactions are transparent and fair."
"Consumers must be aware of their obligations and rights in the digital world."
"For some products, such as MP3 players, DVD players and computer game consoles, the consumer is obliged to accept very strict conditions in the small print, and in some cases this verges on the illegal and violates the right to privacy."
"At the same time, the producers of these devices are expanding the use of digital rights management systems in order to prevent unauthorised copies."
"This creates fear, and that can undermine consumer confidence."
"In order to resolve the problem of interoperability, open standards are required that create a safer, more open and more trustworthy environment."
"Software patents are also a serious threat for software developers in SMEs, who cannot afford the legal costs."
"Fear in this environment is not compatible with confidence either amongst SMEs or amongst consumers."
"Digital platforms can only provide growth and development if they are based on open and interoperable standards."
"Standards can contribute to less fragmentation of markets and the use of open-source software can also make a considerable contribution to promoting on-line security."
"Improving the security and confidence of consumers depends upon certain key elements: legislation, mechanisms for strengthening and creating regulatory instruments such as codes of conduct and confidence marks."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome this report and to thank my colleague, Mrs Roithov√°, for her outstanding work, and the shadow rapporteurs, who are here as well."
"It has been a very good team effort."
"I also want to thank Mrs Kuneva for her very positive response."
"This report shows the value that a parliamentary committee can bring to a complex issue, particularly one that cuts across so many policy areas."
"The special message I want to put to the Commissioner is that I hope she will take this forward and become the champion of consumers in the e-world and in e-commerce, because, as she said, it is not just her services that have a share in this - it is also those of Mrs Reding and of Mr McCreevy, and, indeed, of Mr Frattini and of Mr Verheugen, in his role as champion of enterprise, in particular small enterprise."
"As far as Mr Frattini is concerned, I want to emphasise again the concern that many of us feel about the proposed reform of the Rome I Regulation in particular, which is in serious danger of undermining the provisions for small businesses to be active in the world of e-commerce."
"There are also important data protection provisions that consumers feel concerned about in terms of giving up their data and going online, which also come under his area."
"Therefore, I think it needs that coordinated approach."
"I also want to pick up on what Mr Hammerstein-Mintz said, that small enterprises are the ones we need to look at in particular."
"Large enterprises can build complex websites in different languages, based in different countries, but we want to allow small enterprises with an innovative and exciting product and service based in one EU country to be able to access that EU market freely and simply, to take real advantage of the powers that e-commerce offers them."
"We have to be very careful that we design the regime in such a way as to ensure that we do not discourage them from doing that, because we want not only consumers to go online but also businesses to put their products online, and to make the two work together, because that is what we have the opportunity to do in our dynamic e-commerce market as it moves forward from here."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (HU) I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work over the last eighteen months, during which she has demonstrated considerable openness and willingness to compromise."
"Not the least, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her openness as we have been working together in this area ever since she was elected to this position."
"The result of this work is a report whose ambitious political messages have not, contrary to what usually happens, been diluted by the numerous compromises made."
"If anything, they have been reinforced by them."
"This is exactly what we need; after all, it is how Europe's society and economy are gearing up for the digital age which is at stake."
"What is required here is for increasingly wider sections of European society to have access to information technologies."
"We must therefore emphasise, at any rate, as a footnote to this report the importance of e-inclusion, in other words, how important it is that the inhabitants of rural areas, those with disabilities, the older generations and those on the lowest incomes can be included in Europe's vibrant digital society."
"There is no question that the future belongs to the information society and knowledge-based economy."
"As we have already realised, we also have to accept that business, the goods and services market along with consumption itself are becoming knowledge-based and digital."
"However, consumers are still consumers even on the Internet, with rights and obligations."
"They need to know, above all, what exactly they are facing: brochures, free newspapers, products or even services."
"Equipped with this knowledge, they need to behave just as discerningly as if they were in a conventional library, bank, travel agents or store."
"They need to know what they can and cannot do."
"In return for their compliance, they can then enjoy the protection afforded to law-abiding consumers in the traditional market too."
"However, there are numerous aspects of the digital environment which are fuelling the lack of consumer confidence."
"The easy, rapid flow of information, the frequent lack of information for consumers and the quick and extensive spread of illegal behaviour are just some of the many reasons why anyone using the Internet can cross the boundary of law-abiding consumer activity, even acting in good faith."
"It is our political responsibility as politicians to devise those tools for Europe's digital environment, which will allow our Internet users to remain law-abiding consumers."
"On behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I can say that we will support the idea of a digital consumers charter in the longer term, which will provide every single consumer with clear, comprehensible information about what they should do in particular situations when using the Internet."
"Parliament is also aware that the dynamic development of the digital environment and the ongoing monitoring of consumer protection legislation will have a major impact on the content of any future charter."
"However, consumers also need information until then, which is why we are asking the Commission, even in current circumstances and based on current legislation, to provide some guidance as to what rights and protection e-consumers have."
"With this in mind, we are proposing that a network of consumer protection centres should be set up, based on the model of the SOLVIT system and Dolceta website."
"In other words, a European e-consumer information and support portal, which can help Europe's online consumers by offering advice, answers and solutions."
"Similarly, we support clarification of the legislation governing the use and protection of digital content."
"After all, the interoperability between the tools and content, on the one hand, and online management of rights, on the other, are two important principles."
"Finally, I would like to draw the attention of consumers and industry to the fact that this is something in their joint interest."
"Based on the model of traditional markets, the digital market too depends on law-abiding behaviour."
"There are currently a large number of committees involved in this area."
"We would therefore like the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection, which is linked to consumers and is the most responsive, to coordinate within the Commission the further efforts in this area."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (SV) Commissioner, Mr President, few could have imagined how the Internet would fundamentally change the world, both politically and economically."
"In spite of attempts by totalitarian regimes to limit the flow of information, the Internet is winning millions of new users."
"The way in which we use the Internet is also rapidly being transformed from the passive acquisition of information to an interactive approach."
"We buy and sell goods and services on it, and we chat and meet each other there."
"We have even acquired another life on the Internet, a virtual reality that, for some people, becomes more important than reality itself."
"There are statistics showing a 21% annual increase in Internet commerce, and even though cross-border shopping within the EU is not extensive, there is a lot to indicate that it will increase."
"More than half of European households own a computer - an increase of approximately 4% in one year."
"Forty-two per cent of all households are on the Internet, and here too the increase is one of 4% in one year."
"In my own country, a good 75% of the population have an Internet connection at home."
"It is nonetheless gratifying that the biggest increase is taking place in the new Member States."
"As many of my fellow Members have pointed out in this House, the number of frauds and other acts of deception is increasing concurrently with this development."
"In the light of this, Mrs Roithov√°'s report is an important step towards improving consumers' faith in the digital market."
"We know that, in parallel with Parliament's work, the Commission reviews the whole of the EU's consumer legislation."
"Paragraph 19 of the report proposes what it calls a European trust mark."
"That is obviously a good idea, but I can see certain problems."
"Firstly, the costs of keeping such a quality mark updated may prove to be considerable."
"The Commission has itself calculated the costs at EUR 1 million per country per year, which is a considerable sum of money."
"Secondly, there is a danger of the trust mark being stolen, misused or falsified."
"Another important point is the setting up of an EU charter of users' rights and obligations in the information society."
"This is not a new issue and is obviously an important area for the Commission, as the Commissioner also pointed out in connection with the ongoing review."
"I believe that the wordings proposed in the amendments better take account of the complexity and speed of the changes in the digital environment."
"It perhaps does not even need to be said, but the digital environment obviously needs an efficient framework in the form of rules and legislation."
"All actors who make use of the Internet need to be aware of their rights and obligations."
"We need informed and educated consumers."
"We need not only vendors and entrepreneurs with a sense of responsibility but also bold innovators who envisage new possibilities and new jobs."
"We of course also need laws that operate in a changing environment."
"The Commission has to balance all these interests with a view to an EU that is better able to become more competitive and to comply with the requirements of the Lisbon Strategy."
"Last of all, I should like to point out that we must never forget that it is freedom and free access to information that has formed the basis for the huge success of the Internet."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I should like to thank Mrs Roithov√° for tackling such an important issue."
"We should remember that work on developing the Internet began barely 40 years ago, yet we can now speak of an Internet revolution."
"This extraordinary instrument opens up tremendous opportunities in many areas."
"It also presents us with many challenges."
"It may be used for laudable purposes but may unfortunately also be exploited for criminal activities."
"The same is true of many other instruments used by men and women as they develop civilisations."
"The use of digital technology in electronic commerce for the purchase of goods and services ought to be seen in this context."
"As stated in the report, the legal and technical solutions applied should comply with a range of criteria."
"I would like to make a few remarks in this regard."
"Firstly, access to the Internet retail market should be far more widespread."
"This is linked to more generalised access to broadband Internet, a matter that has been repeatedly mentioned in the House."
"At present only around 25% of households in the European Union have a broadband connection, and therefore enjoy a high quality connection."
"Secondly, the purchaser needs to be certain that making purchases in this way is secure, both as regards the transaction itself and in terms of the relevant guarantee for the goods and services purchased, regardless of borders."
"Thirdly, the fact that the transactions are often anonymous cannot be allowed to facilitate criminal activity in any way."
"I have in mind piracy of films or musical works that are protected intellectual property."
"It is therefore essential to clarify the expression 'for personal use only'."
"Fourthly, other activities conducted through the Internet, such as the purchase of paedophile or pornographic material and the propagation of prostitution call for specific action by the police and prosecuting authorities."
"This is weighing on our consciences."
"Fifthly, payments over the Internet must be undertaken in a way that ensures full security for both parties."
"Sixthly, advertisements for goods or services that can be purchased electronically must allow potential purchasers to verify the information put out."
"My seventh remark is that the security of bank transactions undertaken by electronic means needs to be drastically improved."
"My eighth remark is to point out the importance of using digital means to provide certain medical services, diagnosis, and monitoring at a distance, notably in more remote areas."
"My penultimate point relates to the importance of distance education."
"Finally, we would do well to remember that the disabled in particular benefit greatly from the opportunity to use digital platforms as consumers."
"In conclusion, I should like to emphasise that high quality, honesty, transparency and flexibility must be essential features of the soundly based market in digital services open to competition that we wish to create."
"on behalf of Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my special thanks go to the rapporteur."
"Through her efforts we have an excellent own-initiative report to approve today."
"I hope and am confident that the Commission will take the report's recommendations and conclusions on board when reviewing European consumer rights."
"Our group supports your report, Mrs Roithov√†, and most of your compromise amendments."
"However, we do regret your decision to water down your proposal on the subject of the European trustmark."
"We will therefore not be voting for Amendment 4 and we will also be rejecting the Liberals' amendments."
"Intellectual property rights cannot be allowed to erode consumer rights."
"Consumers need clear information about their legal position when dealing with digital content and digital rights management."
"They are entitled to interoperable solutions."
"The report addresses important issues, calling for a European charter of user rights, the creation of a European early warning system and a database for combating Internet fraud, the inclusion of an external audit obligation for specific electronic services such as online banking, and standardising European provisions for cross-border electronic invoices."
"It also calls for a coordinated global approach for the digital environment, including an analysis of external factors such as privacy protection, citizens' access to information technologies and Internet security."
"The report also calls on the Commission to examine measures to deal with class actions in the case of cross-border digital environment disputes between businesses and consumers."
"We will be supporting the report and hope that it will be adopted in the plenary."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (SV) Mr President, trade and the exchange of goods, services and capital are the very bases of economic prosperity."
"Therefore, any technology that reduces the transaction costs for commerce is also fundamental to increased prosperity."
"With the world becoming more interconnected with the help of modern communications, safe and quick methods of payment and the removal of a good deal of protectionism, ever more countries around the world are now being drawn into global trade."
"In the long run, this is to the advantage of everyone on earth."
"It is therefore the EU's most important task to do everything it can to facilitate trade, firstly within the EU area and secondly between the EU area and the rest of the world."
"The EU is very successful at facilitating trade within the EU area and has made a considerable contribution to the EU countries' economic development."
"The big exception is agriculture, in which precisely no liberalisation has taken place and in which there are, then, major gains in prosperity still to be brought about."
"When it comes to trade between the EU area and the rest of the world, matters look nothing like so good."
"EU protectionism in respect of the surrounding world is extensive and embraces not only the agricultural sphere but also labour-intensive industrial products."
"The economic costs for the poor countries of the world and for EU consumers are very great."
"It is, therefore, above all in these areas that we wish to invest our political resources in order to design an EU policy for increased trade and increased prosperity."
"EU trade is at present a phenomenon of limited scope, but I dare say we all believe that it is a form of trade with a great future."
"Mrs Roithov√° is therefore discussing an area that will prove to be very important in the future, but the question is that of what the EU's role might be in this area at this stage in the development of e-commerce."
"Mrs Roithov√° and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy maintain that consumers do not dare to make cross-border purchases via the Internet within the EU because of poor legal certainty."
"Perhaps that is so, but do we know it for a fact?"
"Every new area and every new problem that is identified are presented in this House as evidence that the EU needs to intervene."
"The tiresome phrase 'this shows that the EU is needed' is repeated like a mantra."
"In any socio-economic analysis of such problems, however, the attempt is first made to establish what the market failures are, whether they can be corrected through political measures and, if so, what these measures might be, and at which political level they should be resorted to."
"In this House, the very point of departure is, more often than not, that the failures can and should be remedied at EU level."
"Every problem that is identified is taken as a pretext for advancing the EU's strategic positions at the expense of the Member States or of international bodies that are more global in scope."
"Constantly, man merkt die Absicht ['the intention is noted']."
"E-commerce is still in its infancy, and we do not know what is slowing down its growth, in which areas it will flourish and what forms it will then take."
"I would therefore advise the House to oppose all these proposals concerning EU-directed and EU-sponsored grant programmes and education and information campaigns and to wait before calling for charters of rights, dispute resolution mechanisms and harmonisation of contract law at EU level, and I advise it to say no to a logo for a European trustmark in this area."
"Those countries and regions that are creative and that are pioneers in various areas are those that offer entrepreneurs the freedom to feel their way towards solutions that politicians or officials cannot normally foresee."
"Where e-commerce is concerned, we shall find that there are very strong incentives for companies to create security for consumers."
"Such security will therefore be brought about by the financial market with the help of new insurance services and through the development of trademarks by producers themselves."
"- (SK) Allow me to thank Mrs Roithov√° for this report."
"It is responding to a dynamically developing digital environment."
"This is an area of everyday life for all of us, whether we are consumers or business people."
"New technologies offer huge opportunities to make full use of the internal market."
"Statistics, however, show that only 6% of European consumers participate in on-line transactions, and 33% experience problems, because their country of residence is different to that of the sellers of the goods."
"According to the Eurobarometer survey, 48% of merchants in the European Union are ready to sell across borders, but only 29% of companies are actually involved in cross-border transactions with at least one other country of the European Union."
"And yet 57% retailers in European Union sell via the Internet."
"The largest barriers to cross-border transactions include the uncertainty of transactions, different accounting rules, difficulties in the resolution of complaints and disputes, differences in national legislation on consumer protection, problems in provision of after-sales services, extra costs arising due to cross-border delivery, and the cost of translations."
"The use of the on-line environment is more complicated than the off-line environment due to its many barriers."
"Because of this, I consider important the proposal to elaborate a strategy to build consumer confidence."
"It should be an attempt to respond and to implement steps for making Internet transactions more attractive, thus bringing an end to the fragmentation of the internal market in the digital environment."
"This should lead to improvements in access to goods and services offered on-line in other Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Roithov√°, many thanks for your excellent report."
"My thanks also go to the shadow rapporteur Mrs Herczog, who was responsible for working on the report within my group."
"This is a subject of particular importance to our citizens."
"It was very good to hear that Commissioner Kuneva will be taking action in this area."
"That is essential, and we can only support her efforts."
"We will be behind the Commissioner one hundred per cent."
"Our citizens have a whole range of problems in the digital environment."
"Goods do not arrive, or they arrive late."
"They may want to order a product in another country, but find themselves unable to do so because the company says that they are resident in the wrong country."
"Or they place an order and suddenly find themselves landed with a subscription."
"These are the problems that our citizens encounter. Of course, within the European Union there is already some very positive regulation within this area, but it is very disjointed."
"It is vital that we create positive legislation for this area that meets the expectations of our citizens and, more importantly, of consumers."
"We want the citizens to enjoy the benefits of the single market in this arena."
"However, they can only benefit if we provide them with legal certainty, if they understand the basis on which they can do business, if they know that when they have a problem with a company they will be able to seek redress - and not have to wait 12 or 15 years for a result."
"They will also benefit from a more open market if they are able to compare prices and access more information."
"As you can see, there is still a lot to do in this area."
"The citizens are expecting not only that we regulate the internal market, not only that we establish constructive and simpler rules for businesses, thereby ensuring that companies are free to move within the European Union."
"Our citizens also expect a Europe that works for them, in which policies are not just designed to encourage the economy, with the citizens merely expected to contribute to that economy."
"Instead, consumer protection should also determine policy, particularly in the digital arena."
"It must be clear that we are making policy for consumers, and that the economy serves the consumers."
"If this happens, Commissioner Kuneva - and I know this is your intention - then we will achieve our objective, namely a Europe for the citizens; a Europe in which they are free to make online purchases in another country without problems or obstacles, and in which they have rights, including the possibility of redress."
"You will certainly have the full backing of my group, Commissioner, and we will be very happy to work with you to achieve your aims."
"(PL) Mr President, the role of the on-line transactions market in the provision of products, services or information on these is now invaluable."
"Mrs Roithov√° rightly pointed out in her report, however, that the development and increased importance of that market is affected by its fragmentation across the various Member States of the European Union."
"I agree that the aforementioned lack of harmonisation of provisions across the territory of the European Union and the lack of consumer confidence in transactions on the digital market may endanger the European Union's competitiveness on the world market especially as Europe is now lagging behind the United States and certain Asian countries."
"Creating a European information system is certainly a good idea although it will require time and tremendous financial investment."
"It does appear, however, that such a proposal may increase the security of on-line transactions between entities in different countries."
"This is because it is precisely the diversity of provisions across Member States and the lack of access to them that enterprises cite as the main cause of the uncertainty about entering into transactions of this kind."
"I believe that the situation in the new Member States where there is a shortage of financial resources for information campaigns on access to electronic services and their quality is also an urgent matter."
"The individual citizens of these countries often lack access to services of this nature, particularly in rural areas."
"The report rightly refers to discrimination against consumers in this group of countries regarding e-commerce."
"In my view, the Commission ought to deal with this situation as a matter of urgency, because all Union consumers are entitled to equal treatment."
"Welcome"
"Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea is present in the official gallery."
"I warmly welcome the Korean delegation, which is here to take part in the tenth European Parliament-Korea Interparliamentary Meeting."
"Mr Lee Sang-Deuk is leading the Korean delegation, which is composed of six members of the National Assembly."
"Our dialogue has developed greater depth and regularity in recent years."
"It has now become entirely political, covering a vast range of subjects from regional and international security to our citizens' everyday concerns, alongside the increasingly active role of the European Union and South Korea in the international community."
"We are delighted to have these fruitful, stable and ever-deepening cooperative relations with the Republic of Korea."

"- Report: Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou"
"- Before the vote on paragraph 38"
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to table an amendment that has been agreed with our rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou. This amendment is intended to replace the current Amendment 38 with the following text:"
"'Welcomes the Council decision of 18 June asking the EU to resume normal relations with the Palestinian Authority immediately and to this end to develop the conditions for urgent, practical and financial assistance, including direct financial support to the new government, as well as to ensure the provision of emergency and humanitarian assistance to the population of Gaza;'"
"rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I should like first of all to thank all my honourable friends from the various political groups who cooperated with me on this report, which is so important for our Euro-Mediterranean partnership and which also contains important and sensitive points which have to do with the funding of the Palestinian Authority."
"In the amendment referred to by Mr Casaca which, as he knows, we made together, there is a parenthesis at the end '(via, especially, the TIM)', which is part of the oral amendment."
"I have no other amendments to table other than to mention that paragraph 38 referring to the Mecca agreement and to a national unity government is no longer topical and has been deleted and replaced by the paragraph which Mr Casaca has just read out, with the parenthesis '(via, especially, the TIM)' at the end."
"That is all, other than to thank you for your cooperation and support."
"To recap for everybody's benefit, Mr Casaca has tabled an oral amendment to paragraph 38, which in its original version and with the rapporteur's addition already has the words 'via, especially, the TIM' added at the end of the text that you will find attached to your voting list."
"Are there any objections to the oral amendment in its entirety?"
"There are no objections."
"Quite exceptionally, the rapporteur is asking for the floor again."
"Recital N, which has to do with this matter."
"The second oral amendment on suppression of recital N was tabled at the same time. It will require a separate vote, but the two amendments are connected."

"(IT) Mr President, I should like to point out that there is a mistake in the Italian translation, which for us is substantive and not trivial. Where the English version has 'calls upon regional authorities to establish special administrative commissions', it says, 'invita le autorit√† regionali a istituire tribunali amministrativi speciali'."
"That is a situation that we had at the time of fascism, which must not be brought back again."
"I therefore suggest we put 'commissioni', in line with the English and French texts."
"In addition, I should like to suggest that the 'powers of arbitration' associated with the commissions be reviewed and replaced with 'powers of decision'."

"Special thanks are due to Mr Sakalas, the rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, who was involved in the difficult procedure of strengthened cooperation between two of our Parliamentary committees."
"I am also bound to call on the House to support this report, for three reasons."
"Firstly, because the report advocates better coordination between our foreign policy and our internal policy, to ensure that our foreign policy achieves the priorities of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"Secondly, because we advocate the specific European method which balances between action to ensure the security of our citizens and action to protect their civic freedoms."
"Thirdly, because we are calling for what remains of the third pillar, notably police and court cooperation on criminal matters, to become a Community issue."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 3, first part"
"Mr President, in order to avoid confusion, I should just like to clarify our request for a split vote and an oral amendment to Amendment 3."
"The oral amendment concerns the part of the text that the amendment by the PPE-DE Group seeks to delete."
"Therefore, if you wish to retain the text, including the oral amendment, you should vote against the first part of Amendment 3."
"Mr President, we propose to insert the words 'by the Council and the Commission', so that the text will read: 'to include a human rights compliance report by the Council and the Commission in all external policy initiatives or documents in the AFSJ...'."
"I must point out to you that, if this House supports Amendment 3, the oral amendment will fall."
"However, if Amendment 3 by the PPE-DE Group is rejected, then the oral amendment will be included."

"This Politkovskaya lecture should be held by a journalist who distinguishes her or himself through an outstanding effort to defend democracy and respect for all human beings."
"With this lecture we would honour all journalists for their essential role in keeping societies open."
"This proposal was co-signed by Bart Staes, Jean-Marie Cavada, Ewa Klamt and Luisa Morgantini."
"Rule 28 states that the Presidency has to answer within 30 days."
"I received only a vague reply and nothing has happened in the mean time."
"We would like to organise this event for October this year, one year after the assassination of our valued Anna Politkovskaya."
"We need the cooperation of the Presidency and we hope we can count on it."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Berman."
"I believe the aim of the brief reply was precisely to prevent the time period from lapsing. Clearly, however, I shall refer this to the Bureau and the President and check with them what will be done to follow up your request."

"Cuba"
"The next item is the debate on four motions for resolutions on Cuba."
"author. - Madam President, the Council has recently recognised that no tangible results have been achieved on human rights in Cuba, despite the goodwill shown by the Council in 2005."
"The majority of us, if not all of us, are in agreement that it is necessary for Cuba to launch a process of political transition to multi-party democracy."
"This is not the Eurocentric position our opponents like to use against us but is about the universality and indivisibility of human rights, including civil, political and economic rights, in which we believe."
"Today we again urge the Council and Commission to continue to take whatever action is necessary to demand the release of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience."
"It is important to give our unconditional support and full encouragement to the launching of a peaceful process of transition to a multi-party democracy in Cuba."
"We have examples to follow."
"Twenty years ago the present EU Member States from Eastern and Central Europe were in many ways - including as regards their human rights situation - in a similar situation to that which Cuba is in now."
"I hope that we will soon witness major changes in Cuba and I look forward to that very special day."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, Cuba has been ruled by a dictator for almost half a century and human rights are constantly being violated there."
"It is practically the last remaining bastion of Communism in the world."
"North Korea is another such bastion, whilst the Chinese regime is somewhat different but often equally cruel."
"After the collapse of Communism in 1989 we expected those Communist countries to review their situation and that Communism would collapse there too."
"Unfortunately, that did not happen, notably in Cuba."
"It is true that the intensity of persecution in Cuba varied."
"There were times when it was particularly cruel and other periods when a degree of liberalisation was allowed and when concessions seemed to be made to the opposition."
"A particularly worrying contemporary development is that Cuba has succeeded in gaining a number of allies. The latter include left-wing governments in Europe."
"The support often provided by governments of Member States of the European Union to the Cuban regime, albeit indirectly, is particularly worrying."
"The current more tolerant attitude to such evil regimes adopted also by the UN is unacceptable."
"For instance, it is being suggested that human rights are not being violated in Belarus or in Cuba."
"I call on the House to adopt an unequivocal approach condemning the Cuban governments, and to follow this up with specific actions aimed at toppling Fidel Castro's cruel Communist regime."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by expressing my concern at the fact that this item on relations between the European Union and the Cuban Government has replaced, in terms of urgency, another issue that I considered to be far more important and far more urgent: the situation of the refugee population in Iraq."
"This is particularly worrying given that, in reality, the fundamental reason for this modification does not so much relate to issues involving that Caribbean Island, but rather to the customary tendency of certain Members from the People's Party to use the European Parliament to express their personal opposition to the Spanish Government."
"It is not for me to defend the position of the Spanish Government;"
"I am not a member of that government or of its party, but it does concern me that such an important opportunity as the Thursday afternoon sitting, which is dedicated to situations of violations of human rights in the world, should be called into question by this kind of initiative that goes against the very spirit of these debates."
"Furthermore, I would also like to point out that on Monday the Council approved its conclusions on relations with the Cuban Government, in which it once again stated its intention to maintain the dialogue with civil society and offered to restore the dialogue with the Cuban Government on the basis of mutual, reciprocal and non-discriminatory interest."
"Cuba must make a lot of progress on issues such as freedoms, rights, political rights in particular, and democratic openness, but I would insist that this is nothing new, it is not urgent."
"What is more, I believe that the position adopted by the Council on Monday sets the parameters for moving in that direction, particularly insofar as it distances itself from the United States' strategy based on a sterile confrontation and an embargo that is both ineffective and irresponsible, amongst other things because it actually hinders certain reforms within the island which would allow for a more ordered transition."
"Furthermore, as we stated in our resolution, that of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, cooperation must be an instrument for development, with a view to achieving the Millennium Development Objectives, and not a tool for imposing conditions with a view to achieving political ends."
"author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for once I do not agree with Mr Romeva i Rueda, because I believe that there is an urgent issue concerning Cuba, and one that actually concerns us as well as the European Union."
"Otherwise, it would be pointless to treat questions of countries that have been dictatorships and not democratic for years and years, or even decades, as urgent topics."
"In this case the urgency concerns us and our policy."
"A decision has been taken in the Council to invite a Cuban delegation."
"What can or what should initiating this dialogue mean?"
"In our view, it should mean that any change, reform or strengthening of relations with Cuba must depend on an equally tangible plan to reform the situation of human rights and democracy on the island."
"It is true that our strategy as the European Union is not to impose an embargo - and I intend to clarify and emphasise that again in an oral amendment - but it is also true that it must not and cannot be a strategy of unconditional and unilateral openness, because that too would prove to be a disastrous strategy, as it has proved to be in the past."
"We must, for instance, give practical support to those dissidents who have come together behind the 'Unity for Liberty' declaration - and this is much more urgent for the European Union than for Cuba."
"One of the problems of Cuba's dissidents and opposition has always been their internal divisions, but this time there is a joint declaration and document that talks about non-violence and democracy."
"It is our job to support these dissidents."
"This has to be taken into account when the discussions and dialogue are initiated, otherwise they will be going against this Union's policies and principles on human rights and democracy."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Madam President, I would like to start by saying to the Spanish rapporteur that I do not need a visit from Mr Moratino to get het up about what the Spanish Government is doing."
"Within the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we have enough colleagues from Central and Eastern Europe who work with the people in Cuba out of a sense of solidarity, and the issue is not limited to the Spaniards within the PPE-DE."
"I do want to assure you of that."
"The future for the people of Cuba should not be limited to two alternatives: either continuing with Communism or being taken over by the government in Miami."
"In the light of the Common Position of 1996 we have a political responsibility to support the democratic and peaceful forces as they work for change."
"That is why the European Parliament has awarded Sakharov prizes to the Ladies in White and to Oswaldo Pay√°."
"I would have liked to have seen a clear statement in the Council Decision that the Common Position of 1996 still stands, that the Council Decision approved on Monday does not alter that Position, that the 2003 sanctions have merely been suspended, and that we will be reviewing the position again next June (the 17th evaluation of the Common Position)."
"The Council should have made that clear."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Madam President, I would like to reinforce what Mr Romeva just said."
"The sole motivation for raising this subject is a Spanish domestic political issue that has nothing to do with the situation in the country under discussion."
"The People's Party has preferred not to debate a truly urgent issue, which is that of Iraq."
"There are currently two million Iraqi refugees within Iraq and a further two million who have been obliged to leave the country."
"At the moment, rather then taking in these poor people who are fleeing the bombings and killings in Iraq, countries are returning them to their country of origin."
"In other words, on the one hand, we are bombing the Iraqi population, and on the other we are not allowing them to leave and sending them back to that hell."
"This is a case of total inhumanity and it is not appropriate at this point for us to forget the situation of these people."
"We therefore believe that this urgency is entirely inappropriate and that we have squandered an opportunity to deal with a case of genuine humanitarian urgency at a time when measures needed to be adopted."
"There has very recently been a conference on Iraq in which this issue has been debated, a series of resolutions have been approved, and this Parliament is incapable of following them up because it prefers to deal with domestic political issues rather than the genuine problems that are currently of concern to humanity."
"Colleagues, I would remind you all that the subject matter of this debate is Cuba, and if anybody else tries to discuss something else, I will be very strict."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I shall definitely speak about Cuba!"
"This House has dealt with the situation in Cuba on several occasions."
"Unfortunately, all our calls for full respect of fundamental freedoms of Cuban citizens have fallen on deaf ears."
"The utterly anachronistic Castro regime is now so much out of date and out of touch with reality and modern democratic norms that it is highly unlikely, in my view, that any significant change for the better will occur while Castro is still in power."
"However, he is now elderly, sick and physically incapable of running the country, so we must start thinking about what to do when he has finally gone from the power stage of Cuba."
"In the mean time, we once again call for democratic reforms and, in particular, we call for the Cuban authorities to allow the two Cuban winners of the EP's Sakharov Prize to travel to Europe."
"Let us hope that some remnants of common sense may have survived in the minds of those ruling Cuba and that we shall soon welcome these Sakharov Prize winners to Parliament."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, for a few seconds the display for the sitting said 'Iraqi refugees'."
"The slip-up has evidently also affected the technology in this Chamber."
"Indeed, that is the subject that we ought to have been debating: the 4 million Iraqis who are trying to come to Europe but to whom we are not showing any hospitality."
"Instead, we are debating Cuba, because an international campaign is under way that led this Parliament to vote against Venezuela in the last part-session and will probably lead it to vote against Cuba today."
"We now expect that someone from the Spanish People's Party will put forward a resolution against Ecuador and Bolivia."
"That is what we are expecting."
"The real purpose, in fact, is to combat the economic policy that a large part of Latin America is implementing at the moment, in contrast to neoliberalism and the imperialistic philosophy of permanent war."
"That is an objective fact in our debate."
"Instead, I believe that we should call strongly for a review of the European Union's common position and for a review of the embargo."
"What the Council did last Monday in inviting a delegation from the Cuban authorities to Brussels was a very significant step that we ought to welcome, so as to initiate a positive dialogue and to give due merit to the progress made by Cuba."
"I believe, however, that the content of this resolution, right from its first clause, explicitly states the views of one side of this Parliament."
"In other words, it is calling for a change to the social, economic and political system of an island and sovereign state."
"I regard that as unacceptable."
"Madam President, Castro's Cuba is the last polity in the western hemisphere in which there is no pretence of democracy: opposition movements are banned; dissidents are imprisoned; citizens are denied the right to travel abroad."
"There are few sights so degrading as that of Western leftists arguing that all this is somehow justified because Cuba is good at producing doctors and ballerinas."
"Two factors have maintained the Castroist dynasty in power: first, the misconceived American blockade, which has allowed him to sustain the siege mentality necessary to dictatorship, and second, the indulgence of those in Europe - and here I must especially mention the Zapatero Government, which indulges the Cuban Communists by according full diplomatic courtesies."
"The way to bring freedom to Cuba would be through economic engagement but political isolation."
"Instead, we are doing the opposite with calamitous consequences for that unhappy country."
"'Sola mors tyrannicida est' wrote my countryman, Thomas More - death is the only way to get rid of tyrants."
"That it should have proved so in the case of Castro says nothing good about the rest of us."
"(PT) What ought to have been on Parliament's agenda was an expression from the EU of a genuine desire for dialogue on the basis of respect for Cuba."
"In our view, the establishment of open dialogue covering all issues of mutual interest naturally entails bringing down the barriers that have been created to make that dialogue difficult or impossible."
"This means calling for a definitive end to the sanctions imposed by the EU in 2003, which are temporarily suspended, and the permanent scrapping of the EU's common position on Cuba."
"These measures would pave the way for the normalisation of relations between the EU and Cuba."
"This, however, is not an option for those who pushed this debate onto Parliament's agenda and who have put their names to the motion for a resolution put to today's vote."
"Its objective is to encourage Cuba's isolation, in line with the unacceptable embargo imposed on Cuba by the US Administration."
"It is also aimed at the blatant, unreserved promotion of intervention in Cuba's internal affairs and at exerting pressure from outside in order to impose decisions that only the Cuban people have the sovereign right to take."
"Reality demonstrates that the best response to such plans is the country's enormous prestige and importance, and millions of millions of human beings showing active solidarity with Cuba and its people."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I was in Cuba not long ago and the country has not made any progress in upholding human rights; quite the opposite, in fact - things have got worse."
"I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to protest more strongly against flagrant human rights violations in Cuba; to support organisations that campaign for the very survival of political opponents and their families, or that help NGOs in Cuba to communicate with one another and express their opinions on how to resolve public issues; and to make the Internet available for Cubans in our embassies, because people do not have access to information in Cuba."
"The Council must campaign for the release of political prisoners who are physically maltreated and do not receive the medicines they need."
"Normal Cubans, too, live in destitution and suffer illness."
"There is a lack of doctors and modern techniques."
"Health was once Castro's pride and joy, yet today normal medicines are only for rich Communist leaders or foreign tourists."
"Cubans want change and they want freedom."
"We must not let the Council open dialogue with the Cuban regime without setting out clear conditions on the release of prisoners and on freedom of expression."
"Madam President, we have good reason to follow closely the recent developments in Cuba, because after 47 years of ruling Cuba Fidel Castro transferred power to his brother, Ra√∫l, who has been running the island in a relatively calm and organised fashion."
"It is too early to say whether Fidel will fully recuperate from his illness, but nearly all observers agree that he will never be able to assume day-to-day management again."
"Cuba, for the first time since the revolution of 1959, has to face the prospect of a country no longer fully run by Fidel Castro."
"This is definitely a new situation, which we must take into account."
"The question is: how can, and how should, the European Union react to this new development?"
"The Council of the European Union gave its first answer three days ago."
"In its conclusions on Cuba of 18 June, the EU renewed its offer of an open and comprehensive dialogue with the Cuban authorities and invited a Cuban delegation to Brussels to sound out the feasibility of such an exercise."
"This open-door approach is consistent with the EU's overall policy of constructive engagement towards Cuba."
"Since 1996, when the European Union adopted its position on Cuba, experience has proved that only a policy of engagement and cooperation, not one of sanctions, has the potential to promote peaceful change in Cuba towards democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law, sustainable economic recovery and improvement in the living conditions of the Cuban people, as stipulated in the EU's common position of 1996."
"Only the establishment of an open, comprehensive and result-orientated dialogue with the Cuban authorities will enable us to make the best use of the variety of instruments the EU and its Member States have at their disposal to further cooperation in the fields of political relations, human rights, investment and trade, development work, scientific research, educational exchanges and culture."
"The European Union is a profoundly value-based entity that makes respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms a key policy priority in its external actions."
"It is deeply convinced that this commitment towards open dialogue must also involve wider Cuban civil society."
"Extending a hand to the Cuban Government to enter into a long-term partnership with the European Union only makes sense if, at the same time, the European Union does all it can to maintain and step up its dialogue with those involved in Cuban civil society, including human rights defenders and peaceful political activists."
"As long as Cuba denies its citizens internationally-recognised basic civil political and economic rights, the European Union will not stop lobbying for democracy and respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms."
"It should not stop expressing its full solidarity with and support to those peacefully committed to making these universal values a reality in Cuba."
"This is the true meaning of the 'two-track approach': saying 'yes' to extending a hand to the Cuban authorities for dialogue and cooperation while explicitly expressing critical remarks and concerns, and 'yes' to defending the right of Cuban citizens to decide freely about their future."
"It is the Commission's firm conviction that the Council conclusions of 18 June are a welcome and necessary first step in this direction."
"That concludes the debate on Cuba."
"The vote will take place shortly."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (PL) Madam President, the proposal that the European Union should depart from the policy of freezing diplomatic contacts with Cuba is totally unacceptable."
"We can agree to reopening a full and open political dialogue on all areas of common interest with the Cuban authorities with a view to improving relations between the EU and Cuba, but only on certain conditions."
"To do so unconditionally would be to send quite the wrong signal to the Cuban regime."
"It would imply that we condone the unacceptable behaviour of the authorities in that country."
"By its very nature, dialogue is a two-sided process, not a one-sided one."
"The Cuban authorities' agreement to include in the discussion issues related to the state of human rights in Cuba must be a sine qua non to reopening a full dialogue."
"It is also difficult to conceive of an honest dialogue with Cuba as long as the Sakharov prize winners are not allowed to travel to Europe."
"The current Spanish Government's approach is very ambiguous in this regard."
"One would expect the Spanish Socialists to demonstrate greater solidarity with European policy towards Cuba."
"It is our duty to demonstrate our consistent opposition to the flagrant violations of human rights by Castro's regime."
"For dialogue between Cuba and the European Union to lead to positive changes it must be a genuine dialogue, not a propaganda stunt."
"In the past, the Cuban side has taken advantage of the Union's openness to launch a propaganda offensive."
"2."
"Human rights in Ethiopia"
"The next item is the debate on human rights in Ethiopia."
"I have received six motions for a resolution."
"author. - (SV) Ethiopia is in 170th place out of a total of 177 countries where human development is concerned."
"Ethiopia has more important things to do than to oppress opposition figures and put them in prison and to treat people as a collective instead of prosecuting them for specific crimes."
"As far back as in October 2005, we criticised the way in which Ethiopia treats its opposition, but in 2006 and during this year the situation has deteriorated."
"I believe that we have to make more stringent demands of Ethiopia."
"After all, the African Union's headquarters are in Ethiopia."
"Ethiopia must set a good example, and we cannot accept that the country that is host to our cooperation partner, the African Union, should go in for extensive human rights violations throughout its judicial system."
"Before we can get to grips with all the issues to do with poverty and poverty-related problems, we must be able to help Ethiopia combat these human rights violations."
"Without a lively opposition, we cannot solve the problems."
"author. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw the Commissioner's attention to a contradiction to which we risk falling victim."
"In 2005, we, the European Union, encouraged everyone in Ethiopia, including the representatives of the Oromo people, to take part in the elections in order to help introduce a democratic system."
"We also sent one of the largest delegations of observers to the country."
"Today, our fellow parliamentarians who were elected to the Ethiopian federal parliament and the parliament of Oromia and who have had the courage to come out into the open are being forced to leave their country."
"They have appealed to us, because some of their number have been killed for political reasons, while others are fleeing to neighbouring Somalia together with thousands of Oromo refugees and are being pursued by Ethiopian troops."
"At this point it is my belief that, as we helped to encourage and initiate this process, we cannot now abandon these people."
"We must accept our responsibility by immediately adopting a support strategy within the framework of the special measures provided for by the new democracy and human rights instrument."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and freedom are the foundations on which the structures of a just state must be built."
"The Commission and the Council should develop a cohesive strategy of actions to support the democratic process in Ethiopia and introduce mechanisms to counter the deterioration of the human rights situation in that region."
"In addition to the arrest and imprisonment of people for their views, I find the information on the suffering and exploitation of children particularly alarming."
"We have to condemn the harming of defenceless and innocent children."
"I believe this is the most serious crime possible and it must be unequivocally condemned."
"Only by acting in unison and with the cooperation of the countries bordering on Ethiopia, and drawing on stronger support from the whole international community can we improve the worrying situation in Ethiopia and return it to normality so that individuals are treated as entities and not as instruments."
"author. - Madam President, I headed the EU election observation mission in Ethiopia in 2005."
"At that time, Opposition leaders warned the EU that the elections would be another scam by Prime Minister Meles Zenawi to fool the international community and that they all would end up in jail or killed."
"We, the EU, persuaded them not to boycott the elections, promising to watch and ensure accountability."
"The Ethiopians believed us and voted massively and in an orderly manner."
"However, when people protested peacefully against electoral fraud, government forces resorted to brutal repression."
"In June and November, hundreds were killed in massacres and thousands were wounded and imprisoned, including the leaders who had warned the EU."
"They are among the 38 political prisoners found guilty on 11 June of this year in a farcical trial in which they were not able to present their defences."
"Sentences are due next July, possibly carrying the death penalty, against some of the most representative, articulate and courageous leaders of Ethiopia - elected Members of Parliament, human rights defenders, journalists, activists for development, teachers and other prisoners of conscience."
"Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, aged 77, the respected founder of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, is one of them."
"The EU is the main donor of aid in Ethiopia."
"I have seen the difference it makes there."
"It can do it again if the Commission, Council and Member States stop turning a blind eye."
"They must act immediately, holding the Government of Ethiopia accountable to human rights commitments under the Cotonou Agreement, holding Prime Minister Meles Zenawi personally responsible and pressing for the release of the prisoners without delay and unconditionally."
"They must follow the recommendations made by this Parliament in several resolutions, including the one we will approve today, not to further let down the Ethiopian people, not to further discredit Europe's commitment towards development in Africa and not to further betray our basic values of democracy and human rights."
"author. - (DE) Madam President, back in the early Middle Ages, Ethiopia played a leading role in dialogue between the Christian and Muslim world."
"It is the oldest independent state in Africa, an ancient civilisation which fought against fascism and colonialism, and as has already been mentioned, is also the country where the African Union currently has its headquarters."
"Given all these factors, it is with horror that we contemplate what Communism has done in the country."
"The free elections two years ago in Ethiopia were a time of hope."
"Unfortunately, that hope was immediately dashed, as demonstrators were beaten and scores were arrested."
"As my fellow Member Mrs Gomes quite rightly points out, it was the best and leading figures in the country from all parties and all walks of life who were the victims of the first wave of arrests, and who have also been affected by the most recent round of arrests, sentences and trials this year."
"We now need to take a stronger line."
"I call on the Council and Commission to provide the long-awaited inspection reports from those observers who attended these unjust mock trials, which were merely for show."
"In line with the Resolution, I call for an independent fact-finding commission, since the members of Ethiopian Parliament's own investigation board have either been jailed or forced into exile for seeking to expose the truth about these events."
"The situation is unacceptable and we now need an independent investigation."
"We urgently need to use our strong position in the country to stand up for the rule of law and human rights."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PL) Madam President, if more death penalties are handed down to opposition activists in Ethiopia in the near future, it will mean disaster not only for the people of Ethiopia but also for our own democracy."
"I have followed the development of the situation in Ethiopia, and have concluded that the Ethiopian authorities consider that the elections held in 2005 represent the achievement of an aim, rather than the start of the process towards achieving that aim."
"I wonder whether this is not due to the fact that despite the verified and documented abuses by the ruling party, the elections concerned have been recognised as the most democratic elections ever to have been held in the whole of Ethiopia's three thousand year history."
"The resolution we are to vote on today in the European Parliament contains many references to cases that must be unequivocally condemned."
"We note that the situation regarding respect for human rights in Ethiopia remains very grave."
"The process of democratisation has ground to a complete halt in that country."
"There can be no justification for the arrest of leading members of the opposition, who are in danger of receiving death sentences after trials that failed to meet internationally recognised standards for free and fair trials."
"We simply cannot condone the infringement of fundamental rights, arguing that it is impossible to expect full compliance with the standards of European democracy in Africa."
"Ethiopia is a country with a long and distinguished history."
"I believe its people deserve much more, and that it is incumbent on us to assist them."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, on the 11 June, 38 leading opposition figures were found guilty of charges ranging from crimes against the constitution to high treason, all linked to the mass protests following the controversial elections two years ago, in which nearly 200 people were killed."
"Before the members of the Ethiopian Parliament's investigation board were arrested or forced into exile, the board concluded that the security forces used unreasonable force and that marksmen targeted leading opposition politicians."
"The sentences are expected in the coming months and there is a danger that most of the defendants will be condemned to death."
"We call on the Ethiopian Government to release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally."
"The Ethiopian courts urgently need to review the rulings and the government must work to ensure an independent justice system and a free press."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, Ethiopia, a country with a population of 75 million, is one of Africa's poorest states and almost two-thirds of its citizens are illiterate."
"It has had a traumatic history, passing from colonialism to royal oligarchy to Marxist dictatorship and, recently, to a type of apparent parliamentary democracy, but with serious democratic deficits."
"We do not expect Ethiopian democratic norms to be of a European standard."
"That would be unrealistic on our part, bearing in mind the country's huge problems, but we expect the Ethiopian Government to show respect for at least basic human rights."
"We are currently very concerned about the psychologically paranoid mentality of the regime in Addis Ababa, which is behind a large-scale crackdown on Opposition leaders, journalists and human rights activists."
"We are particularly worried about the government-controlled corrupt judicial and police systems which operate in the country, and call on the Ethiopian authorities to proceed immediately to drastic changes and corrective measures in order to remedy the currently abysmal situation and to show the outside world that they genuinely care about justice and democracy, instead of simply claiming to do so."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that we will agree with Mr Cappato this time."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to express my support and acknowledgement of the work that some of our fellow Members have been doing for a long time with regard to Ethiopia and in particular that of our friend and colleague Ana Gomes, not just because of the mission that took place, but because over all these years she has been condemning the situation in Ethiopia and taking it extremely seriously."
"I believe that support for this resolution that we are going to approve today may be crucial in terms of changing the situation in Ethiopia."
"In my view, it was significant to see both the chairman and the vice-chairman of the committee of inquiry on the events that took place two years ago, having to flee the country, forced out under pressure from the Meles Government in view of the results of their inquiry."
"This is something about which we cannot remain silent, particularly in view of the fact that it was the European Union that promoted and legitimised the elections in that country two years ago."
"The situation is therefore clearly a worry."
"It is serious and requires an immediate response."
"(MT) Europe views Ethiopia with ambivalence."
"It was initially extremely confident that it could help this country progress towards democracy."
"This is why we sent to Ethiopia one of the largest observation missions we have ever sent."
"The West views Ethiopia almost as an ally, and by the West I also mean America."
"The West also applauded Somalia when it offered aid to the Ethiopian Government."
"What has happened internally, however?"
"Internally, we have seen that, because this country relies on international assistance, especially from the West, human rights are not respected; minorities are punished in one way or another, and there is corruption amongst the police and judicial authorities."
"We have also observed that there are just under forty people in prison, who will probably be given the death penalty."
"Therefore, I believe that Europe must try to re-open negotiations in a collaborative rather than authoritative manner with this country."
"We must convey the message to Ethiopia that it cannot continue to operate in this manner."
"Madam President, I want to assure you that the Commission fully shares Parliament's concerns with the lack of progress with respect to democratisation in Ethiopia and even the deterioration of the situation since the 2005 post-election crisis."
"The Commission, in coordination with Member States and the international community, actively undertook efforts to defuse tensions and urge the Ethiopian Government to take practical steps towards the reconciliation and the democratisation of the country, to restore confidence and to release the imprisoned opposition leaders and representatives of the media and civil society."
"In its relations with the Ethiopian authorities, the Commission is continuously stressing the importance of reforms, including the implementation of the recommendations of the EU Election Observation Mission in 2005."
"As far as the political detainees are concerned, President Barroso and Commissioner Michel have reiterated their concerns on several occasions to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, requesting a short, fair and transparent trial, asking for the withdrawal of the more outrageous charges and pointing out that they did not consider the trial an appropriate response to the Ethiopian political problems."
"The granting of an amnesty to the political detainees was also suggested to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia."
"The presence of an EU lawyer observer at the prisoners' trial is intended to remind the Ethiopian authorities of the EU's attention in this regard."
"Notwithstanding the recent release of 26 of the 131 initial defendants, for whom some of the initial accusations had been dismissed, the Commission is at present seriously concerned about the guilty verdict pronounced on 11 June against 38 political prisoners, which could lead even to the death penalty."
"The Commission, the EU Member States and the international community are following the situation very closely, also taking into account the ongoing mediation efforts between the Ethiopian authorities and the prisoners."
"The Commission supports the mediation, but expects this mediation to lead to the unconditional release of the political prisoners."
"The Commission is aware that the political situation is due to the lack of democratic reforms and extensive human rights violations, like arrests and detentions without charge."
"I want to assure you that we will never abandon those Ethiopians who are committed to democracy, many of whom have been imprisoned and forced to leave the country."
"Notwithstanding some progress made in parliamentary rules, there is a lack of substantial progress in the Prime Minister's commitments entered into with the opposition after the elections, notably on electoral reforms, independence of the National Electoral Board, media reforms, independence of the judiciary and of the security and military forces."
"The Commission remains convinced that we should continue to engage with the Ethiopian authorities in an intense political dialogue on such crucial issues at every possible opportunity."
"Commissioner Michel, who is personally committed, has given priority to keeping an open and structured dialogue with them within the framework of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement on political dialogue, as the most appropriate way to encourage enhanced governance, reconciliation and democracy."
"The Commission recognises that democratisation will take time and we must remain vigilant as well as ready to support the government's efforts in that direction."
"As regards the death penalty, we made it explicitly clear to the Prime Minister of Ethiopia that the European Union is opposed to its use in all circumstances and considers its abolition a crucial step towards the advancement of human dignity."
"Thank you, Commissioner."
"The debate is closed, and the vote will take place shortly."
"3."
"Burma"
"The next item is the debate on six motions for a resolution on Burma."
"author. - Madam President, Commissioner, Burma is a regular theme in our sessions on human rights breaches."
"If we had a prize for the regime with the worst human rights record, Burma would certainly be a very strong contender."
"Incidentally, Burma is also a world star with respect to another evil: drugs."
"According to the International Narcotics Central Strategy Report for 2006, Burma is the world's second largest producer of illicit opium, accounting for more than 90% of South-East Asian heroin."
"I do not know how well the breaches of human rights are connected to drug production in Burma, but I know they should both be dealt with firmly, quickly and effectively."
"Unfortunately, it seems that the EU's stance - as well as that of the international community - against the Burmese regime has not been drastic enough to have any good effect."
"A good example is the recent granting of permission by the Council to the Burmese Foreign Minister to attend the ASEM meeting, only days after the military junta in Burma had extended the deplorable house arrest of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"The Council ought to give an explanation for this action."
"Another example is the fact that an arms embargo on Burma is largely ineffective, since countries like China and India are not taking part in it."
"Surely pressure must be put on such countries to join in the arms embargo against Burma?"
"In conclusion, let me reiterate our call for the immediate release from house arrest of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi."
"That remarkable lady has contributed enormously to peace and democracy, not only in Burma but internationally, and she has been awarded both the Nobel Peace Prize and our own Sakharov Prize."
"It is truly outrageous and shameful that she has spent more than 11 of the last 17 years in detention in her own country."
"International and EU calls for her release have had no effect."
"Our patience has long run out."
"We recommend that more drastic action, such as expansion of sanctions and enlargement of the list of those targeted, must now take place."
"author. - (PL) Madam President, the European Union has adopted a firm stance regarding the abuses perpetrated by the military regime in Burma/Myanmar."
"Europe is pressing for Burma/Myanmar to show more respect for human rights and get back on course towards democracy."
"The authorities in Burma/Myanmar are continuing to imprison and persecute activists working for democracy."
"I believe there are two ways in which the situation in that country could be improved."
"One is for China and India to stop supplying it with arms and other strategic equipment."
"The other is for foreign enterprises investing in Burma/Myanmar to respect human rights."
"It is also important to develop programmes to assist civil society in Burma/Myanmar, notably organisations for women and ethnic minorities."
"I represent the Union for Europe of the Nations Group."
"We support all actions aimed at protecting human rights and respect for the principles of the rule of law and democratic freedoms including freedom of association and freedom of speech."
"We will continue to do so at all times."
"We wish to draw attention to the financial situation of the Burmese people."
"Over 15 million of them are living below the poverty line."
"This amounts to about 30% of the population."
"Immediate assistance is needed to protect the life and health of these individuals."
"author. - (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have often spoken in this House about the situation in Burma, making frequent use of the terms 'repression', 'military junta in power' and 'flouted human rights'."
"The resolution that we are going to vote on today is a call for Burma to bring an end to certain actions."
"Along with my colleagues, I particularly and principally deplore the house arrest since 30 May 2003 of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese opposition member who celebrated her 62nd birthday on Tuesday and has spent eleven out of the last seventeen years in detention, mainly under house arrest."
"She has only been able to leave her home once, for health reasons requiring urgent attention, and she has little contact with the outside world."
"Aung San Suu Kyi is the symbol of the Burmese opposition to the military dictatorship, and also received the Nobel prize in 1991."
"It is absolutely unacceptable for her to be under house arrest. This is why we are calling for her immediate, unconditional release."
"Burma must entirely stop persecuting and imprisoning pro-democracy activists and must release those who are already in prison."
"I am thinking in particular of U Win Tin, a journalist who, now aged 77, has been in prison for nearly 20 years for writing a letter to the United Nations reporting the poor conditions under which political prisoners were being held."
"As Vice-Chairman of the ANASE delegation in Parliament, I see the growing role that this organisation can play in the region."
"May it have a positive influence on the Burmese Government in the near future!"
"author. - Madam President, Burma has one of the world's worst human rights and lack of democracy track records, with people-trafficking for sexual exploitation, domestic service and forced commercial labour."
"This is compounded by the military junta's severe economic mismanagement."
"Burma also remains the world's second-largest producer of illicit opium."
"Despite multi-party elections in 1990, which resulted in the NLD victory, the repressive military junta continues to refuse to hand over power."
"NLD leader and Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who marked her 62nd birthday this Tuesday, has been detained for more than 11 of the past 18 years."
"In February 2006, the junta extended her detention for yet another year."
"Her supporters, as well as those who promote democracy and improved human rights, are routinely harassed or jailed in a country with no independent judiciary and brutal law enforcement agencies."
"Following the recent UN Security Council refusal to apply sanctions against Burma, disgracefully, the UN Human Rights Council has focused almost entirely and exclusively on one single country - Israel - totally ignoring Burma."
"The EU, along with neighbouring ASEAN countries, and along with India and China as well, must now do much more to apply pressure to secure Aung San Suu Kyi's release."
"author. - (ES) Madam President, as other Members have pointed out and as is pointed out time and time again in the reports by the United Nations Special Representative on Human Rights in Myanmar, Mr Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, and in the reports by the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative on Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani, the situation in Burma continues to be of concern and is deteriorating every day."
"I would like to begin by recalling the appeals that have been made in this House on previous occasions and which we must make once again."
"Extending the confinement of Aung San Suu Kyi by a year is entirely unacceptable, and we must therefore call upon the Burmese regime to suspend it as soon as possible."
"It is also important to call once again for the release of all political prisoners and to guarantee freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration, which are currently being violated in that country."
"On the other hand, however, I also believe that it is important to point out our responsibility as western countries in relation to that country, in terms of investments, and I say this because there are at least two crucial factors."
"Firstly, let us not forget that Burma currently has, if not the most significant, then at least one of the most significant reserves of natural gas in South-East Asia."
"That is a very attractive thing, naturally."
"It is therefore essential that, before there is any foreign international investment, we guarantee that there is at least an analysis of the impact of those investments on human rights."
"That is something that we forget too often."
"Secondly, I believe that it is also important to stress that the sanctions currently being imposed by the United States, and the European Union's restrictions, are not proving to be effective."
"The fact that many other Asian countries are clearly increasing their investments in that country obliges us also to take a regional approach to the problem in order to ensure that our actions, and those of our allies, are more effective."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, I reiterate the condemnation of the Burmese regime, which is so clearly and effectively expressed in the resolution."
"The 17-year-long plight of Aung San Suu Kyi is one which few human beings could withstand."
"She has selflessly withstood indefinite imprisonment and ongoing separation from her loved ones, yet is still showing unshakeable courage and consistency in her cause, and for this she must be applauded."
"She is, without doubt, a leader of our time, enduring the curtailment of her civil liberties which closely mirrors the suppression of her fellow citizens."
"The human rights abuses in Burma span religious persecution, forced labour and detention without trial and are elements of political violence which the UN has recently justifiably condemned."
"The signatories of this resolution wholeheartedly denounce the economic support given to the regime through investment in the arms trade and the energy industry from other Far Eastern countries, which only shows up this ruthless dictatorship."
"All democracies should seriously reconsider financing a country with one of the lowest health expenditures in the world."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PL) Madam President, six months have passed since the last European Parliament resolution that sent out a warning about the serious internal situation in Burma/Myanmar."
"The military authorities in power in that country have failed to make any progress towards democracy, however."
"Burma/Myanmar's economic situation is causing great concern."
"Thirty per cent of its people live below the poverty line and human rights are openly violated."
"In addition, forced labour and child conscription into the army are part of everyday life."
"Opposition activists are persecuted and imprisoned for long periods, as has happened in the case of Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel and Sakharov prize winner who has been detained for 17 years."
"Against this background, all the political groups in Burma/Myanmar should be urged to take part in the National Convention charged with drafting a new Constitution."
"Representatives of the National League for Democracy should also participate."
"Burma/Myanmar's membership of ASEAN is particularly important for its future, as ASEAN members are required to redouble their efforts towards democracy."
"China and India should exert political and economic pressure on the Burmese regime by refusing to support the army of Burma/Myanmar."
"For its part, the international community should implement economic sanctions and freeze the assets of members of the Government of Burma/Myanmar and those associated with them."
"It is only by taking decisive action of this nature that we can hope to force the Burmese regime to introduce democratic changes."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Madam President, the subject of today's debate on human rights violations is once again the political and social situation in Burma/Myanmar."
"Ever since 1962, Burma/Myanmar has been ruled by the military, who have kept an iron grip on the country."
"For over 40 years, human rights have been violated in this Asian country, and thousands of individuals have been persecuted and punished for opposition activities."
"Many have been imprisoned."
"Forced labour is the order of the day, and children are conscripted into the army."
"Most people in Burma/Myanmar do not have access to medical care."
"Many of them die of tuberculosis, malaria, HIV or AIDS and almost half the children do not attend school."
"Red Cross centres have been shut down and those in need deprived of protection and humanitarian aid."
"The junta disregards the actions of the UN Human Rights Council and of the ILO."
"It also fails to respond to European Parliament resolutions and to documents issued by the Council of the European Community."
"On 15 May 2007 Aung San Suu Kyi's term of house arrest was extended for a further year."
"This Nobel Prize winner and opposition activist has spent 11 of the last 17 years either in prison or under house arrest."
"We appeal for her release and that of other political prisoners."
"We also call for the National League for Democracy to be allowed to resume its activities, and for the resumption of humanitarian aid to prevent the extinction of the Burmese nation and ethnic minorities."
"A particular problem concerning the continued existence of this regime and others of a totalitarian nature is the ineffective actions taken by international bodies."
"Despite promises to the contrary, the sanctions imposed do not have an impact on the economic structures of the regimes and the embargoes applied hit ordinary people who are already persecuted and living in extreme poverty."
"Our European Parliament resolutions and all other actions will remain superficial and ineffective until these issues are resolved."
"Madam President, the Commission remains worried about the situation in Myanmar/Burma."
"The biggest worries concern the deep social and ethnic fault lines which divide the country and which result in human insecurity, widespread poverty and lack of progress in economic and social development."
"It is obvious, that in a climate of human insecurity and ongoing armed conflict in a few border areas, there is little space for respect for human rights."
"The authorities of Myanmar/Burma are confronted with a number of challenges, like establishing national unity and political stability, and - most importantly - advancing the development level of their country which remains one of the poorest in the world."
"For the international community, helping the transition of Myanmar/Burma towards a more open and more developed society - led by a legitimate and civilian government - should remain the paramount goal."
"The military leadership's erratic governance continues, in economic terms and in the political sphere."
"The military continues to employ practices of forced labour, while civil society faces repression, uncertainty and operational difficulties."
"The '88 Students' - the then leaders of the 1988 uprising - continue to exploit the minimal space for civil society as much as they can, while the National League for Democracy is marginalised and while the unjustifiable detention of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi continues."
"Transition is hard to imagine with more than one thousand political detainees, among whom Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi sticks out as the icon of peace and reconciliation."
"Such transition is equally inconceivable without a genuine dialogue with the various ethnic groups, including those continuing their armed battle."
"The Commission supports the work of Professor Paolo Sergio Pinheiro, the UN's Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Myanmar."
"He said, in his last statement, that 'grave human rights violations are indulged not only with impunity but authorised by the sanction of laws'."
"The Commission also welcomes the appointment by the UN Secretary-General of Professor Ibrahim Gambari as Special Envoy for Myanmar, and expects that the Government will extend its full cooperation to him, in order to allow the good offices of the UN Secretary General to continue."
"Regarding the forthcoming session of the National Convention, we call on the Government to listen to the voices of ethnic groups and political stakeholders in opposition."
"We note progress in the working conditions of the local International Labour Organisation office, which will hopefully improve the situation of victims of forced labour practices filing a complaint."
"But we deplore the deteriorating working conditions for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and call on the Government to allow the ICRC to resume its humanitarian mission."
"Among most observers, there is a growing consensus that more needs to be done about the political and socioeconomic situation."
"The European Union, in its common position, has mandated the Commission to engage the Government in a dialogue over its responsibilities to achieve the Millennium Development Goals."
"The EU has, therefore, been looking for effective policies which may help the people of Myanmar/Burma and which may help to bring them back into the international community."
"The Three Diseases Fund, supported by the EU and its partners, is an example of this policy."
"Our approach focuses on the most basic and immediate human security needs of the population, and it clearly recognises the limits which exist for all external actors."
"However, withholding aid and contributing to more isolation would only make the population pay the price, that is, the people of Myanmar/Burma who are already suffering."
"We simply do not believe that through increased sanctions the suffering of the people can be relieved."
"Moreover, such an approach would not help influence the military leaders."
"The Commission is fully committed to stepping up its programmes in Myanmar/Burma, in quantitative and qualitative terms, with a view to contributing effectively to development and reconciliation."
"That concludes the debate."
"The vote will take place shortly."

"We eagerly await your report on the results of the European Council of 21/22 June and the activities and achievements of the German Council Presidency."
"It is also a pleasure to greet the Commission President, Mr Dur√£o Barroso."
"Welcome, Mr Commission President."
"Before we come to the discussion on the summit, however, it is a joyful experience, together with the President of the European Council, to sign an important new EU regulation."
"With our signature under the Roaming Regulation, we are at the same time rounding off a successful collaboration on behalf of the citizens of the European Union."
"(Audio problems)"
"Europe does not always succeed immediately."
"If we are patient, however, it will succeed."
"As far as technology is concerned, there is still more to do."
"The Commission President is right about a technology institute."
"Mr Commission President, we must move forward."
"Today is a good day for 140 million mobile-telephone users in the European Union."
"The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have acted quickly, decisively and efficiently on behalf of our citizens."
"In a record time of only eleven months after the tabling of the draft regulation through the Commission, the new Roaming Regulation comes into force at the end of this week, on 30 June."
"At this point, I would specifically like to thank the Commission and especially Commissioner Reding for her initiative, her bold proposal and her active role in the course of negotiations."
"(Applause)"
"My thanks also go to the Council Presidency, which recognised the importance of this ruling for Europe's citizens and therefore campaigned for a speedy solution at Council level with great dedication and successful negotiating skills."
"Special thanks go to our rapporteur, Mr R√ºbig, and the chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, Mrs Niebler."
"They steered this difficult dossier safely and decisively through the committee and were able to achieve an excellent and convincing result for consumers."
"From this summer onwards, mobile-telephone customers will be able to take advantage of lasting lowered roaming tariffs."
"Greater price transparency and quick, personalised price information provided immediately on crossing a border will lead to a more customer-friendly service and a lowering of prices."
"Today, the European Union is removing a major barrier to further development of the freedom of movement of persons within the European Union."
"This is a good example for a Europe of results, for a Union whose actions have a tangible value for its citizens."
"Madam President, there is provision in the procedure for you to kindly make a few remarks on the Roaming Regulation before your main report."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, not every regulation can be explained simply, but this one can."
"With this in place, it will be simpler and, above all, cheaper to telephone from one European country to another in future."
"I am quite sure that Europe's citizens will greatly appreciate it and we should, therefore, quickly put our signatures to the regulation, Mr President."
"(Applause)"

"My sincere thanks, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel."
"(Applause)"
"We come now to the debate on the European Council report and the Commission's statement regarding the European Council meeting of 21/22 June 2007 as well as the Council statement on the six months of the German Presidency."
"Madam President of the European Council, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, you will today address for the fourth time the Members of the European Parliament."
"This sets standards for each presidency to come."
"I do not wish to anticipate the comments of the chairmen of the political groups and my other fellow Members. I would, however, like to express our thanks for your good will, your patience, but most of all your decisiveness concerning Europe, without which the outcome of the Brussels summit would not have been possible."
"My sincere thanks, Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel."
"(Applause)"
"I should like to ask you to address us now, Madam President of the Council."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days after a memorable European Council, I would at this point first like to bring back into memory our celebration ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in Berlin in March."
"On that occasion we reminded ourselves that 50 years of the Treaty of Rome, 50 years of peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law, are after all no more than the blink of an eye in terms of history."
"Whether, some day, they are to be more than that ..."
"(Audio problems)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I will try again."
"Is the interpreting service sorted out now?"
"Madam President of the Council, could we try again please."
"In Europe some patience is required."
"I would ask for your forbearance."
"Mr President, my fellow Members, ladies and gentlemen, just a few days after a memorable European Council, I would at this point first like to bring back into memory our celebration ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in Berlin in March."
"On that occasion we reminded ourselves that 50 years of the Treaty of Rome, 50 years of peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law, are after all no more than the blink of an eye in terms of history."
"Whether, some day, they are to be more than that, we do not know."
"At the ceremony in March, we made it clear that none of this, peace and freedom, democracy and the rule of law, none of this can be taken for granted."
"It must all be strengthened and defended again and again."
"To stand still is to go backwards."
"It takes decades to build up trust but it can be destroyed overnight."
"Yes, overnight."
"Any rift would have Europe out of step faster than some might think."
"In short, European integration must repeatedly be worked at and safeguarded."
"I am therefore very grateful that we were able to achieve exactly this with the outcome of the last European Council."
"We set the course for a renewed, common foundation of the European Union; we overcame the standstill."
"In the end we did not destroy trust; we avoided a rift."
"In short, with the outcome of Saturday evening, Europe will find a new, common energy."
"Today, I do not wish to rake over the draining negotiations of recent weeks and months, as we all know only too well that even the starting point was difficult."
"On one side we had the states that had ratified and fully supported the Constitutional Treaty and on the other side the states requiring extensive changes because of criticism from their people."
"Let us not fool ourselves, there is always a danger present: the danger that the state of paralysis and the tendency for division continue."
"Of course, had the European Council not achieved the desired outcome, it would not have signified the end of Europe, but it would undoubtedly have had almost indescribable repercussions."
"It is therefore of great significance that we managed to avoid this situation."
"The Brussels Agreement enables us to retain the substance of the Constitutional Treaty."
"I think that ultimately we are all agreed that the outcome of the European Council is a success."
"A success for Europe and also a success for the European Parliament."
"You have always defended the substance of the Constitutional Treaty and now the Reform Treaty can come into force in time for the European elections in 2009."
"This is of extreme importance for all who will stand before the citizens of Europe."
"(Applause)"
"With the Reform Treaty, we have taken into account the concerns of citizens about a would-be European superstate, about surrendering too much of the identity of the individual states."
"I do not share these concerns, but I needed to respect them and respect them I did."
"We decided, therefore, to refrain from mentioning any symbols or designations similar to those of the Member States in the Reform Treaty."
"At the same time, the Reform Treaty achieves significant advances in the European Union's capacity to act."
"We have gone further even than in the EU Constitutional Treaty in some areas."
"The issues of climate protection and energy solidarity were raised; national parliaments are becoming even more heavily involved in the shaping of national policy on Europe; the lines between the authority of the EU and of the Member States will be even more clearly demarcated; it is now easier to meet the conditions for increased cooperation, particularly in the spheres of justice and home affairs."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Reform Treaty realises three elements essential for the future of the European Union."
"Firstly, it strengthens the EU's capacity to act, both internally and externally."
"The Union's single legal personality and the extension of qualified majority decision-making in the Council play a part here."
"The revision to a double majority, giving the demographic factor greater weight, will, however, come into force only in 2014, that is, at the same time as the first slimmed-down Commission, and with a transition period until 2017, but it will become reality."
"This is European progress that cannot be overestimated."
"The Council's work will also achieve greater continuity through a European Council president and the team presidencies with the coming into force of the new treaty."
"At the same time, the Reform Treaty brings policy progress, for example in the sphere of the European Union's external activities."
"A coherent foreign policy, speaking with one voice, becomes ever more important for a Europe that wishes to assert itself in the world."
"We will appoint the High Representative of the Union for Foreign and Security Policy, he will lead the Committee on Foreign Affairs, he will be supported by a European diplomatic service and he will be a member of the Commission, namely Vice-President of the Commission."
"This is a political quantum leap for Europe."
"(Applause)"
"In the spheres of justice and internal affairs, an area in which people are extremely interested, important progress is being made, for example in the common fight against cross-border crime."
"Proceedings will also be significantly sped up by the new process of decision-making by qualified majority."
"In addition to this, we will be able to make clearer that the transfer of authority is not a one-way street, through which the European Union just takes on more and more responsibilities. There can also be situations where authority can be handed back to the individual countries, where necessary."
"It is a commonly expressed wish of the people that there should be more European participation in some important areas but also less participation in domains that the Member States can manage perfectly well on their own, and we are accommodating this desire."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Reform Treaty also makes a second thing unmistakably clear: there will be greater proximity between Europe and its citizens."
"To this end, a European citizens' initiative will be introduced, as envisaged in the Constitutional Treaty."
"Progress will be made in the social sphere and there will be well-defined regulations in the area of public services."
"In addition, the Intergovernmental Conference will determine its own protocol, where services of general economic interest will be highly valued and it will be made clear that the Member States have substantial freedom of scope in the non-commercial domain."
"I am very pleased, and I think the majority of us are in agreement on this, that we were also able to find a solution for the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The Charter will strengthen the rights of citizens in relation to the institutions. It preserves legal obligations, which, in my view, is fitting for a Europe with a sense of values."
"(Applause)"
"We know that the United Kingdom, with its own legal tradition, has chosen its own path and we must respect that."
"The alternative would have been to restrict the legally binding nature of the Charter for all, which would, however, have been unacceptable for the majority of the Member States."
"It is good, therefore, that this was avoided and I believe that this is the majority opinion of Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, finally, the third element where progress will be seen through the Reform Treaty is that of more rights for parliaments."
"With the reform of the Treaty, the European Parliament will, as a rule, be an equal co-legislator and in future the European Parliament will elect the president of the European Commission."
"At the same time, many Member States thought it important to give more recognition to the role of national parliaments. This will be put into effect in a new article."
"We also agreed to strengthen the parliaments under the subsidiarity control mechanism; although in doing so we have respected the European Commission's right to make proposals."
"In future, individual national parliaments will have no power of veto, which I also think is absolutely right."
"(Applause)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the reform of the Treaty was one of the goals of the German EU Council Presidency."
"The other goal of the European Council Presidency was the reorientation of the European Union towards that which we can achieve only as a united Europe."
"For I am wholly convinced that only if we act jointly and purposefully can we achieve tangible progress for our citizens."
"Of course, there will always be exceptions, which we saw as recently as at the time of the EU Council rulings."
"There will always be new cases of individual Member States deciding that they do not wish to participate, or at least not initially, in particular policies, whilst others lead the way, although within the scope of the treaty."
"This, however, is not a so-called 'two-speed' Europe."
"Allow me to be quite clear on this: I do not think much of it."
"(Applause)"
"This must not be the aim of our policies; otherwise we will open up new rifts in Europe and weaken the European Parliament."
"It is worth all the trouble and effort to keep on searching for a common path for all the Member States of the European Union."
"There is an African saying that if you want to travel fast, walk alone; if you want to travel far, walk together."
"I think that in this African saying lies the wisdom underlying the concept of European integration."
"Only if we act jointly and purposefully can we preserve the great, the unique idea that has shaped the concept of European integration for over 50 years: peace, freedom and legal certainty for the citizens of Europe."
"Only if we act jointly and purposefully can we strengthen the rights of citizens within the European Union, for example, by integrating the Pr√ºm Convention into the legal framework of the EU."
"This facilitates increased police cooperation in the cross-border fight against terrorism, criminality and illegal migration in the EU."
"Only if we act jointly and purposefully will we improve Europe's competitiveness as a place for business."
"An example of this is the Roaming Regulation that we have signed here today."
"Only if we act jointly and purposefully can we take on one of the major challenges for mankind, the danger caused by climate change."
"The decisions taken at the Spring European Council for an integrated energy and climate protection policy are groundbreaking."
"They were, incidentally, also the prerequisite for reaching an agreement at the G8 Summit that we need a follow-up undertaking within the scope of the Kyoto Protocol under the auspices of the United Nations, and that all G8 participants have declared their support for this."
"This would not have been possible without the Spring European Council and the support of the European Parliament."
"This is a great example of defending European interests."
"(Applause)"
"It is only right, therefore, that climate protection will now be included among the goals of the European Union in the new draft treaty."
"Only if we act jointly and purposefully do we Europeans stand any chance of bringing our concerns to bear in the world."
"This was also demonstrated by the summits we held during our Presidency with our non-EU G8 partners: the US, Russia, Japan and Canada."
"In addition to decisions on climate protection, further agreements of long-term importance were also reached at these summits: with the US and Canada we agreed to strengthen regulatory cooperation; with Russia we agreed to establish an early-warning system for energy crises and to open a dialogue on investment; with Japan we agreed to enforce the protection of intellectual property rights more effectively."
"Ladies and gentlemen, all institutional progress and the reorientation of the European Union are ultimately possible only if we Europeans are conscious of our values, indeed, if we make these values the guiding principles for all our actions."
"I believe that these guiding principles can also help to convince our citizens about Europe, namely by raising awareness of our common goals, by making it clear that we are acting together in the world on the basis of our values."
"Europe does not mean doing as we please."
"Europe is an obligation to help ensure that our Earth remains a habitable planet, that fewer and fewer people are forced to leave their homes as a result of violence or war, that diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis can be fought successfully."
"Thus, the German EU Council Presidency comes full circle."
"The Reform Treaty is necessary so that Europe can hold its course."
"The European Council hopes that the Intergovernmental Conference can be convened before the end of July, which is why I would like to ask you today to submit your statements as soon as possible."
"As does the German Presidency, you want us to be able to say to people in the 2009 European election campaign: This is the only way for Europe to move forward."
"This is why it is good that the European Parliament repeatedly gets involved in debate on these matters and seeks a dialogue with civil society, as it will demonstrate at an agora event in the autumn."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like, at the close of the German Council Presidency, to quote once again from the book 'Werte."
"Von Plato bis Pop' (Values - From Plato to Pop) by the German author Peter Prange."
"You may remember that I quoted him in my speech here in January at the outset of my Council Presidency."
"Prange writes that everything we Europeans have ever achieved, we owe to the contradictions within us, the eternal conflict within ourselves, the constant jostling between opinions and conflicting opinions, ideas and opposing ideas, theses and antitheses."
"Allow me to add a few words of my own."
"We owe it all to our ability to withstand these inner contradictions and to our ability, after countless wars and untold suffering, to allow something as awesome as the work for peace in Europe to succeed."
"We citizens of Europe have truly united for the better."
"My wish is that in 50 years' time, in 2057, the citizens of Europe will say: back in 2007, after strength-sapping, nerve-racking discussions, the European Union at last set the right course; back then, in 2007, the European Union set off on the right path to a prosperous future."
"That was, is and will remain our mission, our mission for the future, to which Germany will stay wholly committed even after its Presidency ends."
"Thank you."
"(The Members of the House stand up and there is prolonged applause)"
"Madam President of the Council, the reaction of the European Parliament expresses better than any words its great endorsement of your actions."
"We would also like to sincerely thank your colleagues who have supported you."
"I would also like to express my sincere thanks to Commission President Barroso and kindly ask him to address us."
"President of the Commission. (DE) Allow me to congratulate Chancellor Angela Merkel on what she has achieved."
"Out of an extremely difficult task a success for Europe has emerged."
"I should particularly like to pay tribute to the political ambition that the Chancellor showed in insisting on a reform Treaty that gives the Union the instruments it needs to face up to the challenges of the 21st century."
"We should salute Chancellor Merkel and the entire German Presidency team for battling with such determination to achieve their aims and for bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion."
"These congratulations apply not only to the result of the June Summit but also to the many successes that the German Presidency has achieved in the course of the last six months."
"(Applause)"
"We can honestly say that Europe is fully on track."
"I believe it is useful to remember where we were some time ago."
"Let me step back from the events of last week and look back over the last two years."
"Just over a year ago the Commission adopted an approach which I called 'the twin-track approach'."
"The first track was for the European Union to use the existing Treaties more effectively to deliver results for Europe's citizens."
"We have done this, for example through our package of measures on energy and climate change; through our focus on innovation; through our drive against red tape; through legislation which delivers practical benefits for consumers, such as the legislation we proposed on roaming, which was signed before us here today."
"I want to thank this House for its support for those initiatives."
"The second track was to return to the process of treaty reform."
"That is why we suggested the idea of the Berlin Declaration."
"That was a great moment to reaffirm our interests and our values in the 21st century."
"I believe that the discussion on the Berlin Declaration was an important time to gather the necessary support which made it possible to achieve good results at the recent European Council."
"We are therefore honoured to say that the path we have been suggesting over the different presidencies of the Council was followed."
"How was that possible?"
"Because the twin-track approach was the right approach."
"We cannot give our citizens the impression that we are just talking about institutions: we have to concentrate on practical results for our citizens, and governments and citizens will have the confidence to tackle sometimes very difficult institutional issues if they have the confidence that the institutions can deliver when it comes to the concerns of the European citizens - growth and employment, and Europe's new agenda: energy, climate change and security."
"The recent Eurobarometer is encouraging: support for European Union membership and the perceived benefits of membership have improved considerably over the last two to three years."
"In fact they are the best results in terms of support for the European Union since 1994."
"That is why we have done - and we should do - everything we can not to miss the opportunity to reinforce the commitment to this great European project now that we are 27 states and almost 500 million citizens."
"Let me be very frank about the results of the Council."
"I think that when we consider the challenges ahead we can really say that the results are excellent."
"Today in this House it is the time to stress this point."
"Let us not forget that before this Council we started from a division between 18 Member States that had rectified the Constitutional Treaty and 9 Member States that had not ratified it, and 2 of them explicitly refused the Constitutional Treaty after a referendum."
"Now all 27 Member States are united around a common mandate for a reform Treaty."
"The fact that we managed an agreement is already an outstanding political result and we should be grateful for the willingness of all governments to compromise."
"Now we should look forward to the ratification process as a great moment of solidarity and unity in Europe and as a historic opportunity to consolidate the enlarged European Union."
"At the same time, the advances from the Nice Treaty will guarantee a Union with a greater capacity to act to deliver results."
"Honestly, the reform Treaty will probably not be an example of the finest poetry, but I have no doubt that it will be a very good example of excellent prose if it is focused precisely on the capacity of the European institutions to act."
"I said before the European Council that we really needed to reinforce the European Union's capacity to act."
"I believe the reform Treaty will bring important advances to the Union and will reinforce its ability to act."
"First of all, the Union will be fully consolidated by overcoming the pillar structure and by acquiring a single personality."
"In this area of capacity to act, I would like to stress in particular three specific points."
"First, the most substantial advances are in the area of justice and home affairs."
"There are more than 40 new cases of qualified majority voting in the reform Treaty."
"They include external border control, asylum, migration, criminal law and police cooperation."
"The Treaty will also fully integrate these areas into Community method of decision-making."
"It is in fact the 'Communitarisation' of the third pillar."
"This is a fundamental reform which will create a true space of freedom, security and justice in Europe and it will be a priority for the rest of the mandate of this Commission."
"The Union needs the efficiency which more qualified majority voting brings."
"It is no use having the right policies if they are agreed years too late."
"Second, the reform Treaty will offer new possibilities and reinforce legal bases to deal with the challenges of energy policy and climate change."
"In particular, the Commission is very pleased with the solidarity clause on energy security and agreement to add combating climate change to the Treaty."
"Energy security and climate change are now core priorities for the Union."
"It is right that this is reflected in the Treaties."
"Third, the reform Treaty will enhance the Union's cohesion as regards external affairs."
"In the 21st-century world, it is only by combining the forces of our Member States and of our institutions that we can compete with other leading powers."
"Our prosperity, our freedom and our security depend on the capacity to compete at a global level, the capacity to promote our interests and our values."
"Europe will increasingly speak with one voice in diplomatic, security and defence issues in trade, in monetary aid, in development, and as such will be better equipped to defend our values and interests in world politics."
"We will have the conditions and the instruments to shape globalisation and we cannot miss such a historic opportunity."
"But the reform Treaty also addressed other issues, namely in terms of accountability and democratic legitimacy."
"With the reform Treaty, the Union will reinforce its accountability and democratic legitimacy."
"Again let me emphasise three cases of clear improvement compared to the Nice Treaty."
"First, the European Parliament will have greater participation in the legislative process of the Union by an increase in codecision procedures."
"Under the new Treaty, the vast majority of European laws will be adopted jointly by the European Parliament and by the Council in full respect of the Commission's right of initiative."
"Second, national parliaments will be more involved in the workings of the Union."
"This is about subsidiarity and we are for subsidiarity."
"The new Treaty will amend the protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality."
"This Commission has always welcomed a greater role for national parliaments."
"However, the Commission also made clear that involving national parliaments in scrutinising subsidiarity should not undermine the essentials of how the European Union works."
"First, any new procedure on subsidiarity would have to respect the Community method and the Commission's right of initiative."
"Second, the European Parliament and the Council should be on an equal footing."
"Finally, the thresholds regarding majorities should rise to reflect the importance of the procedure."
"We managed to secure all our demands and as such to preserve the institutional balance of the Union, while reinforcing the control of subsidiarity."
"Third, and in my view this is one of the most important points, the reform Treaty will give legal force to the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"The fact that the Charter is legally binding is a powerful symbol of the strong ties that exist between the Union and European citizens."
"It is also a very good signal and symbol that we are committed to fundamental rights."
"We cannot promote fundamental rights all over the world and not say that we consider them binding at home."
"(Applause)"
"The Charter is not, and was never intended to be, a Charter of the rights of European institutions above the Member States."
"The Charter is for European citizens and the rights of the citizens against any power that could limit those rights."
"The Charter will be a safeguard, both for European citizens and for national institutions, and will be a central part of the system of checks and balances in our Union of law, because that is what makes us different from many other projects: we are a Union based on law."
"I have always said that a step back from the existing acquis would be unacceptable."
"This is particularly important in respect of the single market."
"The results of the European Council were entirely positive from the Commission's point of view, specifically from the point of view of the Commission's competence."
"The protocols on services of general interest and on the internal market and competition, both proposed by the Commission, guarantee a fair and undistorted functioning of the single market, while respecting legitimate concerns expressed by some Member States."
"Before concluding, I should like to warn against the temptation of a perverse alliance between those who resist a political Europe and those who oppose the single market."
"To those who support an open and global Europe, I say that they will only get this if they support political integration."
"Without political power, Europe will never be able to shape globalisation and to defend its interests and values in the world."
"Europe will never be able to defend its commitment to an open economy and to open societies."
"(Applause)"
"To those who accept a strong political Europe, but are not as enthusiastic about economic integration, I say that they will only get that strong political Europe if they support the single market and economic integration."
"(Applause)"
"We cannot defend the European project by attacking the single market and trying to fragment what has been one of the greatest achievements of our integration in Europe."
"After the success of the European Council, there are now two crucial stages ahead."
"First we must finalise the IGC and sign the reform Treaty."
"The IGC will begin next month and the Portuguese Presidency aims to conclude it in October."
"I fully support this."
"Member States must then ratify the Treaty, and meanwhile, we must explain to the European public why this Treaty will be a necessary and positive step forward."
"Such a narrative will be a central part of the Commission's opinion ahead of the IGC."
"I also know that this House is already working hard on its opinion."
"I certainly hope that the European Parliament and the Commission can continue to work closely together on spreading the message that this reform is indispensable for meeting the challenges of the 21st century and delivering better results to European citizens."
"I believe that European citizens are the real beneficiaries of the reform Treaty."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you very much, Mr Barroso, for your speech and your great commitment."
"Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that, for some months now, there has been a 'driving force' in Europe, and we owe that to the German Presidency of the Union."
"I should like to pay special tribute in this House to the Chancellor, the President-in-Office of the Council, Mrs Merkel, and to her government."
"The track record of the German Presidency of the Union speaks for itself."
"Its successes have changed the atmosphere prevailing in the European Union."
"Moroseness and pessimism have been replaced by confidence, and the feeling of powerlessness in the face of the challenges of globalisation has lessened to make way for hope in the effects of ambitious, realistic and determined political action."
"The package on energy and climate change was the first major positive signal."
"You set the tone by convincing the EU Heads of State or Government to opt for ambitious objectives concerning renewable energy sources and CO2 by 2020 and to combat climate change."
"During the G8 in Heiligendamm, Europe showed that it was united and began to make the United States budge."
"Of course, much still remains to be done in this area."
"However, we have shown the people of Europe and our partners that when Europe is united, it has a real ability to influence and to lead."
"The German Presidency has also seen success in our strategic relations with the United States, whether it be in terms of treating the country as a priority partner, of speeding up the implementation of a transatlantic market, or of formalising the 'open skies' agreement."
"Europe's relations with Russia have also been at the heart of your Presidency's work, Mrs Merkel."
"When, in Samara, you were able to tell Mr Putin what our 'no-go areas' were and on what foundations we could and should cooperate, you took Europe forward in this regard too."
"The German Presidency has also been very active in the area, sensitive as it is, of justice and internal affairs."
"I should like very warmly to thank the Minister of the Interior, Mr Sch√§uble, who cooperated very effectively with our Parliament on all of these matters."
"Let us also pay tribute to the progress made in other areas, which are perhaps less spectacular but more tangible for our fellow citizens."
"This progress has been pointed out several times over the last few days: reduced roaming costs, voluntary modulation in the agricultural sector, in the fisheries sector, the environment, etc."
"Finally, I shall conclude with the agreement that was reached in the early hours of last Saturday, on the reform of the European Treaty."
"I shall not go back over the extreme difficulty of the task, apart from to deplore certain remarks which - I shall speak my mind here - are not worthy of the sacrifices made by the people of Europe over the last 50 years to guarantee a climate of peace and reconciliation among us all."
"(Applause)"
"I embrace the surge of hope created by the compromise concluded in Brussels on the relaunch of the EU institutions."
"Is that to say that my group, and especially its European People's Party (Christian Democrats) arm, is fully satisfied with the new draft treaty? Everyone will realise that the answer is no."
"The European symbols, the title of Foreign Affairs Minister, the double majority voting within short deadlines - we regret all of that."
"However, politics, and especially European politics, is the art of compromise."
"The agreement reached by the German Presidency in a joint effort is a good agreement that we will support."
"Thanks to you, Mrs Merkel, thanks to your country and also to the goodwill of the 27, the last six months have been very positive for European integration."
"We are extremely grateful to you for it."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the German Presidency has been a success, the German Presidency has set new standards."
"That is what the President said at the beginning of the debate and, Madam Chancellor, the presence of the German Government and the competence of its members, particularly those from the Social Democratic Party, have made a lasting impression."
"Last weekend's Summit achieved less than we would have liked, but it achieved a great deal."
"The progress made at the weekend was not negligible; it was significant."
"We have taken many significant steps forward. Much of what you have reported on and what the Commission President has described was demanded by the European Parliament."
"I should like to explain why it bodes well that you stood firm in these negotiations."
"Much took place behind closed doors, but we meet in public."
"I should therefore like to share the following: I have learnt that during the night you explained that if there were no unanimity you would convene the intergovernmental conference by a qualified majority and there would be a vote."
"As this spectre of secession hung over the room - and some in this Europe wish to support it - you held your nerve, stood up and said that countries needed to put their cards on the table."
"At this, several gave ground and then there came the unanimous result."
"That explains how you led the negotiations to such a successful conclusion last weekend."
"(Applause)"
"To those who only want to represent their own interests in Europe, who only want to appeal to national interests, I say, as your predecessor, Konrad Adenauer, did with characteristic bluntness: I must not slaughter the cow that I wish to milk."
"He was right, and his words still ring true for the European Union today."
"(Applause)"
"We have made significant progress."
"Europe is now much more transparent."
"There is transparency in the Commission, and also in Parliament, but not in the European Council."
"We talk about Europe being in crisis, but last weekend has made it even more plain that it is not the European institutions that are in crisis; it is above all the governments of the European Union's Member States that are in crisis."
"(Applause)"
"Madam Chancellor, I am not talking about all governments, just some of them."
"I should like to thank the Heads of State or Government who fought on our side: Romano Prodi, Guy Verhofstadt, Jean-Claude Juncker and you yourself, who said: we want European unity because there is no alternative."
"There were other governments who did not join in, who wanted something different."
"The Polish Government - not the Polish people, who, contrary to their government, are pro-European - should remember that in its history Poland had the liberum veto."
"The Polish Parliament of Nobles could only make a decision if there was unanimous agreement."
"The liberum veto was the downfall of the Polish Commonwealth, amongst other things."
"We will not have the European Union inherit this liberum veto, because we do not want it to be our undoing, and we will not allow the European Union to be led down a road that it must not go down."
"Europe and the European Union are an idea."
"It is the idea of overcoming the demons and enmities of the past through European integration."
"We will not allow a handful of people to resurrect past enmities and destroy the idea of Europe."
"That is precisely what you put a stop to at the weekend, and we thank you for it."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"I should now like to say a few words on a disturbing moment in these negotiations."
"Madam Chancellor, our generation, regardless of the part of Germany from which we come, has a duty that we, like all democratic politicians in our country, try to live up to, namely to draw the right conclusions from our country's mistakes and from the crimes that were committed in our people's name."
"The right conclusion that we Germans have drawn was to anchor the reunified Germany in the European Union, to make it part of an integrated community of nations, so as to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never repeated."
"That is our duty; that is what we are working towards together, whether Socialists, Christian Democrats, Liberals or Greens."
"That is our common obligation, our common task, which we Germans - and I am saying this as a Member of this international Parliament - must, in my opinion, live up to."
"We therefore also have the right to say that anyone who wants to use the dead of the Second World War to bargain for more votes in the Council of Ministers misunderstands what European politics is all about and should be rejected out of hand."
"(Loud and sustained applause)"
"Madam President-in-Office, you said that the European Parliament was the big winner of this round."
"We are the big winner because we will act."
"The Council will continue to tie its own hands with its arcane voting methods."
"Congratulations!"
"Once our majorities at both first and second reading are taken into account, we will be the decisive force in the European Union, just as we have been on roaming, REACH and the services directive."
"You have just signed it now, with the European flag behind you."
"In 2057 it is the pro-Europeans that people will remember and not those who wanted to stop this unstoppable idea."
"My heartfelt thanks go to the German Presidency. Thank you for your visit and for the excellent cooperation."
"Finally, thank you also to Wilhelm Sch√∂nfelder, who is sitting next to you and who has done a magnificent job representing the Federal Republic of Germany for all of these years."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Mr Schulz."
"If the Parliament President were permitted to express approval, he would have done so now."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - President-in-Office, congratulations on a green light for Europe and a grand legacy for your leadership."
"Action on climate change and energy security had made yours a noteworthy Presidency."
"Securing agreement for reform of our Union has made it a great Presidency."
"Joseph Conrad once observed 'Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it consists principally in dealing with men'."
"(Laughter)"
"Nowhere was this truer than in the Council, where many of your counterparts seemed intent on burying Treaty reform."
"It is a tribute to your character that you convinced, cajoled, and cautioned agreement where none had seemed possible."
"Who in the months following 2005's referendum results would have thought that institutional reform was still within reach; that Europe's leaders would recognise the need for common action on energy security, climate change, foreign policy or shelve requirements for unanimity in the Council in favour of qualified majority voting in 36 new policy areas?"
"We are pleased too that you recognised Europe's growing political pluralism by giving Parliament three representatives at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"Combined with making justice and home affairs subject to parliamentary scrutiny, this proves that European democracy has come of age and that this House is now an equal partner in governance."
"Agreement came at a price, however, and that price was not simply a derogation here and an opt-out there."
"The real casualty was idealism: losing the symbols of our Union and replacing the relative simplicity of the Constitutional Treaty with bureaucratic opaqueness is a pity."
"As a result, your new Amending Treaty reads like the instructions for building a Japanese pagoda translated into English by the Chinese middle-man."
"(Laughter and applause)"
"As for the content, President-in-Office, the devil will be in the detail."
"Your propensity to play the fairy godmother means, I am afraid, that the naysayers - die Verfassungsfeinde heissen sie immer noch in Bayern - were rewarded in proportion to their negativity, while the friends of the Constitution - the silent majority - received precious little for supporting the Constitution signed by all Member States in Rome."
"(Applause)"
"And so the French and the Dutch struck again with a side-swipe at fair and open markets."
"The full effects of the British and Polish derogation from the Charter of Fundamental Rights are not yet known."
"For Liberals and Democrats it beggars belief that a British Prime Minister is depriving UK citizens of the rights which made his country respected - and which are now guaranteed to other citizens - in order to pander to the popular press."
"(Loud applause)"
"Only time will tell whether the changes to the text are cosmetic, or a wholesale attack on Europe's fundamental civic and market values."
"However, politics is always a matter of bricolage."
"While the result is not flawless, the edifice you have built is sturdy: the roof should not leak as long as the building blocks of progress are cemented by the mortar of determination."
"Let us remind national leaders here and now that Europe demands give as well as take."
"Until they resolve to cooperate fully, the Union will never be fit for purpose."
"President-in-Office, six months is barely long enough for an EU President to shine."
"However, as the leader who brought us the promise of a permanent President your reign was memorable."
"Who else can boast of ending deadlock in the Council and ridding us of the much-maligned pillar structure?"
"Who else can claim credit for creating a European Diplomatic Service and a High Representative to boost our role on the world stage, and who else would have achieved so much without action which was hart aber herzlich?"
"The Portuguese Presidency must harness this momentum to ensure future developments are driven not by events beyond our continent, but, in the best tradition of the European Union, by idealism within."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that the almost lunatic position of the social-democratic President against the democratically elected Polish Government threatens to somewhat overshadow this joyful occasion, a day on which the goodwill of all concerned has brought us to an agreement, I would above all like to thank Chancellor Merkel, to whom we are all sincerely grateful, for her efforts."
"We recognise that the President has got our institutions back into gear, and as Parliament we also appreciate President Sarkozy's mediation over the last few days."
"As a former member of the European Convention, I would like to emphasise certain points to which we remain opposed: the reduction of the composition of the Commission, the absence of certain key rights of the family and children in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the absence of references to our roots and the failure to mention the symbols that have identified the Union up to now."
"The flag, the anthem and the motto hold symbolic value for our citizens; it is dangerous to abandon them in an era of mass immigration and the loss of core values."
"The Union is not and must not be a State; it is a communion of States, and requires visual symbols to represent it."
"If we separate social policy from trade and monetary policy, we increase the risk of a Europe that, as in previous treaties, concerns itself with tractor windscreen wipers, but is incapable of playing a decisive role in creating wider prosperity both within and outside of the Union."
"I welcome the increase in the power of the European Parliament, whose duty it is to restore in citizens and political groups the ability to defend national and regional traditions, combining them with wider Western culture."
"Cooperation in legal and criminal matters must result in harmonisation of trial times and elimination of reduced sentences for serious crimes against security."
"There is an immediate need for migration policy - the Mediterranean countries of the Union can be left on their own no longer!"
"For this reason we applaud the increased support for Frontex."
"Strengthening relations between the Union and Africa means overcoming poverty, terrorist organisations and the ever more worrying synergy between the Islamic radicalism of Iran and Hezbollah, which threatens both moderate and secular Islam and the West."
"We are therefore grateful, Mrs Merkel, for what you have achieved, and we would renew our request: today, there is also a need for a Charter of Duties; duties and rights cannot be separated!"
"I am sorry, Hans-Gert, it is only me!"
"(Laughter)"
"Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, the result is okay; it is even very good."
"In plain language we have to say that the German Presidency - together with all those who wanted to move Europe forward - has managed to move Europe forward."
"The script is fine, but the soundtrack was awful."
"It was too painful to listen to."
"I want to stress one point: on the one hand our citizens are reassured that Europe can act and make decisions, but the citizens of Europe have also been excluded from the process and in the longer term this will prove untenable."
"We cannot build Europe unless our citizens help to shape the construction process."
"If we continue as we are then at some point the edifice will crumble, like so many of our childhood dreams."
"To keep the image, Europe is experiencing a midlife crisis."
"Somehow, thanks to some very skilful manoeuvring from a handful of people, success was achieved."
"Incidentally, in France you get the impression that Sarkozy was the only one at the Summit, and no one else."
"It is very good to hear the plaudits being shared out more widely today."
"On another point: something happened that we Greens cannot accept and that we will oppose to the end."
"It is not possible to opt out of a Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Either we have one or we do not."
"Surely it is absurd to say that we have a Charter of Fundamental Rights with common values that applies in some places and does not apply in others."
"We might go to Mr Putin and say: we are a Community of values."
"Mr Putin and the Chinese will counter: except for where you are not!"
"This is impossible."
"(Applause)"
"Over the next few years we want a process to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights part of the European Union."
"Every British citizen and every Polish citizen is entitled to the same rights as any other European citizen."
"If that is not the case then we are offering the State concerned a privileged partnership."
"With Europe you are either in or out."
"Let us put an end to this nonsense!"
"I am firmly convinced that we are facing challenges that we will not be able to overcome as individual nations."
"These national ritualistic chants that we have at Summit meetings pour poison on our plans."
"Each nation must decide through its government whether it wants to be on board or not."
"The good thing about this Treaty is that at some point there will be a withdrawal clause."
"We are not forced to stay together for ever."
"Anyone who does not wish to does not have to."
"The tyranny of a veto-wielding minority is as undemocratic as it gets."
"That is why, Madam President-in-Office, it was certainly impressive to see how you, a woman, dealt with those machos like Blair."
"I am not only talking about the twins, because Tony Blair was the one who took an axe to our project."
"Despite everything already being signed and sealed he came back and said: I cannot."
"One of the few things that I have learnt in politics is that once something is signed there is no turning back."
"What is more, the issues that were being disputed had already been resolved in the Convention, including the scope of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Anyone who goes back on that shows that they do not take Europe seriously."
"The most tragic, saddest aspect of all of this is that there are governments that do not take Europe seriously."
"You are right, Martin, they want to milk Europe and at the same time they want to eat the cow, sell it."
"We cannot tolerate this and that is why we Greens will be holding a campaign called: We want our rights back!"
"(Loud applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (FR) Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, my group will have the opportunity to return in detail to the various important dimensions of the future treaty that you mentioned."
"I should like to confine myself today to just one issue that the President-in-Office of the Council has not mentioned."
"What, in practice, is going to change the decision taken by the 27 to withdraw free and undistorted competition from the list of the EU's objectives?"
"Because one of two things is true: either the European leaders believe that this is merely a communications exercise designed to reassure, at little cost, the people of Europe, a growing number of whom see this obsession with competition as one of the reasons for the erosion of the social acquis, for the rapid growth in job insecurity and, vice versa, for the explosion in dividends; or this is a serious matter and, therefore, we absolutely must know what its practical implications are."
"Those behind the first theory have solid arguments to draw on."
"Firstly, the framework principle of an open market economy in which there is free competition appears on numerous occasions in the parts of the current treaty that will be replicated as they stand."
"Secondly, a protocol specially devoted to reaffirming competition policy has been adopted by the European Council itself and will be included in the final text."
"Finally, some of the provisions of the treaty that are based on the principle in question have not been amended in any way whatsoever."
"It follows, then, that, despite the impact made by the European Council, there will be nothing new under the sun in this regard."
"If there is nothing new, I believe that this will be a case of disgraceful deceit on the part of the Heads of State or Government who, in the eyes of many of our fellow citizens, are still pushing for a pluralist public debate on the future treaty as a whole, or the double treaty as a whole, a debate that would culminate in an EU-wide referendum."
"I shall therefore listen very carefully to your explanations on this subject, Mrs Merkel."
"What is going to change in relation to free competition, and will these changes affect the substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty or not?"
"In any case, I call on all those who are sensitive to this issue to take the European leaders at their word: free competition is not your aim - let us see if it is not!"
"The first, imminent, test will be the fate in store for the draft directive on the opening up to competition of all postal services."
"In countries such as Sweden, in which this liberalisation is under way, it clearly has unfavourable consequences for employment and social and territorial cohesion, two areas that remain objectives of the Union."
"Logically, then, this directive should be withdrawn or rejected."
"Let us meet in July for this test of truth."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, we have come to know Chancellor Merkel as a charming, efficient, diplomatic and convincing version of Bismarck."
"Chancellor Merkel, you united Europe under German leadership, letting it look as though Poland was the problem."
"The Polish twins helped you by mentioning the war."
"Many Germans were also the victims of Nazi Germany."
"The argument is not valid."
"But from 2017, it is you who can govern the EU with Turkey."
"Poland did not gain or lose."
"The losers are the 21 small and medium-sized countries."
"My country's strength has been halved."
"You doubled German influence, why blame Poland for that?"
"Will you always accept one citizen, one vote?"
"Will you accept this principle in the United Nations with India and China?"
"Would you give India and China 15 votes for one German vote?"
"The Polish proposal is not Polish at all."
"It was presented by Sweden, and invented by a British mathematician."
"Is it not also used in the German Bundesrat?"
"In Nice, Poland got 27 votes because Chirac would not allow Germany to have more votes than France."
"Poland is now offering to reduce its share from 27 to 6, allowing you to have 9 votes instead of 29."
"Shame on those 21 governments that criticised Poland for arguing their interests, plus the general interest, in an understandable system."
"Nice is difficult; the Merkel deal is impossible."
"If you succeed in ratification, your name will be forever linked to an EU which cannot be understood by the public."
"Who can remember figures of populations changing every year?"
"Who can count if a law is passed without having a computer?"
"A double majority sounds easy but it is very difficult to use."
"The Penrose system is much easier and fairer."
"It could be further simplified by giving Germany six votes, France, the UK and Italy five, Poland four, then we would only have 81 votes together, and most of us could remember all the figures in our heads."
"Just like you can in the German Bundesrat!"
"A more just system would be to give all Member States one vote each, and require the support of 75% of the Member States in the Council plus a simple majority in the European Parliament."
"The American Senate does not take votes according to the size of the State."
"Why here, and why make it look as though Poland is a thief?"
"The new system is also as bad for German voters."
"It moves the legislative function into executive and judging powers."
"We go backwards in history from Montesquieu to Merkel and Machiavelli."
"It adds to the democratic deficit."
"(Applause from the IND/DEM Group)"
"The core in democracy is the ability to hold elections, have a new majority and then new laws."
"This core will now be further eroded."
"The Constitution will have another name but the same content, therefore it should also be subject to referendums."
"Six proponents and four opponents of the Constitution have sent an open letter to you calling for referendums."
"77% of all Europeans want a referendum; only 20% are against - and we know all of them, they are ministers!"
"Listen to your own German citizens who want to be heard by referendum."
"Sign the petition for a referendum in all EU Member States at the xO9.eu website."
"(DE) Madam Chancellor, as someone who hails from North Schleswig I have other reasons to hold you in high esteem, and I should like to thank you very much for your commitment to the debate on climate change."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mrs Merkel, you will have to excuse me for the fact that I too have chosen to opt out of the jubilant mood that prevails in this House following the agreement that was reached at the European Summit."
"I will not be expecting then any kisses from Mr Schulz or Mr Cohn-Bendit, but I think I will live."
"What was predicted has come to pass: the so-called reform treaty has turned out to be nothing more and nothing less than a camouflaged version of the European Constitution, in other words, we are getting old wine in new bottles."
"The reform treaty does not create more transparency."
"In fact, the text has become more incomprehensible than ever before."
"Nothing fundamental is being done about the democratic deficit."
"There is no mention of referendums in the Member States; the role which the national parliaments will be playing will, in practice, be non-existent given the high threshold that is being built in; the European Union's boundaries are not any closer to being defined."
"Even the Dutch proposal to include the Copenhagen criteria in the text has been thrown out."
"The typically Belgian compromise - if I can put it this way - about the decision-making process takes no account of the fact that the smaller Member States will lose out in terms of influence."
"Finally, European legislation clearly prevails over national legislation."
"I can assure you, Mrs Merkel, that the triumphalism will be short-lived."
"People are refusing to take the referendums in France and the Netherlands into account."
"If this is the upshot of a two-year period of reflection, then I am bound to say that this is a deeply sad state of affairs."
"The triumphalism will be short-lived if no new referendums are held therefore."
"In the other Member States too, the distrust of the people will only increase, because the EU's democratic support base has become very flimsy."
"There is an enormous chasm between European officialdom and the man in the street - this is, in fact, also borne out by Turkey's possible accession to the European Union - and I regret having to affirm, Mrs Merkel, that you have not taken any initiatives either in order to close the gap between the citizen and public opinion in one way or another."
"Whatever happens, something will need to be done as a matter of urgency."
"It is high time the European Union started to take public opinion in Europe into account."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, the German presidency truly got Europe moving."
"Unfortunately, however, not in the direction of a prosperous Union within the global economy, but rather towards something more reminiscent of the regime of Fidel Castro."
"It is all too clear from the conclusions of the Brussels summit that the Union wishes to preserve its excessively costly and inefficient social systems."
"It is also clear that the leaders of the EU states still believe in the dream of full employment and stable prices."
"And thirdly, the Union has again retreated by another step from its founding principle, from free economic competition without barriers."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you to take heed of the fact that the suppression of free economic competition, which is the driving force of the European economy, constitutes a serious warning to all democratically-minded citizens."
"It is only a small step from the trampling-upon of freedoms in the area of commerce to the trampling-upon of fundamental human rights and freedoms."
"The outcome of the German presidency is not, in my view, a courageous and challenging path to prosperity, but rather the easy path of populism, which leads straight to the hell of institutional autocracy."
"The debate is closed."
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Membership of Parliament"
"The French authorities have informed us that Mrs Marie-Line Reynaud, Mr Pierre Moscovici and Mr Jean-Claude Fruteau have been elected to the French National Assembly."
"Under Article 7(2) of the Act of 20 September 1976 as amended on 25 June and 23 September 2002 these Members have had incompatible mandates since 26 June 2007, the date of the constituent sitting of the French National Assembly."
"Since the election of Mrs Reynaud and Mr Moscovici has been disputed and the deadline for disputing the election of Mr Fruteau is not until 28 June, and since the French Constitutional Court has to take decisions on the disputes as soon as possible, I suggest postponing the establishment of the vacancies concerned until the proceedings before the Constitutional Court have come to an end."
"Given that their mandates have been incompatible since 26 June 2007, Mrs Reynaud, Mr Moscovici and Mr Fruteau may not at present take part in the business of the European Parliament and its bodies."
"In addition, I note that the office of Vice-President, hitherto held by Mr Pierre Moscovici, has, with his agreement, now fallen vacant."
"In view of the exceptional nature of the situation, I propose to refer the matter to the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"European Council meeting of 21-22 June 2007 Activity report of the German Presidency (continuation of debate)"
"The next item is the continuation of the joint debate on"
"the European Council report and Commission statement: European Council meeting of 21-22 June 2007 and"
"the Council statement: activity report of the German Presidency."
"(DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate shows just how powerful the European idea is and how much it unites us at times of crisis, even across party lines, giving us the strength to say what needs to be said."
"I am a Christian Democrat, but I should like to express my unreserved support for the words of my fellow Member, the Social Democrat, Martin Schulz."
"I should like to support every sentence. As a German, I recall the final speech that the French President, Fran√ßois Mitterand, made to this Parliament in 1995."
"He said: nationalism leads to war."
"This is Europe's strength, which we must preserve through thick and thin: a Europe that defends peace prosperity and social security."
"Above all, however, I should like to thank the Council Presidency and you personally, Mrs Merkel."
"You faced a mammoth task and you succeeded."
"Not all of our hopes have been realised, but the substance of the proposals has been maintained both in climate and energy policy and where the reform Treaty is concerned."
"You have succeeded in extending Parliament's rights, ensuring that European law continues to take precedence, strengthening subsidiarity in many areas, clarifying the delimitation of competences and much more besides."
"Questions have also been asked about the principle of competition. We will have to take a closer look at the implications."
"Overall I believe that the German Presidency has been successful on the two most important points: it has been successful in implementing many initiatives in the ongoing programme, and it has cooperated in exemplary fashion with the European Parliament."
"For this too, I should like to thank you personally, Dr Merkel, together with all the members of the German Government and the German Representation."
"(Applause)"
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!"
"Well done, Mrs Merkel, warm congratulations!"
"You have fulfilled your obligations as President of the Council."
"The European Parliament had asked you to convene an Intergovernmental Conference and to resume the European Union's journey towards a constitution, a journey that has brought us peace and prosperity that now offers the globalised world a model of democracy and solidarity."
"After a two-year period of reflection, the majority of the states and citizens came out in favour of forging ahead towards Europe's future."
"Despite many abrogations, which I hope will not upset the EU's cohesion, we have helped those who had difficulties with the treaty."
"We now have to prepare a mandate for this reform treaty, and we believe that is a good thing."
"It contains a clear commitment to the principles, values and objectives of the EU."
"In my opinion, the legally binding nature of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be enshrined in the treaty immediately after the preamble."
"The extension of codecision and qualified majority voting are also positive aspects."
"I nevertheless regret that clarity and transparency have been lost."
"The symbols, the flag and the anthem also bear witness to the joy and freedom in Europe that Beethoven and Schiller emphasised."
"I can assure you that we will continue to use these symbols and hold them up with genuine pride."
"In this conviction, President-in-Office, we will now in the Intergovernmental Conference work together with the national parliaments and civil society to strengthen the European Union constitutionally."
"We will continue to fight on this road, which Walter Hallstein described as constructio continua, and which Jean Monnet spoke of as 'step by step'."
"And like sherpas, step by step, we will climb the Himalayas."
"Thank you very much, Mr Bar√≥n Crespo."
"(DE) President-in-Office, Mr President, my sincere congratulations on your excellent work, Madam Chancellor."
"You have achieved a very good result, you have fulfilled expectations."
"That is no great surprise to the German liberals, because even before the Bundestag elections we were convinced you would make a good leader; I am just saying this for the benefit of Mr Schulz, who said so in effusive terms today, but better late than never."
"Before the German Presidency began, the Free Democrats in the European Parliament had urged the at the time still very hesitant Federal Government to set an ambitious target regarding the constitutional treaty."
"We are therefore pleased that at the end of your presidency we not only have a timetable, but that the contents have been agreed as well."
"However, the price that had to be paid for that is extremely high."
"Names have been changed, longer time periods set, derogations allowed."
"With the Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular that is a real disaster."
"The so-called reform treaty is more complex and less transparent."
"A minority has had its way at the majority's expense and the idea of Europe has suffered a severe blow as a result."
"Whether the decisions that were taken in Brussels in the middle of the night will now actually be implemented remains an open question."
"There is no guarantee that they will."
"The Intergovernmental Conference must meet first and then things will not get moving until ratification begins in the 27 countries."
"Everything is therefore still open."
"The outcome of the German Presidency is therefore a fairly realistic reflection of the current mood within the EU."
"It is not abysmal, but it is nothing to celebrate either."
"What we have is the remote Europe of summits, not the close Europe of citizens."
"In view of the difficulties that would have made an outcome almost impossible, the Presidency has taken us a good step forwards."
"More would have been impossible."
"Mrs Merkel, you have said how you would like Europe's citizens to remember the year 2007 in 50 years' time."
"I would like to add one hope to that: it would please me very much if in 2057 - and I might just live so long - all Europeans were to see the wonderful sentence of the Berlin Declaration 'we have united for the better' not as a decision taken in a back room but as something they experience every day."
"That would be a tremendous success for your Presidency."
"My sincere thanks once again!"
"(Applause)"
"A Uachtar√°in, A Uachtar√°in in Oifig na Comhairle, A Uachtar√°in an Choimisi√∫in, comhghairdeachas leis an Seansail√©ir Merkel agus leis na daoine go l√©ir i rialtas na Gearm√°ine."
"First of all I should like to say that, when we speak of the results of the last week's summit, so much time and effort is given to reported emotions in the media or to the interpretation of what one person said to another, whereas the reality should be that we celebrate the success of the ability of all the leaders of all the Member States of the European Union to follow the leadership given by the German Chancellor, the President-in-Office, Angela Merkel, in finding and charting a way forward for the future development of the European Union."
"In particular, because of the sensitivities that are involved in so many areas, whether it is the issue of votes in the Council, the rights of national parliaments or codecision in the area of justice and home affairs, these are fundamental points that are of national importance to those countries and it would be wrong for any leader of any government to fail to put forward their concerns with regard to those areas."
"However, despite the hot wind that blows around many of these summits, success was achieved and it was achieved because the core principles of the European Union - i.e. compromise, consensus, understanding and tolerance - were brought together under your great stewardship, Chancellor Merkel."
"The other areas in which the German Presidency has succeeded over the last six months are ones that we will benefit from in the future - and I say 'we' not just to mean those of us in Parliament: we as citizens and consumers within the European Union will be able to benefit from the work you have done."
"(DE) Madam Chancellor, you have accomplished a hard task in difficult times."
"Thank you."
"Apologies for my German!"
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance I would like to underline once again what the chairman of my group has already said: it was a great weight off our minds when the outcome of the summit became known, and we shared your relief and your pleasure one hundred percent."
"We were not surprised at Mr Prodi's disappointment either, however, because during this summit it of course became clear how everything was touch and go and what national egoisms actually threaten Europe."
"In the days that followed - and in fact even during the summit itself - it struck me from reports and interviews about this difficult situation that in the light of this loss of further integration, which was also the subject of the summit, many people actually began to think positively about Europe again."
"Basically, this is something quite simple: you only really understand what you have had when it is taken away from you."
"Sometimes you only realise when it is too late, but this time it happened just in time."
"I am extremely grateful for your negotiating skill, because I believe you were able to play very skilfully on simple matters such as how people tick and work in this Europe that is bequeathed to us."
"There is also something I would like, however."
"You have succeeded in bringing people closer to Europe again."
"I would also like to see this transparency, the public nature of the summit, in the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We should not allow this distance to occur and shut people out again."
"I believe that would even help us in Poland, where we have the support of 80% of the population."
"I thank you and wish you much success for the future!"
"(DE) Mr President, like many on the Left in Europe, I cannot approve of anything that encourages nationalism and makes it even more difficult to use the European Union's resources to solve social, ecological and global problems."
"I am therefore a supporter of European integration aimed at a federal European Union with of course a federal constitution, but one with other principles, other priorities and other objectives."
"I, too, owe you my respect, Mrs Merkel."
"You have succeeded in giving a broad public the impression that the Brussels compromise is your masterstroke."
"In many respects, however, the compromise is a continuation of the same old things."
"It brings no major change in policy, only a seemingly better design."
"The rejection of the draft constitution in France and the Netherlands at the time was rooted not in fear of a superstate but in fear of a Europe that was not a social Europe, and you have probably done nothing to allay that fear with the compromise reached in Brussels, the half measures, the postponed problems and the jostling for power we saw over the weighting of votes."
"That is why we continue to demand referenda in the EU Member States - on this treaty too."
"There is absolutely no reason to fear that if, as the most recent surveys show, the majority of Europe's citizens are in favour of Europe."
"If this treaty is a good treaty, there is also a good chance that the majority of the population will support it."
"- (SK) Madam Chancellor, I too would like to join the ranks of those who have been congratulating you, and who appreciate the agreement you have achieved over the question of Europe's future."
"The Treaty establishing the Constitution may have been signed in Rome with great fanfare by the Heads of State, but the period which came next proved that these Heads of State had simply made a pleasant excursion for the purposes of signing a meaningless piece of paper."
"Their signatures did not have the backing of a popular vote, as became apparent later in the sorrowful period of ratifications and referenda in various Member States."
"This period revealed all of Europe's common weaknesses."
"For that reason alone your success in the negotiations and your skills in achieving compromise deserve high regard."
"Madam Chancellor, it is for you that the fanfares should be heard today."
"After the signing, I believe that our efforts as MEPs will be motivated by a vision of cooperation, and not a struggle between the old 15 and the new Member States."
"I am sure we will succeed in weeding out each and every point of ambiguity in the Treaty."
"Finally, I would like to wish you a very pleasant holiday - because you certainly deserve it."
"Mr President, Chancellor, President Barroso, I am not going to try my German out today."
"Others have done it much better than I could."
"As the German Presidency comes to an end, I start by congratulating the Chancellor on her very successful pursuit of the climate change agenda over the past six months."
"The European Council Agreement in March regarding targets for a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, compared to 1990, was a historic one and we in the British Conservative Party particularly support this initiative very strongly."
"As to the European Council last weekend, we have heard many different interpretations about the outcome of the Summit."
"In the United Kingdom, reactions to the outcome have not, of course, been universally supportive."
"Prime Minister Blair, who leaves 10 Downing Street today, maintains that the draft reform Treaty bears little resemblance to the constitutional text that preceded it."
"Yet many of his fellow Heads of Government have contradicted him: the Irish Taoiseach and Finland's Europe Minister have said so, for instance - indeed the latter has said that there is nothing from the original institutional package that has been changed."
"So when our Prime Minister says that the two cannot be readily compared, I think the British people can be forgiven for feeling doubtful about what the British Government has actually signed."
"As Mr Blair promised the people of Britain a referendum in his last election manifesto, I really do believe it is incumbent upon his successor, Gordon Brown, to uphold that pledge."
"Chancellor, I would also like to have one area of clarification on the point about the wide reports that the pursuit by the EU of free and undistorted competition has been undermined in the draft mandate for the IGC."
"I also hear, however, that a protocol has now been annexed to make clear that the Union is indeed totally committed to competition and free markets."
"There are reports that the German Finance Minister was himself concerned at the change."
"He is quoted as saying, 'I see this with a certain scepticism. If things go on like this, I see a risk'."
"To many British people, the internal market and a genuinely competitive economy form a vital basis for their support for Britain's membership of the Union, and they would rightly be concerned at any attempt to undermine that."
"I would be most grateful if the Chancellor could give reassurances to me on that point."
"(FR) Mr President, it is true that it is difficult to resist the temptation to congratulate the Chancellor, and, I may add, I am not resisting it."
"Mrs Merkel, I congratulate you, even though I will remain more doubtful of the future treaty itself."
"At the end of the day, however, the reform of the treaties was at a standstill, Europe was stuck in a rut, its unity had been tested, and you gave it another chance."
"The agreement passed on 23 June in Brussels is a complicated compromise, one that was reached after much effort in a Council that is marked more by the national tensions of some than by the universal sharing of the European spirit; a compromise reached at the expense of the ridiculous relinquishment of the EU symbols and of the appalling opt-out on the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"However, this is at least an agreement that has come at a time when Europe needs to affirm its unity and its desire to move forward so as to meet the citizens' expectations and to rise to the challenges it faces in the world and within Europe."
"Every opportunity must therefore be given to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference."
"As for the treaty itself, we will be able to give a definitive judgment on it only after we have seen the final text that will be derived from it."
"Doubts remain, but the mandate does at least have the virtue of taking up the institutional innovations that were contained in the first part of the draft constitution and that have scarcely been challenged, even in countries in which the 'No' vote prevailed in the referendum."
"I am referring to the enhanced powers of the European Parliament, to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, to the new majority decision-making rules and to the shift to unanimity on a number of issues and, therefore, from this point of view, I hope that the outcome will make it possible for the progress contained in the draft Constitution to be confirmed."
"Having said that, there are two points that I should like to highlight as being important to our group and that concern the European Union's social dimension."
"On the one hand, there was an article on the horizontal social clause and, on the other, an article providing a legal basis for the adoption of a directive on services of general economic interest."
"On these two points, the mandate of the Intergovernmental Conference remains vague."
"We will be very vigilant when it comes to ensuring that, after having renounced the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Member States gathered within the IGC do not further undermine these two possible advances in the social dimension of the European treaties."
"President-in-Office, thank you for bringing some real politics to the European Council."
"In three days' time you will be free of the Presidency and be able to advance German policy with great self-confidence across the European stage."
"Could you assure us that Germany will always fight to combat the version of pick-and-choose Europe that is Tony Blair's sad legacy?"
"My view is that it is sensible now to put into practice the closer cooperation revisions that we see inside the Treaty."
"You spoke of the African proverb which says that you go faster by yourself, but you go further with others."
"The problem is that if you stick to the British Government's approach, we will simply continue to go around in circles."
"Show the way forward, break out of the corral, and the more timid and conservative partners will follow."
"- PL Mr President, Chancellor, I would like to begin by commenting on the speech given by Mr Schulz, who has presumed to lecture and offend the democratically elected government of Poland, whose stance in these negotiations is even supported by the opposition, and therefore enjoys the support of the vast majority of the Polish people, which Mr Schulz has decided to affront."
"This is something this House cannot approve of."
"As far as the German Presidency is concerned, I would like to say that right from the outset its aim has clearly been to put the European Community's affairs in order."
"Unfortunately it has made its priority the resurrection of the Constitutional Treaty which had already been rejected in referendums in France and Holland."
"In spite of this, its greatest success has been to convince the heads of 27 governments and states to agree to sign the watered-down version of the treaty."
"It is, however, the style of the negotiations that has aroused concern, taking as it does the form of blackmail against states with a diverging point of view."
"Let us hope that this will not become the norm in relations between EU Member States."
"I would like to take this opportunity to ask President Merkel what the legal status of the Constitutional Treaty is in Germany, where it was not signed by the president, and whether it is true that when votes are counted in the German Bundesrat, they use a variant of the equal influence system - the very system that was so vigorously attacked during the summit."
"Mr President, you have described the new Treaty as retaining the substance of the Constitution."
"Chancellor Merkel agreed with that today."
"Commissioner Wallstr√∂m said that it was essentially the same proposal as the old Constitution, and governments across Europe have described it as 99% the same."
"You and they, Mr President, are right!"
"Yet there is one leader - correction, erstwhile leader, Tony Blair - who pretends it is something totally different."
"Why?"
"So that he can con the people of the United Kingdom out of the referendum he promised them because he knows he cannot win it."
"The shameless dissembling of the British Government, however, will not deceive the British people, because we know that when a Treaty looks like a constitution, when it talks like a constitution, and when it would walk us like a constitution into a stronger stranglehold of control from Brussels, then it is a constitution, howsoever you might deceptively describe it."
"That is why the people of the United Kingdom still demand a referendum, and anything less would be a cheat."
"Mr President, I have brought a cube with me, which shows the flag of the European Union - the 12 stars."
"It was manufactured in Germany, invented by a Hungarian and consists of 27 pieces."
"I have brought it just to remind us how difficult this Treaty is to put together."
"Just like the cube, it should bear the symbols, it should have a message and be a keystone and a foundation for our joint European building, but, at the same time, it is made up of 27 pieces."
"So this is how I congratulate the German Presidency on putting these 27 pieces together again, because there are big and small pieces - not every piece is the same."
"This cube is not always so beautiful, because you can see the division lines."
"However, from now on this could be kept as a good foundation stone."
"I should like to add that the word 'fragile' should be written on its box."
"All of us in the European Parliament and in the Council have to take great care to keep this cube together."
"I am very happy that Europe is finally trying to swallow what it could not swallow for several years."
"In that sense, it makes Europe stronger, because we all need something that could be a foundation stone."
"We need a common foreign policy, and joint action on fighting climate change and on guaranteeing human rights and minority rights without double standards."
"From that point of view, I really appreciate that a reference to minorities has not been omitted from the reform Treaty."
"However, I also deplore the missing elements, especially the reference that people wanted to leave out of the Treaty - the symbols of the European Union, the stars, the flags - or any reference to Christianity."
"This should not be done."
"Let us keep this cube together, and we must be careful because it is fragile."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, J√≥zsef Sz√°jer!"
"When we met for the first time, you gave me a piece of barbed wire with the Hungarian flag as a sign that the division of Europe had been overcome."
"That was a very beautiful symbol, and I have never forgotten it."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to take up what the previous speaker said."
"Perhaps we ought to show the flag more often now and play the anthem more often to show that these things cannot be lost, because they exist."
"We have fought for the substance to be preserved."
"It has been, and I believe that is a mark of success."
"More has been lost, however, than just the name and the symbols."
"It is after all clear that the reform treaty is something different from the constitutional treaty, because the vision of a political union, not only of a Europe of states but a citizens' Europe, is now even further from our grasp and it will be a long time before we can make a fresh attempt at a European constitution."
"On this point, Europe's opponents have won and the European federalists have lost."
"We must be quite clear about that."
"I also think that the simplified treaty is sadly still a complicated treaty."
"There is a loss of transparency."
"The citizens will not be able to identify so easily with the new product as they did with the Constitutional Treaty."
"Thirdly, I am concerned that distrust between the Member States, and also some Member States' distrust of the EU and its institutions, has grown."
"They all want to join, but they do not all want to join in. We will be watching very closely to see whether there are not only different speeds, but also different classes."
"Some evidently want to be second class."
"If that is what they want, then let them. They should not be able to block the others."
"That was an important stage that takes us forward."
"But it is not the end of the reform process, and the new treaty will for the first time allow this Parliament to make its own proposals for further reforms."
"I have no doubt that, in the next legislative period, we will return to everything that has been left behind this time and that we will pursue the European Union's further development from this Chamber of Europe's citizens."
"(ES) Mr President, we must undoubtedly congratulate Chancellor Merkel and, in particular, the President of the European Commission, who is now having his second big success, following the approval of the financial perspective, because we have avoided a certain risk of crisis."
"Many Members of this House may have hoped for more, but we must acknowledge that this agreement is perfectly consistent with the Community method."
"I am convinced that we are going to carry on functioning perfectly well until 2014 or, in exceptional circumstances, for three further years, with the decision-making procedure adopted in Nice which, in the end - I would like to point out - was approved precisely in order to deal with enlargement."
"Furthermore, I hope that, in order to round off the institutional package, the twenty seats remaining in the European Parliament will be filled for the 2009 elections, naturally, and adhering strictly to the proportionality criteria, that is to say, that it be done in an entirely democratic way."
"Along the lines of the progress made in the field of justice and home affairs, I wonder whether the opportunity could be taken at the IGC to provide the European Counter-Terrorism Coordinator with content and duties."
"I believe that this post responds to an objective need and to a great sensitivity amongst the European citizens, as the latest Eurobarometer indicates."
"Incidentally, I am sure that the European Commission's services will ensure that the terrorist group ETA is called by its proper name."
"In the same vein, I am delighted by the mention in the final point of the conclusions of the peace process in Northern Ireland, but I am also surprised to see that there is not the least reference to the threat to the European citizens, and to the Spanish citizens in particular, represented by the breaking of ETA's ceasefire."
"Any opportunity to express the European institutions' solidarity with people whose freedom and lives are in danger every day is a good opportunity."
"(PL) Mr President, Chancellor, as the leader of the delegation of the Polish left in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, I am pleased to accept the compromise in accepting the mandate and the opening of the inter-governmental conference achieved during the European Council summit."
"The mandate adopted enables the new treaty to keep the most important institutional aspects of the constitutional treaty: the charter of fundamental rights, the extended competence of the European Parliament, the appointment of a European head of diplomacy and a note about European energy policy."
"I am pleased that the Polish Government has finally withdrawn from its concept of an 'equal influence' system, which was opposed by the other EU countries, and accepted a compromised."
"This was a wise decision."
"However, the negotiating methods of the Polish Government, which uses arguments alluding to the Second World War, sully the image of Poland and have threatened Polish-German relations, which have so far been good."
"Polish society's view of cooperation within the EU is different from the Polish Government's."
"Eighty percent of Poles support European integration, and I have no doubt that it was this view of Polish public opinion that brought about the compromise at the summit."
"Today, at a meeting with the Socialist Group, the Chancellor said that to her, relations with Poland are equally as important than relations with France, and misunderstandings are a thing of the past."
"I am grateful to her for these words."
"I call upon the Polish Government to collaborate actively with the other Member States to prepare the final version of the treaty in such a way that it can be implemented before the European Parliamentary elections in 2009."
"(applause)"
"(SV) I wish to thank and congratulate the German Presidency on what it has achieved in conjunction with the Commission."
"Through its work it has laid the foundation for a new Treaty."
"I would thank and congratulate the German Presidency not only on what has been achieved but also in the light of what it will be possible to achieve in the future."
"A new Treaty is not an end in itself."
"The need for a new Treaty has emerged from the successes of European cooperation: enlargement, which has led not only to more Member States and a stronger EU but also to more different national wills to manage; the internal market, which has given Europe a stronger economic role in the world; and political integration and foreign policy, which has given the EU greater responsibility in the world."
"All these developments have given rise to, and continue to increase, the need for a new Treaty."
"What is now becoming possible, however, also brings home the fact that it is not the treaties that are ends in themselves, but the action that may be taken on the basis of them."
"It is now becoming possible to deal with three issues that, especially given the historical background that we have, are more important than others."
"The first issue is that of climate and the need for an energy policy whereby the EU Member States can stand shoulder to shoulder in order to safeguard integrity and security."
"The second issue is that of the EU's future enlargement."
"The issue of enlargement is now once again emerging clearly as a topical issue which must be given further impetus by the governments of the Member States and by the Commission. It is the enlargements that have strengthened the EU and given it new tasks and that have given us a unique opportunity for peace and prosperity."
"In this area, the internal market too has played a decisive role."
"I would therefore point out that, instead of relating only to the economy, any calling into question of free and open competition also calls into question EU-wide equal opportunities for the Member States, individuals and companies."
"Anyone who brings these things into question ultimately brings into question the European Union's ability to bring people and nations together."
"I therefore wish to issue a clear and urgent request to the Commission, the German Presidency and future Presidencies: remove any doubt that secure, free and open competition must prevail for everyone in Europe."
"Competition gives rise to prosperity, freedom and new successes."
"(PT) Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, I too congratulate you, not only for the manner in which you conducted the Presidency of the Union, but also for the good results of the last Council."
"I am Portuguese and, regrettably, I do not speak German, but I do know how to say..."
"(DE) Thank you, Madam Chancellor Angela Merkel."
"(PT) The European Council has gone as far as it can, achieving a realistic compromise, in the words of Jacques Delors."
"It has not been easy."
"The heterogeneity of the problems and the diversity of interests encourage national egoism."
"An agreement was reached thanks to there being determination, negotiating skills and a sense of responsibility on the part of some European leaders, although not all, as we are aware."
"However, the finishing line is still a long and difficult way off."
"In these complex processes of collective editing, it is easy to trip over a comma or fall at a word."
"As my prime minister, Jos√© S√≥crates, says, we have a mandate, but not a Treaty."
"For there to be a Treaty, everyone must collaborate - the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament."
"A joint effort will be essential."
"Bearing in mind the complex international context and the legacy of the German Presidency, I am sure that the Portuguese Presidency will do its utmost to adequately address the mandate with which it has been entrusted."
"(FR) Mr President, Mrs Merkel, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, the European Council has decided to end the period of reflection, which therefore means that the European Union has finally found a cure for the paralysis from which it has been suffering for two years."
"Without an agreement among the 27, the Union would not just have remained at a standstill, it would probably have entered into a real crisis heralding a process whereby our collective project was taken apart, piece by piece."
"The mandate entrusted to the Intergovernmental Conference responsible for drawing up the draft treaty may not be ideal, but it is the fruit of a difficult compromise, gathering together Member States whose differences one feared had become intolerable."
"I should like to congratulate the German Presidency, and particularly you, Mrs Merkel, for your skill and clear-sightedness during the negotiations."
"I am also proud of the role played by France and by its President, Nicolas Sarkozy, whose initiative it was to have a simplified treaty dedicated to extricating Europe from a long-term stalemate and whose political will has been crucial."
"True, we may regret that the Community spirit has not been embraced by all our partners, but patience and time will no doubt enable us to complete our work."
"I am now looking forward to this Lisbon Treaty, the signing of which in October will perfectly symbolise the end of a particularly disenchanting episode of European integration."
"(PL) Mr President, what Europe needs is wise and balanced leadership, but what it needs more is joint action in important areas on the basis of the declared values that have become the mainstay of this Union."
"If the Union is treated as a common market, then profit would come before the main aims of the Union, and it would no longer be a Union, but a market-place."
"If the European Union is to some extent to be a cultural and political organism, then only 'more Europe', as Mr Barrosso often says, will contribute to the greater good of every Member State."
"One point, however: I believe that the 'equal influence' system proposed by Poland, to which it was entitled, would not be a bad thing for real democracy and community, and for the equality of citizens."
"The double majority system could be interpreted as a signal that the European Union will not be enlarged over the next few decades."
"(DE) Finally, I would like to express a wish to all of us and especially to the President-in-Office who was to show understanding for both parts of Europe: may you be an example to your successor of that effectiveness in negotiation that can only be achieved when the welfare and rights of every European nation, true community and equality of the citizens are top priority."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(DE) Mr President, it is an interesting state of affairs in the European Parliament when all the leaders are still here."
"I therefore thank you for the debate."
"I would just like to deal briefly with two points."
"Firstly, the question of the internal market and competition, which has been a great cause for concern here."
"We debated in the Council whether competition is one of our objectives."
"I believe competition is not an end but a means."
"That is why we removed it from the 'objectives' heading, but we have made absolutely clear in the protocol on the internal market and competition that we will be inserting that this means remains intact and its importance is undiminished, and the Commission has also made quite sure of that."
"So nothing has changed."
"Employment and prosperity are our objective, but our objective is not competition as such, it is a means."
"Secondly, a lot has been said about the voting system."
"For clarity I would like to repeat here once again: all possible forms of weighting, including root systems, are conceivable if you take them as the only form of voting."
"If we had been starting from scratch, we could have discussed them all."
"There is, however, a double majority, and this double majority brings the weighting between population and the 'one country, one vote' principle."
"Only this doubling makes the voting system acceptable, and we have probably now found a way that leads us back again to real international world problems and at the same time has a high level of fairness."
"I would like to conclude with a sincere thank you."
"I can report from our government that we had a cabinet meeting today in which we took stock, and that all the members of the government were proud to have conducted this Presidency with enthusiasm and great commitment, and that the Social Democrat just as much as the Christian Democrat members of the government have contributed to that."
"(Applause)"
"Secondly, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commission, to Jos√© Manuel Barroso and to all the Commissioners."
"We have worked together intensively and well, we have had friendly, tough conversations, often extending into the night, but we reached agreement and I believe the Commission and Council have come out of this Presidency stronger."
"I have enjoyed working with you personally, Jos√© Manuel, and I have also enjoyed working with the entire Commission and all its staff."
"Thank you very much!"
"My thanks are also due to the European Parliament."
"It is nice to debate in this Parliament, to feel the spirit of Europe and to accomplish many difficult tasks with the wind behind you - and with a bit of idealism that is perhaps found more often here than elsewhere."
"Because one thing is clear: where there is no more idealism there is only nationalism and clinging to your own vested interests."
"That does not get us anywhere and I therefore extend my sincere thanks to the entire European Parliament and especially to those who always helped us along."
"I will almost miss the cooperation, but one can always come here again as a visitor."
"Thank you very much!"
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Chancellor, Members of Parliament, I have nothing to add to what Chancellor Merkel has already said with regards to competition."
"I would just like to make it clear that the discussions resulted in the non-retention of a particular expression used in the Constitutional Treaty, but in no way alter the principles of competition present throughout the entire Community acquis; that is, the idea that competition is an essential tool for the internal market and an essential tool serving the well-being of the citizens."
"This point has been clarified and I think, from this point of view, we can consider ourselves quite satisfied with the results of this European Council."
"I would just like very quickly to underline one more point."
"The results of this European Council which, in fact, were extremely positive, now mean that we have an even greater responsibility."
"Let us consider for a moment where we would be today if we had not had this success."
"Prior to the European Council, I was untiring in my efforts to draw attention to our great responsibility in terms of credibility."
"How could we Europeans say to the world that we were being serious when we talked about energy safety and the fight against climate change and when we promoted increased employment, if we were unable to resolve the institutional question?"
"This result has been achieved but, as has already been emphasised, we have a mandate, which is excellent, but we still do not have the Treaty."
"This is why we must now all demonstrate the same responsibility so that, during the Portuguese presidency, if possible during the Extraordinary Council in October, we can achieve a Treaty to resolve the institutional question that is of such importance to the Union, allowing us to continue with our agenda for the benefit of the citizens, promoting increased employment and investing further in innovation."
"I would remind you that innovation should be a priority, not only in theory but also in practice, as indeed should all the other objectives of the renewed Lisbon Strategy."
"There is, therefore, a vast potential for achieving results to the benefit of Europe and European citizens."
"And this is precisely why we need to provide the European Union with the Institutions that will give us the capability to act."
"I am absolutely convinced that we are in a better position today to achieve these objectives than we were some time ago."
"For this reason, I would like once again to congratulate the German Presidency and all those who contributed to this result."
"It may not be an exaggeration to further emphasise the excellent institutional cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, and also the fact that this is the first time that, from start to finish, an agreement has been reached by twenty-seven Member States, that is, the longest-standing members and the newest members."
"The negotiations were difficult at times, but the truth is that an agreement was reached, and this point should be underlined as being very positive."
"Thank you, President of the Commission."
"Experience has shown that all three Institutions have always gone in the same direction for Europe."
"Tomorrow, the chairmen of the political groups will be in Lisbon to discuss with the future presidency how things should proceed."
"Thank you all for your participation."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"Last week's political agreement on convening an Intergovernmental Conference and on the basic principles of the reform Treaty is a major compromise, but one that everyone can accept."
"The reform Treaty has got Europe back on track, and has averted a more serious and drawn-out crisis on the European scene."
"The reform Treaty is essential if the European Union and its institutions are to be capable of acting, and it is indispensable in view of further enlargement."
"The principle of double majority in the decision-making process suitably balances and counterbalances the interests of the large and small countries."
"The European Parliament is the unquestionable winner in these reforms, since the expansion of its legislative scope places its political weight alongside that of the Council."
"Those in support of the Constitutional Treaty cannot forget, however, that symbols are of enormous significance."
"Those in favour of integration were not seeking to create a European superstate, but wished to strengthen the common, or if you prefer, the supranational will in the legislative and decision-making process."
"An example was set by the nine, among them Hungary, in representing the most important values in the constitution, including among others the retention of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the safeguarding of minority rights."
"The political storms that raged in the Council have, moreover, taught us the very important lesson that in the decisions of the 27-member European Union, there are times when the positions of the countries in the Central and Eastern European region can, on account of their still undigested historical past, be integrated only at the expense of serious compromises."
"It is precisely for this reason that the time has come for the Central and Eastern European Member States to begin, with the participation of Europe, to deal with their historical wounds."
"This is the only way to ensure that the politics of victimhood does not prevail in the region or in individual countries."
"in writing. - The package agreed by the 27 governments last weekend salvaged many of the practical institutional reforms that were contained in the constitutional treaty."
"However, it also dropped many key features: the notion of a 'Constitution'; the loss of the title and status of 'Foreign Minister'; the fact that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not be spelt out visibly in full in the treaty, and not be enforceable in British courts; the removal of the symbols (flag and anthem); the abandonment of changes on legal terminology (where 'regulations' and 'directives' would have been called 'laws' and 'framework laws'); the postponement of and changes to the new voting weights in the Council; and various derogations given to individual Member States, such as the UK."
"These will be seen by the European Parliament as major sacrifices, but they are necessary to secure ratification of the package by all 27 countries."
"in writing. - (PT) The mandate for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) to amend the treaties, defined at the last European Council conducted by the German Presidency, confirms what we have been denouncing for some considerable time: that those who did not accept the results of the referenda in France and the Netherlands - which rejected the content of the so-called 'European Constitution' - began, almost immediately, to plan ways of getting around the sovereignly expressed wishes of the people of these two nations."
"The IGC mandate speaks for itself."
"It is a case of recovering the essential content of the already rejected treaty proposal - overcoming contradictions, mainly those which, having been compromised by the referenda, they now seek to avoid - dressing it up as a 'reforming treaty' and setting aside the 'constitutional character', the better to disguise the operation."
"Those who repeat to exhaustion that the new treaty proposal is impregnated with democracy are, in the end, the same ones who, once again, are planning how to avoid binding, national referenda, to be held prior to any ratification of a new treaty proposal."
"This is all the more serious inasmuch as it is an attempt to reinstate the qualitative jump in the joint federalist, neoliberal and militarist project which appeared in the rejected 'European Constitution'."
"We may affirm that this is a doubly unacceptable process."
"in writing. - The German Presidency was a disaster."
"The so-called reform treaty which is labelled a success is not preparing the ground for a social, democratic and peaceful EU."
"On the contrary, the EU is more divided now."
"Worst in this respect were threats by German politicians like PSE chairman Martin Schulz against Poland and Great Britain."
"Furthermore, the militarisation of the EU has been accelerated and there have been no commitments for another policy on climate change."
"Any new EU Treaty should be decided by referendum in all Member States."
"It is impossible always to talk about getting citizens more involved in European affairs while at the same time not letting them have a say on the most important issues in the EU."
"My wish would be that the voices of the people who rejected the constitutional treaty because of its neo-liberal and militaristic character were finally heard."
"I see the contrary, however: we are facing an attempt to get the substance of the constitutional treaty adopted through the back door by renaming the project 'reform treaty' and excluding the possibility of referendums."
"If the EU is to be based on democratic principles this has to be prevented."
"Dates for next sittings: see Minutes"
"Adjournment of the session"

"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session suspended on Wednesday, 27 June 2007."
"Statements by the President"
"Ladies and gentlemen, the chairmen of the political groups have asked me to make a statement on terrorism."
"A few days ago, on 29 and 30 June, there were renewed terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow; they came something over three years after the 11 March 2004 bombings in Madrid that cost 192 people their lives and two years after the 7 July 2005 bombings in London in which 56 people were killed and more than 700 injured."
"A few days later, on 2 July, a suicide bombing claimed further victims in Yemen: seven Spanish tourists and two Yemenis were killed and eight other persons injured."
"There are many indications that the al-Qaeda terrorist network is connected with these attacks."
"This is a threat to us all."
"Terrorism is a direct assault on freedom, human rights and democracy."
"Terrorism is an attempt to destroy our values by blind force, values which unite us in the European Union and in our Member States."
"Wherever it takes place and whoever is responsible, terrorism is a crime to which we must respond with determination and solidarity."
"The European Union must join with the international community of nations to fight against every form of terrorism."
"Today, the European Parliament will be discussing Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert's report on the draft directive which the Commission presented last year that will require the Member States to identify important infrastructures in such areas as energy, health, communications and transport and protect them against terrorist attacks."
"This will enable long-term security measures to be taken for the event of a terrorist attack."
"This proposed European strategy is a tangible contribution to the fight against terrorism."
"We must take all the measures necessary to counter terrorism."
"In so doing, we must be guided by our principles of the rule of law."
"The fight against terrorism can only be waged in a manner consistent with the values we are seeking to defend!"
"The European Parliament expresses its solidarity and support for the victims of terrorism and their families - for those who have lost their lives, but also for those who are still suffering the psychological and physical consequences."
"May I conclude by quoting the words of the United Kingdom's new Prime Minister, Gordon Brown: 'We will not yield, we will not be intimidated'."
"We will now keep silence in memory of the victims."

"The Socialist Group, the Liberal Group and the Group of the European United Left propose that Mr Markov's report on road infrastructure safety management be referred back to the committee responsible in accordance with Rule 168."
"Mr President, I would like to speak in favour of referring this report back to the committee."
"There was a lot of concern in committee when the vote was taken to reject this proposal and no doubt the groups involved had reasons for doing that, but one of the consequences was that many road safety issues were then rejected also."
"Rather than go through the whole procedure in this plenary, my group and I feel that it would be far better if we refer the whole Markov report back to committee as of today, take it off the agenda and basically start again with our discussions between all the groups in the hope that we can come to a proper solution."
"(Parliament adopted the motion)"
"Thursday:"
"No amendments"
"(The order of business was adopted)"
"(DE) Mr President, I crave your forbearance because I do not know which Rule of the Rules of Procedure I am speaking under."
"But I am sure that in your infinite wisdom you will find the right one."
"We have a number of debates in this House about Parliament's calendar of meetings."
"There is a very great need for coordination between the political groups."
"The deadline for the tabling of amendments is 10 a.m. tomorrow."
"On behalf of our group, but also with the agreement of other group chairmen and colleagues, I propose that the deadline be extended to 6 p.m. tomorrow."
"That might give us time to resolve one or two serious problems, including organisational ones."
"Thank you."
"A large number of group chairmen and representatives are nodding their heads in agreement with this proposal."
"I can therefore assume that there are no objections and the deadline will be set at 6 p.m. tomorrow."
"Community action programme in the field of health - Action to tackle cardiovascular disease (debate)"
"The next item is:"
"the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on the Council common position for adopting a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a second programme of Community action in the field of health (2007-2013) (16369/2/2006 C6-0100/2007 Rapporteur: Mr Trakatellis, and"
"the debate on the oral question to the Commission B6-0134/2007) by Mr Ouzk√Ω, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on action to tackle cardiovascular disease."
"rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner, I call on you to give due attention to the question of promoting health, which must be seen not only as a valuable commodity and indicator of social prosperity, but also as an investment-generating parameter."
"This approach is particular evident in the field of prevention, on which the programme under debate mainly focuses, because prevention means restricting morbidity and hence reducing the costs of treatment and hospital care."
"There is no need to analyse the beneficial results of such a development for health insurance and, by extension, public finances."
"Improving the health of the population undoubtedly drives progress, strengthens citizens, by guaranteeing them a longer, better and more productive life, and constitutes the precondition to economic prosperity."
"By limiting the number of man-hours lost, prevention also helps to increase the productivity and employability of workers, two indicators which are in keeping with the Lisbon process."
"Prevention, therefore, is the key issue for a revised, efficiency-orientated health policy and a preferential field of action for a Union programme."
"That is why the European Union needs its second public health programme: because we must jointly defend ourselves against the health risks which have appeared so dramatically, with the possibility of a 'flu pandemic and with the bird 'flu epidemic, and that is one of the aims of the programme."
"We must jointly promote a healthy lifestyle for our children, with a proper diet in a society free from smoke and stress and with proper socio-economic conditions in general that have a serious effect on health, and that is one of the aims of the programme."
"We must jointly fight to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of serious illnesses which destroy the body and the mind, and that is one of the aims of the programme."
"We must recommend that better medical practices, which are not only the most efficient way of combating disease but which limit further loss of health, be within reach of everyone, both of those working in the health professions and of simple citizens, and that is one of the aims of the programme."
"Particular importance is attached to collating data on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics, which is currently the scourge of hospitals in Europe."
"Particular importance is also attached to the effect of environmental factors on health."
"It is also extremely important that we collate data and develop strategies on patient mobility."
"I could continue by describing one by one all the aims of the programme."
"I think that it is not necessary, because we are all convinced that we must act jointly and at European level, while at the same time giving the Member States the possibility of increasing their efficiency on health matters."
"This is the second programme, which will apply in the years 2008-2013."
"It is better, more comprehensive and more ambitious and is marked by an integrated perception both of health and of the means, mechanisms and practices for combating health problems."
"It will assist convergence and the integration of the European Union, which we must look on not only in economic terms or foreign policy terms, but also in terms of convergence in the fields of education and health, because that is when the fabric of stability and prosperity of European society is really woven."
"This sort of ambitious plan which, at the same time, is of exceptional benefit not only for the health, but also for the economy of the European Union, needs financial investments that will yield exponential results, because it will considerably reduce the onerous costs of health services in the Member States."
"Unfortunately, the Council made huge cuts to the European Union budget in December, which for certain programmes, such as the programme under debate, were exceptionally painful."
"One wonders how we can progress along the difficult path of European integration when the programmes which fundamentally build and create a European society of the future are subject to significant cuts."
"The good news is that the need for adequate funding for the health programme has been understood by the Council and by the Commission and by Parliament and I believe that the arrangement brokered through unofficial consultations allows for adequate financing within a framework of the rules of the Community budget."
"I call on my honourable friends to vote in favour of the agreed amendments brokered through unofficial consultations."
"author. - (CS) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to express my support for the words of my dear colleague Dr Trakatellis on the particular issue of cardiovascular diseases."
"In my question to the Commission, I focused on a widely known issue, namely the seriousness of cardiovascular diseases, which in the EU alone kill almost two million people per year."
"This is an established and universally acknowledged fact."
"As long ago as 2004, the Council recognised the importance of providing decisive solutions to the problem of cardiovascular diseases."
"There has been extraordinary medical progress in this field in the last 10 to 15 years."
"The problem, however, is the dramatic increase in costs."
"For the purposes of illustration, I always tell Czech citizens in debates - and I emphasise the point here in this Chamber - that treating a coronary thrombosis 15 years ago, using the methods of the time, cost around EUR 20 per day, and after streptokinase was introduced the cost rose to EUR 1,000 per treatment."
"Nowadays, with the advent of stents and acute catheterisation, the cost has risen to EUR 10 000 for a single treatment."
"In other words, there has been a huge increase in the financial cost."
"On the other hand, there has been enormous growth in the range of opportunities for treating a significant number of patients who would previously have had to suffer and die."
"Today, patients with acute coronary thrombosis, provided they are treated quickly and properly, can return home on the very same day and go back to work few days later."
"The money we spend, therefore, can be recouped later."
"A further problem is the differences that exist not only between the various Member States but also within individual countries."
"According to one study in my country, the death rate from cardiovascular diseases rises according to how far from the clinic the patient lives."
"In this regard, the EU varies enormously and what we are proposing is a path towards a more systemic solution."
"Although I do not wish to go against the subsidiarity principle and tread on the toes of the various national governments, I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to bring about an exchange of information and experience, because we certainly have the resources for that, and it is one of the ways in which we can make substantial improvements this area."
"What steps does the Commission intend to take to reduce the economic burden and the impact of cardiovascular diseases on the economies of the Member States?"
"What funding possibilities does the Commission have which can be recommended?"
"In one of the amendments to which I put my name today, I called for a study into the option of mass public provision of defibrillators."
"We know that this has proved to be extremely effective in Japan, and I have also learned of defibrillators being made available in public places in a number of other countries, including the United States."
"I am aware that this is a very expensive option, and that opponents of such an indiscriminate approach would argue that a certain amount of prudence is called for."
"Yet this approach will in many cases save lives before the ambulance arrives."
"This is why I should be interested in the Commission's response to this additional question."
"Œúember of the Commission."
"(EL) Mr President, I should like to start by extending my warmest thanks to all the honourable Members for the interest they have shown in the Commission proposal for the adoption of a second programme of Community action in the field of health."
"I should like in particular to thank the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts, which will allow us - and I am sure of this - to reach an agreement at second reading."
"We have before us today an overall compromise which is the outcome of a number of very positive unofficial contacts between the three institutions."
"The compromise amendments strengthen the text in numerous sectors which are of particular importance to Parliament, such as the follow-up to Community initiatives on cancer and the more accurate wording on action for the environment and health."
"As far as the budget is concerned, which we have also had the opportunity to debate in the past, unfortunately the room for manoeuvre was very limited and the Commission is strictly bound by the agreed financial framework."
"Nonetheless, according to the text of the tripartite statement, the special requirements of the programme will be taken into account during the annual budget procedure."
"In addition, the present text will provide the legal basis, which will safeguard the more effective disposal of resources for achieving the aims of the programme."
"I do not think that anyone can doubt that Parliament, the Council and the Commission made a great deal of effort to reach an acceptable compromise."
"I honestly hope that the vote to follow will express this positive and constructive stand, so that we can start to finance plans relating to important new public health sectors from 1 January 2008."
"I should like now to turn, on the basis of Mr Ouzk√Ω's question, to a more specific aspect of public health and one of the most serious problems; I refer to cardiovascular diseases, which are certainly one of the main causes of early death and disability of the citizens of the European Union."
"The causes and the risk factors are well known; they include smoking, a poor diet and obesity, lack of physical exercise and excessive consumption of alcohol."
"I know that Parliament has an acute interest in this sector and that a motion for a resolution on cardiovascular diseases is being submitted to plenary by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety."
"As you know, the Commission puts particular emphasis on prevention."
"Within the limited resources at our disposal and within the balance of competences set out in the Treaty, we put particular emphasis and expend a great deal of effort on prevention."
"We also do this on the question of smoking and you are all well acquainted with the 'Help' strategy, which has also been received in Parliament, the various laws and the Green Paper we have adopted on banning smoking in public places, and I really do impatiently await the view and opinion of the European Parliament."
"As far as diet is concerned, we published very recently - in May - a White Paper on diet and obesity and, as you know, we have already started applying and implementing the strategy on alcohol, starting with the Alcohol and Health Forum, in cooperation with non-governmental organisations and private-sector undertakings in the aim of combating this new problem."
"Through public health programmes, the Commission supports activities and networks relating to cardiovascular diseases, including an extensive catalogue of data on cardiovascular diseases in the Member States and the development of indicators for monitoring cardiovascular diseases."
"The creation of centres of reference, the exchange of best practices, the combating of the inequalities which unfortunately exist in the European Union - not only from one state to another, but also within the Member States themselves - are the objectives addressed by the new programme."
"However, I must emphasise for the sake of accuracy that we simply provide possibilities; they must be used by the Member States, which are responsible for providing health services."
"As far as research is concerned (because the question also refers to research), the European Union has made over EUR 100 million available for research into cardiovascular diseases through the Sixth Framework Programme on research and development."
"These diseases are still one of the priorities of health research within the framework of the Seventh Framework Programme on research and development which started this year."
"Consequently, there is the facility to continue research in this sector under the Seventh Framework Programme."
"I shall not comment in detail on the European Heart Health Charter, because an event and debate were held on the subject here in Parliament and we all remember the presentation event in Brussels last month."
"However, this cohesive document is important, because it unifies all the bodies which can help to combat this problem and, of course, it is safeguarded by the public health programme."
"More action to combat the decisive factors which cause cardiovascular diseases and inequalities in health will be included in the new health strategy of the European Union which I hope - and I am sure - will be adopted later, before the end of this year."
"As far as the financial part is concerned - because this too is important - there is the European Development Fund for developing countries, where the Commission is responding to the priorities set by the countries themselves through dialogue and, of course, the health sector is one of the priorities."
"The same applies to the Structural Funds which exist in the European Union for the Member States and which can be used for health even more extensively in this period than in the previous period, but there is still a need for health to be a priority issue in the take-up of Funds by the Member States themselves."
"We provide possibilities, by which I mean that I do not fail to raise the issue with the ministers of health whenever we meet but, at the end of the day, the decision will be taken collectively by the governments of the Member States."
"I advise and urge the Member States to make use of the Structural Funds in the health sector, but I must say that there is still a great deal of room for improvement."
"However, it is also our priority to strengthen the national health systems which allow for the management of public health priorities, which cover not only communicable diseases, which of course are the first and obvious threat, but also non-communicable and I hope here that I shall have the support and cooperation of Parliament."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, there is no wealth without health."
"That is the theme of this debate and the sub-plot is that we have both to care and cure, but also to prevent ill-health and promote wellbeing."
"The Commissioner recognises this and has come forward with an ambitious programme, as our rapporteur has said, but the budget was savaged by two-thirds."
"So it is clear we must do better on budgets in the future; it is clear we must use our limited resources now wisely; it is clear we must target the non-communicable diseases that cause 86% of deaths in Europe and devastate lives and families - cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes, respiratory and musculoskeletal conditions."
"That of course links into the resolution that you have before you: 42% of deaths in the EU come from CVD problems."
"Our emphasis must be on lifestyle."
"Some 80% of heart attacks, stroke and diabetes, and some 40% of cancers could be avoided by changing lifestyle and cutting out the risks that come from a bad lifestyle."
"We will sometimes need education or legislation on smoking, drugs, alcohol, salt, saturated and trans fats, lack of exercise, as well as things like stress management and all the causes of hypertension."
"We need partnerships between people, governments, health services and employers."
"And we need ideas such as the one on the defibrillator that my colleague referred to."
"I could end by saying the road to hell is often said to be paved with good intentions, but the health promotion case studies show that, as in North Karelia, if good intentions are translated into action, then the road can lead not to hell but to health."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, my first thanks go to Mr Trakatellis for his excellent work on getting agreement today on a package of amendments on the public health programme."
"It has not been easy: we have had lots of meetings over the course of the last few months, but we finally have a package that the Socialist Group welcomes."
"We welcome the very clear commitment to tackling health inequalities which is contained in the package."
"We welcome, as Mr Bowis said, the action on major diseases which are the biggest killers in Europe."
"We want to see better use made of the centres of reference across Europe and we are also pleased that NGOs and patients' organisations will have better access to funding thanks to this programme that will see emphasis placed on the wider environmental determinants of heath."
"We all know that health suffers because of environmental issues and we want to see that tackled."
"Like the other speakers, I think it is regrettable that we have a lower budget than we had thought in the first place but, as the Commission has said on many occasions, there are other framework programmes where health can be investigated so this is not the only money made available for health research in the EU."
"I want to draw your attention to Amendment 19, which the Socialist Group has tabled separately from the package."
"In recital 14 we talk about increasing healthy life years, and we want to delete the words 'also called disability-free life expectancy indicator'."
"We have had many approaches from disability organisations, which make the point that you can have a disability and be healthy and that, therefore, this terminology seems to suggest that if you are a disabled person you are automatically somebody who is unhealthy."
"Therefore, we would like the Commission and the Council to look at that when they look at the final wording for the document."
"Finally, I want to put on record my thanks as well to the German Presidency negotiating team who helped us to reach agreement today and took on board so many of our parliamentary amendments from first reading."
"I look forward to getting the programme up and running on time next year."
"That is what everybody wants at this stage and that is why we have been prepared to compromise on the budget, but we are very pleased with the content."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I should like to express my congratulations to the rapporteur for his excellent report."
"Professor Trakatellis has spent many years dealing with health issues, both as a clinician and as a politician; therefore, he knows the subject matter of this report very well and it is thus not surprising that he has tackled the issue with efficiency and wisdom."
"Most of us share the rapporteur's views on the main issues brought up in this report."
"One of the most important of these is the problem of health inequalities."
"Such inequalities occur not just from one Member State to another but also within Member States."
"They can be very substantial indeed and, in many cases, such differences exist right across the whole range of healthcare, from prevention and diagnosis to treatment."
"It is well known, not just amongst medical professionals but also amongst ordinary citizens, that such discrepancies more often than not make the difference between life or death."
"The right to life should be accompanied by the right to health - equal health, not one health for the rich and another for the poor."
"In a fair and humanistic society such as the one we aspire to achieve in the EU Member States, all citizens should be equal in terms of healthcare."
"I agree entirely with the rapporteur that this issue should become a very major aim of the health programme and I am sure that the Commissioner also agrees with this."
"A second area referred to by the rapporteur on which I would like to offer some brief comments is that of cancer."
"Cancer is the second commonest cause of death in Europe and the world in general, yet it is absolutely unthinkable why in this day and age no proper Community system for cooperation between centres of reference is fully functioning unhindered."
"And it is shameful that shortcomings exist in the establishment of a Europe-wide register for those cancers which are covered by the Council recommendation on cancer screening."
"The rapporteur addresses both of these issues and many others adequately and proposes appropriate amendments which we fully support."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (EL) Commissioner, we must indeed congratulate the rapporteur, Professor Trakatellis, on achieving today's compromise."
"I, however, shall comment on the financial problem because, as we all know, the biggest bone of contention between Parliament and the Council from the outset was the budget to support this policy."
"The compromise between the Member States in December 2005 on the new financial framework for the period 2007-2013 left funding for numerous policy areas at much lower levels than initially proposed by the Commission."
"One of the policy areas which suffered the biggest cuts was public health and the biggest victim was the health programme."
"The consequences of the negotiations between the Commission and the Council were very unfortunate in terms of financial support for the action programme."
"The budget was reduced to EUR 365.6 million, a very small sum for such an ambitious programme."
"Nonetheless, the rapporteur, with the support of the shadow rapporteurs, explored every way of improving the situation."
"However, given the rigid stance of the Council, he accepted that the room for manoeuvre as far as the budget was concerned was very limited and accepted the compromise between the Council and the Commission."
"Although the limited budget for the programme is not of course to our liking, we welcome the rapporteur's efforts in managing to keep a plethora of Parliament's recommendations and amendments intact and to avoid the conciliation procedure."
"We are most relieved to see that the rapporteur's compromise includes the need to reduce inequalities in health and a reference to alternative medicine."
"Nor does it omit the strengthening of cross-border care and patient mobility or better access for citizens to information, which will make them better able to take decisions which are in their interests."
"It is worth noting that a large part of the budget will go to non-governmental organisations, which are non-profit-making and independent of industry, trade and the undertakings which specialise in the promotion of health and the aims of the programme."
"Let us hope that it will be possible to meet the ambitious actions and expectations we all have of this programme, which will finally enter into force in 2008, despite the reduced budget."
"Commissioner, I should like to emphasise at this point, as my honourable friends and previous speakers have indicated, the importance of prevention and of prompt diagnosis."
"We must invest in this sector."
"You cannot imagine not only the lives we shall save, but also the money that the Member States will save by applying programmes which address this specific sector, especially heart disease and cancer."
"You mentioned cancer as the second cause of death."
"I tell you with mathematical accuracy that, in a few years' time, cancer will be the first cause of death as a result of the progress being made with cardiovascular diseases."
"Commissioner, we are with you and we shall support you in applying the programme."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, the 2007-2013 Community action programme in the field of health aimed to set a course for European health services."
"From the outset, however, the programme has generated controversy."
"This was due not only to the lack of clarity in the provisions on funding but also to other reasons."
"The funds allocated relate only to international NGOs, and other programmes have been cut out."
"Pursuant to the document, substantial sums amounting to 60% Community input and to as much as 80% in exceptional circumstances are to be allocated to non-governmental organisations at international level."
"The programmes of many such organisations include pro-abortion policies."
"In some cases the organisations are offshoots of pharmaceutical concerns."
"Funding laboratories without establishing the type of research they are engaged in is also cause for concern."
"Unfortunately the programme only deals in a cursory manner with access to health services and the care of the elderly."
"It makes no provision for supporting the family, combating the diseases of contemporary society or for access to highly specialised advice."
"The programme does, however, deal with healthy food and a healthy lifestyle."
"The issue of cross-border health care arises again, along with its negative impact on certain health care systems."
"It would seem that in view of the limited funding available, this programme cannot deal with the whole range of problems affecting European health care services."
"- (SK) With regard to this report, I subscribe to all of the observations made by the rapporteur."
"Out of an original budget of EUR 969 million, the Commission has cut healthcare allocations to EUR 365 million."
"It did so despite the fact that Parliament had not regarded EUR 969 million as sufficient and had topped it up to EUR 1.5 billion."
"I view this cut of nearly 60% as highly irresponsible."
"It is all the more shocking in the current climate, with healthcare systems across Eastern Europe weakened by the exodus of large numbers of physicians and nurses, who are leaving to seek work in the EU-15."
"In a situation where other programmes have been cut to the tune of a mere 2 to 5% and when every third citizen in Europe develops cancer, I believe that in assuming this stance the Commission is ridiculing and disparaging the patients and citizens of the European Union."
"It is therefore necessary to support the rapporteur in his efforts to have this small budget increased by at least 10%, that is, to EUR 402 million, while keeping the variation ceiling at no more than 5%."
"At the same time, the programme should explicitly stipulate that structural funds, as you mentioned, Commissioner, can be used to finance healthcare projects, provided that Member States designate health care as a priority in their national programmes."
"Until now, these funds have been primarily used to finance environmental projects or build up infrastructure, and only a few citizens know that the funds could also be employed to finance the modernisation of hospitals, purchase equipment and train healthcare professionals."
"I very much welcome the establishment of European-wide registries for major diseases, notably cancer, which will be instrumental in collecting data and highlighting even more the fact that there are discrepancies of up to 30% between Member States in the survival rates of patients suffering from certain types of cancer."
"On the basis of statistics such as these, I believe that the Commission will review its healthcare priorities and endorse the appropriate allocations."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the action programme on health and the prevention of cardiovascular disease are very closely related subjects."
"I would like first of all to offer Mr Trakatellis my sincere congratulations on his tireless fight for this programme."
"Prevention is better than cure."
"Prevention means longer life, better life, better quality of life, less medical care, less sickness, lower sickness costs."
"I am sure we would have liked more resources than 20 cents per head of population per year."
"We are however modest and conduct many action programmes for little money."
"We can only set priorities of course, and I must make it absolutely clear that we are talking here about prevention, about educating people, and not about treatment, which after all is a subsidiary matter and the responsibility of the nation states."
"Prevention means stopping diseases from occurring in the first place, especially in the area of cardiovascular diseases, involving heart attacks and strokes, of tumour diseases and their causes, as with lung cancer and smoking, of unhealthy lifestyles such as the wrong kind of food or even doping in sport, of accidents and accident prevention, and of research and statistics, where the aim is to detect and understand diseases better in order to develop better guidelines for treatment."
"I will now reply to the oral question from Mr Ouzk√Ω, to whom I also express my thanks here."
"Much can be done to prevent cardiovascular disease by changing one's lifestyle: exercise, health, sport, balanced nutrition and ultimately also avoiding trans fatty acids."
"We also need a catchy slogan for cardiovascular prevention, so that people know what is at stake."
"We could say, for example, 'Save your heart, save your life' or in German 'Herzlos kannst du nicht leben'."
"EUR 325 million for prevention over five years is not much."
"I visited a German heart hospital this morning."
"There, 200 million were invested in just one year!"
"Mr President, as my group's shadow on the motion for a resolution on action to tackle cardiovascular disease, I would like wholeheartedly to endorse this worthy initiative and thank Mr Ouzk√Ω, Mr Andrejevs and Mr Bowis for all their hard work."
"I feel I can but reiterate the content of the resolution and add my voice to the call for action and other points raised in the oral question."
"I find it shocking that nearly half of all deaths in Europe are caused by cardiovascular disease and that it is the main cause of death for women in all European countries."
"I welcome the specific mention of cardiovascular disease in the 2008-2013 health programme, but I am somewhat disappointed at the vastly reduced budget allocation given the fact that cardiovascular disease costs the European Union's countries EUR 169 billion each year."
"The EU has so much to offer in terms of added value which would surely repay many times any money spent on combating it."
"Nevertheless, I fully support the compromise reached and recognise that it is necessary to have this funding in place as soon as possible."
"Any further delay in adopting the programme would not be desirable."
"There is much action at EU level where value can be added and it is for this reason that we need a tangible European strategy on cardiovascular disease which can help Member States to improve and coordinate their prevention strategies, identify those who are at high risk, raise awareness, inform the public and promote exchange of best practice."
"A set of clear political guidelines should form part of this strategy."
"I would like to conclude by reiterating my support for the motion for a resolution and I urge the Commission to bring forward without delay a comprehensive and coherent EU-wide strategy on cardiovascular disease incorporating the European Parliament's suggestions."
"(CS) I too should like to congratulate Mr Trakatellis and thank him for his report and his proposals."
"I would also like to make one or two comments."
"I do not want to go into financial details, because this has already been done."
"I should merely like to point out, speaking as a doctor, that if financial resources are cut, the common programme that we are debating will simply be less effective."
"I firmly believe that healthcare cannot, in budgetary terms, be a peripheral issue."
"I should like to support Amendment 1, which contains proposals for Council recommendations as regards the necessary delivery mechanisms."
"I feel that this is much needed, because we have often called for documents relating to healthcare or the fight against civilisational diseases, and we of course did not have the effective instruments needed to combat such diseases."
"The second amendment that I should like to mention and support concerns patient awareness."
"We need patients to be well informed."
"This is not, however, solely a matter of improving access to information, it is also, in my view about access to better quality information."
"Such information can help our citizens not only to become more interested in their own health, and in looking after themselves, but also to be less susceptible to advertising."
"On the subject of advertising, I believe that we shall have a unique opportunity to show our fairness and honesty with regard to issues such as alcoholism when we debate the proposed measures in the Foglietta report on combating alcoholism."
"On this issue, we will certainly table amendments regarding the advertising of alcoholic products."
"I should like, if I may, to express my support for the initiative of Mr Ouzk√Ω, which applies to his question regarding cardiovascular diseases."
"As a former cardiologist, I feel I have a fair amount of knowledge on the subject."
"I should like to say that cardiologists today know much more about the causes and have put the conditions in place for patients to receive very effective treatment and to return to a normal working life."
"The problem is the extent of the desire to invest in such programmes, in particular when it comes to prevention."
"At the same time, there is a failure to understand that these resources can certainly be recouped."
"In this respect, the Czech Republic is a very good example."
"I believe that as MEPs we have a duty to call for a level playing field in the healthcare sector as well as the economic sector."
"This is a matter of financial solidarity between the EU Member States."
"Mr President, yesterday's media revealed the shocking results of a study of children in a large area of England."
"One in every 58 children has a form of autism."
"How could a seriously debilitating condition have increased from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 58 children in 17 years?"
"Mr Trakatellis's work on the programme of Community action in the field of health 2007-2013 comes at a time when the need for some joined-up, collaborative thinking about Europe's major health threats is urgently needed."
"One of the most important contributions Europe can make to health is statistical research and investigation, establishing the true situation of disease threats - contagious or not, chronic or acute - because, in comparing disease treatment in the Member States, we get the overall picture that helps us develop a standard of best practice and clues to both treatments and even cures."
"The Commission, I am glad to say, has made a start by funding the European Autism Information System project to establish an effective method to be used by Member State health authorities to gather the essential information on the autism epidemic in Europe."
"However, we are very late in this."
"The USA has been tracking this epidemic for a decade now."
"On foot of the figures, the US Congress has passed 16 pieces of legislation channelling billions of dollars, but Europe has done nothing yet."
"I urge the Commission to find a way to foster the highest quality healthcare in the Member States, a system that will never again allow an epidemic like autism to go unchecked as it ravishes children, robbing them of their normal development."
"(SV) The role and responsibility of the EU within the health sphere is, and must remain, limited."
"Perhaps the most important contribution to be made by the EU, however, is to enable people to seek health care in other EU countries."
"For many who are ill, health care in another EU country may be a matter of life or death."
"It is therefore incomprehensible that so many Member States do everything they can to limit that very option."
"European health care consumers should have access to the whole range of European health care, but that means having knowledge and information, and, where these are concerned, the health programme could play an invaluable role in disseminating information about health and health care to all patients throughout Europe."
"I and many like me therefore think how unfortunate it is that, in many respects, precisely this area appears to have been curtailed when, for budgetary reasons, the Commission revised its proposal for a new health programme."
"I understand, however, that there has been a very great deal of opposition to this happening."
"Why, in actual fact, is increasing the transparency between different health care systems in the Member States such a delicate issue, however?"
"Why not focus on measuring the likely results in terms of health care and of how many people would actually be helped to get better, rather than focus on available resources such as beds and days spent in hospital?"
"The only explanation I can see is that there is a desire to keep patients uninformed and powerless."
"It is equally incomprehensible that the EU Member States' compromise with our rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, should have called, for example, for the removal of the wordings I included precisely in order to give patients more power."
"Why, for example, is there no desire to confirm that patients have rights also in their capacity as health care consumers?"
"They have deleted the sentence whose meaning was precisely to that effect."
"I find that embarrassing."
"In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, health decisions must be made at the lowest possible level."
"For me, that means at patient level, irrespective of what is said by politicians and bureaucrats in the Member States."
"We must therefore use European cooperation to strengthen the position of patients and give them more knowledge and more power."
"In a nutshell, patients should be allowed to take control of their own illnesses."
"(NL) Mr President, I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Trakatellis and our shadow rapporteur, Mrs McAvan."
"Health is a great good, as well as an important political topic."
"In the first instance, health falls within the national remit but, for Europe, it constitutes clear and important added value."
"At present, the access European citizens have to adequate treatment is very unequal."
"Cancer patients stand a considerably better chance of survival in some countries than in others."
"Treatment methods differ and access to the health care is imbalanced."
"Patients' knowledge about their illnesses differs from one country to the next, and prevention does not in all countries have the attention it deserves."
"This is why action is needed."
"We must pool knowledge."
"Member States, hospitals, patients' associations and general practitioners can learn from one other."
"We should combine our knowledge about the prevention and treatment of the most important diseases, including cancer, rheumatism, diabetes, lung disorders and obviously cardiovascular diseases, and we should learn from other countries where improvements can be made."
"Knowledge centres and networks, which should be dedicated to the most important diseases, can be a vital source of information for doctors and patients alike."
"(SK) It is a proven fact that money invested in human health makes the best investment."
"It offers the best return on investment."
"I am therefore gratified that the Commission's original proposal for a joint healthcare and consumer protection programme to be established for the period up to 2013 has been defeated."
"Parliament did well to increase healthcare allocations to EUR 1.5 billion from the initial level of EUR 969 million, thus sending a clear signal and message to both the Council and the Commission."
"In the meantime, the budgets for new multiyear programmes in all policy areas have been the subject of negotiations concerning the new financial framework for 2007-2013; in this context, ladies and gentlemen, I must express great dissatisfaction with the fact that many programmes, including the health programme, have been allocated far less than the Commission originally proposed."
"Even though the European Parliament later managed to remedy the situation somewhat, in the spring of 2006, the outcome is wholly inadequate from the perspective of some of the programmes, including healthcare."
"I am referring to public health, where the topped up budget was cut to the scarcely credible figure of EUR 365.5 million."
"It is a good thing that the political agreement in November 2006 for the area of health accepted the Commission's revised proposal, including the budget."
"I believe that the specific programmes designed for people and for patients, such as the screening programmes for cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and many other disorders, will not be jeopardised."
"Nor will we put in jeopardy the necessary cooperation across the Community between specialised centres, or the establishment of Europe-wide registers of such diseases."
"I fully support the approach taken by the rapporteur, Mr Trakatellis, and I believe that Parliament will again take a wise decision."
"(LT) I congratulate the rapporteur, who faced the challenging task of adapting the significantly reduced seven-year health budget to the growing expectations of EU citizens."
"A coordinated Community approach in this field would significantly increase the effective utilisation of funds."
"Now the programme has to be approved as soon as possible in order that at least the funds for 2008 are reclaimed in time."
"In the expanded European Union, differences in medical care in various countries have become evident."
"The programme under discussion ought to help reduce these differences."
"Every EU citizen in any EU country has the right to receive quality medical services."
"It is particularly important that the new EU countries participate in the European projects."
"I would also like to underline the need for attention to preventive projects, which reduce the influence of risk factors and improve the health of the Community."
"Preventing illnesses is always cheaper than treating them, especially at times like this, when resources are decreasing but needs are growing."
"(CS) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this Community action programme establishes priorities for projects, funded at European and national level, to address the biggest causes of death in Europe, including cardiovascular diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, cancer, digestive diseases and respiratory diseases."
"We all have to die of something, especially when we reach a certain age."
"The high quality of European medicine, along with improvements in living conditions, and in particular people's economic wealth, have led to longer life expectancy among Europeans."
"There are fresh challenges that lie ahead of us."
"One is how the health and social systems in Europe are to be funded in future from the public purse and the second is how to improve treatment for polymorbidity, which becomes more common as people live longer."
"Such treatment is crucial to older people's quality of life."
"Both of these concerns are common to all Member States, and yet neither has been included in any detail among the main goals of the Union's action plan in the area of health."
"Perhaps next time."
"Resolving the first of these economic concerns will entail, among other things, an assessment of priorities within the Community, both in terms of government programmes and in terms of people's private lives."
"My professional experience has taught me that the main priority is to make people much more responsible for their own health and disease prevention."
"Patients are not stupid and are capable of making up their own minds."
"They do need adequate information for this, however, and it must be formulated in an appropriate way."
"I therefore strongly support the proposals in the second reading, including Amendment 2, for example, which calls for the programme to provide citizens with better access to information, and Amendment 9, which concerns policies aimed at leading a healthier lifestyle."
"As regards the second problem, I would like to believe that the Member States will actively support the coordination of scientific activities aimed at achieving the complex treatment of associated diseases, despite the large and regrettable reduction in the European budget for the action plan in support of health."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Members once again for a very interesting debate and for the support expressed."
"I do not want to repeat what has already been said and what I said in my introductory remarks, but I shall make some clarifications."
"On the issue of cancer, I should like to clarify that cancer remains one of the Commission's top priorities and is part of the health programme."
"I referred specifically to cardiovascular diseases because that was in a question tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, but through research and other programmes we support many initiatives regarding cancer."
"We had an opportunity to discuss this issue in this House quite recently."
"I should like to correct one mistake."
"Mrs Belohorsk√° is not here and I think that she did not follow the debate closely on how the financial perspectives were adopted and how it was decided who took the decision."
"It was not the Commission who reduced the budget - we are not that suicidal."
"As you know, it was the Council who decided unanimously that there should be a reduction, and the areas that suffered most, unfortunately, were health and education and culture."
"I have to say that it is regrettable and I have had the opportunity to express this on many occasions in discussions here and I understand the frustration of Mr Trakatellis when he had to deal with this issue."
"However, at the end of the day we want to take action, we want to help our citizens and we want to move forward, and therefore we have to make do with what we have and make the best possible use of our limited funds and resources."
"That is why I agree with many of you, and it is our priority, that prevention is one of the main targets because it has added value and a multiplying effect so that we can make better use of the funds by concentrating on prevention."
"That is one of my main arguments."
"I have been trying repeatedly to convince Member States that spending on health is not a cost but an investment."
"It has to be viewed as such."
"We will benefit in the long run, and that is a disincentive for taking measures when benefits will appear sometime in the future."
"Nevertheless, I think that the time has come when we cannot expect to solve the problems only through reforms of the health systems or through patient mobility or through increasing the insurance costs but we have to invest in prevention and on health and this is one of the main priorities."
"I am looking forward to working with you all in the next period."
"Perhaps I could refer to just one specific amendment, that raised by Mrs McAvan."
"We have no objection to agreeing to the deletion of that sentence."
"You realise that for us it is a big achievement to have the healthy life years included as an indicator and this was the purpose."
"It was just a way of expressing it differently, but we see the point so we do not object to removing it, especially because it is the wording that is the problem and not actually the validity of the indicator."
"Regarding the point raised by Mr Fjellner on the issue of patients' rights, we had the opportunity to discuss this issue in this House and we are looking into it through the healthcare initiative which should be adopted towards the end of the year."
"There are different systems in different Member States so we do not always agree on a common approach, but at least the first step will be taken and many issues like information for patients and other aspects of patients' rights will be tackled through the healthcare initiative."
"I should like to conclude by thanking you all, in particular the Environment Committee, as well as Mr Trakatellis for being patient and persistent."
"I am looking forward to working with all of you in the implementation of the programme."
"I have received one motion for resolution pursuant to Article 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Tuesday 10 July 2007."
"MON 863 - Risk Management (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on MON 863 risk management."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, the Commission has on many occasions declared - and, through its actions, proved - its commitment to ensuring that the legislative framework on genetically modified food and feed, which was approved by the European Parliament and the Council, is fully respected."
"We have the obligation - and I believe we are delivering on this obligation - to make sure that the legislation is properly and fully respected."
"Under the legislation, GM food and feed can be legally put on the market only if it is safe and appropriately labelled."
"I would remind the House of how the legislation provides for the division of work between risk assessment and risk management."
"The Commission has no discretion on the safety assessment of a GM product."
"The legislation clearly distinguishes between risk assessment, which is carried out by EFSA, and risk management, which is carried out by the Commission."
"This approach is defined not only by general food law but also by the Regulation on GM food and feed."
"Whenever new scientific questions emerge, the Commission adheres to the separation of competences and asks EFSA to evaluate the information and its impact on the risk assessment of a product."
"The Commission's role is to take relevant risk management decisions, provided that, and only when, such a risk is identified by EFSA as the European Union's body responsible for risk assessment."
"In other words, we manage a risk once it has been identified and assessed by the body responsible."
"It was a very specific decision, when the legislation was adopted, to give the risk assessment to a separate independent body."
"However, if there is no risk identified by the Authority, then there will be no sound scientific basis for the Commission to take a risk management decision."
"On this specific issue, MON 863 had already been evaluated twice in 2004 before the authorisation was adopted."
"In both cases, EFSA concluded that MON 863 maize would not have an adverse effect, and this opinion was reached with the involvement of the national authorities of the Member States and was further reviewed and confirmed by the Authority in 2006 following a specific request to the Commission by the honourable Member Ms Breyer."
"There were intensive repeated analyses, which were carried out as part of the authorisation procedure, and then there was the publication by Professor S√©ralini in March this year - that is the sequence of events."
"The work presented by Professor S√©ralini was not a new study but only a statistical review of the existing rat-feeding study, which supported the authorisation of this product in the European Union."
"Despite the fact that it was not a new study but only a statistical review, as soon as the Commission became aware of Professor S√©ralini's paper, it immediately asked EFSA to analyse it to verify whether the newly proposed statistical interpretation was well founded and, more importantly, whether the statistical differences were relevant for food and feed safety."
"In order to take into account all new elements and thus to eliminate any possible sources of uncertainty, EFSA conducted a new review asking Member States to provide any relevant analysis or comments, set up a specific task force of internal and external statistical experts and held a meeting with the author of the statistical review."
"In the Commission's view, the procedures set up by EFSA to evaluate the review of Professor S√©ralini's report represent a sufficient guarantee of independence and expertise."
"EFSA first responded to the Commission request in March by discussing the issue at the plenary meeting of the GMO Panel, before issuing a statistical report and a scientific statement by the Panel on 20 June."
"In particular, the Authority underlines that the statistical analysis made by the authors of the paper did not take into account certain important statistical considerations and that the assumptions underlying the statistical methodology employed by the authors led to misleading results."
"The conclusion of the Authority is that the paper does not present a sound scientific justification to question the safety of MON 863 maize and, therefore, it sees no reason to revise its previous opinions that MON 863 maize would not have an adverse effect in the context of the proposed use."
"Parliament will be informed in more detail of the background I have outlined in the replies to the written questions on this subject by Ms Breyer, which are currently being finalised following the recent EFSA statement."
"Against this background, two conclusions emerge."
"First, and most importantly, there is at this stage no scientific basis to question either the safety of MON 863 or its status as a legally commercialised product."
"Second, the conclusions of the EU official body for risk assessment, made up of some of the best specialists in Europe, have been drawn after consultation of the national competent authorities as well as external experts."
"By trusting the outcome of this work, which confirms the previous evaluations, the Commission has, I believe, acted as a responsible risk manger, especially within the context of the legislation and the apportionment of responsibilities as I explained them during my introduction."
"The Commission will continue to work along these lines on the basis of a precautious and science-based approach."
"The Commission, I would emphasise, has full determination to make a case-by-case risk management decision taking into account any scientific questions emerging during the evaluation procedure or even after the authorisation."
"We will always be vigilant; we will always be ready to examine every new piece of scientific information that emerges."
"But, of course, our final decision will have to be based on the risk assessment, which will be done by the body in charge of this responsibility based on European legislation."
"We believe that our legislation and the Commission's approach offer the best way to provide our citizens with the high level of safety they expect and demand."
"I hope that I can count on the trust and support of the European Parliament as we continue our rigorous and impartial approach."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, was it not us, was it not the European Parliament that wanted to have an independent European Food Safety Authority?"
"Was it not also the Council of Ministers that wanted to have an independent EFSA, an authority on whose findings you can rely, an authority where there is no risk of getting bogus studies?"
"Did the European Parliament not at that time charge EFSA with making risks assessments of GMOs, and did the Council of Ministers not back that very thing in codecision?"
"In April 2004, EFSA assessed MON 863 maize to be just as safe as conventional maize."
"A second EFSA safety assessment in October 2004 came to the same conclusion."
"That is not of course what the green souls among us want to hear, and because what the Greens do not want simply cannot be, they commission their own study."
"Then this eventually finds, surprise, surprise, that genetically modified maize is lethal, and woe betide anyone who finds that suspect!"
"The EFSA experts then asked for a repeat of the trial on rats."
"Again there was no sign of acute toxicological effects."
"Incidentally, the Greens' study would have given the same result if the statistics had been evaluated correctly, but the statistical evaluation was not scientifically correct, as the Commissioner said."
"Once again, the Green study's supposedly scientific findings were therefore deliberate scare-mongering, deliberately sowing anxiety in the minds of the public and pulling the wool over their eyes."
"It is the typical ideologically motivated policy of obstructiveness that they so much like to use in election campaigns as well."
"They are wasting taxpayers' money by always calling for multiple repeats of the EFSA risk assessments."
"But will they also question the EFSA nutrient profiles under the Health Claims Regulation, for example?"
"Of course not, because they fit in with their ideology."
"The Council of Ministers is also at fault, however. The national ministers responsible lack the courage to agree to authorise GMOs that have been examined and found to be safe."
"It is the small man's fear of not being re-elected, neither more nor less!"
"We are wasting such great opportunities for the EU: GMOs can give us better food and feed with nutrition-physiological added value and efficient renewable raw materials that are carbon-neutral and therefore have no effect on the climate."
"MON 863 is safe and must be approved just like the other useful plants that have been tested and found to be safe."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in response to the previous speaker I would like to quote an Austrian proverb: 'blessed are those who believe, but you will still get to heaven if you do not'."
"Perhaps now I can challenge Renate Sommer's world view a little. It was not only Green Members, but the majority in this House who wanted a consumer- and environmentally friendly solution for the authorisation and labelling of genetically modified food and feed."
"Even a government close to you has questioned EFSA's handling of the studies referred to today."
"My question to the Commission is now: what concrete steps has the Commission taken to bring about a reform of the European Food Safety Authority?"
"This is not the first time we in this House have expressed doubts about its independence."
"And yes, Mrs Sommer, we wanted and we want an independent Food Safety Authority."
"But democratically elected Members naturally also have the right to take a critical look at its independence and work to see that it is genuinely independent."
"That is very much our responsibility, because we of course also know the mood and attitude of the public towards it in all the Member States."
"We agree, Mr Kyprianou, that EFSA should continue to be responsible for risk assessment and the Commission for risk management. I am however convinced that both EFSA and the Commission need to take their responsibilities seriously."
"As you know, next week we in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety will be dealing with the question of how the individual authorisation of genetically modified organisms should be handled in the context of comitology and the regulatory procedure with scrutiny."
"Such cases do not help that discussion very much."
"I hope that in future concrete steps will be taken to demonstrate that the Food Safety Authority really is independent."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, I was instrumental in organising a conference that took place on 12 June at the European Parliament in Brussels."
"The conference dealt with dangers related to the spread of GMOs, and was attended by distinguished scientists from many countries."
"Their presentations clearly indicated that there is increasing evidence of the harmful nature of GMOs."
"Alleging technological progress, large biotechnology enterprises are disseminating serious threats to civilisation the world over."
"With all due respect to Mrs Sommer, I am more inclined to believe scientists than Mrs Sommer's assurances on the safety of MON 863."
"At present, only a little animal husbandry and agriculture in the EU involves the use of GMOs."
"We still have one last chance to protect Europe against this danger."
"I have some questions to pose to the Commissioner."
"Does the European Commission intend to do anything about this?"
"Above all, does it intend to heed the wishes of citizens of entire regions of Europe, where the majority of the population wishes to protect itself against GMOs, or does the Commission intend instead to be seduced by the misleading publicity alleging technological progress?"
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Kyprianou, I am most disappointed, because, like Mrs Scheele, I was expecting answers this evening about when we will finally have higher standards for risk assessment."
"I have been asking the Commission specific questions about these safety issues for months and getting no answers; then officials tell me in private that they are not in a position to give those answers."
"The French scientists' independent study is not the only one to come to the alarming conclusion that Monsanto 863 is unsafe and is an alarming threat to health and that it is irresponsible to leave it on the market any longer."
"A study has also been made in Austria."
"There are alarming concerns in the Member States. We cannot just deny that and stick our heads in the sand."
"I would have liked to receive answers from you today about the fact that the European Medicines Agency also sees a risk with the two antibiotic resistance genes, not only in MON 863, but also in the Amflora potato, authorisation of which has now been applied for."
"Even your own EU institution is contradicting EFSA."
"We really must have answers from you on this, Mr Kyprianou!"
"You cannot simply say that you are not going to answer."
"Even the Council has called on you to comment."
"I find it curious that EFSA needed three months to evaluate the S√©ralini study."
"Incidentally, Mr S√©ralini will be here in Parliament on Wednesday and will then tell us clearly whether EFSA's all-clear, its whitewashing, is really justified. We do know that the EFSA studies make repeated references to Monsanto."
"They contain statistical errors. That has been pointed out not only by the French research team but by many Member States as well."
"We are looking to you for answers as to how these mistakes can be remedied in future, how we are to deal with them, what value, if any, should be put on the precautionary principle."
"We need a reassessment."
"I would like you to tell me, Mr Kyprianou, in no uncertain terms: will MON 863 be reassessed?"
"All EFSA has done is to look at the old data again."
"It has not carried out a reassessment at all."
"That is a very crucial question, to which we need an answer!"
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Mr President, scientists in France recently discovered extensive organ damage in the liver and kidney in animals raised on Monsanto 863."
"Three years before this, German studies were brought to the attention of EFSA by the German authorities that showed kidney damage in rats fed Monsanto 863."
"Yet, despite this, EFSA has reaffirmed their risk assessment on this and said that it is safe for European farm animals."
"Where are EFSA's studies?"
"Why are they just looking at the industry's tests and just going back over them?"
"How difficult can it be for them to try to redo the French and German studies?"
"The biotech industry in Europe alleges that GM farming is inevitable."
"My fear is that this will just be a self-fulfilling prophesy."
"Europe is capable of supplying its farmers with GM-free grain, but if we accept the inevitability, if we accept safety studies that are not really studies at all, then farmers will be forced into feeding their animals GM because otherwise there will be no other grain."
"I would remind EFSA that many products, after years of so-called 'safety', have been taken off the market."
"To give you one example, the polio vaccine we use today is the fourth polio vaccine, because the other three, after having been given to people for many years, were finally withdrawn because of mounting evidence of damage."
"We are supposed to respect the precautionary principle in Europe, especially when we are talking about putting genetically-modified organisms into the environment, considering that, with GM, any resulting adverse effects may be irreversible."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, I know that the GMO authorisations are a sensitive issue but, first of all, we have to remind ourselves that, based on European legislation adopted by Parliament and the Council, GMO products are allowed in the European Union, provided they go through the authorisation procedure I have just described."
"That authorisation procedure provides for the risk assessment to be done by EFSA."
"So, whether some of us agree or disagree with the concept of GMO products, we are all bound by the European legislation."
"This is the rule of law so we have to follow it."
"First of all, on EFSA's work, as you know, Parliament was informed and I came along myself as well."
"We have taken decisions on improving the work of EFSA to make it more thorough and to take more account of the views of the Member States and all scientific developments that may take place during the authorisation procedure."
"The Commission adopted an action plan which has been put in place already and is being implemented and which will also be included in the legislative framework sometime in 2008."
"It is part of the Annual Policy Strategy for 2008."
"There we take into account how we can improve the situation and make proposals based on the views of the Member States and on long-term effects and many other aspects."
"I also have to insist that in the European Union we have the highest standards and the strictest legislation when it comes to GMO products."
"That is why you know we have continuously been taken to the WTO and are not doing so well there."
"But nevertheless our legislation has been accepted by the WTO because it is science-based and the decisions are based on risk assessment so, in this way, we can fulfil our international obligations by taking into account primarily and foremost the safety of European consumers and European citizens."
"So it is not a question of personal preferences but an issue of applying the existing legislation."
"I know Mrs Breyer referred to those questions."
"There is a procedure."
"We have to get information."
"You will be provided with all the details on these questions."
"But again the questions arising are linked to the risk and the risk is not being assessed by us."
"It is assessed by EFSA."
"Therefore, we have to wait for the decision of EFSA on this issue before we actually provide the replies."
"On this specific product there were many evaluations and many studies."
"They all caused EFSA to re-evaluate and reassess its position and it came to the same conclusions."
"So it was not something taken lightly."
"It was not something that was ignored."
"Whenever there was new science and new evidence, this was taken into account and we asked EFSA, which again is the risk assessor of the European Union, to take them into account."
"It is true that EFSA's latest opinion was based on the existing study but also Professor S√©ralini's paper was on the same study."
"It was a question of how you analyse, how you do statistical analysis of the existing data and that is why we had a special task force on statistical analysis, internally and externally, and it came to the conclusion that there were flaws in the analysis and the conclusions of Professor S√©ralini."
"That does not always mean that he who is negative is always right."
"Sometimes people who are positive as well may be accurate and correct."
"Finally, as to the issue of which studies the authorisation would be based on, the decision was that we would continue with the legislation that was originally adopted; that the applicant has the responsibility of providing the data and the studies information."
"In this way, they have the burden of proof which is assessed by the authorities."
"The authorities can ask for any further additional studies they would like and in this way they have the responsibility of proving their case."
"I will not go into the issue of the cost of eventually changing the system."
"The cost will eventually be a burden on the taxpayers of the European Union and not the industry."
"But the main reason is they should have the burden of proof and therefore the authority can analyse this data based on a critical analysis."
"I would like to remind you that a similar situation is used in the EMEA, the medicine authority of the European Union, where again the industry provides all the clinical trials and clinical studies and the decision is taken."
"So I can assure you that we take into account and we will make sure that the EFSA takes into account and assesses and evaluates any new scientific evidence that may arise and the moment a risk is identified we will not hesitate to take the appropriate measures."
"As you know, we have done that and I personally have done that in the past on many occasions with unauthorised products."
"The debate is closed."
"PNR Agreement with the United States (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the PNR Agreement with the United States."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"Mr President, as you already know, the United States and the European Union concluded talks on a long-term PNR agreement."
"I want to use this occasion to thank the German Presidency and in particular Minister Sch√§uble for his personal involvement in making this happen."
"The unanimous mandate given by the Council of Ministers has been fulfilled."
"The new agreement provides for a high level of data protection and important commitments on the handling of future European PNR data."
"Several important interests had to be addressed."
"Firstly, the fight against terrorism and serious international crime, and in parallel the right to privacy and protection of fundamental civil rights, the need for air carriers to be able to comply with diverse legal requirements at an acceptable economic cost, the wider transatlantic relationship and the true international scope of these issues."
"The United States has agreed on a binding international agreement and by doing so they have understood the need for legal certainty."
"The agreement is divided into three parts."
"First, an agreement signed by both parties."
"Second, a letter which the United States sent to the EU in which it set out assurances on the way in which it will handle European PNR data in the future."
"And third, a letter from the EU to the United States acknowledging the receipt of assurances and confirming that on that basis it considers the level of protection afforded by the US Department of Homeland Security to be adequate for European PNR data."
"In the past, the exchange of undertakings was not binding in character."
"It was in my personal view, but also in the view of the Council, a major achievement of the new agreement."
"This agreement will be valid for 7 years, thus providing for a considerable period of legal certainty."
"There is not an extension of the time during which passenger data are kept from 3.5 to 15 years."
"There is an increase from 3.5 to 7 years of the time during which data are kept in an active file."
"The further period of 8 years that was already provided for in the previous agreements and that undertaking is not newly introduced in this new agreement."
"The purpose for which data will be used remains the same."
"The number of PNR data has been reduced from 34 to 19 as a result of rationalisation and merging."
"Sensitive data will be filtered and made accessible only in exceptional circumstances which have been justified and will be deleted after 30 days."
"Those air carriers not already pushing the data will go from a 'pull' to a 'push' system as soon it becomes technically feasible."
"It is now up to air carriers to introduce new technologies as soon as possible, but both the United States and the EU agree that this system should be a 'push' system and no longer a 'pull' system."
"The Commissioner for Justice, Freedom and Security and the United States Secretary of Homeland Security will be responsible for the review system."
"Finally, the United States has accepted a review system which was likely to be agreed at the beginning of our negotiations."
"Protection given under the United States Privacy Act will be extended through administrative procedures to non-US citizens, in particular with regard to redress and correction, and, therefore, EU citizens will be entitled to protection under that Act."
"That was not the case under the previous agreement."
"Common efforts are needed in order to protect our societies, including our human rights, from attempts by terrorists to undermine them."
"The recent events in London and Glasgow have shown that terrorism will stay with us for some time."
"That is why, as I have already announced, I will present a package in the autumn, which will include new measures - both legislative and operational - aimed at improving and increasing our capacity to cooperate at an international level against terrorism."
"I shall also propose that the EU Member States establish a European PNR system at national level in as many Member States as possible."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr Frattini, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Frattini and the German Presidency on the effort they have put into concluding this PNR Agreement."
"It was essential to avoid a legal vacuum that would have left European airlines in a difficult position and jeopardised the protection of our citizens."
"We have always supported having an international agreement at EU level instead of 27 bilateral agreements, because the Union can put forward a stronger position not only on preventing and fighting terrorism, but also on protecting fundamental rights."
"That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was in favour of granting the Commission a mandate to reopen negotiations."
"We are well aware that the negotiations were difficult and also that the European side wanted to find a mutually acceptable solution more strongly than the US side did."
"I find it regrettable, however, that this agreement is composed of three parts: an agreement and two letters, the binding nature of which is not all the same."
"There are several points that have changed for the better, and Mr Frattini has mentioned a number of them, but there are others that have fallen well short of our expectations."
"The points I would highlight are these: first, I welcome the reduction in the number of PNR data, and I welcome the switch from a pull to a push system, as mentioned just now."
"We know that 13 airlines have implemented the system already, but many others have not yet done so."
"I would like to know what kind of initiatives the Commission is preparing to help and encourage airlines to switch over."
"I still cannot accept what I consider to be an excessively long data storage period."
"I am pleased at the inclusion of the requirement to give passengers adequate information and I welcome the appeal procedures for passengers, whereby they can review and correct data held by the US authorities, although there is still no sound legal mechanism allowing European citizens to appeal if their personal data are misused."
"I am afraid that the additional measures for protecting sensitive data are inadequate, and I regret that the use of data by other US agencies has not been fully guaranteed."
"A lot has been done, Commissioner, but there is still a lot left to do, and I hope that the control mechanism that you have agreed upon will allow some of the negative points that remain to be corrected."
"Mr Vice-President, I honestly wish I could congratulate you today on achieving an agreement with the USA; my political group knows how hard you have worked, especially in the face of the USA's threat that, in the absence of agreement, they would unilaterally impose even worse terms on the airline companies."
"Unfortunately, what we have in our hands, first of all, is not an agreement with the USA."
"It is in fact an agreement with the USA and with any other countries to which the USA unilaterally decides to transfer personal data on European passengers."
"Secondly, it is an agreement that contains commitments only for Europe and not for the USA."
"Thirdly, even where the agreement sets certain limits, these limits are so unclear and so full of legal loopholes that in practice it will allow the USA to do pretty much as it likes."
"Let me be more specific: firstly, the agreement and the attached letter from the USA state that America will be able to transfer the information we send it to any third country it likes, with hardly any obligation to even notify us."
"In other words, in practice, Europe is signing the PNR agreement not only with the USA but with any other countries on earth which the USA decides, countries which cannot today receive data on European citizens directly from Europe, because we have not signed an agreement with them."
"Did your negotiating mandate from the Council really include the authority to allow the uncontrolled transfer of European data by the USA where Europe cannot do so?"
"Secondly, while Europe has expressly declared that it is bound by the agreement, the USA has expressly declared that they are not bound by the agreement."
"They are only bound by the unilateral assurances in their letter and by American laws which, if they change, will automatically bring about changes to the agreement."
"Thirdly, as far as passenger information on the use of their data is concerned, there is no provision for an obligation by the governments to ensure they are informed; the airline companies are merely urged to do so."
"But information for citizens is an express dictat of European laws."
"Why did you not mention this?"
"Fourthly, if the USA infringes the agreement, the only solution open to the European Union is to abolish it completely."
"How will this be done, Commissioner, when even if 26 of the 27 Member States consider that it has been infringed and one considers that it has not, the agreement cannot be abolished at European level?"
"Fifthly, the legal intended uses of the data cited are uncontrolled."
"While at the beginning of the letter they are limited to combating terrorism and serious crime, immediately afterwards any use is allowed in any criminal proceedings or however otherwise required under US law, that is, for almost anything."
"This is not an international agreement; at least not as the citizens understand the term."
"I do hope it will be changed on these crucial points before it is signed."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, first of all I note that the Council Presidency is absent during this important debate, which is remarkable as it was responsible for the negotiations."
"I am therefore thankful for the presence of Mr Frattini."
"However, I would like to start by objecting to the implicit link that Mr Frattini makes with the failed terrorist attacks in the UK last week."
"I find that distasteful: it has nothing to do with PNR."
"That brings me to an important point that this House has emphasised many times and that is the need for an evaluation."
"We need evidence that the use of PNR data leads to greater security and that they are not used only to catch people who commit document fraud, drug smuggling or whatever."
"We need evidence and not just anecdotes."
"Mr Frattini says that this is a good agreement."
"Well, it serves two purposes: firstly, to legalise the transfer of data by carriers and, secondly, to provide, as he has said, a high level of data protection."
"Well, it fails miserably on the second objective; it is not legally binding, it explicitly states that it does not confer any rights on any person or any party."
"Well, how much clearer can it get?"
"Then, it looks good superficially, but it is full of loopholes, open definitions and exceptions, when it comes to purpose limitation, for example, or the retention periods, which are going up to 15 years and maybe even more, and they will be applied retroactively."
"I am not a lawyer, but that strikes me as distinctly funny."
"The reduction from 34 to 19 data is an insult to our intelligence."
"If you look at the data, it is not a reduction: the 34 are merged into 19 data fields."
"I am not stupid."
"We may not have any powers here but we are not stupid."
"Then with pull to push: we got that promise back in 2004."
"We still do not have it!"
"It is technically feasible, so why do we not have it?"
"Democratic oversight is completely lacking."
"This House may not have competences any more, but the national parliaments are completely excluded."
"Some of the national parliaments will get to approve the agreement, but they can only say 'yes' or 'yes', because they do not have time, they do not get all the necessary information - only very summary information - and it has just been pointed out that if one national parliament says 'no' then there is no agreement and no parliament will want to take that responsibility, so they have their backs against the wall."
"With regard to the Privacy Act, it is good that it now covers European citizens."
"We asked for that many times."
"However, we all know that the Bush Administration uses all sorts of exceptions and exemptions to the Privacy Act, which, incidentally, affects American citizens as it does European citizens."
"To conclude, concerning Mr Frattini's proposal on a European PNR scheme - which is not a real proposal because he floated it at a press conference rather than putting a real proposal before this House, I think the timing - last week - was wrong and I would like to know what the justification is for such a scheme."
"We do not even know what purpose the PNR agreement with the United States serves."
"We do not know how many terrorists were caught, how many attacks were prevented and how many false positives there have been."
"We have insisted on an evaluation before signing a new agreement."
"Finally, I would like to recommend that the PPE-DE Group support the joint motion for a resolution that we will negotiate tomorrow, read the agreement very carefully and read between the lines, because it is not as good as it looks."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (NL) Mr President, this is the third agreement we are discussing in this Parliament on the transfer of passenger data to the United States, and things are not getting any better."
"Commissioner Frattini, you claim that the data is only used for the fight against terrorism or against serious international crime."
"As you know the agreement well, you will also be aware that Annex II stipulates, as Mr Lambrinidis said, or otherwise required by law, by US-law that is, which opens up its scope considerably, of course."
"In general, I think that this is not the place either where you should make things out to be better than they really are."
"This also applies to the data, as Mrs in 't Veld said a moment ago."
"I have the two annexes here in front of me: an old annex to the old agreement and a new annex to the new agreement, one of which contains 19 data fields while the other contains 34."
"I would very much like to hear from you presently what data, according to you, will no longer be transferred to the United States."
"I want to know this very specifically because, as I see it, there is not one data field that will no longer be transferred to the United States, let alone 15."
"Turning to the other item of push and pull, here too, I am tired of people acting as if major progress is being made."
"On two occasions, the Americans have moved this proposal, and you have had to negotiate once again with a view to them simply delivering on their own promises."
"Surely this is unacceptable in transatlantic relations."
"Finally, I checked the DHS [Department of Homeland Security] website today for redress inquiries."
"It states that if you think you are under suspicion and that you are on a watch list of people who are denied airline boarding, they cannot let you know what the data is that they have on you, but you will have to inform them of the reason why you think you are under suspicion."
"Surely this is not the way to let people seek travel redress!"
"So I would have to say to you, yes, I might be a vegetarian, but this will really not tell you anything."
"It is too absurd for words that people do not have access to the data on which they appear to be judged."
"(NL) Mr President, following endless debates, pulling and pushing, I had hoped for an adequate explanation where effectiveness is concerned, or the supposed effectiveness of an agreement such as this one."
"However, this hope soon evaporated when I read the agreement, one that was announced with so much pomp and circumstance by Mr Sch√§uble and others, including yourself."
"Not a word was breathed about this supposed effectiveness."
"How many terrorists have been stopped in their tracks on the basis of the existing interim agreement?"
"Of course, like the Commission, I too understand the importance of having an agreement, not least on account of the position of the European aviation industry."
"Legal certainty is important to everyone, but rules and regulations should not be there for rules and regulations' sake."
"What struck me, above all, having read this agreement, is that a great deal is coming out of our own pocket."
"It remains completely beyond me why we as a Union allow ourselves to be pushed into such an underdog position."
"Both the Council and Commission could learn from the perseverance displayed by our champion Mrs in 't Veld."
"All credit therefore to her and her unstinting efforts."
"Finally, whilst the fight against terrorism is, of course, an important one, I cannot shake off the impression that we are at risk of losing sight of reality in this matter."
"This agreement is not enough, not by a long shot."
"Mr President, I am afraid that I am going to continue in a slightly sceptical line, but first of all a question to the Commissioner."
"Could he please tell us what is the legal basis of this agreement from the EU side?"
"The only reference I can find to any legal instruments in it are to US Statutes."
"I do not find any reference to legal bases from the Treaties."
"I remember talk of Articles 24 and 38 earlier on."
"If Article 38 is one of them, then why is the European Parliament not formally consulted?"
"Secondly, we hear a lot about needing this to fight terrorism."
"If terrorism is such an important priority of the EU, why have we gone four months without a counter-terrorism coordinator?"
"Thirdly, this agreement is about collecting a huge amount of data on everyone, as a basis for profiling, data mining etc., but we have very poor implementation of targeted measures against terrorism."
"The Director of Interpol has just launched what has been called in the press an 'unprecedented attack on the UK' for failing to check visitors against the Interpol database of stolen passports."
"When the Commission produced a report last year on the common position of January 2005, it was distinctly unimpressed by Member States' achievements."
"Only a small number of Member States had established infrastructures for authorities to search the Interpol databases - 8 of the 25 Member States did not respond to the Commission's inquiries - and very few Member States had made sure that their law enforcement authorities searched the database."
"Member States are completely ignoring their obligations."
"Finally, we have the EU APIS Directive of 2004, which should have been implemented last year."
"Could the Commissioner tell us whether the Member States have implemented this Directive, why it is concerned only with illegal immigration and why it does not provide for visitors to be checked against terrorist watch lists?"
"There are plenty of measures out there which are being completely unimplemented by Member States."
"Let us do that first before we have mass surveillance of the whole population."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank all those who have spoken, even though I do not agree with most of their speeches, but you know that I always speak my mind with absolute frankness."
"Ladies and gentlemen, agreements are made between two parties."
"The United States has the power to accept or reject an agreement."
"We had a duty, first of all, to ask the Council of Ministers for a mandate, which we were given and within which we have operated."
"The agreement has been approved by the Member States - after all, they granted us the power to negotiate - so they clearly thought that having this agreement was immensely better than the possibility of not having any agreement at all after 31 July this year, which is actually in a few days' time."
"Quite frankly, I should like to have heard those who criticised this agreement so harshly make at least one comment on the consequences of not having any agreement at all."
"Can any of you imagine that the airlines would have negotiated bilaterally with the United States and achieved a better level of personal data protection?"
"I do not think anyone can even imagine that that might have happened."
"The protection of European citizens' personal data would have been in serious jeopardy without the certainty of legally binding rules."
"As you know, for the first time we have a binding agreement, unlike the previous one, which involved no binding commitments but just unilateral ones."
"In this agreement, we have recognised the 'push' principle as a fundamental criterion, as this Parliament has demanded on several occasions."
"The fact that some airlines have said that they are not yet in a position to switch over from pull to push does not depend on either the United States or Europe, but rather on the fact that some of them have so far been unable to change system on technical grounds."
"Since others have been able to do so, it must depend on their technical ability and willingness, and we shall help them to make the move."
"We have set the 'push' system as a criterion; if, however, an airline says it is technically unable to implement it, other proposals need to be examined."
"Can we deny that airline landing rights?"
"I am ready to examine any proposals, but we have also set a deadline, which is the end of this year. That seems technically feasible, since IATA (the International Air Transport Association) has told us that it is reasonable to expect all airlines to be technically capable of introducing the new system within six months."
"It is purely down to technical reasons."
"We have established that sensitive data will be destroyed within 30 days, a measure that had not been agreed previously, and we have established that the US Privacy Act will apply to European citizens, something that had been mentioned in many debates here in Parliament as an essential condition: European citizens will be able to complain under the same law as US citizens if the US Department of Homeland Security misuses their data."
"That is something that did not exist before, and I am giving you actual facts."
"Mr Lambrinidis has rightly mentioned third countries."
"It is true that the data in question can be passed on to third countries but, as you know, it is laid down that there will be the same power of control over the correct use of such data."
"The fact that they are passed on to a third country does not affect the power of control: the third country will use the data in accordance with the very same rules laid down in this agreement and we shall retain the same power to check whether the data have been used properly or not."
"Someone asked about the possibility of terminating the agreement."
"The possibility does of course exist, in the event of a substantial breach, and you are perfectly well aware of the legal basis adopted."
"Article 24 of the Treaty is an intergovernmental basis and not, unfortunately, a Community basis, because the European Union Court of Justice has so ruled."
"An agreement had previously been negotiated on a basis that allowed for your full participation as the European Parliament."
"Unfortunately, the Court of Justice ruling established that the legal basis was incorrect and, as you know, everything stems from that ruling."
"It is a fact, Mr Lambsdorff, that many Member States are not complying with European measures, which instead ought to be fully implemented."
"You know perfectly well not only that I published the state of the art country by country just a few days ago, but also that I have initiated infringement procedures, and I do not think I need to wait for the outcome of those to adopt useful proposals to combat terrorism."
"I do not share the opinion of those who say, 'We should do other things first and then worry about terrorism.'"
"Terrorism is a serious and present threat."
"I think this agreement could have been better if we had been negotiating it alone but, since agreements are made between two sides, it is a compromise and, in the spirit of compromise, the Council of Ministers approved it unanimously."
"In my view it was right to do so, and the German Presidency was given due recognition for all the hard work it put into this agreement."
"It is a binding agreement which will certainly help to fight terrorism or, better still, to prevent it."
"No member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should forget that the US Secretary of Homeland Security came to Parliament and gave you some information and, in some cases, specific facts about terror suspects who were stopped thanks to PNR data."
"There were just a few cases, but they concern people who were stopped thanks to PNR data and were later involved in bomb attacks elsewhere in the world."
"Despite all the impact assessments that we have conducted and may yet conduct, I believe that the agreement in question, which provides legal certainty, is infinitely better than the absence of an agreement."
"I am sorry that we do not agree on this point, but I have a duty to be sincere."
"Mr President, we are lacking an important piece of information."
"The PPE-DE Group is basing its positive opinion partly on the fact that the amount of data now being sent to the US is reduced from 34 to 19."
"I have challenged the Commission to say which of the 15 pieces of information are no longer being transferred to the US, because as far as I see it - and the rapporteur Sophia in 't Veld also mentioned this - most of the fields are merged so that the change is mainly cosmetic."
"I would like to be convinced that the opposite is true."
"I would like the Commission to list the 15 information fields which are now no longer being transferred to the US."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday 12 July 2007."
"Measuring devices containing mercury (debate)"
"The next item is the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury (05665/1/2007 - C6-0114/2007 - (Rapporteur: Mar√≠a Sornosa Mart√≠nez)."
"rapporteur. - (ES) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we in this House all agree that it is necessary to reduce the demand for mercury in the manufacture of products and to speed up its substitution."
"It would be appropriate to introduce Community level marketing restrictions on mercury-containing measuring and control equipment for consumer use, with some exemptions in the healthcare sector."
"We want to prevent significant amounts of mercury entering the waste stream."
"In that way, we shall contribute to guaranteeing a high level of protection of the environment and human health, whilst preserving the internal market, as required by Article 95 of the Treaty."
"Mercury and its components are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife."
"Initially seen as a diffuse local problem, mercury pollution is now understood to be global, chronic and serious."
"As regards a potential blanket ban on the use of mercury in all devices, which is the aim of this proposal, it should be emphasised that the experts the Commission consulted have come to the conclusion that hospitals need devices with a high level of accuracy to treat life-threatening conditions such as hypertension, arrhythmia and pre-eclampsia."
"Mercury sphygmomanometers provide the appropriate level of accuracy and reliability to ensure patient safety. We are therefore currently proposing that these instruments be exempted from the ban until there are complete guarantees with regard to the functioning of possible alternative instruments."
"I would also once again call upon the Commission to adopt short-term measures to ensure that all products containing mercury currently circulating in society are collected separately and safely processed. Otherwise, this Directive will be less effective in practice."
"With regard to the production of new traditional barometers containing mercury, which has been the most controversial aspect in this Parliament, we proposed an agreement that there would be a transitional period of two years for manufacturers to enable them to adapt to the new rules."
"Unfortunately, not all of the political groups have agreed to this, though I believe that we will have a sufficient majority in this House to adopt it."
"With regard to the manufacturers of these barometers, I would like to say that they will have this transitional period of two years in order to stop using mercury in their industrial processes. They will not suffer any competitive disadvantage or economic harm, since we know that they have been manufacturing this kind of barometer without using mercury for some time."
"We must remind our citizens that this equipment may pose a risk to health and the environment, since it can break easily and end up being dumped, or, worse still, if it is burnt, the mercury is dispersed into the atmosphere, polluting the air, the soil and water."
"Mercury thereby enters the food chain, mainly into fish, and then us human beings."
"As this House is well aware, at second reading, a majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has rejected the amendments intended to make it possible to continue manufacturing new mercury barometers."
"I believe that it would be irresponsible for us to accept that request and I therefore call upon all the honourable Members to vote against it, as the Council and the European Commission also propose, and I thank them for all of their efforts to avoid a possible conciliation procedure."
"Finally, I would once again call upon the Commission to increase awareness within the population through the organisation of information campaigns on the health risks resulting from exposure to mercury and the environmental problems it may cause, since I fear that the citizens are not yet sufficiently well-informed about its toxicity, unfortunately."
"I would like to end by thanking the Commission for its work and for the possibility of reaching an agreement at second reading."
"Thanks, too, to the Council and to the political groups that have supported this proposal."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by offering my sincere thanks to Mrs Sornoza Mart√≠nez, the rapporteur, on her work on this proposal."
"We are discussing a very important directive this evening."
"It is an important part of our strategy for banishing mercury from our environment for ever - a strategy that has long been backed by the European Parliament."
"Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to human health and the environment."
"The directive will therefore bring a major step forward, it will restrict the marketing of certain new measuring devices containing mercury and in that way prevent some 30 tonnes of mercury entering the environment through waste every year."
"The proposed directive aims to cut the use of this hazardous material in measuring instruments to a minimum and to allow exceptions only where the risks are negligible or there are no substitutes."
"Thus, the marketing of mercury-containing fever thermometers will be banned completely, for example, and the sale of all other mercury-containing measuring instruments to the general public will be prevented."
"I believe it is right that there will be an exception for blood pressure meters in the health sector and for antique measuring instruments."
"The proposals were drawn up on the basis of a risk assessment and detailed impact assessment that were developed for the mercury strategy."
"This directive does not only safeguard human health and the environment, it will also serve to maintain the internal market, since it will introduce harmonised rules for the marketing of mercury-containing measuring devices everywhere in the Community."
"The rapporteur recommends approval of the Council common position without further amendment."
"The Commission agrees with this entirely, since the common position has adopted some of the amendments tabled by Parliament at first reading and represents a balanced compromise between the effort to ban the use of mercury to the greatest possible extent in order to safeguard human health and the environment on the one hand while ensuring the safety of patients in the health sector on the other."
"I must confirm what the rapporteur has already said: the majority of experts still consider mercury-containing blood pressure meters, sphygmomanometers, essential in the treatment of certain life-threatening diseases."
"We shall have to look into this matter, however. If there are safe alternatives available for these instruments, too, then mercury should be banned here as well."
"The Commission will therefore be reviewing the derogation in two years' time."
"A further derogation means that antique measuring instruments, that is those that are at least 50 years old, will still be able to be sold."
"The Commission is able to agree with this because antique instruments are predominantly collector's items which, because of their value, are handled very carefully and come onto the market in only very small numbers."
"In the Commission's view, however, there is no justification for an unlimited derogation for the further sale of new mercury barometers to consumers."
"Since there are alternatives to mercury barometers that are just as decorative and reliable, there is absolutely no need for this hazardous substance to be used in the manufacture of barometers."
"An unlimited derogation for such instruments would be in stark contradiction to the stance taken by the European Parliament in relation to highly dangerous substances when adopting the new REACH legislation on chemicals."
"A transitional period of two years, as now provided in the directive, is perfectly adequate to allow the few remaining manufacturers of mercury barometers to convert to alternatives."
"In any case, many of those manufacturers, if not all of them, already offer alternative products."
"Under no circumstances, therefore, will the Commission agree to the amendments that have been tabled seeking permanent derogations for barometers."
"I urgently request your assistance in backing the common position so that the directive can now be adopted at second reading."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, we have been through these arguments on a number of occasions so I shall keep my argument as brief as possible."
"The only remaining issue to be resolved, as the Commissioner and Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez pointed out, is that of barometers."
"I have to say that I remain deeply convinced that both the Commission and the Council, and some Members of this Parliament, have got the argument completely wrong."
"There is no justification whatsoever for a ban on barometers."
"They are only being singled out because there is only a relatively small number of companies which still produce them in Europe and they are an easy target as far as the Commission is concerned, to make it look as though they are actually doing something about mercury, whereas the big sources of release of mercury - from power stations, crematoria, etc. - are not being tackled because, of course, to tackle them would be very expensive for Member State governments and local authorities."
"This Parliament passed an amendment to exempt barometer-makers at first reading in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and in this Parliament."
"The Council then rejected it, albeit with a two-year phase-out period."
"The Environment Committee did not support the amendment this time round, I am sorry to say, but I have retabled the amendments in order to give Parliament a further opportunity to make a decision on this and, as Members are no doubt aware, a very vigorous campaign is being fought by a number of independent operators and distributors throughout Europe."
"It is a completely illogical position to say that antique instruments will be exempted but new instruments will be banned."
"There are probably more antique instruments being circulated and placed on the market in Europe than there are new instruments being created."
"It is a very small minority specialist market and Europe brings itself into disrepute by delegitimising, by banning, by forcing out of business, a small number of very entrepreneurial and gifted craftsmen."
"They can be controlled by a proper licensing and control regime which they have said that they are willing to pay for."
"That would be by far the most sensible solution rather than an outright ban and to force a number of small companies out of business, thereby losing the skills and traditions that have existed in Europe for several hundred years."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, I am indebted to Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez, who has our warm and unqualified support."
"Mercury, and particularly mercury compounds and mercury vapours, is toxic."
"Mercury can accumulate in brain tissue and the nervous system, where it can wreak great havoc."
"This, in turn, can lead to reduced intelligence."
"An intelligent policy, therefore, prohibits the use of mercury in unnecessary applications."
"Given that alternatives are available, it is to be welcomed that the mercury thermometer is consigned to the past."
"Barometers are the subject of much debate."
"In the Netherlands, the use of mercury has been banned since 2003, but barometers were exempt until 2005 and then, pending fresh European rules, until 1 January 2006."
"We are willing to extend the exemption period by another two years for traditional barometers, which are, it has to be said, delightful things."
"As this brings the total delay to 1 January 2010, there is enough time to develop alternatives, which, as the Commissioner confirmed, are already available to a large extent."
"Whilst I can, of course, imagine that this is hard for producers of barometers to take, if we want to banish mercury altogether, we must in any event ban consumer products that contain it."
"Barometers may break or leak, so that mercury ends up in the environment anyway."
"I therefore agree with the producers of barometers that the use of mercury in low-energy light bulbs is, of course, also very harmful."
"It is a good idea to change over to LED lights as soon as possible, but this Directive is about mercury in measuring devices and not about low-energy light bulbs."
"I would therefore once again like to express my warm support to Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez, who I believe has chosen a very good line of attack."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I wish to congratulate Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez on her excellent report."
"This legislative report follows the mercury strategy report adopted by this House last year."
"It aims at restricting the placing on the market of new measuring devices containing mercury."
"Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez rightly agrees in the main with the proposal before us and reserves only some derogations in cases where there are no appropriate substitutes yet available."
"My group strongly supports this proposal and considers the rapporteur's amendments useful and appropriate."
"Overall, the proposal meets with widespread agreement across Parliament, apart from the single, well-known issue of the barometer controversy."
"The difference, as you know, is that the Council has agreed to the compromise proposal to grant a two-year derogation after the entry into force of the directive to a small number of producers of traditional-looking, present-day manufactured barometers."
"This, we feel, is a reasonable solution and gives those manufacturers time to implement mercury-free substitutes into their products."
"This view is not shared by some colleagues who hold the opinion expressed in Amendments 1 and 2 that there should be a permanent derogation for traditional-looking barometers."
"The matter is not of huge importance in substance, as the amount of mercury used in these instruments is tiny and safety measures are adequately implemented by the manufacturers."
"At the same time, as a question of principle, no long-term derogation is necessary as the manufacturers have ample time to adapt in the case of safe alternative chemicals without the need to introduce a risky precedent in safety directives."
"The issue has, unfortunately, been blown out of all proportion by a section of the national press that want to portray the matter as one of heartless and bureaucratic big-brother-style EU interfering with poor, honest-to-goodness traditional instrument manufacturers and trying to destroy them."
"This, as you will appreciate, is not true."
"The position of my group is to follow scientific logic and not to accept permanent derogations for barometers but, realising the strength of feeling amongst some MEPs, we will not be unduly strict with those in our group who choose not to follow the group line, although there is always the risk of the barometer amendment going through and jeopardising the whole proposal."
"Let us hope that this will not happen."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury is an important document as it limits the amount of mercury released into the environment."
"Mercury enters the food chain in the form of methylmercury in an aquatic environment, affecting fish, fruit, vegetables and eventually human beings."
"It accumulates in our bodies and poisons us."
"Every year, 33 tonnes of mercury enter into circulation in new equipment and 27 tonnes in used equipment."
"Technical advances have reduced the use of mercury in industry and manufactured products."
"In dealing with mercury it is essential to recover it from used equipment and to drastically reduce imports of such equipment from countries outside the Union."
"All European Union Member States should impose a ban of this kind following early amendment of Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain dangerous substances and preparations."
"I would like to thank Mrs Sornosa Mart√≠nez for her work."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (SV) I used to play with mercury as a little boy."
"Hopefully, this directive will mean that future generations of children will not do so."
"There is now a compromise with the Council, and it is high time that we accepted it."
"We know that mercury is harmful both to people and to the environment and that it can almost always be replaced by less dangerous substances."
"The compromise in the Council of Ministers is a balanced one and comes 14 years after Sweden introduced its national ban on mercury thermometers."
"There is no more time to lose."
"Those who are now considering voting through a technically unjustified proposal from the barometer lobby should know that the whole ban will be in danger of being delayed and made more difficult to implement if the proposal is approved."
"It would be irresponsible to vote through such a proposal."
"Dentists, laboratories and hospitals have phased out mercury."
"There is no difficulty at all in measuring air pressure without mercury."
"Anyone nostalgic for an old barometer will be able to buy one."
"Even with this ban - which does not apply to antiques - it is still legal to do so in the internal market."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (PL) Mr President, it has long been known that mercury compounds are harmful to human beings and to the environment."
"Mercury enters the food chain easily."
"The groups most at risk are children, including unborn children, and people in direct contact with mercury."
"Mercury damages the human body by impairing the nervous system, coordination, and also sight, with negative consequences for health and the environment."
"It is therefore right and proper to introduce provisions restricting the use of mercury in certain measuring devices."
"Medical devices containing mercury should, however, be withdrawn from the market gradually, especially in new Member States that have only limited resources available for their health services."
"By way of example it is estimated that the additional public expenditure required pursuant to a ban on the use of mercury thermometers will amount to around PLN 3 million a year."
"Sudden withdrawal of measuring devices containing mercury will not only be very costly, but may also dissuade people from measuring temperature and blood pressure."
"This is particularly serious as cheap electronic devices are not very accurate."
"We proposed extending the transitional period, which would reduce the costs significantly."
"We also believe that the ban should exclude thermometers for premature babies because of the specific range of measurements, their reliability and precision, and also ovulation thermometers used to diagnose irregularities and for reproduction as part of the basic natural family planning method."
"In addition, veterinary thermometers are required for use in the diagnosis of animal diseases."
"Finally, I should like to say that such hurried changes to legislation tend to arouse suspicions that vested interests are involved."
"In this case, withdrawal of equipment containing mercury might not be due exclusively to a desire to protect health and the environment."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this measuring devices directive is intended to remove around 30 tonnes of mercury from circulation, not very much but nevertheless an appreciable quantity."
"The dangers of mercury are well known, its neurotoxicity undisputed."
"Where human health is at risk, I believe the strict principle of substitution applies."
"Where mercury is absolutely necessary and there are no alternatives, it can be retained under strict conditions."
"Exceptions are therefore permitted only where there are no significant risks or where no alternatives are yet available."
"The exceptions include sphygmomanometers for special applications and old measuring instruments, and it goes without saying that the number of old measuring instruments will continue to fall of its own accord."
"I believe the transitional period of two years for barometers is quite sufficient."
"The decisive thing for me is the harmonisation of the internal market, which is taken a step further here."
"I approve the common position."
"(SV) It is, in actual fact, astonishing that we are forced to have this debate."
"Mercury is one of the most dangerous poisons in our midst."
"Of course it should not be used unless absolutely necessary."
"I am amazed that anyone at all can believe that it is more important to go on manufacturing old-style barometers and thermometers than to protect public health."
"As a pregnant woman, I am all too aware of all the risks that mercury entails."
"I know that no one who is to give birth should eat the fish that I myself and others like me ate throughout the period when we were growing up."
"Is that how things should be?"
"Should it not be possible for young women to eat ordinary food?"
"Should pregnant woman have to worry that their unborn children have been damaged by mercury from, for example, products that quite unnecessarily contain that substance?"
"In the run-up to this debate we received letters to the effect that we must safeguard the manufacture of traditional barometers."
"That is genuinely embarrassing."
"How can anyone believe that I attach more importance to whatever pleasure there may be in owning a barometer than to the risk posed to future generations by the use of mercury?"
"I hope that, by voting tomorrow against all the amendments aimed at retaining the use of mercury, all my fellow Members will show how embarrassing those letters are and demonstrate that we are taking our responsibility for the environment and public health seriously."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I agree: mercury is highly toxic."
"It is harmful to the environment, to animals and, through the food chain and by other routes, to human beings."
"It is right that this element should be replaced where it is possible and sensible to do so, but not always and at any price and not because of the properties of the substance itself, but whenever its use really does present a hazard to the environment."
"We cannot remove mercury from circulation completely in any case, because then we would also have to say goodbye to another product that is much valued by many Members of this House."
"The energy-saving light bulb, which many would prefer to impose by law in order to protect the climate, also contains mercury."
"If energy-saving light bulbs were universally used, we would have at least as much of it in our households as at present with traditional barometers."
"I do not think much of banning mercury and a whole group of craft businesses from the EU market tomorrow while at the same time wanting to screw mercury lamps into our light fittings."
"I would be interested to hear what the Commissioner has to say about these conflicting aims."
"(SK) Mercury is used in many measuring devices, thermometers and barometers."
"Mercury has also been used successfully, and without major health implications, in dentistry in the form of amalgam fillings."
"On the other hand, however, under certain circumstances mercury is known to be harmful and can accumulate in living organisms, including the human body."
"We are all aware that the Council's joint position includes most of the amendments already adopted by the European Parliament on 14 November 2006."
"This was reflected in the text, where the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs see almost eye to eye, so that we were close to finalising the legislative process during the first reading."
"There is a major point of difference between the Council and Parliament, however, concerning the production of devices which use mercury, notably barometers."
"As we know, Parliament voted in favour of a complete exemption, whereas the Council is proposing an exemption limited to two years, which appears to be appropriate."
"A ban would apply to new mercury barometers, but it seems sensible to regard second-hand barometers as acceptable, as this would make possible their continued sale, repair and maintenance."
"As a citizen and consumer, I support the type of compromise backed by the rapporteur, which will not jeopardise the overall health of the general public and will enable conventional barometer manufacturers to adapt more quickly to the new situation."
"Mr President, I think we should remind ourselves that this is part of a wider strategy to phase out mercury."
"No sector has been singled out - not thermometers, nor barometers - because there is going to be a set of actions over a number of years."
"I think Mr Ulmer got it right: we have agreed under the REACH Directive that if there is a safe alternative to dangerous chemicals, we should move towards that alternative."
"We have all agreed on that in this House; all the major political groups signed up to REACH."
"So to say 'let us make an exemption for barometers' at this stage is totally inconsistent with the REACH Directive."
"What is more, the REACH Directive would cover barometers."
"There is an amendment about licensing barometers."
"Well, that does not address the issue of spillages, accidental damage or waste disposal, landfill and incineration."
"In the United States in May, somebody found a broken barometer in a storage cupboard in a school."
"The school was closed for a week."
"The whole school had to be evacuated and there was a clean-up bill amounting to thousands of dollars."
"Sixteen US States are moving towards mercury prohibitions on barometers and other equipment."
"In fact, they are going much further than the European Commission is proposing to go here today."
"So anybody who is talking about nanny-state Europe is totally misplaced when they are looking at the barometer issue."
"The PSE Group pushed for the two-year phase-out for the barometer industry."
"We know these are small companies, we know it will pose some difficulties for them, but I think they were aware of the REACH Directive coming their way anyway, and I think this is a sensible compromise."
"Finally, Mr Schlyter talked about how he used to play with mercury when he was a child."
"Many people have said this to me during the course of this debate."
"We used to play with it in the past."
"I always point out that we used to drive in cars without seatbelts; we used to breathe in leaded petrol; and at Christmas time I used to get sweet cigarettes in my Christmas stocking."
"There are things to change and I think now is the time to change them."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be glad to once again clarify the Commission's policy with regard to the handling of demonstrably highly toxic substances in our environment."
"We cannot rule out risks in our society, but whenever the conditions for substitution are present, substitution must take priority."
"I fail to understand how anyone could see it differently."
"If it is not necessary to work with highly toxic substances in our environment, then we simply must not do it."
"That also applies with regard to the energy-saving light bulbs that Mr Krahmer mentioned, which do indeed contain very small quantities of mercury."
"There are as yet no substitutes for that. But work must be done on it, and as soon as there are substitutes, manufacture without the use of mercury must of course be preferred here too."
"May I conclude by talking about barometers again."
"No one is a greater friend of beautiful old instruments than I am."
"I am a great friend of traditional production methods, a great friend of traditional firms, especially small firms."
"And no one wants to drive even one small traditional firm off the European market."
"I have here a catalogue from one of these manufacturers."
"There is no doubt at all."
"Even today they offer beautiful barometers that show not the slightest external difference from the barometers that were manufactured in the past, but they no longer contain mercury."
"Even the famous Prince of Wales barometer, a copy of John Russel's royal barometer, nevertheless costing GBP 795, is already available without the slightest trace of mercury."
"The argument that even one firm could be forced out of business is simply not correct."
"I can therefore tell you quite clearly that we are not acting in these small firms' interests if we prevent them from doing what is necessary to give their products a future."
"And these traditional barometers will only have a future if they are made without mercury."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007."
"Mr President, I wonder if you could check that the interpretation came out correctly."
"I said I played with mercury as a child and I hope future generations will not be exposed to that risk."
"Just to be absolutely clear."
"That is how I understood it, Mr Schlyter: I can assure you, I did the same thing and I hope to live to an old age."
"European Critical Infrastructure (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on the proposal for a Council directive on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructure and the assessment of the need to improve their protection - C6-0053/2007 -"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank the rapporteur for this important report, which follows the presentation of an initiative by the Commission."
"The protection of critical infrastructure is, of course, a priority for the European Commission as well as for the Member States, not least because the need to protect critical infrastructure from the eventuality of a terrorist attack, for instance, derives from the very nature of such infrastructures and the interconnection and interdependence between them."
"Indeed, if a physical or technological infrastructure is attacked in one Member State, the effect will inevitably be felt in other Member States."
"That is why we need a common European prevention and protection framework."
"Our view was that the best way forward was to involve the private sector first of all, which means drawing on currently available technologies and stimulating more technological research."
"We would then call on companies and research laboratories to collaborate by placing the outcome of such research at the disposal of the common European framework."
"The idea is to have proper security schemes devoted to the various infrastructure sectors and a real network of liaison officers to ensure that this common European framework functions."
"Our idea is to take into consideration only those infrastructures that are truly cross-border in nature and not of course those confined to the territory of just one Member State, unless that particular critical infrastructure has an influence that goes beyond the borders of that Member State."
"As you know, we adopted a communication last December to set up a European programme for critical infrastructure protection, together with a proposal for a directive to identify which infrastructure needs protecting."
"I am therefore grateful to Parliament for having examined all the proposals on such an important subject."
"The communication, of course, identifies principles and processes to be carried out as well as the instruments for carrying out the processes, while the directive lays down rules for identifying those infrastructures which, according to a common European approach, require protection."
"It is our intention to develop this action plan through a broad web of public-private collaboration."
"We think that the Member States should be assisted in developing the various initiatives included in the action plan; we are also convinced that the international dimension must be taken into account and that financial measures must be put in place."
"Of course, we already have a financial programme for the prevention, preparation and management of the consequences of the terrorist threat, which may be able to provide appropriate funds for critical infrastructure protection measures."
"I can say straight away that I can accept certain important amendments that Parliament is preparing to examine."
"The first concerns the need to emphasise in the text of the directive that it is the responsibility of each Member State to identify the most appropriate forms and methods of implementing it: in other words, we must stress the principle of flexibility in the implementation of the directive, on the basis of which the measures, whether mandatory or not, should be put into practice without an excessively rigid approach."
"The second point that I think is acceptable concerns the need to clarify the procedures for exempting certain sectors from some of the obligations laid down in the directive."
"The Commission has foreseen the possibility of exempting certain sectors, and Parliament's draft amendments substantially seek to specify more clearly when a particular exemption applies to a given sector."
"I believe I can agree on the need to introduce some specification, thus making things clearer."
"I also agree with the proposal to amend the list of critical infrastructure protection sectors given in Annex I to the proposal for a directive."
"I think Parliament's proposal to amend that annex is acceptable, as is the introduction of certain changes to the sectors where resorting to the comitology procedure is envisaged."
"There is a specific proposal on that, although we should be aware that by limiting the use of comitology we would be increasing the time it would take to implement the directive."
"Basically, comitology is perhaps a rather complicated instrument, but it does save time in implementation, However, I am not against accepting the idea behind those amendments."
"To conclude, Mr President, I can say that I am happy and pleased with the report before us, and I hope Parliament will adopt it by a large majority."
"We need to show that we are speaking with one voice on a strategic measure such as this European initiative to protect critical energy, transport and technological infrastructures, which require strong prevention and protection measures, because the terrorist threat is unfortunately directed first and foremost at critical infrastructures."
"I am therefore grateful to Parliament for the contribution that it has already made and is yet to make to this work of ours."
"rapporteur. - (NL) Mr President, back in June 2004, the Council tabled a request in which the Commission was asked to prepare a general strategy to protect critical infrastructure."
"In the past three years, the topic has not been off the Commission agenda, quite rightly so."
"In line with the wishes of the Council and the European Parliament, the Commission finally moved a proposal for a European programme to protect critical infrastructure, which culminated in the Directive we are debating today."
"As rapporteur, I support the idea of a common framework in this matter."
"The effective protection of vulnerable critical infrastructures and services requires communication, coordination and cooperation in which all interested parties are involved, both at national and at European level."
"The complex processes and interfaces of critical infrastructure with a transnational dimension are, as I see it, also legitimate areas for consideration."
"As Commissioner Frattini has already explained on several occasions, damage to, or loss of, a certain infrastructural provision in a Member State can impact badly on various other Member States and even on the European economy as a whole."
"Thanks to new technologies, for example the Internet, as well as the far-reaching liberalisation of the market, for example where the supply of electricity and gas is concerned, many infrastructural provisions are already part of bigger networks."
"Indeed, in these circumstances, the effectiveness of all these protective measures is determined by the weakest link."
"I do take the view, though, as Mr Frattini already observed, that the Commission has been slightly too proactive or overenthusiastic in some sections of the Directive."
"It must be clear that the primary and ultimate responsibility lies with the Member States and the owners of this critical infrastructure."
"From that point of view, I consider a bottom-up approach to be of critical importance."
"Common action can, in my view, only be justified if at least three Member States were to experience adverse effects, or at least two Member States other than those in which the critical infrastructure is located."
"After all, much has already been agreed upon bilaterally, which, to be honest, is also the most flexible solution."
"In addition, I take the view that overlaps or inconsistencies with existing legislation and/or provisions should be avoided at all costs."
"Existing criteria and mechanisms must therefore be taken into consideration."
"It is equally important to me that the private sector is not faced with an unnecessary administrative burden."
"I would urge them to make use of the expertise that is already available and would, above all, counsel against re-inventing the wheel."
"I would therefore argue in favour of this pragmatic, yet structural, approach."
"Following the debates in the parliamentary committees, certain groups of Parliament have also agreed to focus on so-called priority sectors."
"It has, indeed, also been decided to scrap the proposed comitology procedure."
"In the past, the use of the comitology procedure has too often led to shaky situations."
"I am therefore very grateful to the Commissioner for his observations on this matter and on the other amendments and for the fact that he has shown his satisfaction."
"I would like to have a reaction, however, to the definition of two to three Member States, because this is the most important amendment in my view."
"I should like to finish off with an observation for the Council, which is once again conspicuous by its absence."
"The agreement on a common position appears to be a bridge too far for them."
"This is quite remarkable, given the fact that the Council asked for this common framework itself, and out of character too, because, if anything happens, then the Council is all too keen to be the first to immediately announce all manner of rules without really taking the quality of the proposals into account, their ramifications for the internal market, for example, or the European citizens for that matter."
"After all, vision and power are two skills that can be expected from the Council in this matter."
"At the opening of the plenary sitting earlier today, President Poettering spoke wise words."
"Nobody is waiting for ad hoc rules and regulations that are dictated by panic."
"A structural line of attack, on the other hand, taking the principles of rule of law into consideration - and the latter is vitally important - is very welcome."
"I thank you and I thank the Commissioner."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (DE) Mr President, cross-border crises, whether caused by terrorism or natural disasters, call for Union-wide protection of critical infrastructures."
"Critical infrastructures cannot be kept secret by not mentioning them."
"It would be completely na√Øve to think that."
"From a psychological point of view, the destruction of critical infrastructures leads to a loss of public confidence in the European Union."
"Crisis protection is not therefore only a national matter but requires European crisis management, as the Commission proposes."
"Moreover, as the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has clearly pointed out, moving elements of European infrastructures outside the EU increases the risk of terrorist attacks and access to data in particular makes the entire infrastructure more vulnerable."
"This is also true of banking and insurance."
"Even if security and controls are constantly being improved in these areas, there is still a need for additional coordinated European action."
"Nobody will want double regulation."
"What we need is greater security."
"The Directorate General for the Market must be guided by that and not by short-sighted wishes expressed by industry."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (DE) Mr President, the Committee on Transport and Tourism is of the opinion, for its area of responsibility, that with this proposal for a directive the Commission is exceeding its powers, because it is misunderstanding its instructions."
"It speaks of stabilising the internal market, but the directive is supposed to be principally about protection against acts of terrorism."
"Moreover, the Commission proposal contravenes the principle of subsidiarity, because it seeks not only to complement Member States' existing measures, but to replace some of them."
"Finally, the proposal does not address the real task, but delegates it to a comitology committee."
"The Committee on Transport and Tourism therefore rejected the Commission proposal, although we know that we do of course need European cooperation."
"The question is simply how."
"My main concern is to ensure that the Member States are not obliged to notify their critical European infrastructures to the Commission so that it can then make a complete list of sensitive EU infrastructures, attach security plans to it and then store everything in some office in Brussels."
"That would be against national security interests."
"Such a list would be an interesting source of information for terrorists."
"All that should be done by the Commission is to define and list in general terms the most important sectors at risk."
"It should be left to the Member States to identify those sectors, because it is they who are primarily responsible for the protection of critical infrastructures and they carry the ultimate responsibility for measures to protect critical infrastructures within their national borders."
"In the interests of national security, that must continue to be the case."
"Only a devolved management of sensitive infrastructures can reduce the level of risk."
"I believe the narrower definition of critical European infrastructures, according to which at least three Member States, or two others than the one in which the critical infrastructure is located, must be affected, is the right one."
"We must ensure that the directive covers only European infrastructures and no national ones."
"I also consider that bilateral cooperation between Member States is more sensible in this area on security grounds."
"Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, most sincerely and assure her of my support."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, indisputably, we have raised a very difficult issue with critical European infrastructures."
"There can be no doubt, however, that we need to get to grips with this question at European level and find and develop solutions jointly with the Member States, because the potential threats which the Commissioner has just described do exist and must therefore be taken seriously."
"It is, however, extremely difficult to say where the European competence lies in this matter, what must be organised at European level and where particular devolved tasks must be dealt with."
"This question occupied us in committee for a very long time."
"We have tried - and I would like to thank the rapporteur most sincerely for her very fair and open cooperation - to find a way that will ensure the exchange of best practice between the Member States with EU-wide coordination, while at the same time keeping the subsidiarity principle central."
"Neither, as Mrs Sommer has already said, do we want to notify specific critical infrastructures and collect them somewhere, rather we want to ensure that secrecy is guaranteed."
"That is why we agreed that the Member States should notify the Commission of their respective critical sectors but not specific infrastructures."
"It was important for us not to go for a comitology procedure, and I am grateful to the Commissioner for accommodating Parliament on this."
"As the rapporteur has already pointed out, the procedure's inefficiency in the past does not encourage us to go further down that route."
"We suggest another way."
"I also want to say that it was important for us that unnecessary bureaucracy should be avoided, that a contact point in the Member States should do the designating and identifying and that no new bureaucracies should be created, that administrative costs should be reined in and that there should be plenty of flexibility."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, the President of the European Parliament, Mr Poettering, referred today to this very report by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert when he condemned the latest terrorist attacks, both on European territory - where airports were the targets - and in third countries, such as Yemen - in the case of the murdered Spanish tourists."
"In the latter case, the target was not a specific infrastructure, but rather tourists travelling in a vehicle along a road."
"This reference once again demonstrates or reinforces the importance of this exercise proposed to us by the Commission and for which I would like to thank the Commissioner most warmly."
"This is not a single measure but rather part of a long process - which began in 2004 - which is now taking the form of increasingly interesting and effective measures."
"Furthermore, in view of the complexity of our European society, based on these complex and open networks of communication, supply and services on which, additionally, the economy is founded, we must defend them and defend ourselves in view of their potential vulnerability to terrorist attacks."
"I wish to point out that my group was more in agreement with the Commission's original proposal relating to the definition of critical European infrastructures, in the sense of infrastructures shared by two or more countries, or cases in which a State is affected by an infrastructure of another Member State."
"For example, for us, the Eurotunnel could be a good example for the application of this optimum protection from possible attacks, not to mention airports, etc., where we have already suffered such attacks."
"Tomorrow, therefore, we shall maintain this position in favour of the Commission's original proposal, because we want to remain hopeful that we may find more support in the Council."
"In any event, we prefer to continue moving towards more integrated and European approaches, and we prefer to avoid savings that appear to reduce costs but that we could end up regretting in the future."
"We do support everything that Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert proposes in terms of protection with regard to third countries; we support everything relating to the protection of the individual data involved; naturally, we support everything relating to the necessary confidentiality - we have long experience of dealing with this confidentiality, both at national level and at Commission level, and we do not believe that it is going to be violated in this case - and we also agree that we should avoid any duplication of what has already been done within the Member States and what the Commission is now proposing."
"In this way, we hope to overcome the backward-looking position that we had to accept in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and with which my group still does not agree."
"We hope that, with the proposal that will be put to the vote tomorrow, we will be able to continue moving forward and that with both what Parliament is proposing - and I am grateful for the great work by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert and all of the honourable Members - and with what the Council is proposing, we will be able to achieve better protection of our critical European infrastructures."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (LT) I would like to thank the Commission member and the honourable rapporteur for their suggestions; however, I would like to stress that these suggestions should be interpreted as only the beginning of the discussion."
"I do not know whether the Internet can be described as critical infrastructure according to the definition used by the Commission."
"It is hard for me to know, if a website was blocked in one country, would that mean that it was no longer critical infrastructure?"
"One need only block the website of a large bank that has its headquarters, let us say, in Germany, France or Great Britain, and all the residents of Europe will feel it."
"We are talking about the consolidation of the financial sector, the consolidation of economic activity, even the consolidation of hotel chains."
"In other words, we have to acknowledge that critical infrastructure has spilled into cyberspace, and I believe that Estonia is the first country to have experienced elements of cyber-war."
"I regret that little attention has been paid to this, and now this topic is getting beyond the scope of the concerns of the Commission Member responsible for communications."
"However, I would like to say that this topic has to be highlighted from a security point of view, because it is hard to imagine what the lives of European citizens would be like without the Internet."
"Whether the Internet is European or whether it belongs to one country we cannot say - it is a world-wide web, and of course, to define how to protect the web from an attack that could be carried out at any minute is rather complicated and the level of debate has to be quite different."
"We are presently talking mainly about physical infrastructure and, without a doubt, tragic scenes upset us, but life is becoming ever more virtual and this needs attention."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, no one in this House disputes that close cooperation between the Member States is very important and necessary for countering terrorist risks."
"Our criticism is of how this is to be done."
"More bureaucracy will not help us against terrorism!"
"I would like to thank the rapporteur for at least bringing the proposal back down to earth and greatly improving the Commission's version."
"She has also made a number of very practical suggestions."
"We are all agreed that improved cooperation and information are good things."
"That can be done bilaterally or multilaterally."
"But compiling a list of all at-risk infrastructures will bring no gains in terms of security and may even be counterproductive."
"In the end, however, competence lies with the Member States in any case, and there is no point at all in shifting it to the European level."
"I hope that when we come to the vote tomorrow we will all proceed with the same realism as the rapporteur has shown and go on to secure what we now have: a sensible way forward that takes account of reality and fosters no illusions!"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, those who already wanted more government pressure in the areas of the army, police, security services, all kinds of other control system and the prison system in the past have been able to reinforce their position since the turn of the century."
"They can now refer to the advent of a new kind of terrorism, which, as it came as a shock to everyone, creates scope for ill-thought-out solutions."
"At all administrative levels, proposals have been moved to subject democracy, the freedom of association, the freedom of demonstration, the right to strike, the freedom to travel and privacy to the proposed guarantees for security."
"The trouble with this line of attack is that it does nothing to remove the seedbed from which terrorism springs, including the utter inequality in wealth or power that divides the world."
"Instead, we collect more intelligence, monitor more objects, organise more bureaucracy and bring about more displeasure."
"In the European Union, in the area of critical infrastructure, there are already 32 directives, regulations, treaties and decisions that make a European approach possible."
"This is why adding a new directive with yet more powers and obligations has raised a few eyebrows."
"In January, the committee for the subsidiarity test of the Dutch Parliament drew my attention to this very subject."
"This committee is calling into question Article 308 of the EC Treaty, which focuses on the interim enhancement of powers, as a legal basis, and considers the protection of critical infrastructure to be first of all a national affair."
"As shadow rapporteur on this subject in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I was delighted to find that this committee decided to invite the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to emphatically reject the proposal."
"The main reason for this request was that everything that is in the draft Directive can be regulated more effectively on a smaller scale, in other words by the Member States or their regions."
"In this case, more interference from the European Union means, above all, more unproductive bureaucracy."
"Unfortunately, the groups that voted 'no' unanimously in the Committee on Transport were divided in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs."
"My group was no different."
"Most smaller national delegations consider this to be a poor proposal, partly because unnecessary interference obscures the division of tasks between the Member States and the Union, and partly because it may be used inappropriately in order to cut down on civil rights, such as the freedom of demonstration, by referring to the protection of infrastructure, in which case it does not affect international terrorism, but rather domestic democracy."
"By contrast, the members of our larger delegations from Germany and Italy also see positive points in the proposal."
"They expect a reduction in the powers that are already being exercised by the Commission anyway and better parliamentary control of the application of the remaining powers."
"Those in favour and against in my group applaud the fact that the amendments predominantly weaken the effect of the draft and confine the application to matters that affect at least three Member States."
"(DE) Mr President, unlike the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy or the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the committee responsible, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, failed to recognise the importance of the European level for the protection of critical infrastructures."
"The focus is no longer on the protection of individual infrastructures but on the consideration of sectors."
"I think the procedure proposed in the report lacks resolve."
"The added value that comes from including the European level has been almost completely abandoned."
"It is clear that responsibility for critical infrastructures must rest with the Member States. However, if we leave designation entirely to the nation states we will not identify the weaknesses and structural dependencies, and that is precisely what is needed for the designation of critical European infrastructures."
"The idea that a list would be as good as a textbook for terrorist attacks is downright na√Øve."
"The Member States have had such lists for a long time."
"One of the most important structural errors was, for example, not having checked those lists with NATO."
"In the military sphere, NATO has had such lists of critical infrastructures for 40 years and relevant scenarios have long been provided for in anticipation of military crises."
"(SV) I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a constructive report and an efficient piece of work."
"It feels as if we in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs are systematically wading through all those areas of society that have bearing on the terrorist threats to our citizens."
"The President too addressed this issue today."
"It is very important that we not look at each individual measure in isolation but review all areas together so that we obtain common security regulations covering everything from visa regulations and security checks in aviation to better ways of protecting ourselves against the threats to airports, public transport and harbours and to the whole of the infrastructure which, because of the huge number of passengers involved, could be hit by a huge disaster if a terrorist attack were to occur."
"The issue from the rapporteur's proposal that I wish to address is that of whether three or more Member States should have to be affected by disruption or destruction, or whether it is enough that two be so affected."
"The rapporteur's proposal involves an increase to three Member States from the two referred to in the original proposal's directive."
"I consider this increase to be unreasonable because a threat, disaster or instance of devastation may affect a lot of people, despite few countries being involved."
"Moreover, the incident may make more impact on the place affected than it would have done on more centrally located places in the EU."
"This proposal makes it still more difficult to take account of smaller EU Member States, in spite of the fact that they are in danger of being hit by equally serious crises on just as large a scale."
"I also believe that as we plug the holes and make it more difficult to attack aviation, the terrorists will concentrate on other targets and on central locations within the infrastructure, to which a huge amount of damage can be caused."
"We should not be na√Øve. Instead, we must be as well prepared as we possibly can be."
"That is our responsibility."
"(ET) The cyber attacks against Estonia that took place in April and May of this year were the first such events that gained global attention."
"Yet these were not the first attacks against the essential infrastructure of Europe."
"Until now, cyber attacks had been directed against individual companies, primarily in the financial sector, where the Internet has become an indispensable environment for transactions."
"For understandable reasons banks prefer not to make a lot of noise about attacks."
"Lack of confidence in the reliability of banking systems would have serious consequences for the entire European economy."
"Fields of activity in which the Internet has become an essential part of infrastructure include public administration and the media."
"The inability to repulse a cyber attack could in the worst case scenario throw the European Union back in time to the last century."
"Imagine today, in the 21st century, a situation in which communication between ministries is interrupted, and both the government and the media are unable to inform the public."
"This is precisely what happened in Estonia, as Mrs Starkeviƒçi≈´tso correctly stated."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur and emphasise her excellent timing."
"Cybersecurity is the best example of the need for cooperation in the defence of the essential infrastructure of the European Union."
"During this hitherto unique cyber attack against an independent state, Estonian IT specialists were supported by experts from both the European Union and beyond."
"May this cooperation be an example and a lesson in internal security to the responsible parties in all the Member States."
"Neither wealth nor military force can help repulse a cyber attack."
"The only defence is cooperation."
"Once again, many thanks to the rapporteur."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while I am grateful to all the speakers, including the rapporteur, I am afraid I have a few concerns about accepting the rather restrictive approach that the Committee on Transport and Tourism has tried to put across."
"As certain Members have rightly pointed out - Mrs Segelstr√∂m was the last, and there were others - restricting the minimum threshold for defining a European infrastructure to just three or more Member States would, in my view, have two drawbacks, the first of which would be to prevent the smaller European Member States from taking part in the critical infrastructure protection programme."
"We, of course, want to avoid any such eventuality."
"We want to offer all Member States that are potential targets for terrorist attacks a way of taking part in this European strategy."
"I must also raise objections to the restrictive attitude that is hostile to the idea that Europe should concern itself with a common infrastructure protection framework."
"This is not a matter of subsidiarity, which we are extremely careful to respect."
"The problem is that infrastructures nowadays are closely interconnected, and the last speech by the Member from Estonia, who recalled the cyberattack on her country, provides the most obvious proof of that: it was an attack that affected an entire countrywide system."
"Even though only a single countrywide system was involved, can we have any doubt that that attack indirectly affected Estonia's entire network of relations with the other countries of Europe?"
"If the banking system of just one country is paralysed for a certain number of days, then one of the basic structures of the European Union is inevitably affected."
"I therefore believe that the Commission's original proposal, for which I confirm my support, is better in that it provides a wider range of opportunities."
"With regard to cyberattacks, I do not rule out the possibility that terrorists may plan an attack on a countrywide system, such as a banking system, a ministry or an administration system: we are examining what happened in Estonia and our information security agency will be producing a report after the summer."
"I obviously intend to publish its report but, leaving aside the analysis of this particular incident, we cannot rule out the possibility that terrorist organisations may be thinking of knocking out an entire countrywide system by means of a cyberattack."
"That is why I believe a rather less restrictive interpretation is absolutely essential."
"To conclude, I once again thank the rapporteur and all the Members of this Parliament."
"I believe that adopting a rigorous report on the initiatives undertaken by the Commission would show very clearly that we are concerned about prevention."
"As someone rightly pointed out, the European Commission and the European Union's institutions have been acting to strengthen our policies on prevention ever since 2004."
"It is only by doing so that we can provide a truly effective and coordinated response to the threat of terrorism."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007."
"Law applicable to non-contractual obligations ('Rome II') (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Wallis, on behalf of Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ('ROME II') (PE-CONS 3619/2007 - -."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, this is, for us, the final chapter of a very long-running play that started with a Commission proposal in July 2003, but had a longer period of preparation stretching back beyond that."
"It has very much been a first for the European Parliament, with there being no previous international convention to work on; it was the first time we had codecision in this area and it was the first time that we experienced conciliation in this area."
"I, for my part, would like to thank all those in Parliament's conciliation delegation who participated."
"We left a clear mark, on behalf of Parliament, on the final text - a text which, thanks to Parliament, goes beyond the mere technical and legal, bringing private international law into the open to serve the practical needs of our citizens, particularly in the area of road traffic accidents."
"However, we also dealt with technical issues: clarifying definitions on the environment or supplying a solution on the issue of unfair competition, and then grappling with the relationship between European conflict of law rules and internal market instruments."
"I am not entirely sure that we got it right."
"I find I have been congratulated from many quarters, which makes me a little nervous."
"Then we are still trying to have the same debates around Rome I and the review of the consumer acquis."
"We have, at some point, to get this relationship correct."
"It was heartening to us, as Parliament, to have representatives from no less than three DGs of the Commission present at the conciliation and working together."
"I hope that in future we will be able to reinforce that and see civil justice as a thread that runs through many of the issues that we deal with in the internal market."
"There are many leftovers from Rome II that form the basis of studies that I hope the Commissioner will mention in his declaration - studies on road traffic accidents, on defamation, and on the treatment of foreign law."
"All these issues are absolutely integral to the relationship between civil justice and the internal market."
"Indeed, we could say that the internal market will function only if we have a coherent system of civil justice."
"Civil justice cannot just be an add-on to the internal market - some sort of limited competence where we tread only reluctantly at the invitation of Member States."
"I seem to remember a long time ago in 1999 in Tampere that there was a vision of an area of civil justice."
"Rome II was part of that."
"We need to refocus, to question whether we have a civil justice system in Europe that functions for all the users of the internal market and for our citizens, and is accessible and understandable."
"Rome II plays its part as forming the basis - the initial roadmap - but the following studies give us the chance to re-evaluate and make the next steps forward."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (FR) Mr President, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, in particular, on having helped make a success of the conciliation meeting."
"She has enabled us to arrive at a balanced text after four years of discussions."
"I believe that Mrs Wallis should be congratulated on the effectiveness with which she has largely helped to make a success of this matter."
"In my view, this text is key to the completion of the European area of justice and to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"It would seem that its implementation in practice is now keenly awaited by the legal and judicial fields as well as by economic operators at EU level."
"On the one hand, 'Rome II' will help to increase legal certainty in the area of civil obligations, which is crucial to the proper functioning of the internal market."
"On the other hand, this regulation will also facilitate the mutual recognition of decisions - a pillar of the European area of justice - and that, in turn, will make it possible to promote mutual confidence among the Member States' judicial systems."
"A key issue for Parliament concerns the improved compensation for victims of road accidents."
"In this regard, I can confirm my commitment and that of the Commission to launch an exhaustive study as soon as possible at EU level and to take the necessary measures, which will enable us to reach the stage of adopting a Green Paper."
"I can also confirm the Commission's commitment to submit another study to the colegislator before the end of 2008 on the situation in terms of the law applicable to invasion of privacy, which takes account of the rules on freedom of the press and on freedom of media expression."
"As I promised during the conciliation phase, should it prove necessary, appropriate measures will be taken, on the basis of consultations."
"Finally, with regard to the complex issue of the application of foreign law by the courts, the Commission - which is aware of the existence of different practices in the Member States - is going to publish, at the very latest four years after the entry into force of 'Rome II', a comparative analysis and will be ready to take any appropriate measures that follow on from it."
"To conclude, I should like Parliament to confirm this agreement reached in conciliation as the climax to the long-awaited adoption of the 'Rome II' regulation and I hope that the text will be endorsed by a large majority of Members."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, in the debate on second reading we said that we want to keep as much room for manoeuvre open for Parliament as possible."
"I have no doubt that tomorrow we shall at last find a broad majority, Commissioner."
"I was present at the conciliation procedure right to the end and must therefore say that in my opinion we - not only Parliament, but everyone involved - made hardly any use of the room for manoeuvre."
"We could have wished for something more on one or two points."
"Mrs Wallis has already mentioned that."
"I am convinced that a broad majority of the public would be prepared to go a lot further than the statesmen in the classic areas in particular, in road traffic accidents or such areas as punitive damages."
"When I look at the results of the summit, I can already see something of a gap here."
"We are trying to fight people's disaffection with Europe with things they do not at all want, but the statesmen are often unwilling to bring in the things the public really wants."
"It is also apparent that our meetings will show greater transparency in future, and I have great hopes of that."
"It is also apparent that officials often have their own hobbyhorses and are much more reserved and restrained than necessary."
"Unfortunately, politics is not up to speed here."
"It would be good to have bold political decisions more often, even in the conciliation committees."
"A Member State that proved obstructive at the last minute might then in fact often not be so politically obstructive."
"As Parliament, we have now set out down this road with one of the first cases where codecision has been used in this area, and we ought in future to be even more self-confident in using the room for manoeuvre and demonstrate that we are also capable of allowing such negotiations to fail."
"In the long run, all the studies and assessments with which we have been prevaricating for three or four years are not enough when the citizens want a decision here and now!"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Wallis on the work that she has done."
"I believe that we are going to achieve a good agreement, that a majority in Parliament is going to support this proposal and that we will have a new Regulation in the field of non-contractual obligations."
"I would like to point out, however, that this Regulation is only going to be the beginning."
"There is a fundamental difficulty throughout the field of international private law and in the field of conflict of laws, which is simply the judges' inability to apply a law that is not their own."
"In the European Union - and in general - we have trained judges to apply their own law."
"When an issue arises in which they have to apply a foreign law, there are immense difficulties."
"It is clear that, if two English people have a road accident in France, they are going to apply France's traffic laws - they would not be able to see someone driving on the left as being in the right."
"In the second part, with regard to the civil liability to be determined, if the judge is English I find it very hard to believe that he would accept the application of the restricted liability rules that exist in French law and not apply the English law."
"I therefore believe that this work is only just beginning, as I said before."
"Commissioner Frattini mentioned a subsequent study by the Commission - which is also mentioned in the draft Regulation - which is on the applicability of the law by the jurisdictions."
"I believe that this is the second part, a crucial second part."
"Those of us who have worked in this field have seen that the courts have a general tendency to apply their own law, the 'lex fori'."
"This agreement or this Regulation cannot therefore be interpreted without taking account of which jurisdiction is applicable at a particular moment."
"The jurisdiction is largely going to determine the law applicable because judges normally resort to any kind of subterfuge."
"Here, for example, we have eliminated the subterfuge of referral, but there is still the whole issue of public order - the public order clauses - which take up the crucial provisions of national law contained in the draft agreement."
"I therefore have the impression that, working on the basis that this Parliament is going to approve the proposal presented to us by Mrs Wallis by a large majority, once it has been approved we are going to have to carry on working in this field."
"We eagerly await the Commission's studies on this subject and in particular an important element, which is the work with the people who are going to have to apply this Regulation: the judges themselves."
"We wonder what the attitude of the judges is and how this Regulation will be applied in practice, since experience with international agreements and with the application of the rules of the States' international private law demonstrates this tendency on the part of judges to apply their own national law."
"(PL) Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and also those who have contributed to the draft before us."
"Clearly, even partial harmonisation of provisions concerning conflict in the area of non-contractual obligations will have a positive impact on the operation of the Community's internal market."
"Harmonisation and regulation of the principles of procedure in situations arising in a cross-border context will make it possible to refer to a single legal basis common to all Member States."
"Cases in point include road accidents, unfair competition, environmental damage, the treatment of foreign law and infringement of personal rights."
"This would undoubtedly increase certainty regarding the choice of the appropriate law and the expected outcome of conflicts."
"It will also facilitate recognition of court rulings."
"It should be emphasised, however, that the regulation is an instrument of international private law."
"It does not therefore harmonise the substantive law of Member States."
"The latter retain full autonomy."
"What the regulation does do is harmonise conflict with internal law."
"The regulation will ensure that the same national law is applied in similar cases, but will not impact on decisions concerning the cases themselves."
"Mr Medina Ortega rightly pointed out that the decisions and practices of the courts will be the most important element in this area."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (HU) This regulation is truly a great step forward in the process of Community harmonisation."
"In a Europe that is in the process of unification, it is indispensable for the judicial fora always to use the same national law in similar cases, regardless of which national court is hearing the case."
"This measure does significantly increase the legal security of private individuals and business actors involved in cross-border disputes, and avoids 'forum shopping' - that is, the possibility for the plaintiffs to file their lawsuits in whichever Member State they like - while at the same time upholding the autonomy of national law."
"I consider it important that we were able to make insurance cover cases of cross-border traffic accidents, and to ensure that the court would take into account the actual circumstances of victims with regard to the payment of damages."
"Simply to choose the law of the country where the accident took place could have led to unsatisfactory situations on account of the vastly divergent amounts of damages awarded by the various national courts."
"The specific rule concerning unfair competition is very important for judges and lawyers."
"The same rule also limits to a large extent the practice of 'forum shopping'."
"It is regrettable, but in the interests of a comprehensive compromise it is acceptable to leave out regulations concerning the infringement of personal rights - and in particular concerning the rules of libel in the press."
"It is our hope that as part of the examination of the regulation, we will succeed in resolving this question as well."
"It is important to define the notion of 'environmental damage', which is in harmony with other European Union legislation, and in particular with the Environmental Liability Directive."
"All in all, I find the final text a satisfactory and balanced compromise."

"Modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Jacek Protasiewicz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
", rapporteur. - (PL) Madam President, Commissioner, with this debate we are winding up several months of discussions in the European Parliament on the issue of modernising labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"It has been quite an emotional and sometimes heated debate, but this is not really surprising, seeing as it is an issue affecting almost every European, regardless of their age, walk of life or place of living."
"However, intensive discussion has not been confined to this House."
"The publication of the Green Paper has given rise to wide public debate throughout the European Union, and has involved numerous trade unions, employers' organisations, local businesses and workers' organisations and various non-governmental initiatives both in the old and in the new Member States."
"During these months, I have gained the impression that the majority of the participants in the debate agree that changes in labour law are necessary because of the challenges brought by this century."
"What challenges were they referring to?"
"There were four main challenges."
"Firstly, the positive and negative consequences on European economies of advancing globalisation."
"Secondly, the rapid development of the service sector, which is rapidly giving rise to new jobs both in the new and old Member States, although these differ in nature to the jobs once created by industry."
"The third challenge is the sea change in technology, and particularly new communications technology, which is having a major effect on our present way of working."
"Another great challenge is demographic change, which even now has radically changed the situation in the European jobs market, and will change it even more radically in the near future."
"Whilst there has been broad agreement that change is necessary, what direction these changes should take is not quite so clear-cut."
"Some MEPs have been in favour of greater flexibility in European regulation, arguing that this will increase employment and reduce unemployment."
"Others, by contrast, support a greater protective function for labour law."
"Some MEPs support greater harmonisation of national legal systems, saying that this is a requirement of the process of creating a single European market."
"Others steadfastly support the principles of subsidiarity, citing differences in the traditions and models prevailing in various Member States, and underlining that such diversity is a good thing because it allows best practice to be found through a practical exchange of experience, and is preferable to new, usually inflexible community regulation."
"The initial draft of the report that I prepared as a draft position of the European Parliament, favoured greater flexibility and opposed harmonisation."
"It also proposed clauses giving a positive assessment of the influence of 'atypical' forms of employment on job creation in the European Union and challenged Member States to apply active employment policy methods and support adaptability designed to protect people rather than specific existing jobs."
"In the introductory draft report, I also pointed out the need to improve EU and national regulations to free businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape."
"I pointed out in addition that excessively restrictive labour law may discourage enterprises from taking on new employees, even at times of economic growth."
"Furthermore, I drew attention to the key significance of education to improve the chances of workers and the unemployed of finding new jobs."
"In this context, I proposed that we appeal to the European Commission, Member States and employers to invest in lifelong learning and improve the quality of education for young people, in particular as regards the needs of local and regional jobs markets."
"Finally, I drew attention to the great importance of mobility in improving the situation on the European labour market."
"That is why I proposed challenging Member States to remove the barriers imposed on the citizens of other Member States and opening up their domestic labour markets."
"The first draft of the report provoked a lively reaction from fellow MEPs."
"The heated debate and the 490 amendments proposed to the original text were subjected to further discussion and negotiations with all political groups."
"At this point, I would in particular like to thank my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, and in particular Ole Christensen and his advisors, for their contribution."
"The result of the negotiations was put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on 18 June in Strasbourg."
"I must admit that the result of the vote was not completely what I myself had wished for."
"I also have the impression that we lost a considerable contribution put forward by myself in the initial draft which, in my view, was not properly addressed in subsequent debates, which was that any reform of the labour market, including the reform of labour law, should serve to create new jobs in Europe in order to effectively face up to the challenge of the 17 million people who are currently out of work."
"These high unemployment levels are a direct threat to the values on which the European social model is based, and we must do everything we can to radically reduce them."
"There are over 60 amendments to the report in its present form."
"Almost half of them support the approach of creating new jobs."
"I hope that the results of the voting will be satisfactory enough to enable me to recommend that this House adopt this report, and that it will be an important vote in the debate which the European Commission started by publishing the Green Paper in November last year."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Green Paper has created a good opportunity for discussion on the need to improve labour law to meet the challenges of the 21st century."
"It elicited a huge response from a broad range of interested parties."
"These responses contain useful information on national legal systems and on fresh problems in the European labour market caused by cross-border mobility and the expansion of international trade throughout the EU."
"The quality of responses to the Green Paper was astonishing, and I believe that this is the outcome of consultations and discussions led by the governments and some parliaments of Member States, along with the social partners and other interested parties at both EU and national levels."
"Some of the problems that emerged during the course of this public consultation had already been the subject of European Parliament negotiations and resolutions."
"I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, the political groups and the MEPs for their contributions to the wording of this own-initiative report."
"The report attempts to establish how to make practical use of the debate on the Green Paper, in the form of practical measures that would enjoy broad support."
"The Green Paper also fully recognises the Member States' competence in labour law and their own labour relations and traditions, and progress on collective bargaining."
"The debate has brought to the fore how useful labour law can be in resolving issues relating to cuts to the workforce in a fast-changing world with large mobility of capital and technologies."
"Labour law and collective bargaining are intrinsically linked."
"Labour law provides a basis on which the social partners at all levels can negotiate compromise agreements on employment relations, lifelong learning, flexible working time arrangements and the organisation of the labour market, which would facilitate movement between jobs and from one type of contract to another."
"It will come as no surprise to anyone that, in responses to the Green Paper among social partner organisations, there has been a wide variety of opinion on how to move forward."
"Sharp divisions emerged during Parliament's negotiations on this report and in parallel negotiations at EU and national levels in relation to the following points:"
"the status of full-time, standard contracts of indefinite duration in comparison with new flexible forms of work and the emphasis on measures to resolve labour market segmentation;"
"the approach when amending non-standard contracts, some of which lack appropriate guarantees of employment security; this mainly involves cases of multilateral employment relations; flexibility is often called for without suitable employment protection and without any actual chance of achieving genuine security in the framework of more stable labour relations;"
"the Green Paper's emphasis on individual employment relations has raised the issue of whether sufficient attention has been given to the collective dimension of labour law and the benefits of social dialogue;"
"it has been said that the Commission should have restricted this debate to the social partners at EU level and should not have opened up public debate in which EU bodies, EU Member State governments and EU- and national-level social partners were involved;"
"there were also arguments over the contribution the EU could make to supporting labour law reform and to developing minimal social standards applicable to all forms of labour contract."
"I feel that the report in principle advocates:"
"an examination of flexibility and security as two mutually reinforcing factors contributing to improved productivity and job quality;"
"adopting an approach that, when it comes to developing employment security, takes account of the life cycle;"
"providing basic protection for all workers regardless of the type of contract that they have signed;"
"help for workers to change jobs quickly and sustainably;"
"ensuring that efforts to modernise labour law are in keeping with the approaches of better lawmaking and of cutting the excessive administrative burden, in particular as regards compliance with legal provisions on small businesses;"
"proper implementation of EU legal provisions on work and on improving information for employees and workers concerning the minimum EU provisions in force, with particular regard to the fight against illegal work."
"We believe that the principles of non-discrimination, gender equality, flexible working time for the purposes of reconciling work and family life and the opportunities to gain an education and vocational training are the very cornerstones of employment security, essential for a smooth transition from one job to another, and from one type of employment contract to another."
"The report acknowledges how complicated it is to distinguish between categories of worker and self-employed persons."
"There is a prevailing fear that increased cross-border mobility may affect the correct implementation of the Community acquis."
"I welcome Parliament's positive attitude to finding ways of resolving the problem, whilst respecting the Member States' right to establish whether employment relations are involved in a case."
"I feel that the report also emphasises the benefits of dialogue between the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the EU in this regard."
"We must make the most of the ILO's expertise and experience, and use its efforts to establish basic labour standards enabling flexibility and security to coexist."
"The Commission faces the task of assessing the main themes of this policy, and the alternatives to it that have emerged through a number of the answers we have received, including those that were recently incorporated into Parliament's own-initiative report."
"Honourable Members, I await with interest the debate on this extremely sensitive and complex issue, and expect that it will bring further initiatives and will lead to the successful adoption of the report before us."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is giving a good account of itself."
"The work carried out so far in committee - the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - has been of a good standard."
"It has escaped the bottleneck of ideological clashes and opposition and has focused attention on the actual subject of the Green Paper on employment policies and on the actual possibility of planning innovation."
"Globalisation and demographics are only two of the main challenges."
"Sustainable development also requires changes in the way in which work is organised and in the use of time."
"Very careful thought shows that there is no non-working time, but rather time for personal life in addition to family life; that we have been wrong to identify the new frontier in social conflict as a conflict between insiders and outsiders; that the relationship between flexibility and security is a two-way relationship and includes the needs of employers and the needs of workers; that extending rights is an action that must not be so many words on a piece of paper but that requires change and transparency, action against undeclared employment, a coordination of policies and renewed vigour in harmonisation towards the goal of European employment law."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection. - (NL) Mr President, I am pleased with this debate, but not with the method."
"Commissioner, labour law is first and foremost a competence of the Member States and particularly of the social partners."
"It guarantees the right to a decent wage, good working conditions and protection in the case of dismissal, and makes for a stable social climate which we need for economic growth and productivity."
"In this, the normal contract of employment, as opposed to assorted, precarious statutes, is the point of reference."
"I am therefore pleased that the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs underlines these two crucial elements and that the suggestion from my opinion by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for a European initiative for chain responsibility has been adopted."
"The discussion on relaxing dismissal conditions is sending the wrong message to European employees."
"In recent weeks, I have met with a great deal of indignation in my country about the level of redundancy payments made by Opel Antwerp, but I have noticed that there is little indignation among those selfsame people about the immoral restructuring plans which companies are carrying out."
"Both Parliament's report and the European Trade Union are very critical of the Green Paper, and this is why I hope, Commissioner, that you can address this criticism."
"If one party in social consultation levels criticism of this kind, then we owe it to them to give them a decent answer."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (NL) Mr Protasiewicz, Commission, I am not opposed to the reform of labour law if it leads to more certainty for adequate health care, unemployment benefits, pensions for everyone: including those on the lowest incomes."
"The Commission is turning this argument on its head, though."
"Instead of arguing in favour of reinforcing employee rights, the Commission intends to turn Europe into a paradise for employers, in which the right not to be able to be dismissed without any justification will be consigned to the nostalgic past, where you no longer have the right to refuse unpaid overtime and collective labour agreements are deemed old-fashioned."
"The Commission calls this flexicurity."
"Sounds nice, but the translation of what the Commission is hoping to achieve with it is simple."
"More flexibility for the employer and more uncertainty for the employee."
"This will have a particularly disastrous impact on women, young people and minorities, who already suffer a disadvantage within the labour market and are disproportionately represented in part-time jobs and temporary contracts."
"They will be the first victims if this proposal is adopted intact, and the rest will follow."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (PT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all to commend rapporteur Protasiewicz for his efforts."
"However, I must say that the report, such as it has been presented to us, is unbalanced."
"It is unbalanced because it covers, above all, aspects relating to social protection - which are undoubtedly important - but ignores the other fundamental perspective for a reform of the labour laws for the twenty-first century, which must take into consideration greater flexibility in the functioning of the labour markets."
"In addition, the text rests on a very conservative view further fuelled by a culture based on suspicion and conflict. Well, what we need today is the opposite: a culture based on trust and cooperation between the sides."
"This paradigmatic amendment, which is absolutely essential if the values of social justice and human dignity are to be reconciled with increased competitiveness, does not appear to have been assumed in this report."
"A clear expression of the balance to which I refer, and which is absent from the text of the report, would be fundamental in encouraging a change in behaviour and attitudes on the part of firms and workers, with a view to encouraging confidence levels."
"In short, the text of this report is, in some way, a disappointment because it gives no indication that modern-day Europe has the spirit, talent and capability to become more competitive whilst simultaneously demonstrating the capacity to preserve the values that are representative of its social model."
"The truth is that the text under discussion shows no signs of spirit, and no evidence of either talent or reform capability. For this reason, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has put forward a series of amendments which will, if approved, ensure that this report does not become a lost opportunity."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DA) Madam President, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Protasiewicz, for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report."
"If the EU is to tackle the challenges of the 21st century and create sustainable growth with more and better jobs, we shall have improved the quality both of jobs and of work per se."
"Labour law has a crucial role to play in this area."
"If we compete on the basis of poor working conditions and low wages, we shall lose out against a background of increased globalisation and competition."
"Security of employment is a factor in production."
"A high degree of security promotes flexibility, employment and competitiveness."
"This is a consideration that should be reflected in future labour law, and I reject any attempt to undermine the social and economic security for which employees have had to fight hard over a great many years."
"In recent years, we have witnessed a clear increase in the use of atypical employment contracts, but this is unfortunately also a sign of companies wanting to circumvent labour law and their social obligations."
"There are, unfortunately, still too many employees who have no choice in being offered such contracts and who do not enjoy protection and security."
"They are often forced into jobs without pensions and without sick pay or maternity leave."
"There are also still many employees working without basic social rights."
"The International Labour Organisation has on quite a number of occasions pointed out the connection between, on the one hand, reduced security and poorer health in the workplace and, on the other hand, short-term contracts."
"That being said, however, we also think that standard full-time contracts should be the norm."
"Contracts of indeterminate length are good for both employees and companies."
"They provide security, predictability and increased opportunities for development."
"Flexibility and security of employment are not opposites but, instead, preconditions of each other."
"This is something that needs to be reflected in future labour law."
"Flexibility is basically about developing constructive cooperation and about mutual trust within companies."
"It means that the collective bargaining system and the social dialogue have a major role to play in developing flexicurity."
"The Socialist Group in the European Parliament rejects the Commission's narrow focus on individual labour law."
"The best balance between flexibility and security is achieved in many countries through the signing of collective agreements that are constantly adapted to developments in terms of both employees' and companies' needs."
"The Commission must therefore promote the social dialogue both at national and European levels."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to welcome the work that has been done, not only by the rapporteur but, I believe, by all the groups as a whole."
"This has produced the text we are considering, which was adopted by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but I would like to try to clarify one point."
"I do not think that conservative and disappointing ideas prevail in the text adopted."
"I believe that this text is a contribution to overcoming every resistance and ideological barrier to forms of flexibility in the employment relationship that today often not only exist but constitute a need to allow the system of companies at European level to respond to the competitive challenges posed to them on a worldwide scale."
"In order to protect these needs, however, it is necessary for these forms of contract to be genuinely finalised."
"A more flexible contract - whether it be part-time, fixed-term, or with temporary employment agencies - responds to a need for flexibility in the just in time response to peaks in demand and to production supply needs, which exist in the competition on the employment market."
"It must not be, on the other hand, an inappropriate instrument for introducing forms of discrimination on costs and safeguards, which would transform the flexible contract into a kind of basis or short cut for social dumping that has nothing to do with the requirements of competitiveness and that transforms the challenge of competition into a challenge of mere competition on costs."
"This is why I believe that, while we are affirming the need to accept the existence of these contractual forms and not to oppose them on ideological grounds, we also need to raise the level of specific protection, and guarantees, linked to these forms of flexible working."
"The rest follows: the primacy of collective regulation over individual exceptions; the fact that there are European areas of responsibility that respect national prerogatives in the social field and that there is a Community dimension, governed by subsidiarity, of specific regulatory competence, to guarantee minimum standards, which give a meaning to the European dimension, not reducing it to mere squeezing onto the market; the fight against the underground labour market; and, finally, the rejection of the logic of trade."
"The problem is to achieve these objectives in a balanced way, and certainly to avoid trading safeguards, such as safeguards in companies for the safeguards of the employment market."
"We need to push everything that promotes high-quality forms of mobility and transition and, once again, forms that are not linked to contradictions regarding social safeguards."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, the Green Paper proposed by the Commission and the report we have discussed is in my opinion a valuable introduction to a longer debate on the adaptation of labour law to the changing realities both in Europe and in the world."
"This is only the beginning, and we are facing an extremely complicated task."
"We need to achieve results which are hard to reconcile, such as increasing the number of jobs while preserving their quality, guaranteeing social security for workers and keeping as many standard contracts of employment as possible, while at the same time looking after employers' interests and dealing with competition in the global market."
"One issue is paramount: regardless of whether a contract of employment is full-time or not, or whether there are more atypical forms of employment or conventional contracts of employment, every EU citizen must have the right to work or to provide alternative services, and definitely the right to guaranteed health services."
"My political group will gladly vote in favour of this report in tomorrow's voting."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, The debate on liberalising the postal services has taken up a lot of our time today."
"It also shows that it is typically in the field of services that liberalisation is attended by an increase in precarious labour relations."
"In the face of such developments, everybody expects the Commission to support workers' rights in a Green Paper on workers' rights, to set minimum standards at European level to prevent workers' rights from going into freefall, and to strengthen trade union representation and social dialogue."
"Instead, the Commission's Green Paper starts talking about ideas of Flexicurity, which opens the floodgates to social dumping, which has caused bitter disappointment and will lead to a rise in Euroscepticism."
"This House has made a clear amendment here: worker's rights are not exclusive, but apply to all employees, regardless of what their collective bargaining situation is."
"It is the situation on the ground that is decisive. More flexibility is only possible if there is greater security."
"This is the only way in which the report can be further developed."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe concerns itself too little with employment problems, and, when it does concern itself with them, it does so totally inadequately, as if employment were not at the heart of building democracy and of the European social model."
"Certainly, many of the reasons for the problems of Europe lie in this culpable and deliberate undervaluation."
"Within Europe, job insecurity is very widespread and is hindering social cohesion, constituting a real tragedy - in fact, the major social tragedy being experienced by whole generations of young people, as well as older workers who have been prematurely ejected from the labour market."
"All this has an effect on our cities, our families, and on all of us."
"Combating job insecurity is vital when it comes to building a future and to providing certainty and hope."
"This is our main task."
"The Commission, instead of combating job insecurity, seems to be adopting it and almost using it to reduce individual and collective rights, to further reduce the role of the trade unions and to set against each other those who have rights - who are in fact becoming increasingly few - and those who do not, in the name of a so-called employment policy."
"This is unacceptable."
"What needs to be said is that Europe considers employment to be the basis of true democracy and social cohesion and that Europe has its own concept of what constitutes normal work: stable employment, for an unlimited period, protected by contracts and by the role of the trade unions and with a requirement for equal conditions for standard and non-standard jobs, as part of employment equality."
"This idea of employment is a healthy idea, which benefits production as well, because it says that competition is not based on exploitation but on quality and innovation."
"Saving on employment costs and making workers compete against each other garners easy profits in the short term but does nothing to make the economy or society grow."
"This is the social model that Europe should present to the world, and it should put itself forward as an example."
"The right to work is a fundamental element of democracy, because it demonstrates the rules for activity upon which society rests."
"Within these rights we should build a social unit of young and old, instead of placing them in a ridiculous opposition."
"The employment contract should contain these rules and rights, which cannot be delegated to others or replaced by external action, which would leave the employment contract at the mercy of the law of the jungle."
"This is why we are not convinced by the concept of flexicurity, of weak contracts replaced by welfare benefits: no, the benefits must be in the contract and they must act as safeguards for the worker, as a European citizen."
"The text that has been submitted to Parliament is a compromise; it has ambiguous points, but important elements, too."
"Attacks on this employment, such as those contained in some of the amendments, would be negative and would lead us in a backwards direction."
"I say this in particular to my socialist comrades, especially with regard to those amendments that distort the nature of normal employment."
"We would consider the approval of these amendments to be a breach of the compromise agreed on in committee."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, the rapporteur's first draft was not well received in committee, because he was trying to cut back on red tape and to reduce the regulations meant to protect workers but which, in fact, cause unemployment."
"We are debating the second draft, which was more acceptable: he had toned it down."
"A pity, because it means we are to continue with many of the restrictive practices in the name of harmonisation, while all the time that which you fear - globalisation - is stealing up on you."
"For that, the EU will have to cope with competition on the free world markets, but you are not prepared for that."
"Unless you learn to compete in Europe, you will not be able to compete globally."
"Footballers continually practise ball skills and teamwork; they do not prepare for a match by playing cards in a backstreet bar!"
"Likewise, continued practice in Europe's protectionist systems will mean defeat in the most competitive matches played away on hostile, global playing fields."
"- Madam President, it is the policy of my party, the British Conservative Party, to reinstate the opt-out which was agreed at Maastricht and to withdraw the United Kingdom from EU employment and social legislation."
"I trust that my Conservative colleagues in this House will have the full support of their political group, the PPE-DE, in implementing this policy."
"Turning to the report, I was astonished to read in recital C that 'the EU is not only a free trade area'."
"Anyone who knows the first thing about international trade will know that the EU is not a free trade area at all: it is a customs union."
"They will also know that the customs union or Zollverein is a 19th century Bismarckian concept which should have no place in the 21st century."
"All the evidence from around the world shows that free trade areas work, while customs unions work far less well."
"Indeed, the EU is the only group of developed countries still operating in this outdated mode."
"If this House wishes to convert the EU from a customs union with political pretensions into a modern effective free trade area, it will have my full support."
"The Commission's proposals on modernising labour law and our first draft report show a belated recognition of the huge damage that intrusive and inflexible labour market rules have done to European economies."
"They made the first tentative steps towards liberalisation."
"However, amendments passed in the Unemployment Committee reverse the direction and turn the report into a regressive socialist wish-list of deeply harmful proposals."
"Today's amendments restore the balance, and so long as they are maintained the report's timid measures are better than nothing and deserve our support."
"Paragraph 2 quotes the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"That Charter was signed off twice by Tony Blair, yet after the Brussels summit of 22 June he came back like Chamberlain from Munich declaring he had protected his red line and that the charter would not affect UK labour law."
"Could the Commission please give me a clear 'yes' or 'no' answer?"
"Is Blair's opt-out legally defensible?"
"I look forward to the Commission's reply."
"As we have reached voting time, the debate is now suspended."
"It will be resumed at 3 p.m."

"For the sake of clarity, I shall make it clear to all those who want to avoid any increase in the minimum rates on beer and spirits that they should vote against all the amendments adopted in committee except one, adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs by a small, chance majority of 21 to 19."
"I am asking you, in any case, whatever the result of the vote, to reject all of my report and so maintain the status quo in relation to excise duty on alcohol, until we have the Commission's report, given that Mr Kov√†cs wishes to make proposals on the whole excise duty policy at the end of the year."
"I would remind you again that Winston Churchill said:"
"'There is no such thing as a good text'."
"(Applause)"
"(FR) I should like to add to that there is nothing worse than pointlessly increasing taxes at the wrong time."

"The House is obviously grateful for your advice."
"Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. - (FR) Madam President, the House will recall that we had to refer this text back for further discussion because, following conflicting votes, our rapporteur had called for a vote against."
"The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs carried out a serious piece of work, which, obviously, does not correspond with our rapporteur's opinion and no doubt she ought to have withdrawn her name from the final result."
"It was not obtained by a small, chance majority but following very thorough work, with the Commission and with the Council, for an extremely reasonable proposal which, I hope, this House will be able to support."

"In the text of the report there appears the word 'institutional'."
"In the language of the European Union, 'institutional' has a very specific meaning which is too high for what is intended here."
"My suggestion, therefore, is that we replace the word 'institutional' with 'official'."
"It would thereby read thus: 'Welcomes the proposal to grant existing associations of TSOs an official role with formal obligations and objectives (the ETSO+\GTE+ solution);'."
"(The oral amendment was accepted)"

"Madam President, on a point of order, you are obviously having trouble seeing me at the moment."
"I asked twice for a check on my own report, which was refused."
"I just want to put it on record that perhaps this has happened because you cannot hear a woman sitting at the back, perhaps you will not give the floor or listen to that kind of request."
"You and your colleagues have been wrong several times, and although you listened to the request for a check, you did not in the case of my report, and I asked for twice."
"I think that should be put on record."
"Thank you."
"(Applause)"

"(For the results and other details on the vote, see Minutes.)"
"Convening of the Intergovernmental Conference: opinion of the European Parliament (deadline for tabling amendments): see Minutes"
"Explanations of vote"
"in writing. - (DE) Kiev is by no means as far along the 'road to Brussels' as some may believe."
"An unambiguous retreat from Moscow which Lukashenko has for some time given the appearance of preparing would have consequences, not least regarding oil and gas supplies."
"Any instability in this area would also have consequences for the European Union."
"Although the latest round of enlargement has taken us to the limit of our capabilities, it has not yet been resolved whether we will respect Russian influence in the post-Soviet territories, or whether we will continue to blindly ape the US striving to expand in Eastern Europe."
"Despite the resulting zigzag course and political tension in Ukraine, it is in our interests to deepen neighbourly relations with Ukraine."
"In the confidence-building measure of easing visa restrictions, we should nevertheless ensure that the old scandal is completely cleared up, and there will be no further abuse of the system."
"Under the terms of the 2005 Treaty of Accession for Bulgaria and Romania, a simplified system was created allowing their accession to conventions and protocols concluded under Article 34 TEU or Article 293 TEC without the need to negotiate or conclude specific accession protocols to these conventions, thereby reducing the huge bureaucracy which would result from the need for ratification by the twenty-seven Member States."
"Thus, the annex sets out a list of seven conventions and protocols relating to justice and internal affairs where the present convention can be found."
"I welcome this kind of initiative aimed at reducing Community bureaucracy and the exaggerated amount of time taken up over such simple matters as this."
"I, therefore, support this Council Decision determining the date on which the Convention of the 26 of July 1995 on the use of computer systems in the field of customs, and respective protocols, should enter into force in Bulgaria and Romania."
"I am voting in favour of Mrs Grabowski's report on the Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Europol Convention of 26 July 1995."
"According to the act on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, these states are able to join conventions made by the Member States on the basis of Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union according to a simplified procedure."
"For this reason there is no need for negotiations and special accession protocols, which would also involve the need for them to be ratified by all members of the Community."
"All that is required is that the Council, after consulting with the European Parliament, adopt a decision setting the date on which the Europol Convention becomes effective, along with the necessary protocols."
"The Council should also take into account the new deadlines for the effectiveness of the three protocols, dated 30 November 2000, 28 November 2002 and 27 November 2003."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my colleague, Mr Stubb, on the special report of the European Court of Auditors concerning translation expenditure incurred by the Commission, Parliament and the Council."
"I am pleased to have been able to table an amendment deploring the fact that more and more documents and communications - not least compromise amendments when they are voted on in committee - and, for example, annexes to reports, are being submitted in just one language."
"This trend goes against the need to maintain a democratic functioning model of our Union involving various peoples from different cultures and language backgrounds."
"Our model can be of use to other regions in the world, not least the Mediterranean area, and we must fully respect the use of languages."
"I regret that I was unable to prevent the report from encouraging the parliamentary committees and delegations, as far as possible, to submit texts solely in the languages of their full and substitute members and from demanding that other language versions be provided on request."
"The latter restriction will result in Members being deprived of the opportunity to follow the work done in committees other than their own."
"Respect for the official languages of each Member State of the European Union is laid down in the Treaties."
"However, the idea that some translations are dispensable is being encouraged on grounds of the financial question, and by appealing to the need to define priorities and restrictions such as the size of documents."
"We do not accept these guidelines, as they counteract respect for multilingualism."
"We, therefore, reassert our firm rejection of any effort to limit the use of any official (and working) European Union language on the grounds of high costs, an example of which, as we pointed out at the appropriate time, are the current criteria that determine the languages used during the EU-ACP parliamentary assemblies, which make the use of Portuguese unfeasible in a discriminatory manner."
"We also reject a reduction in numbers of interpreters and translators on the pretext of fallacious budgetary arguments, and any precariousness or degrading of their working conditions in Parliament, Commission or Council, namely by promoting the outsourcing of these services which are essential to the adequate functioning of these institutions and to guarantee the citizens of the different Member States of the European Union access to pertinent information in their own language."
"in writing. We abstained on today's report from Mr Stubb as we are concerned that the term, 'controlled full multilingualism', could be used to restrict the amount of written material available to Irish speakers in comparison to speakers of other official and working languages."
"At present a range of services which could be made available in Irish are not made available because the European Parliament administration shows no wish to do so."
"Such unnecessary limitations placed upon the Irish language as a working language should be removed."
"Some of the suggestions in Mr Stubb's report with regard to respect for multilingualism, quality control, user satisfaction, translation memory systems and a common database for terminology are positive."
"in writing. - (DE) The Court of Auditors' criticism of the 25% rise in the cost of translation, which cannot be explained solely by the increase in the number of official languages from 11 to 21, should be examined in detail."
"For this reason it is worth considering whether it would not be advantageous in future to break down the costs of translation by target languages in order to better evaluate need, demand and translation output."
"We also need a strategy for the ongoing pre-accession negotiations, because if Macedonia alone has six official languages, we will soon have our own Tower of Babel."
"When all the information is made available, the potential for any rational savings will become clear."
"However, this audit should not be misused so that even more important EU documents are classed as 'working documents' or 'annexes' to close the door on the obligation for complete translation."
"In particular, the use of German, due to its importance as the most widely spoken mother tongue and the second most important foreign language in the EU, should be promoted."
"in writing. - (NL) Madam President, I voted in favour of the Stubb report on the grounds that I agree with its gist."
"Our actions should remain based on complete multilingualism, out of respect for the principles of equality of all citizens, and for the benefit of the best possible communication and democracy."
"At the same time, however, we should exercise caution where costs are concerned because, if not, we run the risk of losing the social support for the multilingualism of our institution."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mr Mulder, on minimising administrative costs imposed by European legislation."
"The European Commission's objective of better regulation must be encouraged and monitored."
"Pointless administrative costs are the scourge of our societies based on the rule of law, which, at times, do not realise that the inflation of law results in its depreciation, for Europeans do not apply pointless and costly rules."
"It is not illusory to envisage a 25% reduction in administrative costs by 2013, provided that we conduct a thorough analysis of what is at stake and do not lose sight of the fact that false economies can be far more costly."
"Everyone knows that mediocrity is far more costly, in the long term, than quality."
"If we must constantly fight against all pointless laws and their associated administrative costs, we must ensure that we regulate economic activities carefully and with proper judgment, in the best interests of consumers and manufacturers."
"in writing. - (DE) If we continue to conjure up new EU agencies just to assuage national sensibilities, and their tasks overlap with existing ones, we really should not be surprised at increasingly vociferous criticism of burgeoning red tape, unchecked organisational nonsense and creating unnecessary jobs."
"Citizen-friendliness needs more than e-government and similar publicity stunts, and we have to avoid and cut down on duplication."
"We should also make use of the present savings potentials."
"These include: reducing the seats of Parliament to one single location, assessing expenses on the basis of the actual costs incurred, a top-class anti-fraud system and the real recovery of grants that have been improperly paid out, along with the millions to be saved by not foisting enlargements on reluctant citizens."
"In no way should the EU follow the example of some Member States, where increasing numbers of migrants are taken up in the administration."
"This will cause irreparable damage to the creation and development of a European identity."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Mrs Wallis, on the draft regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (ROME II)."
"This extremely complex matter is a step in the direction of harmonising the Member States' conflict of law rules applicable to non-contractual obligations, that is to say, the consequences of road traffic accidents, unfair competition, environmental damage, defamation and, more generally, violation of personal rights, etc."
"Overall, the European Parliament has not been sufficiently heard by the Member States, and the countless studies and reports that are to weigh up the consequences of this agreement will be crucial when we return to this important matter."
"For example, regarding road traffic accidents, how can we be content with applying the law of the country of the accident, and not that of the country of residence of the victim, and are we sure that recitals of this regulation on their own will make it compulsory for the courts to assess losses?"
"How are we going to manage defamation in the context of a globalised and dematerialised press?"
"The examples go on."
"A considerable amount of work awaits us on these issues."
"in writing. - (FR) I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the balanced text that she is proposing to us."
"The object of this text is the setting up of a coherent legal framework for relations between international civil laws and other Community instruments."
"This regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations ('Rome II'), seeks to harmonise national rules of conflict of laws."
"These rules determine the law applicable to non-contractual obligations such as, for example, road traffic accidents, product liability, unfair competition or environmental damage."
"We are in favour of the principle of adopting standard rules in relation to conflict of laws, although they still need to be, let us remember this, sufficiently clear and precise."
"This was not the case with the controversial provisions on defamation by the media."
"Freedom of speech and of the press must be protected and be able to be fully exercised."
"In the absence here of rules for the protection of editorial independence, it was reasonable to exclude the provisions relating to violation of personal rights by the media from the scope of 'Rome II'."
"We shall, therefore, vote in favour of this report."
"in writing. - (FR) I am very pleased about the adoption of the compromise negotiated with the Council concerning the second programme of Community action in the field of health 2007-2013."
"The European Union can no longer do without a common programme for health with common public investment."
"It is unfortunate that the budget has been revised downwards."
"A large number of investments are needed before we can have preventive and technical resources."
"Prevention is better than cure and good information on lifestyle or a healthier diet in order to reduce mortality due to serious illnesses is an essential prerequisite."
"It is necessary also to make generally available technical solutions for emergency situations."
"Widespread availability of defibrillators is one of many examples."
"Health, however, does not come down to a simple matter of accountancy."
"It is also and above all a benefit for everyone."
"Making patients more responsible is a central factor."
"Setting up clear and applicable provisions everywhere in the European Union is undoubtedly the most essential way forward for the future."
"The action programme proposed as the common position of the Council of the EU does not seek to protect and upgrade public health, but to manage its problems, extend the commercialisation and privatisation of health services and help private groups of companies penetrate what is a profitable sector for capital."
"The responsibility and obligation of the state to protect and improve public health is being transferred to local authorities, to NGOs, to 'civil society', while personal responsibility is being promoted as the basic determining factor for public health."
"Capitalist restructurings in the public health sector come under the general anti-working class policy of the ŒïU, the deteriorating terms of insurance and the increased retirement age of the workers."
"We are radically opposed to the anti-labour proposals included in the Community action plan in the public health sector."
"The Greek Communist Party is fighting for solely public health and welfare services which meet the contemporary needs of working families."
"(NL) Madam President, I am right here in the centre."
"Allow me to make a brief observation with regard to reducing the use of mercury, of which everyone is in favour."
"It is a good thing because, in many sectors, the use of mercury has been superseded and, indeed, has to be replaced by other materials, but a total ban on traditional objects, including the traditional mercury barometer, is taking matters too far in our view."
"I recently paid a visit to the Dingens company in the Belgian town of Leopoldsburg, where, for decades, they have proved that mercury barometers can be produced in a sustainable and ecologically responsible manner."
"Moreover, these traditional barometers have an unlimited lifespan, unlike their digital successors, which work on batteries and therefore use energy."
"Also, since the producers of traditional barometers have become skilled in maintaining these devices in a sustainable manner, mercury from barometers no longer ends up in the waste cycle."
"I would therefore call on the Commission - and this is my final comment - and all those involved to send out a signal at this stage to the sector involved and for the benefit of the assessment, which has taken two years, to give due account to this justified specific situation of the mercury barometer products so that they, hopefully, continue to qualify for exemption schemes."
"(NL) Thank you, Madam President."
"I voted in favour of Amendments 1 and 2, because I take the view that the production of traditional barometers must remain an option."
"I resent any kind of European interference which leads not only to traditional customs and production methods, but also employment, falling by the wayside."
"Moreover, it is very much the question whether the ban on mercury barometers would be an effective measure."
"Other forms of mercury use are far more extensive and far more problematic than those in the production of barometers."
"Also, as mercury barometers do not require any batteries, they have an unlimited life span."
"This House has once again managed to miss out on an opportunity to give due account to a specific reality, namely that small and medium-sized enterprises occupy a critical position in our economy and in Europe."
"The last thing these SMEs need is even more European busybodying and interference."
"in writing. I voted in favour of the amendments to exempt barometers from this overly prescriptive legislation and, upon defeat of the amendments, I voted against the report."
"The total ban on mercury instruments destroys a long-standing craft industry in the UK and is the product of obsessive meddling by Brussels in matters far beyond what is necessary or sensible."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the wise decision taken in relation to the Council common position, which takes up most of the amendments adopted by the European Parliament."
"The main difference between the positions of Parliament and of the Council concerns mercury barometers and the derogations to be implemented, in view of the fact that the ban that would subsequently be introduced would only apply to new mercury barometers, as barometers that are already in circulation can always be resold, repaired and maintained."
"Given the very hazardous properties of mercury and the much larger amount of mercury contained in traditional barometers in comparison, for example, with fever thermometers, the solution proposed by the Council to grant a limited derogation is a balanced compromise: the aim, in fact, is to grant a temporary derogation in order to allow the manufacturers of traditional barometers to adapt to the new arrangements."
"in writing. - (FR) I welcome the adoption of the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing of certain measuring devices containing mercury."
"I am in favour of restricting the marketing to the general public of measuring devices containing mercury, which have been banned in France since 1998."
"The Council common position accepted by Parliament establishes a balance allowing both a reduction in the release of mercury in the environment while allowing a transition period for certain articles such as traditional barometers."
"A transition period of two years after the date of entry into force of the directive will allow the industries concerned to develop their technology to produce mercury-free devices."
"in writing. I am appalled that we are still producing legislation which puts jobs at risk for no real environmental benefit."
"UK barometer-making, like that in other Member States, is a traditional industry dating back several centuries."
"It is clearly necessary that the use of mercury is properly controlled and we have made substantial progress in recent years on related matters such as storage and export."
"However, it should be possible to safeguard traditional barometer-making by ensuring that proper safety warnings etc. are used. There is no need to destroy a long-established craft simply because it is easier to have 'one size fits all' legislation."
"Social Europe means nothing if it means putting people in traditional crafts out of work."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, mercury is a dangerous product that should be handled with the necessary caution."
"Nobody in this House is in any doubt of this."
"Unfortunately, this House has pursued this position today with regard to the vote on the Sornosa Mart√≠nez report to absurd levels, something which I deeply regret."
"By holding firm to a total ban on the production of traditional barometers, the Commission, backed up today by a majority of this House, has sounded the death knell for a sector that stands for 360 years of European tradition."
"The fact that all barometer manufacturers in the European Union only account for a few tenths of percentages of the annual mercury consumption, mercury which, by the way, is recycled 100%, makes the matter only worse."
"Today, we were clearly not guided by common sense in our decision."
"in writing. (SV) The votes on Mrs Westlund's reports are not just about which food additives may be used."
"They are mainly about who is to decide on individual issues concerning food additives."
"In contrast to the rapporteur, we Swedish Conservatives do not believe that the European Parliament should evaluate, and take decisions on approving, individual food additives, for example on the basis of details such as the risks posed by individual food additives to people with allergies."
"That would involve a politicisation of important issues that should be decided on a scientific basis and at the level of the relevant authority."
"We therefore reject the proposal concerning increased powers of codecision for Parliament."
"As a consequence of this, we have voted against unduly detailed regulations in today's vote."
"(CS) Commissioner, I supported the more flexible authorisation of food additives."
"The Commission should look specifically at the impact of these additives on the environment and on health."
"I should like, if I may, to draw your attention to the high number of people with allergies, whose lives depend on keeping to a gluten-free diet."
"In addition to specially made goods, they buy normal foods that do not normally contain gluten."
"Additives must be properly labelled so that consumers are not misled."
"Manufacturers and supervisors often ignore the fact that the labelling of every product must explicitly show whether it contains gluten."
"Statistically Europeans suffering from food allergies are unfortunately not provided with the necessary information when they make their purchases, so either their choice of food is restricted or, much worse, they put their health at risk."
"I therefore call on the Commission to oversee a proper investigation into gluten in additives and to promote the comprehensive labelling of all foods so that those Europeans on a gluten-free diet are also able to understand it."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Swedish fellow Member, Mrs Westlund, on food additives."
"While it is normal to simplify the European Commission's task by agreeing that decisions on authorisation of food additives should come under the comitology procedure, the Commission must, for its part, take account of the comments that Parliament has been making non-stop for years now in the new regulation on food additives, and in the new regulation establishing a common food authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings."
"These comments chiefly concern the environment, public health and allergy sufferers."
"We should be pleased that the current legislation stipulates that the authorisation of additives must not mislead consumers."
"However, colourings sometimes give the impression that a foodstuff contains fruit, when that is not the case."
"Consumer protection must therefore be strengthened on this point, without this affecting manufacturers."
"in writing. Although I agree with the principles contained within the amendments on the labelling of GMOs, I abstained because I believe these matters should be addressed by national governments and should not become an EU competence."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my esteemed Irish colleague, Mrs Doyle, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on food enzymes and amending a number of existing texts."
"In order to remove the barriers to trade and to prevent not only legal uncertainty, but also differing health and consumer protection standards among the Member States, it is vital that we harmonise, at Community level, the rules on the use of enzymes in the food processing sector, which has developed considerably over the last few years (baked goods, cheese, beer, fruit juice, starch, etc.)."
"Major scientific and technological developments, which make it possible to have new enzymes made from genetically modified micro-organisms, must lead us to accept this prospect of harmonised legislation on the use of food enzymes within the European Union."
"This is in the best interests of consumers and manufacturers, provided that we do not have too costly a form of legislation."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Slovenian fellow Member, Mrs Drƒçar Murko, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on flavourings and certain food ingredients with flavouring properties for use in and on foods and amending a number of existing texts."
"At present, all natural tastes and odours can be copied synthetically from 2 600 molecules with flavouring properties, with the possibility being there to create new tastes that do not exist in nature."
"Technological developments in the flavourings sector and the rapidly changing tastes of our fellow citizens must encourage us to monitor food safety and consumer protection and to give the industry concerned the opportunity to pursue technological development, with the aim of all this being to strengthen the internal market."
"Many questions have been raised, and I welcome the compromises reached by the rapporteur, which ensure that the proposal for a regulation represents an effective initiative aimed at modernising and simplifying the legislation on flavourings."
"in writing. I will be voting for this report."
"I welcome in particular the commitment to labelling GMOs."
"I do not share entirely the concerns expressed by some of my colleagues as to the safety of GMOs."
"My judgement is different."
"As a scientist I believe GMOs have a role to play."
"Nevertheless, I do accept that others have the right to make their own choices."
"Therefore, labelling enables those whose judgement differs from mine to avoid products they chose to reject."
"in writing. Although we agree with the principles contained within these amendments on the labelling of GMOs, UKIP has abstained because these matters should be addressed by national governments and should not become an EU competence."
"in writing. Amendment 38 - providing that GMO-derived content of food be indicated by labelling - attracts abstention (rather than support) despite its inherent desirability, owing to its dangerously and irreformably undemocratic source (EU institutions)."
"In other words, I consider centralist EU rule, without democratic accountability, to be more of a threat to civilisation than are unlabelled, GMO-derived food additives."
"Therefore, I abstain rather than voting for this amendment."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the package relating to the rationalisation of procedures for the authorisation, use and consolidation of directives relating to additives and flavourings, as well as the harmonisation of legislation relating to enzymes."
"A certain number of additional guarantees have been introduced to ensure the transparency of decisions and the protection of consumers and I am very pleased about that."
"The aim of future legislation will be to ensure consumer protection and food safety while preserving innovation and competitiveness in the food processing industry."
"The food industry uses many natural and artificial flavourings: no fewer than 2 600 are listed."
"More and more enzymes enter also into the manufacture of food stuffs and the texts adopted seek to improve the safety of the use of these substances."
"The competitiveness of the food processing industry in the market should be preserved."
"Natural flavourings are wholly made up of natural flavouring agents."
"The ratio of 90/10 proposed by the Commission made it possible to produce a natural flavour with tastes differing according to the products, targets or the culture of Member States."
"The 10% came from natural sources other than the substance concerned."
"I regret therefore the adoption of the arbitrary rule called 95/5 which could penalise the food processing industry but without giving the consumer better information."
"in writing. I voted against the report on excise duty on alcohol and alcoholic beverages."
"The ECON Committee voted for a 4,5% increase in minimum rates."
"As I am against any tax harmonisation or increase, no matter how small, I have had to vote against Astrid Lulling's report."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, emotions run high each time we discuss beer, wine or other alcoholic beverages in this House."
"This was also true of the brewery agreements."
"Today is no different."
"Fifteen years ago, the Council agreed on minimum rates for excise on alcoholic beverages."
"The intention was clear: bring the vastly different rates in the Member States into line with each other."
"So many years later, we have to conclude that the decisions taken at the time have overshot the mark."
"Accordingly, for public health reasons, some Member States, including the Scandinavian countries, apply rates that are much higher than the minimum rates."
"Which is not a bad thing at all."
"Every Member State is entitled to adopt excise policy that is commensurate with its national traditions and policy preferences."
"Let us, however, also admit that the inflation correction of existing rates, proposed by the Commission, will not make any difference."
"As the current excise straddle between the Member States and the existing competitive distortions will persist without any sign of let-up, I supported rapporteur Lulling in her no-vote."
"- (DE) Madam President, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert's target for the proposed directive should be supported because it is quite simply a matter of protecting important infrastructure which affects several countries against terrorist attacks."
"That is why we need to identify and define the infrastructure, as well as security plans."
"The Commission's proposal goes too far, though."
"It undermines the principle of solidarity by confusing anti-terrorist activities with economic instruments."
"The Commission should also ask itself whether the centralised compilation of critical infrastructure will not serve the terrorists and thereby increase the risk."
"This House has made constructive amendment proposals, which, thank goodness, we have approved with a large majority."
"I therefore propose that the Commission revise these."
"I have voted in favour of the report."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the excellent report by my Dutch fellow Member, Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, on the proposal for a Council directive on critical infrastructure."
"Firstly, I applaud the vision of the European Council of June 2004, which is behind this proposal for a directive."
"It is, in fact, imperative that the European Union support the Member States in protecting critical infrastructure from the risks, including terrorist risks, that we face."
"Although the responsibility for this type of infrastructure lies with the Member States and the owners/operators who are generally linked to them, it is logical to communitise certain aspects of prevention, identification, designation of critical infrastructure, as well as the evaluation of the need to protect this infrastructure better."
"Internet development and the liberalisation of certain markets (electricity, gas, telecommunications, rail freight, etc.) must lead us to be more vigilant regarding our critical infrastructure, which is becoming more and more interconnected throughout Europe and of which the interruption, whether on a permanent or temporary basis, or destruction could have serious repercussions for health, security and the economic and social well-being of Europeans and for the proper functioning of the Member States' governments."
"The establishment of a common framework for action to protect European critical infrastructures means that we are once again faced with the central question of transferring competencies that lie at the heart of the States' sovereignty to the sphere of the EU."
"The definition of the protection of these infrastructures at Community level, in the name of the so-called 'fight against terrorism', will mean that the Member States will be faced with the responsibility of implementing binding measures, as, indeed, is mentioned in the justification of this proposal."
"Despite the rapporteur's having mitigated the scope of the initial proposal, by underlining, for example, that 'the responsibility for the protection of critical infrastructures lies solely and exclusively with the Member States' and considering 'that a Community approach is only justifiable if at least three Member States, or two Member States besides the one in which the critical infrastructure is situated, are affected', the fundamental objectives are not called into question."
"It should also be emphasised that, as recent events have shown, measures which compromise the rights, freedoms and guarantees of the citizens have been implemented on the pretext of the said 'fight against terrorism'."
"Let us hope that the concept of 'protection of European critical infrastructures' does not come to be used as an argument in favour of curtailing legitimate industrial action by workers defending their rights."
"in writing. - (DE) I am voting for the report on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructure and the assessment of the need to improve their protection."
"Damage to, or the outage of, an infrastructure facility in one Member State may have negative consequences for other Member States and on the European economy as a whole."
"For this reason, protecting critical infrastructure is essential for the internal security of the EU."
"I also agree with the report's proposal for setting up a list of priority sectors containing critical European infrastructure be made subject to common criteria."
"However, the Member States should not be obliged to disclose their critical infrastructure in great detail, as this would go against the interests of national security."
"Horizontal legal provisions at EU level, which would take into account the complex processes and the interfaces of critical infrastructures with a trans-national dimension is a justified concern."
"It should, however, be recognised at the same time that the EU should support, not duplicate, the work done by the Member States."
"For this reason I also approve of the proposal for a bottom-up approach, as national authorities know best what is going on in their own countries."
"in writing. There is no European critical infrastructure, it is national."
"Its protection is the responsibility of national governments, particularly given the threats facing the democracies from terrorism."
"I am, of course, in favour of measures that would genuinely enhance security."
"However, the directive is a further step in the EU's attempts to extend its reach into the security and defence sphere."
"This is its most objectionable element."
"The Commission seems to view security as a means to ensure that the, 'stability of the Internal Market is maintained', which misses the point."
"The proposed system of reporting risk and threat assessments to the Commission merely creates additional bureaucratic burdens and structures."
"The requirement for Member States to notify the Commission of specific critical infrastructures is counter-productive, as it would produce a list of targets that would be of great interest to the wrong people."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I voted against Mr Vidal-Ouadras' report, not because I oppose opening up the electricity and gas markets - quite the contrary, but I cannot agree with one of the core requirements, which is ownership unbundling - or rather, I cannot do so at present - for three reasons: firstly, because we have to give national regulatory authorities more time to build up effective regulation for competition; secondly, it has by no means been satisfactorily demonstrated to me that ownership unbundling will promote investment in supply networks, and thirdly, because the unbundling proposal does not apply where networks and generation facilities are still under state ownership."
"This is the point where we should impose those strict liberalisation conditions that have so far been denied to competition, instead of undermining those that are on the right market economy track through unbundling provisions."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of the report by my Spanish colleague, Mr Vidal-Quadras, on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market."
"The report has made it possible for us to review this matter after a long process of energy market liberalisation and, above all, for the European Council of March 2006 to adopt an 'energy package' aimed at safeguarding security of supply, competitiveness and environmental sustainability in relation to EU energy policy."
"I regret that the amendment tabled by my colleagues, Mr Reul, Mrs Laperrouze, Mrs Trautmann and others, for which I voted, has not been adopted by Parliament, since it provided for a balanced alternative to the mere ownership unbundling of energy networks, while safeguarding the independence of that unbundling."
"These are subjects on which the political debate is far from over."
"The same is true of the role of the regulators, the lifting of the barriers to interconnections, the development of new massive generation from renewable energy sources, the substantial investment in infrastructure to meet growing needs and so on."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against the Vidal-Quadras report on the prospects for the internal gas and electricity market which prepares for the presentation next September by the Commission of a third 'liberalisation' package."
"First of all I am opposed to the liberal dogmatic principle of ownership unbundling (ownership and management of the network), because it brings no guarantee in relation to investments, supply, safety or access for third parties and renewable energy to the network."
"It does not ensure availability of energy at the best price for citizens and it does not fulfil public service obligations either."
"Why then disrupt the present organisation, which works well and ensures the effective independence of system operators, thanks, in particular to strong intervention by the regulator and putting in place strict rules to guarantee equality of treatment and a quality service to all users of the networks, even those who live in regions with a natural handicap and very remote regions."
"Furthermore, I think that the problem of the independence of the transmission system operators does not relate to the issue of the system of ownership, but to that of regulation."
"Why, therefore, ask for the elimination of the public character of energy operators?"
"in writing. - (FR) I regret the adoption of ownership unbundling defended by the fierce defenders of the dismantling of large companies."
"In my opinion, the liberal right has struck another blow to the principle of public service mission, which is so dear to European citizens."
"I think that ownership unbundling brings no guarantee in relation to investments, safety or third party access (including renewable energy sources, which could be penalised because of their high costs)."
"Nor does it ensure availability of energy at the best price for citizens."
"I believe it would have been preferable to retain a system like the French one, which integrates into its working the legislative rules from previous European directives."
"This is another one of the steps towards the liberalisation of the internal gas and electricity market in the wake of the Lisbon Strategy."
"The keywords in this report are 'liberalisation' and 'market'."
"The basic idea from which they set out is always the same."
"The premise, already refuted by innumerable examples, that the market alone will resolve the problem of energy supply and consumption, is defended with growing fervour in an effort to conjure away what is increasingly difficult to ignore: that the 'market' has only been a success for some, who have accumulated fabulous profits, but not for the consumers, who find themselves confronted with ever-higher energy bills."
"Its strategic nature means that the energy sector is vital for a country's independence and sovereignty."
"To subject it to private national and transnational interests is an affront to the sovereignty of the peoples and the rights of the workers and populations."
"We, therefore, once again, reject the liberalisation of gas and electricity, advocating that they should remain in the public sector as the sole guarantee of access to a continuous service offering quality and accessible prices."
"in writing. - (FR) I voted against liberalisation of the gas and electricity sectors because I do not consider that transmission ownership unbundling is the most effective way of stimulating investment in these infrastructures."
"As the report recognises, 'this model might not address all of the issues at stake, such as interconnections and congestion points'."
"The fact is that the electricity market and the gas market require significant investment."
"It is not by eliminating the big operators in the market that the European Union will be able to guarantee its security of supply."
"A strange fact remains that the European countries that have liberalised the most also have the highest prices for consumers."
"in writing. Sinn F√©in rejected the Vidal-Quadras report on the internal gas and electricity market because of its emphasis on privatisation and ""unbundling""."
"Member States should retain the right to fully own and operate their energy systems if they see fit to do so."
"As an all-Ireland party we look forward to the development of an all-Ireland energy market which is fully integrated and managed in an accountable way."
"Interconnections between north and south are important infrastructural elements in the creation of an all-Ireland economy."
"in writing. - (FR) The Union for the Presidential Majority (UMP) delegation wishes to point out and highlight the fact that ownership unbundling is not the best answer to current market dysfunctions."
"In a context of strong competition, which sees the emergence of powerful non-European operators, we feel it is dangerous to dismantle the European energy companies in the name of a dogmatic approach to competition policy, far removed from the industrial strategies that ought to strengthen the European Union in global competition."
"European energy supply is a strategic long-term issue that requires its security to be guaranteed beyond the duration of a single contract."
"This security of energy supply depends upon investments that are already clearly inadequate."
"They will, however, have to increase significantly in order to meet our future needs whether for gas or electricity."
"Ownership unbundling means that our traditional energy operators will not be able to realise these investments in the energy networks."
"Handing over this opportunity to new entrants, who will not necessarily have the financial resources needed, or to non-European companies, who do not necessarily share our assessment of our future needs is very dangerous and very worrying."
"In these circumstances, the UMP delegation expects the European Commission to develop an alternative approach to ownership unbundling."
"Animal proteins are not a natural part - and I emphasise the word 'natural' - of the diet of, for example, an adult bovine."
"Currently, many appear to have forgotten - or make out that they have forgotten - the consequences of the 'mad cow' crisis - BSE - on human and animal health, and the socio-economic consequences underlying the intensive production model which caused it."
"The current report supports the lifting of the ban on the use of fish oil and flour in ruminant fodder."
"The intention is to further increase the profits of the agro-industry and large-scale farmers."
"We should reject this intention."
"Not only because this measure is linked to the development of intensive production and the verticalisation of agricultural production, and because it would encourage fishing on an industrial scale to obtain fish flour and oil for fodder, namely for ruminants - when, at a time of scarcity, maritime fishing resources should be put to better use as foodstuff for human consumption - but, above all, because there are still risks for human and animal health."
"Thus, we consider imperative the application of the principle of precaution."
"We therefore regret the rejection of our proposal to reject the lifting of the current ban."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"(The sitting was suspended at 1.15 p.m. and resumed at 3.05 p.m.)"
"Approval of Minutes of previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Posting of workers (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the secondment of employees. (0-0041/2007-B6-0312/2007) by Mr Andersson on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"rapporteur. - (SV) I believe it was Jacques Delors who said that the internal market for goods and services would never succeed without a strong social dimension."
"Why did he say that?"
"What he meant was that we must not use poor working conditions, low wages and so on to compete with each other in the internal market."
"Why not? Because European workers would never accept such a policy."
"The flexicurity debate also shows that we cannot use low wages and poor working conditions to compete with countries outside the EU."
"Nor, then, can we adopt a similar approach within the EU."
"It is in that perspective that we should view the Posting of Workers Directive."
"The Posting of Workers Directive has come about with a view to guaranteeing fair and decent working conditions for employees: wage conditions, working times and other working conditions."
"Minimum rules have been talked about, but if we are to proceed on the basis of the Advocate General's opinion in the Laval case it is not minimum rules but, rather, normal rules that should apply."
"That is what the Advocate General goes so far as to say in his opinion."
"That is important for employees."
"It is important if they are to have decent conditions, and it is also important for companies."
"If we had not had these regulations, we should have benefited those companies that pay poor wages and those that have rotten working conditions."
"There would have been no competition-neutrality - something that is important for both employees and companies."
"The Commission has produced an interpretation."
"I can say that there are parts of it with which we agree, but that there are also parts with which we disagree."
"Allow me to begin with those parts with which we agree."
"A better exchange of information is needed between the authorities in the various Member States."
"Those companies that happen to operate in another country need to be significantly better informed of the conditions in that country."
"This is an area in which we can do a lot in the future."
"The Commission has looked at case law and has sometimes come up with over-interpretations, but sometimes also with correct interpretations."
"When it comes to third-country citizens, we have no views on the interpretation produced by the Commission, but when it comes to a number of other matters we do not share the Commission's approach."
"Allow me to give two examples."
"The first concerns the requirement for a representative."
"In this area the Commission has produced an over-interpretation of the existing conception of justice."
"The case that exists is about the need to force the representative to be resident in the country in which the activity is taking place."
"We are not laying down that requirement."
"That being said, it is important that countries be able to make demands of a representative who is not just anyone but who has a genuine mandate to represent the company."
"That is important in my country, where we have collective agreements, and it is also important in other countries from the perspective of the authorities and in terms, for example, of the conditions of the working environment."
"It must be possible to make demands of a representative who has a mandate to speak on behalf of the company."
"The next issue is that of social documentation."
"There are legal cases to which the Commission refers."
"We are concerned here with Belgium and with the issue of whether documentation should be kept for five years."
"That is an unreasonable length of time;"
"I can agree about that."
"However, documentation is needed to show who is employed and working and what wages and working hours they have."
"Such information is undoubtedly needed during the period that the work is being carried out and also for a reasonable period thereafter."
"We are, of course, aware that a certain amount of cheating goes on in these matters, so a reasonable period after the work has been carried out is needed."
"The mistake made by the Commission is to have over-interpreted in its communication."
"It has over-interpreted the case law."
"The requirement for a representative is important, as is the demand for social documentation."
"The Commission states that we must not challenge any labour market model within Europe."
"That is an important statement, but that is precisely what is being done when criticism is directed at those Member States that lay down requirements in terms of representatives and social documentation."
"If it is not permitted to lay down such requirements, it is of course impossible to have a regulated labour market and impossible to maintain our labour market model."
"It is, then, another model that we are speaking of, and that is something that the Commission should take on board."
"Germany has put forward precisely the same criticism as the Nordic countries have done."
"Finally, I should just like to address the issue of balance."
"Those countries that do not exercise any control at all should also be criticised."
"There are countries that do not have sufficient controls in place, which means that employees perhaps work in conditions that do not comply with the requirements of the Posting of Workers Directive."
"These countries should come in for criticism."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Madam President, honourable Members, on 13 June 2007 the Commission adopted the final communication relating to the 2006 communication, in which it expressed its full support for the Member States' objective of stamping out illegal practices in the labour market."
"The Commission acknowledges that national bodies must carry out appropriate checks in order to ensure that service providers comply with national working conditions."
"Nevertheless, assessments of the progress made since 2006, which the Commission carried out on the basis of information from the Member States and the social partners at EU level, indicate that some measures implemented in some Member States are disproportionate and overstep the mark in terms of what is needed in order to guarantee effective protection for posted workers."
"As the June 2007 communication pointed out, it appears that this situation has arisen from ineffective cooperation between the relevant bodies in the Member States and from inadequate access to information."
"In its communications, the Commission points out that as regards the free movement of services, which is enshrined in the EC Treaty, rules can be restricted only on grounds of overriding public interest, for example the protection of workers, and these reasons must be appropriate."
"We should assess on a case-by-case basis whether particular national measures can be viewed as justified and appropriate - for example the requirement to have a representative who is resident in the host country or the obligation to hold certain documents relating to social and labour conditions in the host territory for monitoring purposes."
"The Commission is looking very carefully at the situation in every Member State so that it can determine which control measures might be deemed unjustified and inappropriate."
"Where necessary, the Commission will initiate proceedings on grounds of non-compliance with obligations, so that Community law can be enforced."
"Let me stress that the Commission is also examining the possibility of whether measures adopted by individual Member States are adequate and effective."
"If not, they will proceed in the same way, because the objective is to protect workers effectively without hindering the internal market."
"The Commission does not currently intend to publish any further guidelines."
"The final decision on compliance with national measures rests with the Court of Justice, which has already issued a number of rulings, and not with either the Commission or Parliament."
"As regards cooperation on information, checks carried out by the Commission demonstrate that there has been an encouraging improvement."
"Yet further improvement is essential."
"The Commission is therefore proposing to enhance and strengthen administrative cooperation with the Member States, above all to bring together other interested parties - in particular the social partners - that play an important role in monitoring compliance with the rules."
"Assessment of enforcement measures indicates that although the implementation of the directive has not led to many formal complaints or legal proceedings, there are some problems that require further consideration, such as the effectiveness of cross-border enforcement of sanctions or the protection of workers in the case of multiple subcontracting."
"The Commission would like to involve the social partners and the Member States in that work."
"Lastly, I should like to stress that the June 2007 communication demonstrates that, as a matter of principle, the Commission does not in any way wish to undermine the various social models of the Member States nor the way in which Member States organise their systems of labour law relations and collective bargaining."
"It is of course the Commission's job to guarantee that European Community law is strictly complied with, and in cases where inappropriate measures have been adopted, leading not to the protection of workers but rather to restrictions on the freedom to provide services in the internal market, the Commission has to take action, as enshrined in the Treaty."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Madam President, one of the challenges of trying to produce an oral question followed by an immediate resolution in a very short space of time is to get it to reflect fully everything we want it to say."
"I think on this occasion, as in maybe some others, the very rush has meant that not all of us agree with the wording of every detail of the resolution."
"That is not meant to be a criticism of political opponents on the other side of the House."
"It is just meant to be a comment, a statement of where it is."
"I would like to add - unofficially in any response and consideration the Commission gives to this - the following question."
"If the current directive is not being implemented satisfactorily in all Member States, could the Commission please consider taking a bit more time out to understand why?"
"Are there some intrinsic problems with the directive?"
"Are there some issues that certain Member States still have with it?"
"So rather than us just forcibly saying 'the directive is the directive is the directive, thou shalt implement it without delay', please can we look at listening a little bit more, because I am sure there is something we can learn."
"In principle, we are all for having a directive in this area so that there is clarity."
"The final thing I would just say is certainly from this side of the House."
"We are interested in helping workers being posted."
"We are interested of course in their security of work conditions, but we are interested in promoting their mobility."
"We are not interested in using this as a device for protectionism to prevent workers being posted."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, I can tell you that my group has very mixed feelings about this new communication by the Commission."
"On the one hand, it is, of course, good that the Commission wishes to continue to focus on the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive, because, almost weekly, we get to hear about new cases of social exploitation of employees posted elsewhere, a situation which, moreover, has placed a considerable strain on our working conditions in our countries."
"On the other hand, we have the distinct impression that the Commission still has not managed to strike the right balance between guaranteeing the freedom of provision of services on the one hand and protecting employees on the other."
"It should be clear to you, Commissioner, that a number of control measures which Member States have taken, including the requirement to keep documents in the workplace, imposing posting of workers declarations or the presence of an authorised representative, are essential in order to be able to protect the working conditions of workers posted elsewhere."
"It is, moreover, abundantly clear, Commissioner, that Member States can only rely on their own national measures, because the desperately needed transnational cooperation between administrations and access to the necessary information is virtually non-existent, and international force mechanisms simply do not work."
"Nevertheless, the communication suggests that a host of these measures are incompatible with Community legislation, and you even threaten to institute infringement procedures, even before the desperately needed steps have been taken to guarantee the flow of information, to allow cooperation between the Member States to really function and to put an effective system of penalties in place."
"Needless to say, my group welcomes the Commission's intention to set up a permanent high-level committee to help the Member States enhance their cooperation."
"Administrative cooperation is not enough, though, Commissioner."
"What we also ask for is a European platform for cross-border cooperation between the competent inspectorates of the Member States."
"Until this aspect has been addressed, a crucial instrument to enforce compliance with the Posting of Workers Directive will be lacking."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DA) Madam President, Commissioner, I wish, on behalf of my group, to support the approach chosen by the Commission in connection with this directive, namely that of putting its faith in the provision of better information and in enhanced cooperation between Member States and, in cases of serious infringement, in taking Member States to the European Court of Justice."
"Unfortunately, we do, of course, have to recognise that, in an enlarged EU with large differences in income, there is a lot of insecurity, including insecurity associated with this subject."
"On the one hand, there is the fear that employees posted to another Member State will work under poorer social conditions than normal in the host country and that this situation will create a threat to security of employment."
"On the other hand, there are still many bureaucratic obstacles to the free exchange of services in the EU."
"These factors impede competition and mean that people receive poorer services."
"What, of course, the Posting of Workers Directive is precisely designed to bring about is a proper balance between the freedom to provide cross-border services and the simultaneous maintenance of labour market protection in the host country."
"At consultations in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have previously been told by employers' representatives and unions that the Posting of Workers Directive is, in actual fact, good enough, but it is very complicated."
"Employers and employees do not, therefore, have a good enough knowledge of their duties and rights, and that is a situation that we must do something about."
"It needs to be simple and straightforward to do things in a law-abiding way, and such a state of affairs needs to be brought about through the provision of information - understandable information, mind you - in people's own language. People also need easy access to help in solving problems."
"The Commission has observed that the Member States do not always have confidence in the information exchanged between countries, and I therefore think it a good idea now to strengthen the ongoing cooperation between the Member States in this area."
"Moreover, the Dublin Agency on Living and Working Conditions should take it upon itself to exchange good practice and, in that way, involve both the labour market partners and the Member States in a positive process."
"On the issue, mentioned by Mr Andersson, of the host country requiring there to be a representative and on the issue of documentation at the workplace, I too think it important that we maintain the right balance, and I really do basically think that this balance is what the Commission has found."
"That is the background to our amendments to the report."
"The representative need not necessarily be physically present in the host country."
"That is something on which we agree, and I should like to see it made clear."
"Regarding the reference to the Laval or Waxholm case, I think we must await the final decision before using the matter as guidance as to the state of the law."
"That concludes my observations."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, the present debate is also a warning: if this communication is yet another attempt to smuggle the deleted Articles 24 and 25 of the original Services Directive through the back door, then this House will unambiguously reject it."
"The Posting of Workers Directive is there to protect workers, and this protective function must remain sacrosanct."
"In the Posting of Workers Directive the local principle prevails, which means, amongst other things, that all measures by Member States that serve to protect posted workers and protect their interests are legitimate and desirable."
"The Directive is a law for a free internal market for services."
"But this freedom cannot come at any cost."
"It is not the go-ahead for social dumping."
"I am tired of having to make armchair decisions about the theoretical possibility of providing evidence of fair pay in the worker's country of origin within two or four weeks."
"The situation on big and small building sites all over Europe tells a different tale."
"The lack of possibilities for checking payslips on site gives additional opportunity to criminal machinations."
"Surely that is not something you want to take the responsibility for?"
"Go and see the building sites for yourselves before proceeding any further."
"See how workers are deprived of fair wages, and how social dumping distorts fair competition on those sites."
"Equal pay for equal work in the same place must be the overriding principle."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - Madam President, first of all we need to remember that the Posting of Workers Directive is about workers' rights, and it just lays down minimum standards in terms of pay rates, holidays, working hours and so on."
"Without the Directive, workers are open to all sorts of abuses through post-box companies and bogus self-employment, a fact which some employers have not been slow to exploit."
"However, it seems to me that, in its emphasis, the Commission gives primacy to removing obstacles to the provision of services and the orderly functioning of the internal market."
"I believe the resolution associated with this oral question represents a step back from existing Parliament positions, most recently expressed in the Schroedter report."
"The fact is that the Commission has not enforced the Directive, and many Member States ignore its provisions."
"These failures should not be sidestepped in arguments about proportionality or protectionism."
"When Parliament adopted the Services Directive, those of us who were concerned about its impact on workers' rights were assured that the proper enforcement of the Posting of Workers Directive would deal with our concerns."
"That has not happened, and the Commission has failed to enforce this Directive properly."
"This leaves many workers exposed, without the minimum standards necessary to avoid exploitation and abuse."
"(DE) Madam President, On 13 June the DG Employment notified the Commission that some Member States are not implementing the Posting of Workers Directive conscientiously, Germany included."
"My country is accused of exercising excessively stringent controls, and thereby driving workers from other Member States away."
"How provocative can you get?"
"I expected a different position from a Commissioner whose fairness I otherwise greatly value."
"Although cooperation between sending countries and recipient countries is important, it cannot replace effective controls."
"Our common aim must be to secure worker protection, to prevent social dumping and to uncover and punish illegal working."
"But this can only be done if we have valid documents, which should be in the language of the host country."
"The following should be ready for presentation: work contracts, pay calculations, timesheets."
"The General Prosecutor at the European Court of Justice supports this view, because inspectors will obviously have considerable problems with documents that have not been drawn up in the language of the respective country."
"Secondly, in order to allow notices to be properly sent, the recipient must prove an address in Germany, and not just a mail-drop abroad that has been specially chosen for anonymity and everyone is obliged to appoint as an official representative anyone they consider appropriate."
"The place of work could also be an address."
"This I consider to be a fair solution."
"Threatening infringement proceedings are an insult."
"In Europe, Commissioner, things must be fair, not least as regards controls."
"Mr ≈†pidla, I ask you, please keep the sense of scale and balance we are used to seeing from you."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am one of those who thinks that posting of workers is an opportunity for the European Union and its citizens."
"An opportunity both in economic terms and in terms of contributing to strengthening the European idea."
"Workers who are posted on European territory are first of all Europeans and they must be treated as such, which, to my mind, means that for the same job in the same territory, no inequality should be allowed."
"One of the problems raised today by the Directive 96/71/EC is that, on account of the lack of harmonisation of national systems in relation to labour law and the disparities existing between new and old Member States in this field, a fear arises that this directive will allow arbitration between Member States and be linked with 'social dumping'."
"I repeat once more: it is from the top that social Europe must be built, and not by smashing to bits its social acquis, as some here would like."
"I cite as evidence certain amendments tabled on this report in relation to modernising labour law."
"In this field, I advise them not to play at alchemy, at the risk of finding themselves confronted with uncontrollable social conflicts."
"To my mind, in order to avoid these pitfalls, Member States must be able to continue to retain some restrictions but also, when they receive workers on secondment, they must be able to impose certain conditions."
"I think in particular that workers on secondment must have authorised representatives who must be independent."
"They must be able to supply relevant information regarding working hours and health and safety in relation to this work, so that they can be guaranteed protection."
"Employees on secondment must make a prior declaration, so that the social partners in the host countries, where wages are fixed by collective bargaining, can come into play to negotiate directly with the home company of the seconded workers."
"We must, however, go further still in this field by giving further thought, for example, to establishing a minimum European wage."
"We must have a political commitment to convergence towards a floor of social rights common to all the European Union."
"It is with such practices that we put ourselves on the road towards a social Europe, a united Europe, a Europe of workers that we all wish for."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, when we were discussing the services directive, we stated quite clearly and definitely that it should in no way affect social rights in Member States."
"That is why we removed the infamous Articles 24 and 25 from the directive, because it should not be possible to override these rights by exploiting loopholes."
"We also agreed that, to clear up any ambiguities, the Posting of Workers Directive should be amended if any problems arise."
"I would like to remind you of this compromise, which the European Commission also agreed to, and would like to demand this agreement again."
"Commissioner, I share your view that lack of, or poor, cooperation among the authorities is one of the main reasons why we are having such problems with the Posting of Workers Directive, but do you really believe that by removing opportunities for control, documentation and everything else that is needed for control, will improve poor collaboration?"
"On the contrary, lack of documentation and poor cooperation among authorities equals social dumping pure and simple."
"I cannot believe that that is what you really want."
"So let us work together towards improving administrative cooperation, and to open the market for services and the markets for workers at the highest level of social protection."
"Then we will be doing something positive for Europe, and, instead of a destructive approach to the Member States, strive positively for solutions that really will help things to progress."
"That is the direction we should take."
"Otherwise we will end up not achieving what we set out to do."
"Madam President, I am disappointed that Commissioner ≈†pidla has told us today that he does not propose a new communication on this issue."
"If European workers are to move from Member State to Member State without triggering a race to the bottom, we must ensure that the law is clear, that there are standards applied commonly across the European Union and that they are fully implemented."
"The Posting of Workers Directive, as it stands, does not meet those criteria, nor do the guidelines which the Commission published only a year ago."
"Right now, we need the Commission to insist on the retention of documents in the Member States where a worker is posted and we need to insist on an identifiable employer who carries legal responsibility for compliance."
"Even that will not be enough unless all Member States put in place compliance mechanisms and severe penalties for breaches of the law."
"There is no possibility of progress on issues like flexicurity and reform of labour law unless we deal with issues such as workers' security in this area."
"Workers in Europe will not stand for a diminution of their rights or a race to the bottom."
"We will not get any legislation through this House which weakens their rights in any way unless they can see that there are advantages for them in preventing a race to the bottom."
"I believe the short-sightedness of the Council and the Commission in this area is unbelievable, and it is simply inexplicable if they are serious about creating a European social union."
"Member of the Commission. - (CS) Honourable Members I should like to make it clear that the correct implementation of the posted workers directive is not, under any circumstances, a back door through which we are seeking to weaken and compromise the protection of workers in the European labour market."
"Quite the opposite, correct implementation of the directive will lead to the effective protection of workers, and this is of vital importance."
"It is not true at all that the Commission is placing restrictions on monitoring powers: let me state categorically that any measures that a Member State deems necessary, and which are proportionate to the objective, will of course be correct and applicable."
"I must also point out that the decision on this directive, did not take place in some ivory tower any more than the decision on the communication did - it has been discussed on countless occasions on the ground with the social partners."
"I feel that when it comes to implementing laws, we all know where to draw the line between instances when the law becomes a matter of mere bureaucracy, and fails to achieve its objectives, and on the other hand instances when it achieves different and incorrect objectives."
"Checks must therefore be thorough and effective, but within the framework of an applied method, as the directive and the law in general do not allow everything."
"In other words, not everything will be acceptable - only that which falls within the framework of the law, and which is effective and is proportionate."
"As regards amending the directive, which has been suggested, I should like to say that Parliament has itself addressed this issue at least twice or three times before, as have the social partners, and no overriding position was formulated whereby the directive could be recast in a substantive way."
"On the contrary, the positions formulated were always in favour of improving cooperation and implementation."
"I should also like to point out that the implementation is a matter for the Member States, and the Commission is responsible for ensuring that implementation is carried out within the framework of European law."
"It also has an obligation to use the legal resources at its disposal."
"In this regard, the Commission of course checks what the situation is in labour markets in the individual Member States and proceeds in a considered way, as is laid down in the law."
"It is of course extremely important to improve administrative cooperation."
"It is also important to improve cooperation between individual monitoring bodies in the Member States, and the Commission will proceed and channel its efforts in this direction."
"If it is shown in subsequent debates that there are grounds for extending the law, this point will certainly be opened up, and fervently debated."
"At the moment, neither the preliminary political debate in Parliament nor the debate with the social partners suggests that it would be right to take any new legislative action in this field."
"Honourable Members, I must stress once again that the objective of this directive is the effective protection of workers, and any monitoring measures that contribute to effective protection will be appropriate."
"Member States that do not carry out effective monitoring are in breach of the directive."
"It is clear that monitoring in any area must be pursued in a manner which is proportionate, in the legal sense of the term, and we are often in dispute over what is proportionate."
"The Court of Justice in Luxembourg has the authority to settle such disputes between European institutions."
"To wind up the debate, a motion for resolution has been tabled under Rule 108(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, 11 July 2007."
"Membership of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"First railway package (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Michael Cramer, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the implementation of the first railway package"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by expressing my deep gratitude to the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation on the first railway package."
"Generally speaking, the first railway package can be described as a complete success."
"The opening of the networks in Europe to rail freight traffic has proved its worth."
"The countries who have done particularly well are those who prepared themselves for this early on rather than waiting until the networks were opened."
"For example, Germany has been able to increase rail freight traffic by 25% and the Netherlands by 42.5% since the opening of the networks, and the United Kingdom and Poland have managed to increase the proportion of freight transported by rail by 60% - albeit at a low level in the case of the United Kingdom."
"This benefits the environment, and it benefits transport in Europe."
"The countries who did not prepare for this, and waited until the last moment, are not doing so well."
"For example, France, which did not open up its freight networks until the beginning of this year, saw a 28% decrease in rail freight traffic for the same period."
"Its volume of road freight traffic has increased - which hardly fits in with prevailing climate policy."
"In my report, I also discuss the fact that the overall modal split has not changed - the reason for which being, of course, the absence of fair framework conditions between the different modes of transport."
"Our framework conditions are spectacularly unfair!"
"Transport in Europe could also be described as too cheap, with only rail transport - which is environmentally friendly - being too expensive."
"We also have unfair subsidy practice: approximately 95% of total EU cofinancing for transport is spent on road transport - not on rail transport, as is always called for and claimed in soapbox speeches."
"For this reason, I am delighted that the committee was able to agree that, in future, 40% of spending on transport should be channelled to the railways."
"It is unacceptable that our efforts should be counteracted by poor financing practice."
"The unfair framework conditions also take the form of, inter alia, the imposition by the EU of mandatory rail tolls applying to all trains on all routes and having no upper limit, whilst road tolls do have an upper limit, are voluntary - the Member States can decide whether to levy them or not - and apply only on motorways and only to lorries above 12 tonnes."
"This is unfair competition, and must change if the railways are to have a chance."
"For example, some of the new Member States are levying very high tolls on rail freight services."
"The eight highest track charges are levied in the new Member States."
"At the same time, these high tolls are used to subsidise passenger transport, which receives hardly any State subsidies or none at all, whilst road freight transport escapes with no charges."
"This is a model of how to move transport from the railways to the roads - exactly the opposite of what the competent Commissioner and the EU always claim to be aiming for."
"We want fair competition; but this fair competition is not yet complete, as particularly those railway undertakings that do not have a long State tradition are frustrated time and again in Europe."
"They have complained, for example, that access to the network or to a favourable route cannot be granted because this route has already been allocated to the rail undertaking belonging to the dominant group, that their wishes cannot be met since points have previously been extended or passing loops dismantled by the State undertaking, that low-speed stretches of route (speed limits) have been ordered - for no good reason - in order to frustrate the wishes of the new rail freight operators, that route prices have been drastically increased when State railway undertakings have been sold to another undertaking, that cross-subsidisation is not being prevented, and that non-State undertakings often pay higher energy prices than group subsidiaries."
"This shows that much remains to be done in spite of our success."
"After all, the overall modal split between road and rail in Europe has not improved, but actually worsened."
"One thing that can be said, however, is that the first railway package has halted the decline."
"If we are to improve the situation, we now need fair framework conditions for rail transport in Europe."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted that the European Parliament has taken up the report by the Commission on the implementation of the first railway package of 3 May 2006, and I should like especially to thank Mr Cramer, the author of the report, for his very serious and solid work."
"The challenge of European railway policy is to put in place a regulatory framework that encourages new investments and the provision of competitive transport services in a common railway area."
"The creation of this common railway area demands the full and correct transposition of Community provisions."
"In its report in 2006, the Commission identified the conditions to be met to take up the challenge: I will mention the most important of them."
"Firstly, restructuring of the historic enterprises must be completed."
"It must be done while respecting conditions of separate accounting and of neutrality of the essential functions such as allocation of capacities and levying of charges."
"Secondly, the principles underlying the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure must be established taking into account the levying of charges for other modes of transport."
"That must be part of an overall strategy encouraging fair competition between modes and therefore sustainable development."
"Thirdly, the good functioning of the supervisory and safety bodies demands that these same bodies should be granted the necessary financial and human resources. These bodies must enjoy genuine independence."
"The European Parliament largely takes up the priorities for action that have been identified by the Commission."
"These priorities put forward the conditions of intermodal and intramodal competition, as well as rules governing the separation between infrastructure and operation."
"With regard to the conditions for intermodal competition, the Commission wishes to create a fair and balanced competitive framework."
"In your report, Mr Cramer, you mention fairer competition between modes of transport, particularly through internalisation of the external costs of road transport."
"At the time of the adoption of the Eurovignette directive, I made the commitment to submit, in June 2008, a methodology for the internalisation of external costs. Well, this commitment will be kept!"
"As for the conditions for intramodal competition, I support your position in favour of rapid deployment of the European signalling system European Rail Traffic Management System/European Train Control System (ERTMS/ETCS) and the reduction in the noise level of wagons."
"On this last point, that is, noise nuisance, I shall present a Commission communication on the measures to be taken."
"We are in agreement also concerning infrastructures."
"This needs to be a priority in order to promote good performance of rail freight transport."
"In October, I shall propose to the Commission a communication on a rail network focussed on freight in Europe."
"This document will present a plan of action which will cover the main suggestions in your resolution."
"Finally, I quite agree on the need for strict neutrality of the essential functions to realise the policy of market opening and the strengthening of competition."
"Your report describes the positive effects of opening up on the performance of rail freight in the Member States that have been the first to open the markets."
"Finally, I should like to remind you that the Commission intends to do everything in its power so that Member States effectively implement the provisions of the railway packages."
"If necessary also, we shall start infringement proceedings."
"A European market can only develop if the regulatory framework is consistent over all European territory."
"Non-discriminatory access to services linked with rail transport, for example in the marshalling yards, is vital for the good functioning of the rail market."
"My services are also assessing options with a view to recasting the legislation of the first railway package on this point, which will lead us to a recasting of the European railway code next year."
"That is what I wanted to say in reply to Mr Cramer, whom I thank once again."
"I wish, of course, to confirm to him that the intention of the Commission and of myself as the Commissioner is certainly to do everything so that the modal shift in favour of the railways is as substantial as possible in the years to come."
"I shall now listen, Mr President, to the Members of Parliament with close attention, so that I can answer them at the end of the debate."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen."
"Mr Cramer, you already know that I have not always been enthused by your report in all respects - we do not need to discuss this fact today."
"The report lacks balance and practical relevance."
"For example, it contains many provisions unrelated to the implementation of the first railway package in terms of content."
"Therefore, we - our coordinator Mr Jarzembowski and I - have tabled 20 amendments, only 11 of which involve the deletion of whole paragraphs."
"I was pleased with the outcome of the vote in the Committee on Transport and Tourism."
"The important points are, firstly, the call for the Commission to take action, without delay, against Member States who have not implemented the first and second railway packages by the specified date."
"Secondly, we consider it important, with regard to the financing of the further development of the European transport routes, that support be given in particular to the 30 priority trans-European network projects."
"Unfortunately, the complete deletion of the paragraph headed 'Regulation of the separation between network and operation' could not be pushed through."
"I reject out of hand a limitation of the choice between the various organisational models."
"We need solid evidence."
"We need to know the advantages and disadvantages of such a separation."
"We still need flexibility for railway undertakings."
"That is why we have requested a split vote."
"I should also like to say a few brief words about the problem of 'gigaliners': that is, ultra-long lorries of 60 tonnes and upwards."
"We cannot support Mr Cramer's amendment concerning these in tomorrow's vote on this report - which, after all, concerns the railway package."
"I do fully agree that goods belong on the railways, and thus my position may appear contradictory, but an amendment on gigaliners has no place in this report."
"We shall discuss this within the framework of the Ayala Sender report - when we shall also have time for the debate."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (FR) Mr President, at a time when we are drawing up the statement for the first railway package, we have to recognise that we are still far short of the target."
"In spite of the progress achieved and particularly the fact of having stemmed a decline which seemed unavoidable, rail's modal share remains still too weak."
"It is all the more unfortunate because in these times of climate change the choice of rail sees its relevance confirmed every day by what is happening."
"We know what the reasons are for this mixed statement: we have staked too much on opening up, the contributions of which cannot be denied, without worrying enough about the technical barriers, in particular the lack of interoperability, knowing that this ought to have accompanied the opening up gradually, instead of lagging further and further behind."
"This situation is probably due to the fact that in general liberalising does not cost the Member States very much, while harmonisation is a different matter."
"Today at the very moment when we are at last beginning again to tackle the problems of interoperability, it therefore seems to me worrying that, under cover of co-modality, the objectives of modal shift towards rail, in particular, move into the background."
"Instead of revising the objectives downwards, we ought to have revised the intellectual as well as the financial means upwards."
"I hope that this report will contribute therefore to reminding us of the way we have still to go in order to give back to rail the place it deserves."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as you stressed before me, the object of the first package was to lay the foundations of an integrated European railway area and, by modernising the network, speed up the modal shift of freight traffic from road to rail, so as to reduce CO2 emissions and also, obviously, all the road congestion from which Europe is suffering."
"I wish to thank my colleague Mr Cramer for his own-initiative report which sets out a full assessment of the implementation of the first package, without omitting to underline nonetheless all the factors which affect the performance of rail and those which hold up the achievement of the objectives that we have set ourselves."
"In the first place we should emphasise that the opening of the rail network, while maintaining a very high level of safety, has allowed a very significant increase in freight traffic at least throughout the European Union, and small rail undertakings have also been able to take an interest in niches considered unprofitable by the historic operators."
"I am pleased that the report also places the emphasis on the current system of levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure, which does not allow the setting up of fair competition between the different modes of freight transport."
"I think that it is essential today to achieve as rapidly as possible a harmonisation of user fees capped by sector which can better take into account the internalisation of external costs and which limits the exponential increase that we are witnessing currently."
"I think also that it will be necessary to have more discussion about the Eurovignette directive, as this represented an advance that we must continue, and I am pleased that you have confirmed this evening, Commissioner, that discussions about this are planned from June 2008."
"I would like, moreover, Commissioner, the Commission to commit itself rapidly, with you, to a process of modernisation and development of intermodal infrastructures, mainly on the international corridors of Road Transport Telematics (RTT), through a European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) equipment system and allowing a genuine junction with the port infrastructures on the one hand and river infrastructures on the other."
"Finally, I would like the Commission to present recommendations with a view to financial stabilisation of the railways which, in my view, will have to take into account the reduction in debt from which some historic operators have benefited, in order to put all the rail transport actors on an equal footing."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mr Barrot, first of all I would like to thank Mr Cramer for his report, even though it has, certainly, been assessed in highly contradictory ways."
"In my own brief comments I would like to touch on just one aspect - I was pleased to see that the report stressed that, despite the liberalisation of the rail freight transport market, the European Union's border states, such as the Baltic States, in reality depend on freight customers, and in our case this usually means Russia."
"If Russia, however, chooses to work with a rail monopoly company, then it is relatively difficult for us to discern a real impact arising from the introduction of this first package of rail legislation."
"I think, therefore, that this issue needs to be discussed further with Russia, with other potential aspects in mind also, and this is particularly true in view of the announcement by Mr Ivanov, Russia's vice-premier, concerning moving the flow of container freight to Russian ports alone."
"Thank you."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, for many years, everyone has been saying that, in relation to the transport of goods in all European countries, rail is losing the battle."
"The same applies even to cross-border, long-distance transport."
"The railway system is suitable for mass transport and, in some cases, special goods lines have been built for this purpose, mainly in and around industrial areas in Germany."
"Similarly, the recently opened Betuwe line in the Netherlands, which forms part of freight corridor No 1 from Rotterdam to Genoa via Germany and Switzerland, is a special line of this kind which is totally unsuited for the transport of passengers."
"Despite this favourable starting position for rail, the proportion of goods transported by rail has decreased and, in some cases, even the volume is declining."
"Much of this transport has been taken over by the lorry, and the huge increase in the volume of goods is largely being handled by motorway, as a result of which these are increasingly becoming congested."
"This shift is, to a considerable extent, related to infrastructure."
"Before, rail boasted a very intricate network, opening up both villages in the countryside and ports and factories in the cities."
"Apart from goods lines, there were also container stations where goods carriages came together and were redistributed across different trains."
"As many companies had their own connections to the railway network, goods carriages were able to shuttle directly between a harbour quay and a remote company without any interim transhipment of goods."
"Everything people want to achieve these days using multi-modal systems was already in place then."
"Unfortunately, the governments have decided to shrink the railway network, because it is deemed loss-making."
"Many small railway lines have been discontinued and many connections to companies have disappeared."
"Billions have been invested, on the other hand, in extending the space-guzzling motorway network."
"In many cases, door-to-door goods transport is only possible by lorry these days."
"It is indispensable for pick-up and delivery, and it seems the easiest option then to use the motorways for the much longer, in-between section as well."
"If the company connections and container stations were restored, this could make a considerable contribution to reinstating goods transport by rail."
"The first railway package is partly based on the assumption that rail transport should adopt the working methods of transport by road and air."
"In this case, it is international companies that arrange cross-border transport from beginning to end, and this is the most attractive option for those people with a transport requirement."
"My group has always pointed out that this is not the only possible solution."
"There is an alternative, namely better cooperation between national railway companies."
"They should not see each other as competitors, but as partners in a comprehensive European railway network."
"It is precisely by encouraging them to enter into competition with each other that cooperation runs less smoothly."
"To date, we have not yet seen any positive results in respect of the course taken."
"The free market is often not a solution to a problem, but its very cause."
"The rapporteur is right in always arguing in favour of the new standard safety system, European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)."
"We see eye to eye with him on this."
"We also notice that the launch of this system is far less swift than had been expected and that, alongside the new system, a second old system should remain in place."
"Thanks to the average low speed in freight transport, ERTMS makes for fewer problems compared to the high-speed lines for passenger transport."
"Finally, we share Mr Cramer's view that transport by air and road are kept artificially cheap and that transport by rail is kept artificially dear."
"If we do not change this in any way, the least environmentally friendly mode of transport will continue to prevail."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, that was interesting: Mr Meijer virtually recreating ancient railway history before our eyes."
"He, too, should have perceived the very idea of laying railway tracks from one village to another for freight transport as being as slow as it is unrealistic."
"Mr Cramer, nor can I share your simplistic demonising of the lorry."
"After all, lorry operators pay corporation tax, vehicle tax, petroleum tax and tolls - and so the assertion that lorries drive for free and competition is distorted is simply unrealistic."
"I fully share your view that it is not right for Poland's Ministry of Finance to charge excessively high route prices - but that is an issue for the Polish Government, not European legislation, to deal with."
"We should perhaps remind the Polish Government that route prices are intended to promote rail transport rather than to reform the Polish budget situation - but this has absolutely nothing to do with the lorry."
"Mr President, I should like to ask you to ensure speedy implementation of the second railway package, too, by all Member States."
"After all, we pushed through the requirement that networks must have been opened up to the national and cross-border movement of goods by 1 January of this year, and I see this as a great opportunity to help European markets operate across borders."
"I should like to discuss one of the points the Commissioner raised, and I would ask him to elaborate on this."
"He said that the Commission is willing to help reduce the noise caused by rail trucks, and announced a communication on this."
"What I should like to know is when he plans to present this communication."
"Does he believe that this will put greater focus on European aspects, or will it open up possibilities for the granting of aid at national level?"
"Noise pollution - for example, from trains passing through residential areas at night - is unacceptable in cities, in particular."
"If the Commissioner is prepared to provide help with this, we would be very grateful."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr Cramer's report on the implementation of the first railway package shows the difficulties and problems it faces."
"If railway transport develops and runs properly, it can result in more people and goods being carried, thereby taking the burden off road transportation and cutting CO2 emissions."
"Rapid passenger transport can also compete with local airlines and coach services."
"Interlinking rail, road and water transport can reduce its costs and increase the efficiency of the economy."
"In implementing this package, we should pay particular attention to supporting railway projects, particularly in countries that lack the funding to expand and upgrade their railway network and infrastructure, supporting all activities relating to the exchange of good practice, including for establishing flexible and competitive modes of operation for railway companies, monitoring and removing organisational, administrative and financial barriers to the development of transport, and support for the railways taking over a portion of international road haulage operations."
"I would like to thank Mr Cramer for his necessary and insightful report."
"(PT) The report being debated today contains aspects that reflect the demands of the large private interests that lie behind the liberalisation and privatisation of public rail transport services promoted by the European Union, which we reject."
"Our view is that the report should, instead, denounce the dismemberment in EU countries of public services and public companies, the closure of branch lines and stations, service reductions and cuts in the number of trains, the brutal reduction in the number of rail workers, and the increase in precarious work in this sector."
"We also believe that the report should, in other respects, fight for the promotion of public rail services through the existence of strong public companies with all their merits, with effective management to ensure high-quality services and high safety standards; for a guaranteed, high-quality, high-capacity, comfortable public rail service with affordable fares, fully meeting the needs of passenger mobility and goods transport; and for job security for the workers in the sector, promoting their inclusion in the companies' senior management teams, enhancing careers and wages and ensuring continued training."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, I thank each of the speakers for the wise observations they have shared with me."
"Nonetheless, I shall say a few words on a point which, to my surprise, has not really received the attention of the European Parliament."
"It is about the separation between the management of the rail infrastructure and the provision of transport services."
"It is, in fact, this separation which makes it possible to give to competition its full scope."
"We have to ensure non-discriminatory access to facilitate the entry into the market of new entrants."
"That is a very important point."
"I should like to answer some questions."
"In talking about co-modality, our goal was simply to explain that rail transport, which is indisputably the best solution over long distances, must be able to be completed by local transport which, in certain cases, can only be provided, as Mr Jarzembowski has said, by road."
"Therefore, the idea is not to take something away from rail but on the contrary to allow it to have its rightful place."
"Oh yes, it is very clear!"
"I am speaking in particular to Mr Navarro: one must make no mistake about the intention."
"The intention is really to make a success of this modal shift, which is very important to me, as it is to you."
"I must say also that what we are doing, be it about financing infrastructures across trans-European networks or interoperability, which the European Rail Traffic Management System and European Train Control System is going to make possible for us, or the cross-acceptance of rolling stock or the promotion of freight traffic on European corridors, all these achievements seek to obtain the most substantial modal shift possible."
"I think that, on this point, our approach presents no ambiguity."
"Mrs Griesbeck, I would like to confirm the Commission's intention to present guidelines on state aid in the rail sector before the end of the year."
"I should also like to confirm to Mr Jarzembowski that the communication on the noise of carriages is planned for the autumn of this year."
"I cannot say any more about it for the time being; we are in the process of working on it."
"There are certainly other questions which deserve an answer. I would like you to know, in any case, that I really have listened with close attention to all that has been said by each of you."
"I consider for my part that the work carried out by Mr Cramer and his committee is enlightening for the Commission."
"I should like to repeat again that what we want are fair intermodal and intramodal conditions of competition which make it possible effectively to develop this modal shift to which, I repeat again once more, we are very committed, particularly for reasons of environment and relief of congestion on our road network."
"For all the reasons that you can imagine, we have more need than ever of the railway."
"I must say that, each day, I work towards this with much determination."
"I have moreover realised that, with the opening of Betuwe in the Netherlands, a willingness is really establishing itself in Europe with a view to giving rail its rightful place; and indeed, if in certain cases, problems of charging arise, it is incumbent upon the Member States to accept their responsibilities."
"This modal shift is a real priority cause in Europe."
"It is necessary also that governments accept making it their priority."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July 2007."
"Common rules for air transport services (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Ar≈´nas Degutis, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for the operation of air transport services in the Community (recast) C6-0248/2006."
"rapporteur. - (LT) This future regulation should replace three regulations currently in force, which make up the third set of guidelines for the domestic air transport market."
"The aforesaid regulations set out the procedures for issue and cancellation of air transport firm licences and the principles for free use of Community air routes by Community air transport companies, and liberalising prices of airfares."
"Once the third set of guidelines began to be applied, an unprecedented expansion of the European air travel sector took place: the old monopolies disappeared, a system of local air transport was instituted, and consumer-friendly competition increased in all markets, especially in the area of pricing."
"What had been a regulated European aviation market based on bilateral agreements became a particularly competitive market."
"It is natural that after a few years of applying the third set of guidelines, some guidelines became obsolete, others were applied poorly, and now they need revision, reconsideration or straight-out abolition."
"The proposal under consideration urges correction of the three sets of guidelines that have been mentioned to make them easier to apply, to simplify the legal grounds, to remove the obsolete parts and to set new, firmer requirements."
"In my opinion the Commission's proposal is logical, and I agree that it would not only be meaningful but also purposeful and essential to review the regulations now in force."
"In any case, in the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, which I of course support, some important parts of the regulations need to be made more precise."
"I would like to mention a few of these parts:"
"Rentals."
"There is variation among the Member States in regard to rental agreement practices."
"This can distort the market and cause social and aviation safety problems."
"Therefore, without a doubt, new general requirements need to be set."
"The rules proposed in Article 13 are too strict and do not take into consideration certain characteristics of the air transport industry, especially its seasonality."
"Therefore, it would be good to find a logical compromise between social concerns and safety, and simultaneously improve the performance of airlines."
"In my opinion the compromise reached by the Transport Committee may help to resolve this problem."
"Transparency of prices."
"We support the Commission's aim of banning advertising of and publicity about airfares which do not include any costs, surcharges, payments and levies."
"I believe that the airlines' commitment to publish only final prices has to be clearly formulated."
"Here too we have found a compromise which also reflects consumer needs."
"Particular social considerations."
"Suggestions concerning particular social considerations put forward by colleagues from other groups are, in my opinion, premature unless the possible consequences are analysed assuming adoption at this time."
"Therefore, we request that the Commission prepare a study, on the basis of which it would be possible to regulate these matters without creating obstacles for the improvement of aviation industry competitiveness."
"Passenger safety."
"In the Commission's proposal there is no provision for any clear mechanism, which would ensure that passengers would not suffer from the effects of bankruptcy of airlines; for example, not getting compensation for cancelled flights or being abandoned to their fate at overseas destinations."
"Therefore, we believe that guidelines for passenger safety should be included in the regulations (Amendments 15-16)."
"Commitment to provide public services and regional airports."
"I believe that any formulation of the term 'regional airport', which obliges to provide services to the public, will inevitably include airports in economically more affluent regions, whereas airports in regions that need economic or social support may not be included in the definition."
"Since the commitment to provide public services on this principle is applicable only to airports serving regions having economic and social problems, I would suggest that the difficult-to-define concept of regional airport be dropped from this document."
"As well as the points mentioned earlier, one should explain several definitions and conditions in order to avoid misunderstandings and erroneous application of the regulations."
"Community's domestic air services."
"While we suggested some amendments for the subjects mentioned earlier, we support the proposed extension of the Commission's powers in relation to deciding on questions concerning the provision of domestic Community air services."
"Since the Commission can more effectively negotiate concerning certain rights than can individual Member States, it should have the opportunity to do so."
"This has been demonstrated by the agreement with Russia on transit flights over Siberia."
"Therefore, it is recommended that the Commission's proposed wording for Article 15 be accepted."
"That is a brief characterisation of service provision."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal we are debating today represents a great success for the European Community."
"It seeks, in fact, to modernise and complete the 1992 regulation that set up the single aviation market in Europe."
"The creation of this single aviation market has allowed air transport in Europe to enjoy unprecedented expansion."
"The number of airlines has increased and there has been a general increase in traffic and competition."
"Since full liberalisation in 1997, the number of routes has increased by more than 60%; more cities are served, notably in the isolated regions."
"The appearance of new competitors has brought a significant reduction in fares on numerous routes."
"More and more Europeans can travel by plane."
"This development contributes to economic growth, as well as to the creation of direct and indirect employment."
"Taking this success into account, the Commission intends to maintain the fundamental principles of this liberalised market."
"The proposal seeks simply to simplify the consolidation of current legislation."
"It proposes also some adjustments to improve the effectiveness of its application."
"Firstly, the revision makes it possible to clean up the text to remove the obsolete parts linked to the transition phase towards the liberalised market."
"The text has been clarified, ambiguities have been removed and three regulations have been consolidated into a single text."
"Secondly, the proposal seeks to achieve effective and uniform application of Community rules."
"At present there are divergences between Member States in the application of the third package."
"Thanks to this revision, we shall have a more uniform application especially in relation to the granting and overseeing of operating licences."
"The proposal strengthens, moreover, the monitoring of the financial viability of companies, in particular of the new entrants."
"Thirdly, the proposal strengthens coordination of Member States on intra-Community services and transit overflight by companies from third countries."
"It is important to encourage a coordinated Community approach to ensure the integrity of the European market and to facilitate the work of the negotiators with the third countries."
"Finally, fourth point, the proposal advocates new rights for passengers."
"The right for passengers to have complete information on the real price of a ticket with taxes, charges and costs included. The right not to be discriminated against according to nationality or place of residence at the time of purchasing a ticket."
"Consequently, this updated version should further strengthen the appeal of the single European market in many third countries."
"These principles apply not only to Switzerland and to countries in the European Economic Area but also to Morocco and to the countries in South East Europe and they serve as a benchmark at international level."
"That is why I thank, Mr President, the European Parliament for the speed with which it has taken up this dossier."
"I would like to commend the work carried out by your rapporteur Mr Degutis, and to thank the chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Paolo Costa, as well as all the members of that committee because, I must say, Parliament has certainly improved on our text."
"on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to start by extending the warmest of thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, and all the Members involved, for their cooperation."
"I firmly believe that, since the vote in committee, we have a balanced, practical report on the operation of air transport services."
"The original Commission proposal was well thought-out and goal oriented in this case, so I am much obliged to the Commission, too."
"Since I am basically satisfied with the outcome of the vote in committee, I should like to discuss only the transparency requirements with regard to the listing of air fares."
"From the outset, I have stood up for the creation of transparency without additional bureaucracy, and for the equal, fair involvement of everyone concerned."
"The air fare advertised should show clearly what charges, duties and taxes this includes and what they are used for."
"Air-ticket prices should be easy for consumers to understand and transparent."
"This is particularly applicable to the advertising of air fares on websites."
"Nevertheless, there is still disagreement over the means, and the precise extent of this."
"Amendment 48 lays down that duties and charges must be listed and summarised in four categories: firstly, taxes and other State charges and duties; secondly, air traffic control charges; thirdly, charges, duties, fees and other costs for the benefit of the airlines; and, fourthly, fees, levies, charges and other costs for the benefit of the airport operators."
"The problem is that air traffic control charges cannot be clearly stated in advance."
"Tomorrow, then, on behalf of my group, I shall be requesting the deletion of this second category, air traffic control charges, by means of split voting."
"Despite this amendment, the compromise reached fully meets the transparency requirement, whilst taking into account the interests of passengers and also airlines, and so I and my group cannot support the rapporteur's new amendments, Amendments 54 and 55."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome the Commission proposal and also, of course, the rapporteur's report, as both make a contribution to the completion of the European internal market for air transport and to increasing safety levels."
"I should like to mention and highlight four points."
"Firstly, the provision on price transparency that has been adopted is a clear victory for consumers."
"It will no longer be possible in future to lure citizens with false bait advertising."
"Irrespective of the sales channel, all air fares are to be set out comprehensively and in detail."
"Naturally, air traffic control prices are estimated on a flat-rate basis - although, at the end of the day, prices must be comprehensible."
"We do not need to argue about this, however."
"On the whole, we are creating clarity for passengers and strengthening competition."
"Secondly, with regard to wet-leasing contracts, this is a balanced Regulation that, on the one hand, takes account of airlines' needs in the event that seasonal pricing movements occur or an exceptional need arises and they have to rely on such a model; and, on the other, makes clear that the circumvention of European safety and social standards is unacceptable."
"Thirdly, like many reports on aviation legislation, our report contains numerous amendments on social legislation for employees."
"The Commission is urgently required to make a proposal on this at long last, to close the loophole that the Services Directive has left and the present Regulation cannot close."
"Fourthly, the new one-step procedure for traffic distribution is simpler and quicker than all previous procedures."
"This is a good decision, including in terms of the future, that enables a more flexible response to capacity bottlenecks in infrastructure."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Mr President, my thanks to Mr Degutis for his report."
"We must agree with Commissioner Barrot's words that the third package in the internal air market, which is now fifteen years old, has significantly contributed to the development of European civil aviation."
"Now change is needed, in particular as regards leasing, licensing air transport services, social matters, protecting passengers against carrier bankruptcy and so forth."
"Other important factors are proper observance of the eight Freedoms of the Air."
"The question that raises the greatest emotion is the transparency of air ticket prices."
"Passengers expect to know how much they will actually pay for tickets, not publicity stunts in disguise."
"I support the view that the regulation and the directive we have adopted preventing unfair competition, which will come into effect in five months, will lead to an increase in passenger rights."
"A passenger must be the subject both of the activities of the carrier and of the airport."
"Unfortunately, it is too often the case that passengers are simply treated as cargo."
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (CS) Ladies and gentlemen, I associate the common rules for the operation of air transport services in the Community with the third aviation package or with problems relating to its practical implementation."
"Perhaps the biggest problem here is transport safety, which involves securing the social conditions of employees, including cases where aircraft are hired out together with crews, as well as the safety of passengers, who are traditionally the priority."
"Alongside this is the issue of the financial health of airlines and the stricter requirements for the terms and conditions that apply to aircraft leasing, including proposed time limits."
"I feel that it would also be desirable for consumers to know what exactly they have bought for their money."
"You too would surely feel suspicious about airline advertisements promising fares of EUR 1."
"Another issue is that of how detailed the price breakdown should be, and what exactly it should contain."
"In this regard, it is very important to clarify the distribution of cost items for processing passengers and aircraft, including the endless discussions on the concept of reasonable profit."
"I am definitely opposed to the idea that has emerged during the debate that this is about technical standards and that social issues do not come into play."
"I should like to thank the rapporteur Mr Degutis, who has also referred to social issues in his speech."
"His work was outstanding and his report deserves our support."
"As regards the proposed amendments, we agree with all of them apart from Nos. 16, 29, 37, 40, 42, 49 and 50."
"In most cases, this is not a matter of substantive disagreement: our objections mainly involve instances where the same thing has been proposed in two places or where better options are available."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to refer to three more aspects."
"In the consolidation of the third aviation package, it is crucial in terms of the transparency of air fares that there be no false bait advertising, and it is also relevant in this regard whether the flat-rate security charges levied on passengers actually match the costs of the security measures."
"I have the feeling that airports are using some of these security charges to obtain further remuneration for themselves."
"It is very important in the interests of the transparency of costs that security charges do indeed correspond to the costs incurred by security measures."
"Secondly, I should like to discuss competition between airports, and to do so from two angles."
"I should like to ask the Commissioner to give one or two examples without delay to show the extent to which the Commission's guidelines for permissible (or impermissible) aid for regional airports in the Community are actually being applied."
"As I see it, there are a great many regional airports that are only being kept afloat by subsidies and will never be able to support themselves economically."
"In these cases, the Commission guidelines should actually be putting an end to the subsidies."
"Thirdly, this consolidation of the third aviation package changes the definition of an 'airport system' slightly."
"I would ask that the Commissioner elaborate on this, too, at some stage."
"It is unacceptable that, by law, an airport system can only exist if it serves the same conurbation, and that airports such as Frankfurt and Frankfurt Hahn can claim that, despite being 120 km apart, they serve the same conurbation and must therefore be recognised as an airport system."
"The Commissioner should on no account permit such mushrooming of what is recognised as an airport system."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Degutis, on the wonderful flexibility he has shown in accepting some of the proposals of the various Members."
"I would also like to congratulate the Commissioner on his magnificent presentation, because it has demonstrated that this text represents a definitive improvement of the legislation, since it updates, simplifies and consolidates the best aspects of rules that had become obsolete and which needed rapid updating, given the sector's development."
"In reality, all of this benefits all of the actors in the sector, particularly passengers, in a sector such as aviation that has suffered so much."
"Furthermore, inconsistency amongst these kind of regulations does not just usually distort the operation of the internal market, but we believe that it also leads to risks in terms of the quality of service, safety and working conditions."
"Of the improvements and achievements that Parliament has introduced - most of which have been mentioned by other Members already - I would like to stress the demand for greater transparency and control of the financial situation of companies and operators in the sector."
"In view of the exponential growth of this sector and the appearance of tempting pockets of potential customers - such as immigrants, who have increasing purchasing power thanks to work regularisation, in my country for example - it has become much more urgent to apply rules and conditions rigorously in order to prevent the fraud and abuse that usually arise in the sale of tickets and also the deceitful offers from companies that appear all over the place."
"We also believe the provisions to prevent and alleviate the social consequences of such fraud and of possible bankruptcies to be very reasonable."
"Furthermore, transparency of prices and non-discrimination in acquisition, through whichever channel the passenger acquires the tickets, also seem to us to be fundamental improvements to this text."
"Other aspects that I believe have emerged and have also improved are those relating to the social conditions for workers in the sector."
"Preventing social dumping, which disrupts the economic and social situation, and preventing games from being played with displaced workers employed by transnational companies operating from different bases, has been a positive achievement and an improvement."
"Better still is the fact that the debate that has opened up during the process of drawing up this report has led to the request, in Amendment 61, for a legislative proposal on social and working conditions, which I believe the Commission must present urgently."
"Mr President, the opening-up of air travel to millions of citizens has been brought about by the low-fares airlines."
"I agree with the Commissioner that the single aviation market has been a singular success."
"Airlines such as Ireland's Ryanair have revolutionised the aviation sector and have put pressure on the older, more established and more expensive airlines to follow suit."
"Such competition is good for the consumer and the traveller."
"However, I want to focus on what has already been mentioned by four people tonight, and that is that there is a problem."
"In such a competitive market, airlines have indulged - and still continue to indulge - in extremely attractive but grossly misleading price advertising."
"A travel fare advertised at five cents looks very attractive indeed, but when the consumer goes to book, either online or otherwise, the five-cent ticket can be several hundred euro when taxes and other charges are factored in."
"I raised this issue by way of a parliamentary question here last January, and the Commission replied, 'the Commission, while maintaining the general rule of price freedom, proposes that ""air carriers operating within the Community [...] provide the general public with comprehensive information on their air fares and rates and the conditions attached‚Äù."
"Consumers will thus be informed of the actual price (price of ticket plus the various charges and taxes).'"
"The Degutis report, which we are debating here tonight, will give practical effect to this, and that is extremely welcome."
"The obligation on airlines to introduce full transparency is extremely welcome and very important, because the consumer will now see from the very outset exactly what he or she will have to pay."
"That alone will not reduce the numbers of people travelling - as a lot of people think it might - but in my opinion it will further enhance competition and benefit the travelling public."
"Finally, could the Commissioner tell us when exactly we can expect this to come into effect?"
"The sooner the better, in my view."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank all the speakers and I am pleased about most of the amendments proposed."
"These amendments usefully clarify several points, especially concerning the economic and financial monitoring of companies or again the issues about leasing of aircraft."
"I fully support the proposed improvements concerning the principal place of business in order to ensure effective monitoring of companies for which a national authority has responsibility."
"The Commission also agrees with your proposals in relation to the conditions for granting or revoking licences, even if we cannot accept that this action could be taken on the basis of suspicion alone."
"The simplifications regarding public service obligations and coordination of airports will allow a more flexible and effective implementation of these measures."
"Moreover, although the Commission can support the major part of the amendments without any problem, I am going nonetheless to tell you about some reservations."
"I can understand and support the need to find solutions for passengers who are stranded when an airline goes bankrupt."
"Mrs Ayala referred to that."
"It is, indeed, such situations that have led to this updating of the regulation, which seeks to strengthen the conditions for granting licences and the economic and financial monitoring of companies."
"I cannot, however, at this stage, accept a new obligation whose feasibility and scope in economic and financial terms we have not yet analysed."
"That is why, in my opinion, we should make reference to the need to make provision for conditions for reimbursement and repatriation, without, for all that, deciding on a solution the real impact of which we do not really know yet."
"My second reservation concerns the social dimension."
"It is of the utmost importance that national authorities correctly apply the appropriate national and European legislation."
"It is a good thing to remind Member States of these obligations, which are laid down by the Treaty and by national legislation, but this sectoral regulation does not seem the most appropriate to deal with this matter."
"We must look more closely at this subject in order to grasp all the implications and to define the real needs that call for a response at Community level."
"Also, the proposal made by your rapporteur seems to me right, that is, to make reference to the obligations of Member States in a recital."
"Furthermore, I wish to answer, of course, those who asked me about the proposal."
"Yes, the Commission is carrying out a study on the effects of the internal aviation market on employment and working conditions."
"This study, which will be finished at the end of 2007, will give us food for thought and enable us to decide what practical measures to take."
"As Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned, the Commission is hesitating in relation to the obligations that are too specific for the distribution of traffic between airports."
"It is legitimate to require reasonable and effective connection times with city centres. Is it not, however, going too far if we insist on a fixed time, as well as an obligation for there to be links between airports?"
"I come to the problem of prices."
"The provisions on transparency of prices and full information for passengers are necessary, but they must be feasible and intelligible."
"Your rapporteur is right to wish to cover all flights leaving from an airport in the European Community."
"However, the extension of this obligation to only the Community companies in third countries gives rise to serious legal and commercial difficulties."
"I should like to respond to the question of costs linked with security."
"It is true that the Commission is in favour of the cost of security and the portion of the price resulting from it being known."
"Moreover, it also wants the various costs, charges, taxes and surcharges to be clearly shown."
"However, if it is true that this regulation seeks to ensure information for passengers, we cannot use it to lay down the use and characteristics of each charge or tax; provisions of this kind will have their place in the directive on airport charges under discussion in our institutions."
"Mrs Jeggle, with regard to advertising on the Internet, I agree with you, but Amendment 48 seems to us very complicated."
"It really needs to be clear and practical."
"I want also to respond to Mr Stockmann and Mr Kohliƒçek concerning the issue of wet leasing."
"It is necessary to allow relative flexibility to meet exceptional needs while laying down strict conditions for safety and frequency."
"I am in favour of a system that makes it possible to reconcile safety requirements with the need for recourse to wet leasing in exceptional circumstances and for a limited period."
"Finally, for reasons of fair competition with third countries, I consider it is justified to compensate for the removal of Article 23 on price leadership by the possibility of imposing restrictions, when a third country with which an agreement has been signed does not recognise the same duties."
"It is a principle of good sense which should help us in the negotiations with third countries."
"I thank Parliament also for having supported the Commission's approach concerning relations with third countries, which must be conducted in a coordinated fashion."
"There too, I shall still need the support of Parliament, Mr President, for the next stages."
"I do not pretend to have answered all the questions."
"I say again, quite simply, that Parliament's work has improved our text."
"Therefore, Mr Degutis, Mr Costa, it is really with much satisfaction that I thank Parliament for its work; the questions that you have raised are also very sound."
"I observed that, for some of them, it was not necessarily in this text that an answer needed to be provided."
"On the social level, I pointed out that we are in the process of working, and that by the end of the year, I would have a better idea for a possible proposal."
"Mr President, I felt it was necessary to provide rather detailed answers in order to close a debate of high quality."
"(FR) Commission position on Parliament's amendments:"
"Degutis report"
"The Commission can accept the following amendments: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 34, 37, 38, 39, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 and 56."
"The Commission can accept in principle the following amendments: 1, 8, 10, 12, 20, 23, 31, 32, 36, 44 and 49."
"The Commission can accept in part the following amendments: 33, 45 and 47."
"The Commission cannot accept the following amendments: 2, 15, 16, 17, 25, 35, 40, 41, 42, 46, 48, 50, 57, 58, 59, 60 and 61."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July 2007."
"Sustainable mobility (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Etelka Barsi-Pataky, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent"
"rapporteur. - (HU) Parliament welcomes the mid-term review of the fundamental document of Europe's transport policy, the White Paper."
"We are pleased that the Commission has prepared its report on the subject after broad coordination, and that it has done a thorough job."
"We also welcome the fact that it has made suggestions in several areas with regard to modifying the existing transport policy."
"Parliament recognises the achievements of the past five years, while at the same time we are critical on several matters."
"Parliament requests the Council and the Commission to consider our recommendations as the cornerstone of European transport policy."
"Now, what do these consist of?"
"First of all, the experience of past years shows that the use of regulation is the weak point of transport policy."
"As for implementation, it has been the case more than once that this came only after considerable delay, while sometimes it has been done incompletely or not at all."
"The Commission's report does not face up with sufficient thoroughness or honesty to this problem, and therefore it does not suggest appropriate solutions."
"Parliament emphasises the importance of cooperation among the European, national and regional levels, of strengthening this cooperation and of working together."
"Second, the majority in Parliament is of the opinion that we need to shape our transport policy more realistically than was done in the past."
"The review quite rightly observes that transport, as a service, plays a key role in the economy and in society, and that it is inseparable from the latter; our recommendation is therefore that we integrate it fully into the Lisbon Strategy."
"For the most part, we agree that existing capacities must be utilised more efficiently on their own or in integration, and that each and every mode of transport must be sustainable on its own; this applies particularly to logistics."
"In addition to co-modality in certain areas, the modal shift, in our view, plays an important role especially with regard to long-distance transport."
"Third, as far as the growth of the European economy is concerned, the inadequate financing of infrastructures poses a risk."
"Neither the Commission's report, nor the Council's position faces up adequately to this problem."
"European transport requires more Community financing, more financing by Member States, more courageous financial solutions and, above all, political support, in order to implement its key projects."
"We ask, and we expect, that the tasks of reviewing the seven-year budget for this area begin immediately."
"Fourth, we should talk about the changed circumstances and new challenges since 2001."
"Among these I would highlight first of all those tasks, which follow from the reunification of Europe in 2004 and 2007, which considerably increased the differences within Europe, as well as its diversity, which needs to be analysed much more thoroughly in European legislation."
"We have a common interest, moreover, in the interconnected, interoperable trans-European network."
"Thus it must be the joint responsibility of every level and every institution to make full use of those sources that ensure cohesion."
"Fifth, we need to face the fact that the impact of transport on climate change has increased and continues to increase."
"Although the spring session of the Council formulated worthy general objectives, their practical transposition is the task of the legislation that is before us, and that will be carried out in the coming period."
"Among these, for instance, is the Commission proposal, due in 2008, on the internalisation of external costs."
"Sixth, we must consider here and take account of the fact that traditional arrangements are gradually reaching the limits of their effectiveness, and therefore we must take advantage of the potential of intelligent transport systems."
"We need to create a legal, economic and technological environment that is suitable for the industry."
"We have launched some large, comprehensive Community projects, European projects that are promising."
"But the Union does not have any experience in these innovations, so we need to blaze a trail in this area."
"However, European responses to climate change are worthless if we cannot implement these on a global scale."
"Commissioner, it is our opinion that after this mid-term review, there needs to be a progressive renewal of Europe's transport policy in this direction and an adjustment to the new challenges, otherwise overcrowding, the pressures on the environment, and the problems of social sustainability will present serious obstacles to the growth of Europe's economy and well-being."
"I thank all those fellow Members who have lent their constructive support to the preparation of this report."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very happy to be here to take part in this debate on European transport policy."
"I wish to commend the quality of Mrs Barsi-Pataky's work which, by the conciseness of its messages, has given a strong political signal."
"You said just now, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, that any transport policy must be able to be constantly updated, for the very reason that it has to adapt, and you have underlined the importance of making this growth in transport sustainable."
"I am pleased by the soundness of your report and its relevance to the mid-term review of the White Paper."
"You received favourably the realistic approach of the Commission's communication; it is an approach that needs to be brought up to date, in compliance with the Lisbon objectives, and made part of the framework of the European strategy for sustainable development."
"These objectives relate to the four pillars of our approach: sustainable mobility, safe mobility, innovative mobility and the international dimension."
"You also supported the concept of co-modality and we must indeed, in order to make a success of the modal shift, reduce the negative impacts of all modes of transport precisely so as to ensure the environmental efficiency and performance of each mode of transport."
"The promotion of intelligent systems of transport and logistics, urban mobility policies, the development of intelligent charging systems are all ways of contributing to it without jeopardising the mobility necessary for growth."
"I shall mention now the items under this heading that are due shortly."
"The Green Paper on urban transport, the importance of which you have emphasised."
"The action plan on logistics that I intend to submit to you soon and which will include actions intended to remove administrative, operational and functional obstacles: to encourage training and exchange of best practice, to promote standardisation across the different modes."
"A communication on port policy is planned for the autumn, in which there will be, among other things, assessments of aspects of integration of port infrastructures in the logistics chain."
"The forthcoming appointment of a European coordinator for motorways of the sea and of another European coordinator for waterways, and we are going to consolidate the institutional framework of inland navigation with harmonisation of pilots' certificates and the setting up of a fund for innovation in this sector."
"Next, the communication on a rail network focussed on freight in Europe."
"Next, the levying of charges on infrastructures."
"As you wanted at the time of adopting the new Eurovignette directive, the Commission will present in 2008 a methodology for the internalisation of external costs."
"There, now, is a good agenda which corresponds, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, very much with your recommendations."
"I should like to add a few comments about certain passages in your report beginning with a reminder that the Commission carries out a rigorous policy of initiating proceedings for infringements, which is beginning to bear fruit."
"In another vein, I understand that the international negotiations are a sensitive subject for Parliament."
"Having said that, it is up to the Commission to negotiate international agreements, but it will keep the European Parliament regularly informed about the progress of the negotiations."
"I also take note of your request for a report concerning the directive on the interoperability of electronic road pricing systems and we shall present, as set out in the directive, a report for 2009."
"The Commission is in the process of assessing the impact of the European modular system."
"Despite the advantages and increased efficiency in some instances, this option remains controversial."
"Finally, the Commission fully supports the development of biofuels with the establishment of European standards for this type of fuel."
"It is a matter of making it easier to achieve the European Union's minimum target: 10% of biofuels out of the total fuel consumption by 2020."
"I am going now to listen with attention to your comments and once again I thank Parliament and the Commission for giving informed opinions on this mid-term review of the White Paper."
"draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. - (FI) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my thanks go to the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, for the work she has done."
"On behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I nevertheless have to say that I am sorry that the Committee on Transport and Tourism took only very little account of our committee's proposals."
"The traditional way of thinking is that the more transport there is the better it is for the economy and industry."
"The Committee on Industry, however, took the view that transport caused others to incur much more in costs which are not at present internalised in the price of transport."
"Transport is the sector where carbon dioxide emissions are growing the fastest."
"For example, emissions from road traffic have increased by more than 25% since 1990; the figure is more than 50% in the case of air traffic."
"This renders meaningless the reductions in emissions which have been achieved in industry and energy production."
"It is therefore time we started applying 'the polluter pays' principle in transport too, and internalised the costs of environmental damage in the prices of different transport modes."
"Fair competition between the different transport modes also makes this necessary."
"The Committee on Transport regrettably wanted to water down this principle so that the environmental charges on transport would be spent in the transport sector."
"Transport, however, also needs to take the issue of carbon dioxide emissions seriously."
"We have to set clear targets to reduce not just emissions from vehicles but all forms of transport."
"Part of this will entail less traffic generally, especially car and air traffic."
"Half of the car journeys taken every day in the European Union are less than five kilometres long."
"They are mainly in the cities."
"If just a third of these short car journeys were stopped and people walked, cycled or took buses instead, carbon dioxide emissions thorughout Europe would go down by several per cent."
"For example, emissions in Germany would fall by 4%."
"Moreover, air pollution would be reduced precisely where people mostly tend to live."
"According to the World Health Organisation, every year over 300 000 Europeans die before their time from air pollution, the main cause of which in cities is car traffic."
"Business would also benefit as a result of less illness caused by pollutants."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs Barsi-Pataky on this report and by thanking her for her hard work and willingness to compromise."
"She has managed, in a very short, but accurate and perceptive report, to give an overview of the key priorities for Europe's future transport policy."
"Experts - especially those who can read between the lines - will appreciate that."
"However, our citizens will lament the lack of detailed, tangible examples and practical proposals."
"The mid-term review on the European Commission's 2001 Transport White Paper shows that we have a lot of catching up to do."
"This is not only true for the security aspects, but also for other areas such as sustainability, investment (particularly in TENs) and logistics."
"Mrs Barsi-Pataky has indicated the right approach through her support for an intermodal transport network in which each carrier will develop their strengths so as to create goods transport services that are in the public interest."
"I was struck by the absence of any call for an appropriate Community framework for intermodal tourism, in other words for structuring the movements of European citizens."
"We also need intermodal approaches in public and private long-distance passenger transport in order to satisfy the constantly growing desire for mobility."
"I very much welcome the decision to link existing transport problems to the development of intelligent transport systems and innovative technical solutions."
"Policies should be bold enough to give priority to security-related legislation in the transport sector."
"This should include strict rules for HGVs up to 44 tonnes and transport infrastructure safety management."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (ES) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Mrs Barsi-Pataky most warmly on her ability to synthesise such a heated process and procedure as the revision of this Green Paper, despite all of the, shall we say, good intentions."
"It was only to be expected, however, that all of the Members would want to add some of the huge number of ideas inspired by the Commission's proposal."
"I would also like to congratulate her on her ability to reach valid compromises, which are going to attract broad support from the whole of Parliament."
"She has achieved a good balance between the unquestionable objectives, such as the modal shift in favour of modes that are still under-developed and which offer great environmental advantages, such as railways and inland waterways, while at the same time being able to interweave it with a new notion of co-modality that gave it a touch of realism that was more acceptable to all of the actors in the sector and which reduced many of the pressures that were preventing us from moving forward in a more reasonable manner."
"I would point out that one of the great problems with Community legislation - though not just Community legislation - is its deficient application."
"It is therefore crucial that we call for innovative instruments for that application."
"We also agree with her criticism of the insufficient funding of the trans-European networks and of the other transport measures at European level and we believe that it opens up future perspectives which may be very useful to us in the 2008 debate, in order finally to achieve funding that is a match for our ambitions for European transport."
"We are also grateful for your understanding in relation to integrating transport into the heart of the Lisbon Strategy."
"We believe that that will finally make the Member States act responsibly in both fields: that of legislative application and that of sufficient funding."
"The proposals in favour of logistics also seem to us to be hopeful signs, and we will try to follow them in the report that we are currently drawing up, as well as the innovative solutions and your total and ongoing support for intelligent transport systems."
"We also support your call for diversity and what that has meant since enlargement, which you understand better than anybody."
"We agree with your approach with regard to the global approach and relations with third countries, which we believe to be crucial to the future of the whole issue of European transport."
"We also welcome your support for the Green Paper on urban transport and, finally, we are grateful for your understanding over the need to update your report in relation to climate change, taking up the Council's latest proposal on reducing CO2 emissions."
"The only thing I must say, finally, is that we will not be able to join you in supporting the modular aspect that appears in paragraph 11 of your report, but I believe that, by means of the proposal with which Mr Grosch will perhaps provide us, we will be able to find a solution to that little problem between the two groups."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (IT) Mr President, Mr Barrot, ladies and gentlemen, what we are examining is an excellent report, which enables Parliament to understand, support and align itself with the work that the Commission must carry out in this last brief period of its activities."
"The Barsi-Pataky report covers all the problems with which we have dealt in recent years and thus can make a strategic contribution to our policy."
"I had the misfortune, if I may put it that way, to arrive just a moment before that clear change in priorities that has occurred over the last few weeks, with the possible inclusion within the Union's activities of the fight against climate change and direct responsibility for the issue of energy costs."
"I believe that this makes it necessary for us to review the whole text in the light of the new priorities, justifying or clarifying all the policies that we must implement to ensure that transport, too, makes its contribution to the attainment of these two objectives."
"This means working to use alternative fuels or the same fuels with more efficient engines, trying to organise more efficient journeys with the aid of logistics but also, and above all, adding principles and logic to our need to insist on the better use of more energy-efficient and climate-friendly transport, as well as organising our lives in such as way as to reduce unnecessary mobility demands."
"This merely underlines once again the historic strategies, which all in all are a credit to the European transport policy."
"Interoperability, access to the markets and the integration of networks are making a dominant reappearance on the stage, albeit with two qualifications: time and money."
"Time is becoming more urgent: everything needs to be accelerated and pushed to achieve swifter results if we wish to maintain the objectives of reducing CO2 and energy costs, as anticipated in the new objectives that the Union has set itself."
"The other problem is funding."
"The way in which the Union acts as intermediary regarding the Member States' investments needs to be reconsidered in the medium term: I am referring not only to the funding of infrastructure, which is certainly the largest amount, but also to interoperability and to other measures that are designed to facilitate market access."
"This funding not only needs to be obtained at European level, but also requires the Commission to have the possibility of coordinating the policies and funding of all the States, so as to ensure that the results we require are rapidly achieved."
"on behalf of Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, the report has a promising title: 'Keep Europe moving - sustainable mobility for our continent'."
"The clearest statement in Mrs Barsi-Pataky's report is in paragraph 14: 'the mid-term review of the Transport White Paper 2001 has not laid down long-term objectives nor given answers'."
"The EU's transport policy is riddled with inconsistencies."
"Many good principles are correctly identified, but often are not put into practice."
"The report makes it clear that the negative effects of climate change have increased, not least as a result of a bad transport policy."
"Many people still believe that growth is a constant: ever faster, ever higher, ever further."
"Growth may be sustainable, but is not a good thing."
"Incessant growth will not achieve the Kyoto targets, and the aim of halving CO2 emissions by 2050 will remain a pipe dream."
"Often we only treat the symptoms, not the cause of the evil."
"Satu Hassu from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has already cited various examples."
"We have been afraid to tell the whole truth about the costs."
"We want to build new, ridiculously expensive high-speed train tracks while the existing tracks, in Italy for example, are rusting away."
"Air traffic emissions are not included in the CO2 calculations, and transport is being promoted all over Europe."
"Let us look at a very real, topical event: today in Vienna, the transport ministers from Italy, Austria and Germany have again happily declared their commitment to the Brenner Base Tunnel."
"The economic viability of the Brenner Base Tunnel is very dubious in the light of our experience with the Channel Tunnel."
"The finance comes from Member States who are already contravening the Maastricht criteria, which puts it on a very shaky footing."
"Some of the approach sections have not even been planned."
"It really is a massive white elephant."
"There is talk of transferring goods traffic to rail, yet the plans are for a high-speed passenger line.p"
"The objectives of a socially acceptable and environmentally-friendly transport policy need to be: reducing unnecessary traffic flows, moving to more environmentally-friendly transport methods, being honest about the cost - which means transport prices must include all the costs of construction, maintenance, addressing environmental and health problems, and the cost of accidents - and sustainable taxation of transport based on CO2 emissions, including, most importantly, for air traffic."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Mr President, practice has proved to be more inflexible than theory."
"Halfway through the planning horizon of the White Paper on transport, it transpires that the objectives are not yet within reach."
"The Commission's decision to fine-tune the objectives is both courageous and sensible. I take my hat off to you."
"The change of course does, however, mean that we need to have different irons in the fire."
"It is no longer only the intention to shift cargo, but to improve every modality."
"This requires copious amounts of international decisiveness and tenacity in a number of cases."
"There is also plenty to do in Europe, including the introduction of adequate infrastructure, the use of new technology, specific action programmes for market sectors and the further introduction of the polluter, that is, the user pays principle."
"These elements have been included in the Barsi-Pataky report with very good reason."
"As such, I can identify with most of the content of her report."
"I have tabled amendments in respect of two points."
"This House lays down transport legislation, whereupon it is often up to the Member States to transpose this legislation."
"It has transpired that one and the same piece of legislation is interpreted and enforced in different ways in different Member States."
"This means, for example, that lorries driving across various Member States comply with this selfsame piece of legislation in one country and not in the next, with all the consequences that this entails."
"I regard this as unacceptable."
"This is why, in my Amendment 4, attention is drawn to this, and Member States and the Commission are urged, where necessary, to agree on a common interpretation of legal documents."
"This amendment does not provide for common penalties applicable to infringements."
"The second point concerns urban transport."
"Although I am well disposed towards it, I take the view that this should fall within the Member States' remit, and should remain so."
"The role of the European Union can therefore be nothing more than facilitating."
"By way of conclusion, I should like to thank Mrs Barsi-Pataky for her efforts and congratulate her on this result."
"(DE) Mr President, the Commission's mid-term review rightly highlights a number of common transport policy successes, notably the constant improvements in incorporating transport policy priorities in other policy areas: the internal market for one, and environmental policy for another."
"I would like to thank Vice-President Barrot for specifically referring to the study on internalising external costs."
"We are eagerly awaiting the findings and recommendations for further action."
"The mid-term review must also recognise that many actions that were identified as necessary have either failed or are threatened with failure because of the lack of funding and unwillingness to provide funding on the part of the Union - or more specifically, the Member States."
"This indicates that new impetus is called for at half-time."
"We need more money."
"We need better systems."
"We need more, better and new technologies, and above all, we need better logistics."
"There are also new issues to address."
"It is vital that we involve the new Member States and the candidate counties in the older existing system of trans-European networks so that we can all grow together."
"With all the different facets of security considerations, there is still a lot of work to be done."
"On the subject of urban transport policy, boldness and sensitivity must be our watchwords."
"A methodical approach is needed: it is not necessary to enshrine every feasible and conceivable idea in European law straight away."
"It may be better to opt for less binding legislation, and more stimulus in the form of best practice and respect for subsidiarity."
"Transport as a whole is set to keep increasing, not decrease."
"Some have a vision of the future in which transport growth and economic growth will be completely separate."
"We do not want to fall flat on our faces, though: growth is not appropriate for all areas."
"Amendment 6 from our Scandinavian fellow MEPs should not be seen or used as a back door for the so-called EuroCombi HGVs."
"What may be good practice in Scandinavia is not suitable in the rest of Europe."
"My thanks to the Commission. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report."
"(DA) Mr President, Commissioner, I wish to begin by thanking Mrs Barsi-Pataky, who has produced a skilfully worded report with some very clear messages."
"I also wish to thank the Commission and Commissioner Barrot for their evaluation of the White Paper, involving a lot of constructive new thinking about the EU's transport policy."
"The White Paper will be the framework for sound and wide-ranging transport decisions over the next few years."
"The evaluation may help bring about better decisions."
"The EU's Heads of State or Government have, of course, decided that efficient transport should be a part of the Lisbon Process, designed to make the EU into the most competitive knowledge-based economy before the year 2010, and that of course sounds all well and good."
"It shows that there is increasing understanding for the fact that efficient transport is crucial to economic development."
"At the same time, the Commission's commitment to co-modality and its focus on the interplay of different forms of transport testify to a more realistic understanding of what drives demand for transport, which is to say that people want the safest, most efficient, comfortable and inexpensive means of getting from A to B. We must develop each individual mode of transport in ways that are environmentally sound and we must do more to coordinate the different forms of transport so that proper consideration is given both to efficiency and to the environment."
"Such a policy requires investment, and one might well doubt somewhat whether the EU Heads of State or Government will honour their fine words about enhanced transport."
"We shall get some perspective on the matter shortly when we hear what the Trans-European Networks are to get."
"I am afraid that not enough money has been set aside for the Trans-European Networks for 2007 to 2013, and we must demand that the agenda for the mid-term review of the 2009 budgetary framework includes more money for transport investment."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Europe is stuck in traffic jams, and the situation is getting worse."
"Change is needed."
"Yet transport plays a vital role in our economy."
"If our transport policy is poor, the economy will suffer because it is dependent on the transport sector."
"So it is important that we create links between transport policy and other policies."
"We can and must make progress on a lot of important regulation, such as harmonisation, starting at European level, but we must remember that political measures can only be taken at Community level if they offer a clear added value."
"This means constantly evaluating the need for all EU transport policy regulations."
"Existing measures have to be reviewed regularly, so as to be able to nip any undesirable trends in the bud."
"Overregulation is detrimental to the transport market."
"In order to make real improvements to mobility and environmental protection, we need to establish substantial incentives for the relatively environmentally-friendly, but hitherto neglected rail and inland waterway sectors."
"We need to get the Member States on board in this area."
"There is still a wealth of unexploited potential, and that is a challenge for Europe."
"At the same time, there is no satisfactory answer to the question of whether the European Commission should intervene in urban transport."
"Are we responsible for this sector?"
"Does that not go against the principle of subsidiarity?"
"Can Europe dictate how our towns and cities manage their internal affairs?"
"The European Commission cannot be allowed to use the current hysterical climate change debate to extend its powers."
"If we want to make sustainable improvements to the transport situation and thereby to environmental quality in our cities, we need to get Europe's citizens behind us. Only through changes in the behaviour of our citizens as transport users will we achieve substantial and genuinely effective results."
"This will require targeted information campaigns, however, which would need to be initiated and supported at European level."
"To close, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Barsi-Pataky, for her excellent and thorough report on the subject and for always being open to discussion."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work."
"European transport faces major challenges: a uniform market and good connections and cross-border permeability, services in large cities, safety and quality of services and working conditions for transport workers."
"This involves above all good and systematic regulation of European and national legislation. It also involves proper organisation and logistics, a lot of investment in infrastructure, but above all it involves energy consumption."
"There is no such thing as transport without energy supplies."
"Using energy in transport creates harmful emissions."
"We must limit these emissions on environmental grounds using the requisite technology."
"The cost of fuel is high, and we must reduce fuel consumption by incorporating new technology into engines."
"But new pollution-cutting and fuel-saving technologies cost money, and we have to develop them further to bring down their price, as cheaper technology in transport is cheap transport, and cheap transport means a competitive economy."
"So here again, the main problem is new technologies."
"I would like to ask this House, during the mid-term budget review, to greatly increase expenditure on transport research and technology."
"We need to be innovative in transport technology, otherwise we will lose the race for competitive transport, a competitive economy and the Lisbon strategy."
"Vice-President of the Commission."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like first of all, quite simply but frankly, to say to Mrs Satu Hassi that I am surprised by her comments as we are totally committed to sustainable mobility."
"I am surprised, Mrs Hassi, that you should think that we are forgetting the 'polluter pays' principle."
"I think I made, with Mr Dimas, a brave commitment about sharing with aviation the allowances for greenhouse gas emissions."
"We observe a political line and I am very surprised by your comments which, if I may say, seem to me a little excessive."
"I am also going to take the opportunity of saying to Mr Kusstatscher that I find it difficult to understand him: it is quite clear that at a time when we are building infrastructures for high speed trains, we are freeing up conventional lines for freight."
"It is not just by chance that I stated just now that there would be a communication on railway lines dedicated to freight."
"Mrs Sommer, may I say to you also that I am not looking for competences."
"On the other hand, I take into account, on the one hand, the expectations of citizens and, on the other hand, the fact that, if you want rail to have its rightful place in Europe, it is necessary to ensure interoperability."
"If you want a sustainable development policy, there comes a moment when you can do it only by coordination and harmonisation on a European scale."
"I say this to you straight out, because you will understand that as a Commissioner, committed as I am, I am happy to accept a certain number of justified criticisms, but I feel obliged to answer back directly when the criticism becomes excessive."
"I come now to some comments that I wanted to make."
"The Commission has already begun removing obstacles to the running of trains: simplifying the certification of railway vehicles, railway interoperability and safety, the third rail package."
"I thank your Committee on Transport and Tourism for their work in this field towards reaching an agreement."
"In the aviation sector, we have two regulations concerning the interoperability of European traffic management systems."
"We adopted, in 2007, an 'airports' package that is focussed on the role of airports in the competitiveness of the internal aviation market and, as for infrastructures, we have a new trans-European network (TEN)."
"Mr Costa is right, however, when he says that we shall have to really redouble our efforts to coordinate financing because, as Mrs Ayala and others have emphasised, we find ourselves faced with a budget which is too limited to be able really to undertake the major works on infrastructure that will enable sustainable mobility."
"You are absolutely right and I thank Parliament for forcefully pointing it out."
"Mr Koch spoke about co-modality in tourism and he is right."
"Co-modality must also work in favour of passengers."
"As far as infrastructures are concerned, as I have just said, we are going to try to mobilise all possible resources and to develop public private partnerships with the involvement of the European Investment Bank."
"I shall say a brief word on the social aspects of transport."
"From April new social rules in relation to professional road transport came into force and we presented three proposals for regulations with a view to modernising admission to the occupation of road transport operator and access to the road transport market."
"With regard to passengers' rights, we have, thanks to Parliament, begun to introduce rights for passengers with reduced mobility in all modes of transport, particularly by coach and by sea."
"I will admit to you, knowing Parliament's sensitivity on this subject, that we must now actually put these rights into practice."
"As far as safety is concerned, I should like to emphasise again the priority of road safety in our action, as the first European Road Safety Day attests."
"We have also simplified the rules in relation to transport of dangerous goods and we have three air, sea and rail safety agencies, which are not idle."
"Safety will keep us busy in the autumn in the context of conciliation on common rules in the aviation sector."
"With regard to innovation, on which Mrs Barsi-Pataky was right to insist, it is really a major problem."
"Transport has to benefit from new technology."
"That will be the case with the Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) for air traffic. It is the case with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) to equip new railway lines and then, of course, it will be the case with energy saving and green propulsion to ensure the sustainability of road mobility."
"All that will be the subject of an action plan for energy efficiency and will be part of the European strategy for energy defined by the European Council."
"I shall not elaborate on the international dimension."
"It is obviously necessary to pursue this policy that has enabled us to sign an open sky agreement with the United States and with other countries."
"Henceforth, we are going to pursue all these efforts."
"Mr President, I shall leave it at that, because, of course, all of that deserves much more explanation."
"I thank Parliament and particularly Mrs Barsi-Pataky, because I think we are engaged in a transport policy that really takes into account future requirements, which looks not to the past but very much to the future, with this double objective: to enable mobility such as the Lisbon objectives require and, at the same time, to ensure that this mobility remains compatible with the demands of environmental protection and the fight against global warming."
"It is a very difficult battle."
"I thank Parliament very much for its support and, personally, I feel very committed to these efforts towards sustainable mobility."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday 11 July 2007."
"Recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on bilateral trade relations between the EU and China by Helmuth Markov, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6-0129/2007)."
"author. - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to be able to introduce this subject on behalf of the Committee on International Trade."
"I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner Mandelson and his services, who have dramatically improved the flow of information sent to our committee regarding the various bilateral and interregional trade negotiations."
"The committee hopes that this style of cooperation will continue for international negotiations on partnership and cooperation agreements in which, as in the case of China, trade is a significant factor."
"Our trade relations with the People's Republic of China are of great importance for both sides."
"Last year, China took over from the USA as the largest exporter to the European Union."
"At the same time, the European Union's trade deficit with China rose to EUR 128 billion."
"The Committee on International Trade has been monitoring China's growing importance in international trade for some time now."
"As early as 2005, our committee chose to produce an own-initiative report on the subject: the first report ever produced on an individual trading partner."
"A second report looked at the consequences of the expiry of the quota system for the Chinese textiles and clothing industry."
"We should congratulate the rapporteurs - Caroline Lucas and Tokia Sa√Øfi - for their foresight two years ago."
"In the European Union and developing countries, concerns about the textiles and clothing industry and the impact of opening the market to China have still not been allayed."
"This uncertainty has been increasing as the 2005 Memorandum of Understanding is now due to expire."
"We need a clear statement about China's market economy status in order to investigate allegations of dumping in this area."
"The Lucas report looked at the issue of Europe's strategy in terms of optimising the value creation chain and increasing production of high-tech goods."
"The belief that the European Union can continue to offer cannier solutions in the long term and set the pace for scientific and technical progress has to be called into question in view of the incredibly high numbers of well-qualified Chinese school leavers."
"We do, of course, recognise and welcome the reduction in poverty that China's meteoric rise has brought about in the past 20 years."
"At the same time, it is reasonable to expect China to comply with the WTO rules that it accepted when it became a member."
"This includes provisions on intellectual property and the principle of non-discrimination for imported goods."
"Nor can we afford to ignore the ecological and social consequences of China's growth."
"We should be prepared to support those who are addressing the problems on the ground."
"Commissioner Mandelson, I believe I read that last month at a trade union conference in the United Kingdom you said that in international and bilateral trade talks, we seek to set fair environmental and social standards."
"I only hope that this applies to our major trading partners, not just the small ones."
"So we expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement that you are currently negotiating with China to incorporate all these elements, and that the interests of all affected parties will be considered, instead of focussing solely on market access."
"Commissioner, perhaps you could tell us to what extent this message is being conveyed through the EU's stance in the negotiations on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with China, and also how China has responded to our position."
"Another, more general, question is that of the relationship between international and bilateral negotiations."
"The European Union's trade strategy sees national bilateral and interregional trade relations as complementing the multilateral efforts made within the WTO."
"The WTO negotiations seem to have stalled."
"Could you, Commissioner, explain what is the basis for conducting bilateral discussions, given that it is currently unclear what shape the global framework for future negotiations will take, and therefore what the agreements will need to look like."
"Lastly, I would like to ask you whether it is really necessary, before we reach an agreement in a multilateral framework, to negotiate individual WTO-plus agreements containing provisions that we know many developing countries are not happy with."
"Would this type of conduct not make concluding a multilateral agreement - which is the solution that our committee favours - even more complicated than it is at present?"
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, let me say straight away in response to Mr Markov that I am grateful to him for acknowledging the increased flow of information that comes from the Commission to his committee and the stronger cooperation that he has seen."
"As far as China is concerned, the EU side has as its objective in the prospective Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to lay the foundation for enhanced cooperation, including enforcement and, where possible, the upgrading of environmental - including climate change mitigation - social, labour and safety standards, so we are on the same wavelength on that."
"I welcome this opportunity to give this House some feedback on recent developments in bilateral trade relations with China."
"China has been a top priority since I took office."
"We have a lot to gain, but also some things to lose, depending on how we conduct this important relationship."
"I chose the European Parliament last October to present, together with Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, the Commission's China strategy paper - 'Closer Partners, Growing Responsibilities' - and, more specifically on trade and investment, the policy paper entitled 'Competition and Partnership'."
"I argued in that policy paper that Europe benefits from an open and balanced economic relationship with China based on fair reciprocity."
"That fundamental argument still holds good today."
"Our economies are complementary: China has strong competitive advantages in many areas; we have an enduring competitive advantage in high value-added services and goods, especially ones that require strong intellectual property right (IPR) protection."
"However, we have not yet achieved the balance in our relationship that will guarantee that it can be sustained to our mutual benefit."
"Europe's trade deficit with China is indeed growing."
"I accept that part of this deficit may be the natural result of market forces, but we also know that our export potential is being hampered by barriers in the Chinese market and that an important part of the current trade balance is consequently artificial."
"It is a product of politics, not economics; it can be addressed by politics."
"A recent study has even put a number on the cost of China's barriers to our trade at about EUR 20 billion annually in lost exports, that is 30% of our exports to China."
"China must take practical steps to address the problem."
"So what is the EU looking for?"
"Well, we want improved access to China's goods and services markets and, for EU investors, a sea change in protection of intellectual property rights and copyrights, especially by cleaning up the huge street markets that sell counterfeit products and by ensuring Chinese companies pay royalties due to EU companies when using their technology."
"We want an ambitious approach to negotiations to update the 1985 Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement between the EU and China."
"This has to be a genuinely high-standard agreement that addresses long-term concerns, and we want assurances that the drive for growth and the lack of domestic market signals in China will not lead to over-production and dumping, especially in key products like steel."
"The fundamental case for a positive trade relationship with China remains correct, but we are at something of a crossroads in our trade relations with China."
"A policy of dialogue to address the problems we have is credible only if it delivers more than the alternative means of trying to force change."
"The policy of dialogue and engagement can be challenged."
"It will be challenged if things do not improve between us and if people cannot see tangible, deliverable, practical improvements and benefits as a result of that policy of dialogue and engagement."
"So let me repeat: openness to China is in Europe's interests, but it is sustainable only if we can show that EU products and services are just as welcome in China as Chinese goods are in Europe."
"That is why China needs to reciprocate by strengthening its commitment to economic openness and market reform behind its own borders."
"I have made this case openly and frankly to the Chinese authorities, most recently with Commerce Minister Bo Xilai in our recent EU-China Joint Committee meeting in Brussels on 12 June."
"At that meeting, the Chinese leadership recognised for the first time that the current trend of the trade imbalance between China and the EU is simply not sustainable."
"I was able to agree with Bo Xilai to set up a high-level group that will explore ways to address this issue."
"I am looking forward to the initial report of this group at the next EU-China summit in November, and I expect it to identify some first tangible and practical steps to address this shared challenge, notably in ensuring higher Chinese imports from the EU."
"I agreed with Minister Bo Xilai on 12 specific points that address EU companies' concerns regarding their access to the Chinese market."
"One of these was the agreement on terms of reference for the upgrading of our 1985 trade pact."
"This was an important step forward, as I had withheld our commitment until I felt the terms of reference were right from our point of view."
"It is important to stress that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement of which our trade discussions are forming part will encompass the full scope of the EU-China bilateral relationship, including enhanced cooperation in political matters."
"The PCA will contain a standard clause on human rights."
"The clause will cover all issues related to democratic principles and fundamental human rights."
"As I have already said, one of our objectives in the PCA is to lay the foundation for enhanced cooperation on matters to do with environment, social, labour and safety standards."
"On the trade side, the agreement will cover important issues for both sides such as IPR, investment, non-tariff trade barriers, capital movements, sustainable trade, and natural resources and competition."
"These negotiations are an important tool to try to rebalance our trade relations and create opportunities for EU business operators."
"However, this is not a preferential agreement, and tariffs will, therefore, not be discussed."
"In parallel, the European Commission will continue to monitor closely China's implementation of its WTO accession obligations."
"This will remain a central priority for the Commission in the years to come."
"China's non-accession to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement leaves important Chinese markets closed, and China needs to honour its commitment to open negotiations on accession to this agreement in 2008."
"The Commission will also launch a comprehensive review of market openness in China and China's implementation of its WTO commitments later this year."
"IPR was another focus of my talks last month with Minister Bo Xilai."
"Cooperation and dialogue on IPR issues are not an end in themselves."
"They have to produce real change."
"Talk is not enough."
"That is why the Commission has made it clear to China that the cooperative approach we are presently favouring must produce tangible results."
"The next meeting of the EU-China IP working group should be held in the coming month."
"If significant progress is not made in the short-term on key issues for the EU, such as fake markets and payment of royalties, we will have to reconsider our approach with China in the IPR area."
"The Commission does not exclude using the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO."
"In addition, the Commission is working actively to stop Chinese exports of fakes from entering the Community, most notably through strengthened customs actions at EU borders."
"I believe this must become a higher priority for the EU as a whole."
"Europe can cope with tough competition, but it needs to be fair competition."
"This means that we have to ensure that we are acting on a level playing field, rejecting anti-competitive trading practices and standing ready to apply our trade defence instruments against dumping and illegal subsidies, as well as stepping up the fight against counterfeiting."
"I should also like to share with you key elements of our updated assessment of China's request for market economy status."
"This issue is important in the context of the EU's application of its trade defence instruments when faced with allegations of unfair dumping in Europe by Chinese exports."
"The updated assessment reflects the significant and welcome steps of China towards becoming a market economy."
"Progress was recorded across the board and brought China closer to fulfilling the four outstanding market economy status (MES) criteria."
"In particular, we think that the adoption of a number of important laws deserves recognition - the bankruptcy law, the new property rights law and the new accounting standards."
"However, the updated assessment also makes clear that still further progress is needed."
"None of the four outstanding criteria has been fully met."
"In particular, proper implementation of the new pieces of legislation will be crucial."
"It is not enough to pass new laws."
"They, as I believe China's state authorities understand, must also be used and respected."
"We will review the situation again in 12 months and continue technical talks in the meanwhile."
"I value the views of this House very highly and I am committed to providing early and clear information to you."
"Where possible and appropriate, this has been done in writing, for instance the MES assessment has been transmitted to the Committee on International Trade."
"On other occasions, it may be more appropriate to provide information orally because of its sensitivity."
"This is fully in line with Article 19 of the Framework Agreement."
"What matters is that I will continue to keep Parliament fully informed."
"To summarise my approach, I believe in a balanced partnership between the European Union and China based on fair reciprocity, a partnership whose core task is to open markets to fair trade for the benefit of Europe, China and the wider world."
"I believe the EU has been playing its part in delivering that partnership."
"It is right that we insist that China should play its full part as well."
"Mr President, Commissioner Mandelson is not only an inspired orator, he is also a tireless negotiator."
"Six years after the accession of China to the WTO, we are still waiting for a balance in bilateral trade between the European Union and China."
"China enjoys fully the benefits of the open markets, without itself complying fully with its obligations under multilateral rules and disciplines."
"The Chinese markets are still to a large extent closed and non-transparent."
"There are high import barriers, which result - according to estimates - in lost profits of EUR 20 billion a year to European businesses."
"Protection of intellectual property is inadequate."
"I need only mention that, in 2006, 80% of imitation goods seized on the borders of Europe were of Chinese origin."
"The Commission preferred to continue bilateral dialogue with China on intellectual property issues rather than coordinated action between the ŒïU and the USA, which activated the WTO dispute settlement mechanism against China."
"Dialogue would appear to be the way forward."
"However, we are awaiting concrete results from this specific dialogue."
"In any event, dialogue does not preclude the use of other legal means."
"In the textile and clothing sector, all means should be used to safeguard the smooth development of European flows when the Shanghai Agreement expires in 2008."
"As far as footwear of Chinese origin is concerned, the Commission is called on to monitor imports closely, in order to prevent the risk of China's circumventing the already inadequate trade defence measures adopted by the Union."
"China, as a trading policy power constitutes both a threat and an opportunity."
"What we need to fight against are China's competitive advantages that derive from prohibitive import barriers, from unfair competition and from economic, ecological and social dumping practices."
"The liberalisation of trade, which we enthusiastically support, should be based on reciprocity and accompanied by equivalent institutional counterbalances."
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (PT) Mr President, based on the fundamental premise that relations between the European Union and China are of vital strategic importance in political terms, we have to ensure that our trade relations are governed by two principles, which have been very well expressed by the Commissioner: on the one hand we must invest in cooperation and, on the other, we must always keep up a very demanding attitude in our relations with China."
"Our trade relations with China are extremely asymmetrical."
"It is not just our more direct interests that are at stake, but also our essential values in terms of environmental protection, respect for employment rights and guaranteed protection for certain fundamental social issues."
"In that context, we must establish a permanent debate on our cooperation efforts with this emerging great power, which is absolutely essential for keeping the international system in balance. That is why we cannot close ourselves off from China."
"Indeed, we cannot close ourselves off from a growing market that is opening up new opportunities for us, which, of course, we have to seize."
"Here, too, we have to be demanding about the opening-up of those markets and about respect for intellectual property rights, for example. At the same time, the European Union must adopt this highly demanding attitude in relation to fundamental issues concerning certain core principles of our model of economic, social and political organisation."
"That, in fact, forces us to adopt the balanced position that I have mentioned (and I believe that the European Commission has been making efforts to do so by adopting the trade protection instruments that are available to us whenever we find that there is a real danger of Chinese exports threatening certain European industries, particularly footwear, clothing and textiles) and to be extremely demanding in the relations that we have to maintain with China in this area."
"That, I believe, is the path we need to take, which must be based precisely on the fundamental idea that we cannot forgo having ever closer relations with China. At the same time, we have to try to promote some of our values."
"To conclude, I feel that we Europeans are in a very special position in the international context, in that our interests are to a great extent identified with our values."
"Protecting our interests depends on promoting many of our values and, if we do manage to promote them, we shall certainly be defending our interests."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I feel it is appropriate to begin by expressing Europe's support for the flood victims in China."
"Our fellow Member, Mr Markov, has raised an extremely important question, for which I would like to thank him on behalf of the Committee on International Trade."
"The EU and China are two of the oldest cultures in the world."
"On the one hand we have the largest trading bloc and on the other the fastest growing economy in humanity's history."
"So this is definitely an issue that needs to be addressed outside the WTO: an issue that requires a bilateral approach and a bilateral agreement."
"Both sides have a great deal at stake."
"We should not allow ourselves to be pressurised by the USA."
"So I would like to thank Commissioner Mandelson for refusing to adopt a common WTO strategy for dealing with China on the subject of pirate goods."
"Both sides - China and the EU - have both interests and instruments to protect against and to allow abuses of intellectual property rights: anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures."
"What matters is how we deal with one another - how we use those instruments."
"The Commissioner has said that reciprocity is vital, and I would agree."
"We Europeans benefit from the fact that China has adopted our continent-wide European patent laws wholesale."
"That is a good thing."
"But having the laws is not enough: the rights must be enforceable and they have to be enforced."
"It is also in China's own interest to do so, though - you know that the Chinese company Heier will soon have an interest in protecting its own patents."
"Which proves that China does need this strategy."
"What should we do in the meantime, though?"
"We are threatened with a very hostile scenario, whereby the Chinese apply for patents that are similar to ours, then close their market."
"They have already proved that it can be done."
"Thanks to the former President of the European Patent Office, Mr Pompidou, in around four years' time, China will actually have overtaken us in terms of the number of patents."
"I think we should link the patent issue to the EU's climate protection targets."
"That is right, with our climate protection targets!"
"Let me explain why: China is a win-win culture, a culture that strives to achieve harmony."
"So I think that if we have something to offer, we may succeed."
"China is currently experiencing massive environmental problems."
"Social stability is threatened; the government is under great pressure because of huge environmental problems."
"At both the IPPC Conference and the G8 summit, China indicated that it wants to work towards the climate protection targets."
"Yet in many areas China lacks the technology."
"So our offer could be that we will support a CO2-free coal-fired power plant with our technologies, as a gesture, but in return we can demand that our patent rights be respected."
"Commissioner, you are on the right track."
"Thank you very much for the information that you have provided today."
"on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at a time when the European Commission has begun talks with China with a view to a new partnership and cooperation agreement, Parliament's Committee on International Trade feels a duty to draw the attention of the Community executive to some well-known issues, which characterise relations with the Asian giant."
"China has a right to economic growth and development, which equates to well-being for its citizens, which also constitutes an opportunity for the world economy."
"This should not take place, however, at the expense of compliance with the rules of international trade, of what has been agreed within legitimate forums and of what China accepted when it entered the WTO, otherwise the consequences for its economic partners, starting with Europe, could be disastrous, as they could for Chinese citizens themselves."
"The talks with China are the most appropriate opportunity for tackling these issues bilaterally."
"We need to find a way to tackle the issue of insufficient protection of human rights and inadequate environmental, social and safety standards."
"Nobody is expecting China to achieve our levels, but to gradually achieve more acceptable standards."
"We need to act as 'exporting fathers' to improve access to the European Union market by means of the gradual removal of non-tariff barriers and, more generally, of administrative obstacles of various kinds that very often discourage businesses, especially small ones, from investing in China, and we need to take a firmer position on combating counterfeiting."
"The Chinese Government must do its part and show political will and take effective action to combat a phenomenon that concerns a large number of businesses, and especially consumers, worldwide."
"Above all, food-related counterfeiting, which has recently been an increasing problem, deserves the greatest attention because it affects the health of ignorant and defenceless citizens who trust in the appearance of labels."
"This battle against counterfeiting and forgery must involve both the European authorities and the Chinese Government."
"On these three aspects we expect the Commission, in the course of the talks that Parliament will follow with the utmost attention, to adopt a firm approach that will lead to clear and unequivocal results for our entrepreneurs, our consumers and also for Chinese citizens, because by 'well-being' we mean not only European well-being but also the well-being of Chinese citizens."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Commissioner, the status of market economy is not yet within China's reach."
"There are still too many irregularities in the bilateral trade relations for this."
"The frequent violations of intellectual property, for example, spring to mind."
"Commissioner, I have gleaned from your excellent intervention that following your meeting with Chinese Minister Bo Xilai on 12 June, the dialogue on intellectual property rights has been resumed."
"This news has brought me great joy."
"Moreover, I take the view - unlike my Liberal counterpart - that in matters such as these within a WTO context, the EU would do well to tag along with the United States straight away."
"After all, the United States remains our most important strategic ally."
"Commissioner, I should actually, above all, like to draw your attention to another important aspect of our trade relations with China, namely the European export of secondary raw materials, such as used paper."
"This is a huge issue at the moment."
"Last weekend, the Dutch prominent press dedicated a large article to this very subject."
"As you know, the new European rules for the export of these raw materials will enter into force in two days' time."
"It is through the Commission's fault that no agreements have as yet been concluded with important countries such as China and India."
"This means that, as from 12 July, used paper and other recyclable materials will become the most dangerous form of waste."
"You will appreciate that this has major implications for the export of these products."
"I would urge Commissioner Mandelson to promise this House a transitional provision that runs until 1 January 2008."
"During this time, you will be able to conclude agreements with those countries with which there is nothing in place as yet. With this, you will be able to prevent exports from grinding to a halt and these products from accruing in European ports, such as that of Rotterdam."
"I hope, Commissioner, that you will really take action, because this is a matter that comes across to the Dutch public as very negative in terms of Europe."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, we would agree that precisely because of the scale of EU's trade deficit with China, the European Union needs to be given much better market access opportunities, that the distortions created by Chinese State aids have to be reduced, and the Chinese Government needs to enforce WTO-standard intellectual property rights in the provinces as well."
"We also need to work together to convince China that we are not just presenting a list of demands, but rather that it is in China's interest to allow fair market access."
"We have to make China understand that if they want to lick their environment into shape, if they want to create an efficient energy supply - after all, China has plenty of money, there is no problem on that front - then we need to be given access to their public procurement market."
"Then we will be able to sell our products in China in a sensible trade in goods, and China will be able to purchase modern coal-fired power stations and sewage plants and suchlike and make use of our technologies."
"China does not need handouts, it has plenty of capital: it has the largest foreign currency reserves in the world."
"China is currently setting up a fund to invest its money worldwide."
"Our message to the Chinese Government should be: invest your money in your own country!"
"Do something for environmental protection and energy security, improve safety in the coalmines."
"If we are successful, we will also be able to improve trade relations in the long term."
"Of course, as you indicated, these agreements also contain a human rights clause because we have been discussing human rights with China for years; we must stand firm on that point."
"As a previous speaker said, no one expects China to respect all human rights overnight, but we do need to see significant progress."
"The People's Republic of China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights several years ago, but has not ratified it and does not apply it."
"So we need to turn around and say: you chose to sign it, you said you wanted to uphold human rights, now do it!"
"(ES) Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the information that you have given us and also for your work in favour of balanced relations that are beneficial to both parties."
"I agree that China must not be seen just as a threat to certain sectors, but also as a great opportunity."
"We also agree, however, that it must continue to make efforts to apply the agreements, to open up its markets and to create an open climate for investments."
"As you have pointed out, European industry is still complaining that there are an excessive number of barriers and obstacles that put it at a competitive disadvantage."
"In this regard, we are still talking about tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers, such as piracy, counterfeiting, discrimination between national and imported products and so on."
"We therefore believe that opening up negotiations on a new partnership and cooperation agreement with China is a good initiative that must enable the European Union to strengthen its bilateral trade policy on the basis of the principle of reciprocity, which you yourself have mentioned."
"We are delighted to agree that the issue of human rights should be one of the issues tackled within the negotiations on the agreement, of course."
"Specifically, we must point out that the Chinese Government is making progress in this area and the rights recognised by the International Labour Organisation should also be taken into account, since they are a crucial aspect of human rights."
"The agreement must also serve to continue promoting a commitment on the part of the Chinese authorities to effectively - not just theoretically - protect intellectual property rights through the adoption of relevant measures in the administrative, legal and border-control fields."
"I would like to refer to the 'memorandum of understanding' between the European Union and China on trade for the textile and clothing sector, which expires this year."
"There is concern in the textile industry about its expiry and about the fact that the conditions of the agreement between the United States and China are being extended until the end of 2008."
"In view of this disparity, therefore, I would also like to ask you what measures can be taken to prevent situations of tension such as those which took place in 2005."
"(PL) - Mr President, once again this forum is discussing trade relations with China, which has over the past decade emerged as a world economic and political power."
"In October last year, the European Commission approved a programme for EU-China relations, which entailed an increase in mutual undertakings."
"In this situation, it would be sensible to support changes for greater openness and pluralism in China, as well as cooperation on energy and climate change because we know that China is one of the world's major producers of greenhouse gases."
"On the other hand, we must not forget about the alarm that was caused when thousands of tubes of counterfeit toothpaste, some of them manufactured in China, were discovered in Spain, and containing doses of toxic diethylene glycol far in excess of European standards."
"China means cheaper goods in European shops and greater competition, but is it always healthy?"
"I am in favour of making the best of the opportunities offered by the dynamic development of relations with China, especially following my visit there, when I was able to see first hand this fast-developing world power."
"The Commission says that a strong Chinese economy is in the economic interests of Europe, and rightly so."
"However, we should not forget to look after the interests of the members of the Community above all, and to assess the opportunities but also the threats that cooperation with this Asian tiger poses through the prism of these interests."
"(SV) I am convinced that fear of China's economic growth really is exaggerated."
"I believe that those who have a sufficiently long historical perspective on trade policy recognise a good deal of the disquiet and a good many of the arguments from the debate about the incorporation into the world economy of Japan and of other Asiatic tigers (such as Korea and Taiwan)."
"Certainly, it is easy to allow oneself to be frightened by the relative size of the countries concerned."
"As the Commissioner pointed out, however, their economies supplement Europe's economy, and their size is, rather, a great opportunity for Europe."
"I am convinced that the strong and sustained growth and the boom being experienced in the world right now is due in large part to the fact that China, India and other large countries in the world are in the process of being incorporated into the world economy."
"That does not, however, mean that there are no problems in trade relations."
"I believe that we have many important problems to get to grips with, for example infringements of copyright and issues concerning intellectual property rights, as well as Chinese markets closed to everything from financial services to car parts."
"I am almost more concerned, however, about the protectionist tendencies to which China's growth is giving rise in Europe."
"Not that I believe the Commissioner to be in favour of such tendencies, but there are many voices that are now demanding more trade barriers in order to stop imports from China."
"Talk of stopping, for example, Chinese textile exports has been heard in this House in the course of this evening."
"I am convinced that the European trade barriers against China cost European consumers and European companies more money than do imports of Chinese goods."
"We should, therefore, continue to combat European trade barriers rather than Chinese exports."
"The fact is that China's growing prosperity, together with trade with China, not only give thousands or millions or, indeed, hundreds of millions of Chinese people richer and more dignified lives; they also make Europe richer."
"We must not forget that trade is never a zero sum game."
"We are both winners."
"(ES) Mr President, allow me to begin by saying something that is said so often at these night sittings, which is that we are discussing such an important issue amongst such a select band that I have the impression that we do not even have a representative from the Chinese Embassy present at this sitting."
"I am entirely confident that the verbatim reports of debates that Parliament's services produce so efficiently will enable them to read what we are saying."
"If I am to follow on from the previous speech, I must draw a conclusion: the globalisation that we are currently seeing would be unimaginable without the explosion of China."
"China's presence on the world market has simply been a decisive and unquestionable reality, but a very recent one let us not forget."
"The explosion of China, which has been direct and immense in the case of production, will be even more so in the case of consumption and also in distribution at world level, becoming one of the main determining factors of both elements."
"But neither must we forget that the quantity and characteristics of Chinese goods, largely defined by the profile of its workforce, its internal market, limited in income terms but incomparable in absolute quantity terms, and, more recently, its investment capacity, make China a great supply and demand power."
"However, as a wonderful article today by our fellow Member Mr Martin points out, China is a key factor in the success or failure of many international negotiations, including that of the recent G4 meeting."
"Can our approach to relations with China be simply to say that everything is a free-for-all, that is to say, all doors are open to what we send and what we may receive?"
"I believe not."
"We must do it in a regulated manner and, furthermore, we must demand clear reciprocity, the removal of barriers to access for European products, adequate protection of intellectual property rights and patents, full respect for the standards required in social terms - which I believe to be crucial - and equal respect for environmental and safety criteria for goods produced in China."
"And of course we must not forget human rights."
"We are not just talking about values in metaphysical terms."
"We are talking about rights applicable to people, to citizens like ourselves."
"We are talking about values that are quite simply beyond dispute and which cannot be treated in relative terms."
"Just today more people have been executed in China, and that is the most serious violation of human rights imaginable."
"Mr President, I should like to thank the Commissioner for a very clear and convincing message and I see that we share the same concerns."
"Ten months ago this Parliament decided that trade relations with China require reciprocal market access, which has to be founded on the WTO rules, fair competition and a reasonable balance of interests."
"The 'round' situation, sadly, does not match those expectations today."
"We are worried about the increasing trade deficit with China."
"We are worried about the fact that 70% of all counterfeit products on the European markets originate from China and that EU industries are suffering extensive damage as a result of unfair competition and social dumping."
"At the same time, many EU exporters are handicapped when trying to enter Chinese markets."
"Therefore, the EU representatives should insist first of all on providing legal security for foreign companies in China."
"I agree with the Commissioner that imbalance in the relationship is mainly a product of politics and not economics."
"The widespread use of slave labour, including children, is an extremely alarming problem that should be addressed at the highest possible level."
"The recent cases exposed are only the tip of an iceberg."
"China has now been a member of the WTO for six years but it has not implemented significant WTO commitments, including protection of intellectual property, national treatment and transparency."
"I still see leverage to create a fair and reciprocal balance of relations in linking firmly China's request for market economy status with Peking fully meeting its WTO commitments."
"Lastly, China is to be seen as a sobering example, bearing in mind Russia's impending WTO membership."
"As far as we would be hesitant about insisting on reciprocity and meeting commitments, it would be unrealistic to hope that EU support for Russia's membership will make Mr Putin's state behave according to the WTO rules."
"(HU) Two weeks ago, 20 Members of the European Parliament went to China, and their trip there confirmed that the picture is much more complex and nuanced than what we have available to us here."
"I agree fully with Mr Fjellner that the 21st century could be China's century, and that for the European Union this represents an enormous challenge and an enormous opportunity."
"There is very great asymmetry not only in trade, but also in the fact that the Chinese are much more familiar with the European Union than we in the European Union are with China."
"The picture is much more nuanced, be that in terms of human rights or on other questions."
"This is an enormous competitive disadvantage for us."
"The problem is not only that we do not know the Mandarin Chinese language, but that they know the English and European languages much better - this is an enormous asymmetry."
"We need to overcome this, for if we do not make changes to this situation, we will not progress in excellence."
"Member of the Commission."
"Mr President, bearing in mind your probable desire for this House to rise before midnight, I would just like to say that overwhelmingly the contributions to this debate have been very balanced and very realistic."
"I think that Mr Calabuig Rull and Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez, for example, made appropriate observations in stressing the fact that China is an opportunity for Europe, as well as a threat."
"Another appropriate observation was that of Mr Fjellner that we need to take the longer-term political view in our relations with China, but he also referred to the growth of protectionism, of a sort of Chinese nationalism which is becoming more prominent in China's trade practices."
"My view is that China's nationalism does not sit comfortably with the enormous benefits that it is deriving from the internationalist trading system that is based on reciprocity."
"Without reciprocity China will not be able to expect in the future the continued goodwill and balanced approach that it has been receiving from Europe."
"The fact is that China is falling below our expectations."
"It is not that it is failing to comply with or implement all its WTO obligations and commitments, because in many respects it is."
"But in certain other key areas of economic activity in China, in financial and other services, it is failing to implement fully the commitments that it made upon its accession to the WTO."
"One or two concerns have been expressed about textiles."
"This House will recall that in 2005 I negotiated a voluntary agreement with China that gave European industry an extra period of two-and-a-half years to restructure and to adapt to the new global situation in the textile sector."
"It was a once-and-for-all, bilaterally concluded agreement and the Commission therefore has no means simply to seek an extension of the agreed levels that have been operating beyond the beginning of 2008."
"However, I will be putting in place means to monitor and to keep under surveillance any sudden and large-scale changes in imports of Chinese textiles that threaten to disrupt our market in Europe, and I will consider what, if any, action I can take in the light of disturbances to our market."
"This is quite distinct from the use of trade defence instruments."
"The textiles agreement was based on fair trade."
"It was not unfair trade."
"It was just a disturbance that we were unable to take on on such a scale at this time."
"In other respects, the use of TDI is not against China's natural competitive advantage but against unfair competition, and we will retain the right and the full use of our trade defence instruments and employ them as and when necessary."
"In conclusion, others have referred to the need for China to consciously build up the standards it operates in relation to social, labour and environmental standards."
"That will always be a feature of the discussions that I undertake with Chinese officials."
"I am personally very committed to growing technology transfer with China on climate change projects."
"This is a key way to ensure Chinese interest in tackling climate change."
"It is a win-win situation."
"The EU can export energy-efficient, clean technology and China can make a contribution to tackling its environmental problems."
"This is at the heart of our dialogue with China on climate change and it is something in the trade realm that I intend to build up in the future."
"That concludes my remarks in response to this debate, which I greatly welcome."
"As I say, it has been very balanced, and I will certainly ensure that I and my services take into account fully the remarks and observations that have been made by Members of this House this evening."
"Mr President, I asked the Commissioner a very clear question: at the moment there is unrest in my country, a big news report on a mission of the Commission agreeing to the export of so-called secondary resources such as old paper, recycling material, etc."
"What are you going to do, Commissioner?"
"I ask you to conclude agreements with countries such as China and India and pause until 1 January 2008, because otherwise there is a standstill in exports in harbours like Rotterdam."
"I asked you what you were going to do."
"I did not get an answer."
"I hope you forgot it."
"Member of the Commission."
"I think in the circumstances and in view of the time, it might be better if I gave the Member a written response to his question."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the last serious and very recent case of widely-consumed counterfeited goods - a toothpaste containing antifreeze, sold on the European market and produced in China - brings back into the limelight the problem of combating 'multinational forgery'."
"It is in this large Asian country, where de facto slavery is permitted for workers deprived of any sort of protection, that most of the products of the counterfeiting industry are concentrated - medicines, cosmetics and food products, as well as toys and items of clothing containing carcinogenic chemical substances that are strictly prohibited in the European Union."
"Unfortunately, this is a phenomenon that, while until a few years ago was restricted to high-end products (luxury lotions, perfumes, watches and bags), is now expanding to include products within the reach of an ever-growing number of users, leading to a high risk for consumer health."
"Today, more than ever, it is necessary for the political and industrial West to adopt a strong position towards powerful, wealthy China."
"On the one hand, we need to step up coordination between the Member States in inspections of imported products and, on the other hand, we need to persuade the Chinese Government to apply wide-scale, very strict on-the-ground, checks in order to protect European industry from unfair competition resulting partly from counterfeiting and piracy."
"in writing. - (FR) China represents a major political and commercial challenge."
"It is in fact essential to rethink economic and commercial relations between the EU and China, based on respect for the rules of fair and honest competition as well as on the application of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules."
"China must commit itself in practice to global responsibility and in favour of the establishment of commercial relationships based on reciprocity."
"Our European markets are open to those who open theirs, but they are closed to those who close them."
"We must not resign ourselves to unfair competition and monetary, social and ecological dumping practices."
"On the question of environmental standards, the EU must, in the framework of the new agreement, denounce the importing of products into the Community market that do not respect the environmental and phytosanitary rules (which the EU itself imposes on Community producers)."
"China is a major stakeholder and must cooperate on the matter of climate change and energy in order to strengthen international environmental governance."
"The achievement of parallel progress on the political and commercial fronts is, one can understand, a more than decisive factor for an EU - China agreement."

"Presentation of the programme of the Portuguese presidency (debate)"
"I am delighted to welcome the President-in-Office of the Council, the Portuguese Prime Minister, Jos√© S√≥crates, to the European Parliament."
"(Applause)"
"As always, it is also a pleasure to have the President of the Commission, Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso, with us."
"(Applause)"
"As you can tell from the names, this is a very special line-up."
"Portugal is at the centre of the European Union."
"It is a great pleasure to invite the President-in-Office of the European Council, Prime Minister Jos√© S√≥crates, to take the floor."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(PT) Mr President - my dear Mr Poettering, my dear Mr Barroso, honourable Members, at the start of the half-year of the Portuguese Presidency, in the presence of the legitimate representatives of the citizens of Europe, I would like to reaffirm the main guiding principle of this Presidency: the construction of a stronger Europe for a better world."
"To this end, we make a clear commitment: we will do everything possible to transcend the period of doubts and uncertainties as to the course the European project should follow."
"We should like to ask all Members here, in the seat of European democracy, to support us in that common objective."
"It is well known that Portugal was not a founder Member State of the European Communities."
"However, when we restored democracy in our country, in 1974, after 48 years under an authoritarian regime, our principal objective was to join the European Communities, as they were known at the time."
"We achieved that objective in 1986."
"On assuming the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of the Union for the third time, I would like to reassure you of the Portuguese Government's determination and its commitment towards promoting and strengthening the values of peace, freedom, solidarity and prosperity that inspired the founder Members in 1957; those values which we, now 27 Member States and almost 500 million citizens, reaffirmed last March in Berlin."
"I am confident, honourable Members, that this half-year will see us emerge from the deadlocks and obstructions that have been holding up the European project for too long."
"The example of the European project is motivating many peoples and countries in various parts of the world, who are the first to ask the European Union to play a more active role in world affairs, and they have difficulty in understanding our hesitations."
"I have always considered, and continue to consider, the European project as one of the noblest and most vital political projects of our times."
"The construction of Europe is important for the European economy, for the promotion of European values and for European citizens."
"Yet the construction of Europe is an equally important factor in meeting global challenges, taking advantage of the opportunities of these times of change and building a fairer, more stable and more developed world."
"It is not only the people of Europe who need a strong Europe; the world also needs a Europe with a proactive voice."
"Mr President, honourable Members, I think you will agree with me that the success of a Presidency always depends on the clarity of its programme."
"Our priorities for the next six months are clearly defined: the reform of the Treaties, an agenda for modernising Europe's economies and societies and the strengthening of the role of Europe in the world."
"The biggest challenge, of course, lies in pursuing the process of reforming the Treaties, on the basis of the mandate adopted at the last European Council."
"I have pleasure in commending to you the merits of the strategy and negotiations conducted by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, whom we have consistently supported throughout the last six months."
"I would also like to acknowledge with gratitude the clear positions adopted by Parliament in the Resolution it adopted on the basis of the Bar√≥n Crespo-Brok report, which led to an agreement which was reached between the Member States that preserved the core objectives of the Constitutional Treaty and which incorporated the signals given by the French and Dutch referendums."
"The progress that was made at the last Europe Council was only possible as a result of the impetus it was given by the European Parliament, which has always maintained a strong, consistent and constructive position in that respect, and never resigned itself to the deadlock at the time."
"The agreement reached at the 21 and 22 June European Council took the form of a clear and precise mandate, as Portugal has always considered necessary. We are now in a position to move forward."
"I would like to make it clear to Parliament that there is one point on which I have no doubts. The decisive moment was in October 2006 when the Heads of State or Government of the three countries that made up the trio of Presidencies - Germany, Portugal and Slovenia - agreed to prioritise the resolution of the institutional impasse in their programme."
"At that time, in October 2006, there were few who believed that such an objective was possible. The fact is that that objective is now within our reach."
"We therefore approach that task with confidence and should now complete it by transforming the mandate into a new Treaty."
"I know we are facing a difficult and demanding process of negotiation and reaching agreement."
"I am naturally prepared for the problems that always arise, especially in the final stages of negotiating processes. I know, however, that we can do it."
"One thing is clear to me: our mandate is not to change the mandate."
"The mandate, furthermore, is clear."
"It is clear as to which parts of the previous Constitutional Treaty must be abandoned, as to what should be retained in the Reforming Treaty and as to what innovative new aspects should be added to the Treaty of Nice."
"The best thing we can do, honourable Members, is to take advantage of the political momentum. We have to move quickly."
"This is why I decided to open the Intergovernmental Conference on 23 July, separately from the General Affairs and External Relations Council."
"On the same day, we will be distributing a draft Treaty drawn up on the basis of the detailed instructions in the mandate."
"In the course of the same week we shall be holding meetings with legal experts to examine the text and identify any potential difficulties."
"The informal meeting of Foreign Ministers on 7 and 8 September will be used to take stock of how this is progressing."
"We intend to play an active role in ensuring that agreement on the Treaty can be reached during the informal European Council in Lisbon on 18 and 19 October."
"That is our objective and I think you will agree with me that this timetable is closest to the spirit and desire of all the European institutions and also the one that will best serve the interests of the Union."
"I am relying on the European Parliament to achieve that objective."
"That, furthermore, is why I have argued that Parliament should have three representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference, and not two as on previous occasions, thus ensuring greater representation for this House."
"For the same reason, moreover, I am also going to propose that, whenever the Intergovernmental Conference is attended by Heads of State or Government, Parliament be represented by its President."
"I know I can rely on all the institutions to contribute."
"I am grateful to the European Commission and the Central European Bank for issuing their opinions promptly."
"I am grateful to Parliament for its efforts in ensuring that its opinion could also be adopted today, thus fulfilling the necessary conditions to enable the Intergovernmental Conference to begin this month as well."
"I know I can rely on the willingness and commitment of all the Member States."
"This is a moment of convergence when all the institutions come together so that a prompt decision on the Treaty can provide a clear sign of Europe's confidence and determination to make progress in its project."
"Madam President, honourable Members, the reform of the Treaties is still only one of the tasks facing the Union in the next six months and I should like, if I may, to take a few minutes to talk to you about some other extremely important issues within the Union."
"Apart from institutional matters, the citizens of Europe are demanding answers to questions that directly relate to their everyday lives, in which they recognise that Europe must produce practical results that make a difference and help improve their living conditions."
"I believe no one is in any doubt that Europe must invest further in modernisation."
"Just over seven years ago, Ant√≥nio Guterres, then Prime Minister of Portugal, came to this House to present the Lisbon Strategy. Up to now, that Strategy has been the road map for the modernisation of the European economy and society."
"I therefore have particular pleasure in telling you that the 'Lisbon Strategy' will once again be at the heart of our plans."
"The strategy defined in 2000 with a view to strengthening competitiveness and social cohesion, by investing in knowledge and innovation, is still the right way forward and still has the support of the main European political forces."
"What we shall be doing is actively to contribute to a new round of the Lisbon agenda, which will be adopted in the spring of 2008 during the Slovenian Presidency."
"We shall prepare for that new round by maintaining the balance between the three components of that agenda, namely the economic, social and environmental components."
"The review of the internal market will enable us to place the accent on the business competitiveness, on opening up the markets, on eliminating context costs, and on the role the cultural industries can pay in terms of job creation, economic growth and innovation."
"The next half-year will also be particularly relevant as regards political, energy and environmental options, and, on those matters, Europe can have only one objective: to continue to take the lead in environmental issues and, in particular, in the fight against climate change."
"We shall therefore meet the objectives of promoting the debate on a technological plan of action for energy and the environment, and will emphasise the role of biofuels, particularly in the context of the report that emerged from the first summit meeting between the European Union and Brazil."
"We wish to give the social dimension of the 'Lisbon Strategy' the visibility and relevance it deserves."
"Ten years after the launch of the 'European Employment Strategy', it seems essential to us to encourage a debate on the best ways of coordinating employment policies, with a view to boosting the creation of sustainable jobs in a context of global competition."
"This line of action pursued by the Portuguese Presidency will be closely linked with the training of human resources, the reconciliation of work and family life and the fight against poverty and exclusion."
"The European social model, with its well-known diversity, requires us to reflect together on the sustainability of pension and retirement systems, and also to identify the reforms that are necessary in the labour markets and systems of protection against social risks."
"In that context, the aim of our debate on so-called 'flexicurity' should be to find integrated and balanced solutions, which should be reflected in general shared principles at European level that take account of the diverse social conditions in the various Member States."
"Honourable Members, for the Portuguese Presidency, one of the basic core values of the European project lies in the interface between freedom and security. In that context, one of the Presidency's priorities will be to strengthen police and judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and crime."
"Terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to international peace and security. Democracies are not afraid of terrorism and know how to stand firm in the face of that threat."
"If there is a good example of that firmness it was provided last week by the British Government, to which I should like to pass on a message of solidarity from all the countries in the Union."
"The fight against terrorism must therefore remain a common objective for all the Member States, because only European cooperation will make it possible to prevent, protect ourselves against and combat terrorism."
"The Portuguese Presidency will work to implement ongoing initiatives under the EU strategy against terrorism, the action plan to combat terrorism and the continued implementation of the strategy to prevent the radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists, which will be reviewed during the next six months."
"We therefore consider it urgent to find a replacement for Mr De Vries and define the resources and the mandate that will enable his replacement to perform his or her duties effectively."
"Honourable Members, history has taught us that there is no freedom without security."
"This is why the Union's security policy is also essential in order to preserve the open and tolerant nature of European societies."
"It is therefore a source of pride for me to say that it was Portugal that suggested, and it was also a Portuguese company that designed SIS-ONE4ALL, the technological solution whereby the new Member States could become full members of the Schengen area and whereby borders with those countries are to disappear at the end of the Portuguese Presidency."
"We shall thus fulfil one of the greatest wishes of those citizens: freedom of movement of persons in Union territory."
"Honourable Members, I should also like to say a few words about immigration policy. We shall give special attention to this issue during our Presidency."
"Europe today is an area that welcomes millions of immigrants who live, work and bring up their children here, and whose contribution is essential to European economic growth."
"We must therefore draw up a European immigration policy based on prevention of illegal immigration, but also one of including and integrating legal immigrants and of effective cooperation with their countries of origin, one that can regulate migratory flows to our mutual benefit."
"Only a policy effective in both the country of origin and the country of destination, one that addresses both the causes and the effects, will be capable of dealing with the scale of the phenomenon in a manner compatible with our values and responsibilities."
"Mr President, honourable Members, the current international situation is creating special responsibilities for the European Union and I should now like to speak to you about the European Union foreign policy agenda under the Portuguese Presidency."
"The citizens of Europe are unequivocal in their demand for us to take an active role on the international stage, based on the values of international law, mutual respect, dialogue and cooperation."
"Similarly the international community expects the Union to play a committed and consistent role in major international affairs."
"In the second half of 2007, there are decisions on delicate world issues that cannot be put off - the future of Kosovo, the nuclear dossier on Iran, the humanitarian crisis in Darfur. There is to be a series of especially important bilateral summits, with India, China, Russia and Ukraine."
"Relations with the United States, in the context defined by the Washington Summit, which took place under the German Presidency, will be monitored as closely as one would expect of such strategically important relations."
"In all cases, we will be equal to our responsibilities as holders of the Presidency, and will work closely with Javier Solana, High Representative for External Policy, and the European Commission."
"I should like to draw your attention to three initiatives with which we are closely linked and which deserve special emphasis: the EU-Brazil Summit, which has already taken place, the EU-Africa Summit and Euro-Med meetings."
"In this first week of the Presidency, we have already held the Summit with Brazil with the aim of moving relations to a higher level of mutual understanding and close cooperation, at all levels."
"This initiative is particularly dear to the Portuguese, as we share our language and much of our culture and history with Brazil."
"We are seeking to create the political conditions whereby, as is happening with other emerging economic powers, a formal relationship of mutual benefit to Europe and Brazil may be created, which will in turn help us achieve the kind of relations we should like to enjoy with Latin America as a whole."
"Closer ties with Brazil will also bring practical results in terms of our response to global challenges."
"Last week's summit with President Lula has also made it possible to keep open a window of opportunity, which we must now make the most of in the Doha Round negotiations, and we shall do everything possible to support the European Commission in that context."
"I am among those who take the view that the Doha Round negotiations represent an important factor in regulating globalisation and that the conclusion of the negotiations will be highly positive. This should continue to be a priority for the European institutions."
"The EUROMED ministerial meetings form part of a series of negotiations, including what are known as the Barcelona Process and the New Neighbourhood Policy. These meetings serve to highlight the importance we attach to reviving the crucial political debate with our partners to the south of the Mediterranean."
"We share common concerns and are facing challenges relating to development and social cohesion that emphasise the growing interdependence of the two sides of the Mediterranean, and we are convinced that we can help overcome certain obstacles in essential areas such as the management of migratory flows and the potential contribution of diasporas to their countries of origin, with the support and commitment of the European countries and the relevant international institutions."
"Finally, we propose to hold a second EU-Africa Summit, having been behind the previous Summit in Cairo in 2000, which, as you will recall, took place under a Portuguese Presidency."
"Without overlooking certain difficulties that will have to be overcome, we are convinced that there is no justification for the fact that no meeting of this kind has been held at the highest level for more than seven years, when it comes to two continents with such close historical ties and that are so interdependent in today's world."
"Portugal is in a particularly good position to take on this responsibility and is very much counting on the African Union and all European and African countries to ensure that this Summit offers a chance to revive dialogue and cooperation on matters of the greatest common interest."
"We shall therefore take on the task of defining a new strategic partnership between the European Union and Africa aimed at sustainable development, ensuring peace, fighting endemic diseases and maintaining a balanced partnership in the management of migratory flows, to our mutual benefit."
"Mr President, honourable Members, this is our agenda, which I have briefly described to you."
"I am aware that we are holding the Presidency at a time when the international situation is extremely delicate and that we have been ambitious in the definition of our own objectives."
"We know that Presidencies on their own do not resolve all the problems that arise, but we also know that we can make a difference if we adopt clear objectives, if we are humble in the way we pursue them and if we demonstrate the will to reach the necessary consensus."
"Many European philosophers define today's world with the prefix 'post' - post-democratic, post-modern or post-industrial - it is for them a 'post' world."
"All that this concept really means is that we are living in a world of change, accelerated change, and we do not yet fully understand what we see happening."
"Amidst all these uncertainties and unknown factors, however, we believe one thing is certain: in a changing world the worst mistake is to stand still."
"That is a mistake that Europe must not make."
"Honourable Members, our firm proposal is to ensure that Europe does not stand still and to advance the European project in the cause of creating a better world."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President-in-Office of the Council, thank you for the presentation of your programme."
"The applause shows how well it has been received here in the European Parliament."
"Above all, we would like to thank you for making it clear that the European Parliament will be represented at all levels of the Intergovernmental Conference."
"You personally have always supported that approach, which guarantees that the European Parliament will be able to give its approval to convening an Intergovernmental Conference."
"We in the European Parliament also have great expectations for our work with the Council General Secretariat."
"I would now like to invite the President of the Commission, Jos√© Manuel Dur√£o Barroso, to address the House."
"President of the Commission."
"(PT) Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, I should like first of all to extend a very special greeting to the Prime Minister of Portugal at the start of the Portuguese Presidency."
"The programme outlined for the Portuguese Presidency is ambitious and demanding, and the Intergovernmental Conference will naturally occupy a prominent place, particularly until the European Council meeting in October, but the Portuguese Presidency involves more than the very important issue of the Treaty."
"Other tough assignments include foreign relations, with important summit meetings being held with many of our partners, the relaunched Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Employment, and innovation."
"Yesterday the Commission adopted its opinion for the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC)."
"As I have already stated in this House, the IGC about to begin will be of a very different kind from its predecessors."
"Thanks to the work that has already been done, to the efforts, in particular of the German Presidency, which I would also like to commend, and to the fact that we have been able to make such clear progress, we can say that the degree of detail in this mandate is unprecedented."
"Never has an IGC begun with such a precise mandate."
"In certain areas, in fact, that mandate adopts the wording of the 2004 IGC, while in others it uses highly-developed legal and technical language."
"As a result of that degree of precision, we can now say that the central question is no longer about its political substance, since that was essentially resolved when we met in the European Council, but rather about keeping faithfully to the content of the mandate."
"We therefore need to be clear on this."
"I want to make the position of the Commission clear: we fully support the mandate and consider that the issue does not need to be discussed again."
"The crux of the matter, as Mr S√≥crates has told us, is to transform the mandate into a Treaty."
"It is not to create a new mandate."
"That would be very much a backward step, and in my view, it would be inconceivable for us to go back on what has unanimously been agreed."
"It would be a sign of a serious lack of confidence if we were now to try to renegotiate a mandate to which everyone has agreed."
"It is impossible to build a strong Europe without confidence in the value of the commitments we have made."
"It is also true that, from the Commission's point of view, the mandate is neither ideal nor perfect. On many points we would have been more ambitious."
"Nobody finds the mandate absolutely ideal, and that is how the European project works and has always worked."
"Since 1957, our integration project has always moved forward by means of political compromise and not with ideal solutions. That is once again how it will be."
"Nor should we forget that the agreement we reached at the European Council was hard won, based as it was on a delicate political compromise."
"Our responsibility is to maintain that compromise at the IGC, all the way to final ratification."
"The Commission fully supports the Portuguese Presidency's intention to hold a short, condensed IGC."
"It will begin on 23 July and, if all goes well, and we shall do everything in our power to ensure that it does, it may be concluded at the informal European Council in October."
"The Commission does, however, reserve the right to express its opinion on positions and proposals of governments of Member States during the IGC and, in particular, we shall be vigilant to ensure that the mandate is duly fulfilled."
"We think it is our duty to do so."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, as we have already mentioned, the Portuguese Presidency goes beyond this vital matter of the Treaty and I am pleased to note that the Prime Minister and President of the Council intends to give particular attention to the Lisbon Strategy."
"The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment, which we collectively relaunched in 2005, is now producing some quite encouraging results."
"Unemployment in the European Union has fallen from 10% in the mid-nineties to 7% last June."
"Our analyses prove that structural unemployment is also falling, which is fairly encouraging for Europe in the medium and long term. Our data also show that there has been a 50% increase in women's employment."
"These figures are most welcome in a Europe we want to make more competitive, fairer and more inclusive."
"Economic growth has also reached its highest levels since 2000, in a context of the higher potential and growth of the European economy, which leads us to believe that the recent growth is structural and not merely cyclical."
"It is fair to say that this progress is largely due to the reforms inspired by the relaunched Lisbon Agenda for Growth and Employment."
"The fact is that, by giving the various governments of the Member States a common reform framework, Europe is facilitating, supporting and strengthening precisely that movement to reform which, admittedly at varying speeds and with different scopes, all European governments have been implementing in one way or another."
"It is therefore appropriate to emphasise here that the much-maligned Lisbon Strategy is a crucial factor in the economic and social modernisation of Europe."
"The fact is, however, that there is no room for complacency. There is still a lot to do to make the European economy more competitive and European society fairer."
"In particular, we must increase the contribution of innovation to economic growth."
"I know this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency and this is something I applaud."
"Innovation is the driving force behind the triumvirate of the Energy Technology Plan, the European Technology Institute and the first Innovation and Technology Community, which we intend to see specifically targeted at energy issues and the fight against climate change, and which we hope will be launched during the Portuguese Presidency."
"This is the clearest example that the relaunched Lisbon Strategy is seeking to connect the different aspects, such as this key central aspect of the fight against climate change and energy security."
"To achieve success in that area, we must do more in the field of innovation and that is why I am pleased to note that the Portuguese Presidency intends to include innovation as an essential topic at the December European Council."
"Education, scientific research and innovation are essential elements of the European society we want to build in response to the most pressing concerns and challenges posed by this new century."
"To achieve the objectives we have set in the context of European energy and climate policy, we have prepared an ambitious and consistent strategy to ensure sustainability, security of supply and European competitiveness."
"It should be emphasised, however, that for the success of that strategy we must warmly applaud the conclusions of the March European Council, which mark a turning point in the history of energy and the fight against climate change."
"In order to achieve results now we must step up our efforts in the areas of scientific research, technological development and innovation."
"The technological plan in the area of clean energy technologies is a cornerstone of that strategy."
"The creation of the European Institute of Technology, which is now so well received in the European Parliament, also constitutes an essential means of increasing European competitiveness by mobilising efforts on a European scale and better liaison between knowledge and innovation."
"Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, as the Commission states in the opinion we adopted yesterday, the reforming Treaty will reinforce the capacity for action of the Union in external relations, which is highly symbolic: two of the central pillars of the Portuguese Presidency are institutional reform and the Union's external relations."
"The active cooperation between the Presidency and the Commission in this latter field is obvious."
"Last week, Mr S√≥crates and I myself went to the final session of the African Union Summit in Accra, and on the following day we attended the first EU-Brazil Summit."
"With Brazil, our latest strategic partner, we share an ambitious agenda that includes energy, mainly biofuels, which we want to be sustainable, the fight against climate change, and trade relations."
"In the case of international trade, we have made a very strong appeal to President Lula to reach an agreement at the Doha negotiations. The Commission emphasises the commercial importance of Doha because trade drives economic growth and development."
"Trade has lifted millions out of poverty in Asia and it can go on doing so, not only in the Asian countries, but also in South America and Africa."
"International trade must, however, be based on multilateral rules and institutions and the European Union has a vital role to play in the consolidation of international rules and governance. Doha is therefore an essential issue."
"It has to do not only with trade, although trade is important in itself; it has to do with our multilateral vision."
"We cannot actively support multilateralism and then defend unilateralism when it comes to trade."
"We also need to make progress on this matter because it is not only an agenda for trade, it is an agenda for social development, an agenda that can strengthen our links with developing countries."
"In the case of Africa, the strategic partnership between Europe and Africa is also essential for international stability."
"The EU is the main source of financial, economic and technical aid for Africa."
"Europe is the major trading partner of the African continent, importing more than all the other G8 countries."
"From the beginning of its mandate, the Commission I have the honour of chairing has made relations with Africa one of its most urgent priorities."
"For example, the Commission has opened its first EU history college outside Europe in Addis Ababa, where we held a working meeting with the Commission of the African Union."
"Yet there is still much to be done in relations between Europeans and Africans."
"The imminent EU-Africa Summit, to be held under the Portuguese Presidency, is a unique opportunity to set an ambitious agenda, including practical issues such as energy, migration, the fight against climate change and, obviously, democracy and human rights."
"We have a duty to talk with our African partners about issues of democracy, human rights and governance."
"We have talked with the rest of the world, it would be incomprehensible for us not to talk with Africa."
"There are, admittedly, certain political and diplomatic problems to be resolved, but those problems, the relevance of which we have to acknowledge, cannot and must not become obstacles to an essential strategic partnership for the future of globalisation."
"Africa and Europe must work together."
"I have said more than once that the EU has a mission for the 21st century, namely the promotion of justice, freedom and solidarity throughout the world."
"The EU cannot and must not be a group of countries dedicated to looking inwards."
"It can and must be a force for reform and stability in the world, and for the defence of European interests and the promotion of European values."
"We are a community of values, particularly the values of freedom and solidarity."
"The African continent is undoubtedly a region that needs our support and commitment."
"The European Union cannot close its eyes to the drama that is being acted out so close to it."
"Before I finish, I should like to wish the Portuguese Government every success and reaffirm the Commission's absolute willingness to work with the Presidency."
"I may say that I have total confidence in the ability of Portugal - a country that has proved its commitment to Europe - of the Portuguese Government and authorities, and of all the country's political forces to work for Europe."
"We share with the Portuguese Presidency the excellent slogan it has chosen for this period: a stronger Europe for a better world."
"Together we shall succeed in working to this end."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, Mr S√≥crates, Mr Barroso, ladies and gentlemen, my group welcomes the Portuguese Presidency's ambitious motto: 'A stronger Union for a better world'."
"By making its will to build central to its mandate, the Portuguese Presidency is following the German Presidency's lead."
"And by capitalising on the dynamism of Mrs Merkel's achievements, you will show, Mr S√≥crates, that a Presidency's success depends on its having a strong political will and a strategy of convergence on ambitious, but realistic, priorities."
"Your success will also depend on your cooperating with this Parliament. Involve us very closely in your work and your decision-making."
"As far as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is concerned, institutional reform, the security of our fellow citizens, the pursuit of the internal market and the consolidation of growth are the crucial aspects of your Presidency."
"The agreement reached on 21 and 22 June takes up the bulk of the advances contained in the previous text."
"If the Member States ratify it by spring 2009, Europe will finally be able to make effective, transparent and democratic decisions in areas such as security, growth, energy, climate change and demographics."
"Going back on the commitments made would be to regard the European Union as a house of cards: one card fewer and the whole house collapses."
"As far as our group - and in particular Mr Brok who will represent it - are concerned, the Intergovernmental Conference must be devoted to the legal finalisation of the revised treaties and should be concluded, as you wish, Mr S√≥crates, in time for the European Council in the autumn."
"Mr S√≥crates, while a stronger Union for a better world motivates your work, you cannot overlook the security of our fellow citizens, and you have spoken of this matter at length this morning."
"The terrorist acts in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in Europe and the breaking of the ceasefire by ETA worry us and call for Europe-wide anti-terrorist coordination."
"Mr S√≥crates, I am aware of the Member States' reluctance to cooperate in this area."
"The 'every man for himself' principle must be eradicated; it is the security of the people of Europe that must prevail."
"Faced with international crime, terrorist cells, the complexity of the networks and the sophistication of the methods used, not least regarding migration, we are in danger of being caught up and we have a duty to act immediately."
"The vacancy of the post of EU anti-terrorist coordinator is unacceptable. Thank you for your commitment."
"Mr S√≥crates, let us show the same determination on the subject of our security as we do on climate change and energy."
"The victims of the terrorist attacks require us to stand united."
"Under your leadership, we expect more cohesion and the Member States to be more involved in an effective anti-terror coordination model."
"With regard to the other priorities such as the pursuit of the internal market and the consolidation of growth, our fellow citizens will only adhere to the European ideal if they can see that our social model, the free movement not only of persons, goods and capital, but also of services, and the promotion of education, training and innovation, are reflected in so many tangible improvements in their everyday lives."
"Becoming the world's most advanced economic area means having political will and courage."
"Portugal dared to have the Lisbon Strategy."
"The opportunity has been given to it to provide the best 'after-sales' service."
"We value both the social and the economic dimension of European integration."
"Mr S√≥crates, we hope, like you do, that progress will be made with Africa on migration issues and that our links with Brazil and the emerging countries will be strengthened."
"Like you, too, we regard transatlantic relations as one of our priorities."
"Over the last few months our partnership has taken a big step forward in quality terms; it must now make progress."
"Firm positions in terms of respect for our values and ongoing dialogue must govern our neighbourhood relations with the Balkans, Ukraine, Belarus and, of course, Russia."
"Mr S√≥crates, the PPE-DE Group wishes you every success with this stronger Union for a better world that you so earnestly desire."
"We will support you when it comes to defending the values of peace and solidarity, courage and responsibility."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, almost exactly one year ago, on 1 July last year, there was an excellent football match that Portugal won in a penalty shootout after extra time."
"It was a remarkable game."
"The Portuguese kept their nerve and every penalty went in."
"The ball is now in position for our penalty shot."
"You have said everything there is to say about the Intergovernmental Conference."
"Now you need to get the ball in the net."
"From this morning's speech, I suspect that your nerves are as steely as those of the Portuguese football team."
"If you score this time, in October you will win the trophy."
"(Applause)"
"We are realists, Prime Minister S√≥crates: there is not as much in the mandate as we might have hoped, but we accept that no more could have been achieved in the negotiations."
"However, there is a good deal in the mandate."
"You need to make it clear to all participants in the Intergovernmental Conference that there can be no going back on what has been agreed."
"I have a comment to make to my fellow Member, Joseph Daul, at this point."
"I have certainly noted that this is the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I hope that all sections of the PPE-DE Group, right through to the committee chairmen in your group, will take the same view."
"(Applause)"
"The higher the committee, the less I am certain."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what would happen if we went backwards?"
"We would find ourselves in another crisis situation like the one we have just resolved."
"And if we are in a crisis, President-in-Office, then the laudable objectives you have just described would again be out of our reach."
"How can we really implement a cohesive Lisbon Strategy with a two-speed Europe?"
"The two are mutually exclusive."
"You are quite right: we need to breathe new life into the Lisbon Strategy."
"Three years ago, a decision was taken to revitalise the Lisbon Strategy."
"Three years down the line, we have not made much progress."
"It is good that you are saying as President-in-Office of the Council we are going to get our heads down and get things moving, speed things up."
"There are two main reasons for speeding things up, though: you are quite right to say that we want to focus on qualifications."
"If we want to become the most competitive knowledge-based continent, we need to focus on qualifications."
"What we want from the Lisbon Strategy, above all, is social stability."
"If we have greater economic growth - which we do, there are more jobs, and the reforms are taking effect, in fact thanks to Gerhard Schr√∂der's Government, they are already having an impact in my country - if we have more jobs, then there is one thing we need above all: for that growth to be sustainable and to bring sustainable social stability."
"Otherwise the Lisbon Strategy is worthless."
"If, as you quite rightly said, President-in-Office, we are looking for a subject that forces us to act as a Community, and a Community of 27, and where there is massive popular support, then climate protection is it."
"The Live Earth concert last weekend clearly showed us how enthusiastically young people will champion a cause."
"So let us harness that enthusiasm."
"These young people go to the concert, and when it is over, they ask: and what now?"
"Bono and Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer do not have the solution."
"They can champion a solution, but it is up to us to provide it through practical actions."
"If we offer that solution, though, if we actually implement the ambitious targets, then I am certain that the people of Europe will be behind us, and that is exactly what the European project needs."
"When I talk about climate protection, Prime Minister, I am very grateful for your strategy on Africa and Latin America, because climate protection will only be feasible if we involve Africa and Latin America."
"In the case of Africa we need to recognise the bitter truth that the continent is most affected by global warning, despite making the least contribution to that global warming."
"This is a significant factor in the Africans' plight."
"I am very grateful for your position on Latin America too: the European Union's transatlantic relations go far beyond our relationship with the United States of America."
"Above all, it is incumbent upon us to support Latin America in finding multilateral solutions to international conflicts, in United Nations reform, and in combating financial crises triggered by the financial markets."
"Which countries were most affected?"
"Argentina, and also Brazil."
"It is vital that we in Europe work with the Latin Americans."
"My group will be running with and supporting this initiative in the autumn, and we are very grateful to you for organising the summit."
"There are some people in this House who immediately get twitchy if there are two speakers in a row from the same country."
"Mr President, today we have seen a Portuguese President-in-Office of the Council from the left and a former President-in-Office from the right working together for Europe."
"I think that is worthy of note."
"Overcoming issues that divide us at home in order to work together for a Europe for everyone else, this sense of common ground, of setting aside our differences, is what defines the notion of Europe."
"That is exactly what we need to build a stronger Europe, because as you quite rightly said, not only Europe itself, but the whole world, needs a strong and united Europe."
"That can only be achieved by resolving our differences, and concentrating on what unites us."
"So I wish you all the best for your Presidency."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, President-in-Office, the programme that you have presented combines clear goals with ample ambition."
"Success is not immanent, but Liberals and Democrats have high hopes of a European Union double act under the two Jos√©s."
"Indeed, you appear to compete for the laurels of economic liberalism."
"As Britain's newspaper the Daily Mirror might say, 'It's the only way, Jos√©!'"
"Who, if not you two, could convince Europe's governments of the beauty of Lisbon and the importance of its agenda?"
"Put the 'is on' back into 'Lisbon' - the need to consolidate public finances, the commitment to financial discipline and debt management, the drive to complete and strengthen the single market."
"Yes, even in the face of populist opposition in your own parties."
"It is not just in Asia that the free market has lifted millions out of poverty - it has done the same for 50 million people in the EU in the last 10 years alone."
"Most importantly, there is a need for sustainable economic recovery in Europe to be built on job creation rather than on rigging the rate of exchange to ratchet up export-driven growth."
"Therefore, my group particularly welcomes your initiative to open the discussion on flexicurity."
"We have to modernise social protection and benefit systems to face the challenges of a global market."
"Let us protect workers, not uncompetitive jobs."
"Our social safety net should protect not failing businesses but rather those in them, helping them to find new employment opportunities."
"The only European social model that matters to me is the one that preserves our prosperity by preparing our people for the future."
"And, yes, if we talk about the future, let us not forget the fight against climate change."
"Let us look at how we can merge the Gothenburg and Lisbon Agendas and use innovation in green technologies to help us be more innovative, create more jobs and lead the world in setting the climate change agenda."
"President-in-Office, you are right to place an emphasis on Africa - discovered, exploited and then abandoned by Europeans."
"The fact that you have called the first EU-Africa summit in seven years says it all."
"It has been the forgotten continent for far too long."
"Africa needs Europe, and Europe needs Africa if we are to deal successfully with migration, disease and climate change."
"China offers money for natural resources and weapons for money."
"That is the road of 21st century economic colonialism and it is the wrong way forward for Africa."
"But Europe must avoid talk of the dimensions of empire."
"Let us learn from the past and forge a new and generous partnership."
"In justice and home affairs, we appreciate the fact that your Presidency will focus on a series of measures strengthening the area of justice in the European Union."
"After the revealing comments by Germany's Interior Minister, Mr Sch√§uble, my group will be on the guard against the erosion of civil liberties that underpin our society."
"(Applause)"
"We want to see the framework decision on procedural safeguards agreed in the Council as a necessary accompanying measure to the European arrest warrant."
"And we caution against a response to terrorism which changes the nature of our society by fettering the freedoms for which you fought in the Carnation Revolution."
"Two weeks ago, this House applauded the Council for agreement on a mandate for the IGC, but last week we learned from some of your colleagues in the Council that they were hollow words."
"Well, that was rather an ephemeral victory."
"I believe I speak not only for my group but for many colleagues in this House when I urge that the package agreed at the June Summit should not be unravelled."
"From a school on the Sagres peninsula, your country gained world repute as a nation of navigators."
"As President-in-Office, you will need those skills to navigate through the treacherous waters of Council negotiations."
"We wish you good luck and fair winds."
"Boa sorte!"
"(Applause)"
"thar ceann an Ghr√∫pa UEN. - A Uachtar√°in, is √≠ an aidhm is m√≥ a bheidh ag an Uachtar√°nacht seo a chinnti√∫ go s√≠neoidh ceannair√≠ an Aontais Eorpaigh Conradh nua an Aontais Eorpaigh n√≠os d√©ana√≠ sa bhliain."
"Th√°inig na ceannair√≠ ar shocr√∫ ginear√°lta polait√≠ochta ag an gcruinni√∫ mullaigh deireanach ach t√° obair mh√≥r f√≥s le d√©anamh sula mbeidh an conradh cinntithe go hioml√°n."
"Beidh an Phortaing√©il i mbun cruinnithe mullaigh go hidirn√°isi√∫nta leis an mBrasa√≠l, le ceannair√≠ na hAfraice agus le rialtais Mheirice√°, na S√≠ne agus na hIndia."
"And in particular when we speak about Africa we have all seen the difficulties and the concerns that have been raised by many colleagues with regard to the attendance of certain people at that conference."
"Perhaps this could be an opportunity for us, instead of shouting 'no' from the sidelines, to encourage other African countries to cooperate with each other, to use the open method of coordination of what should be proper democratic controls and proper procedures for the rights of individuals and freedoms for individuals when we meet at this African summit."
"Darfur is mentioned often but rarely given any real meat, and the African summit provides us with another opportunity to try to bring together the disparate parts and elements in the conflict to ensure we can find a clear way forward."
"Concerning the reform treaty - as you rightly mention the mandate has been set for the IGC in very specific terms - in many ways, despite what other people may think, we should expand or change those terms."
"We are best to deal with what we have before us and what has been agreed by the 27 governments."
"If I could sum up what the reform treaty should be about in one single phrase, the reform treaty is about giving us the freedom we seek, which is not the freedom to do whatever we wish, but rather, the freedom to achieve all that we desire."
"In particular, when we speak about that freedom, we must take into account our climate and in particular climate change."
"As I said in Lisbon, I welcome the fact that the Brazil Summit gave us an opportunity to bring forward the whole idea of renewable energies and look at ways of creating new world trade organisation and partnership with the developing world and, most importantly of all, to guarantee that our citizens have the rights and freedom to succeed in Europe."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (PT) Mr President, a stronger Europe for a better world."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, 'a stronger Union for a better world': my group and I like your slogan very much, and I believe that there are three things the Presidency should do to ensure that over the next six months we remember this stronger Europe."
"With regard to the intergovernmental conference, you should not tolerate at all those who wish to back-pedal the agreements reached, but you should, meanwhile, find areas for possible improvements, such as in the field of climate change, and seek to promote and allow the opening up of the intergovernmental conference to the eyes of the European Parliament and to public debate."
"For us, these are the conditions for a successful reform of the Treaties."
"This reform will not be the last, because we are committed from now on in this House to reinitiating the battle for the European Constitution."
"On the Lisbon Strategy, we believe that no progress will be made unless, over the next six months, you are able, together with the Commission and Parliament, to strengthen the climate change agenda, since this cannot be separated from the Lisbon agenda."
"Following the decisions taken during the German Presidency, the time has come to act, rejecting the attempts by many Member States to become swept up in wheeling and dealing, where each party has the aim of reducing its commitments to the minimum."
"For this reason we would like to relaunch - and I urge you to take this into consideration - the idea of a Pact on climate change and energy security, based on the goal of restricting temperature increases to 2¬∞C above the level of the pre-industrial era and on instruments that include mechanisms for imposing sanctions, exactly as in the Stability Pact."
"There must be three lines of action, on which we would like concrete results within six months and on which I would ask you to respond, right now, in this debate: the issue of energy saving; transport, which unbelievably remained outside the agreements reached in the spring but which is responsible for 30% of emissions; and renewable energies, on which unfortunately the Barroso Commission has still done nothing, especially with regard to the heating and cooling Directive."
"The issue of renewable energies enables me, Mr President, to bring to your attention the issue of biofuel and relations with Brazil."
"We are worried: we do not like the mystical vision and miraculous significance given by President Lula to biofuel, as a new 'green gold'; nor do we like at all the fact that the issues of deforestation, illegal importing of timber, food safety and the European contribution to the development of innovative technologies for renewable energies have been excluded from the agenda."
"I would briefly like to make a similar observation on the issue of Africa."
"The fine words of Presidents S√≥crates and Barroso have a specific and worrying implication, which I urge you to consider: the pressure exerted by the European Union on various African countries to make them sign the economic partnership agreement by the end of the year."
"The Commission is using money from the Development Fund to convince these countries, in many of which civil society is opposed to the agreement, because the total opening up of their markets would ultimately achieve nothing but a reduction and restriction in their ability to integrate into the international market."
"I would have liked to say many other things to you, Mr President, but I am unable to do so."
"I hope that I will have other opportunities to do so."
"(Applause)"
"on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, what we have just heard from the current President of the Council proves that this is going to be yet another wasted opportunity to put on the agenda some of the serious economic and social problems that need changes in policy and responses on the part of the Community institutions: for example, the unequal distribution of income, increased job insecurity and the poverty in which nearly 80 million people live, including increasing numbers of workers on low pay and fewer rights, old people with negligible pensions, and women and children being denied fundamental human rights."
"Instead of attaching priority to changing the objectives and statutes of the Central European Bank so as to demand that it be subject to democratic control, to curb the rise in interest rates and to stop social injustice from getting any worse, he persists in his obsession with the main proposals contained in the neoliberal and militaristic draft Constitutional Treaty and greater concentration of the power of major EU powers."
"Instead of fighting for the withdrawal, or at least a radical revision, of the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon Strategy, in order to kick-start investment in the public sector and SMEs, to curb deregulation and the privatisation of fundamental sectors and public services with a view to creating more jobs with rights and reducing poverty and social exclusion, he places the emphasis on the sacred cow of competition to increase the power of the economic and financial groups."
"Instead of proposing measures to respect the dignity of working people, and to alleviate the increasingly insecure situation of millions of workers, particularly women and young people - as several thousand people demanded at the demonstration organised by the General Confederation of Portuguese Workers on 5 July in Guimar√£es - what we are seeing is an emphasis on flexisecurity, which more than anything else means flexi-exploitation of the workers."
"That is why we stress the need for a sea change on the part of the EU, and why we say it is time to listen to the people's demands, to extend democracy and to commit ourselves to a fairer social Europe characterised by progress and a fairer distribution of income; it is time to uphold the principle of sovereign States with equal rights, to strengthen international cooperation and solidarity, to commit ourselves firmly to peace, whether in the Middle East, Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa."
"We reaffirm our objection to a so-called reforming draft Treaty, but which, in practice, is nothing more than a reproduction of the Constitutional Treaty by means of a major smokescreen designed to circumvent referendums and to reduce democracy and the opportunity for people and national institutions to make their voices heard, for fear of pluralistic debate and public opinion in our countries."
"That is why we want a referendum in every Member State, as public opinion in our States demands."
"on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a Polish newspaper recently published the following story: What was the first European referendum?"
"Answer: when God, having created Eve, said to Adam: 'choose your wife'."
"The image is apt."
"Today, far away from the Garden of Eden, the Portuguese Presidency has taken over from the German Presidency."
"The latter will have been marked by its trickery, with an attempt to impose on the people of France and of the Netherlands a barely disguised and pruned text that they rejected by referendum."
"This mini-treaty is nothing but the Constitution in disguise."
"Some years ago, Mr Padoa-Schioppa, the father of the euro, wrote a piece in a French journal, the gist of which was that European integration stems more from enlightened despotism than from democracy."
"We have a vivid illustration of this today with this gross manipulation."
"How can one say that the new text corresponds to the desire expressed by the people of France and of the Netherlands during the referendums if it is not submitted to another such test by referendum?"
"If I may, Mr President, I shall express a wish in this House at the dawn of the Portuguese Presidency: if we do not want the people of Europe to turn their backs once and for all on the political class, then the Portuguese Presidency must make a total break with its outdated methods and undertake immediately the one genuine European reform that the people expect: less technocracy, more democracy."
"on behalf of the ITS Group. - (FR) Mr President, may I take this opportunity once again to express our gratitude for the magnificent reception that yourself and your government reserved for the chairmen of the parliamentary groups very recently in Lisbon: it testifies to your will to work seriously with this Parliament."
"We can only approve a number of your objectives, the ambition of which does not surprise us."
"They include that of helping to resolve the problems in Africa, problems that we must indeed admit have only worsened since the countries of Europe left, unlike what some people would have us believe."
"They also include an effort aimed at Latin America, and in particular Brazil, which is dear to your heart and which is close to you - all that is justifiable."
"As I have already had the opportunity to say to you, I believe that the only way that the European international policy that you hope to develop will have any legitimacy and transparency is if it distinguishes itself from that of the hegemonic superpower that the United States has now become."
"I fear, Mr President, that my fellow Member, Mr Watson, and many others like him are confusing two things: on the one hand, the necessary restoration of economic freedoms within a nation or within an area of which the parameters are almost the same in social protection terms and, on the other, a form of unbridled free-marketism that is reflected in downright unfair competition founded on social dumping."
"The truth is that, in the beginning, an economy develops only within a protective framework, which is true for the major partners of the world market that, today, are Japan and China."
"With regard, lastly, to the Intergovernmental Conference, you are going to have to apply a road map that has been proposed to you and that is a veritable manual with which to deceive the electorate."
"We are, in effect, keeping the substance of a constitution that, as has just been said, has been rejected, and changing the vocabulary."
"True, we are doing away with the words 'constitution', 'foreign affairs minister' and 'framework law', we are not mentioning the Charter in the text and we are merely publishing it in the Official Journal."
"However, we are keeping the extension of the Union's powers, majority voting and a single presidency, which would deprive us of your presence today, if it were in force."
"We are keeping everything to which the people did not subscribe and which they would most probably reject if they were properly informed."
"Mr President, you are the representative of a nation that is small in size but so very glorious in terms of its immense history."
"Such glory was possible only thanks to the constant battle that Portugal has always fought - from its birth and throughout its history - to uphold its independence."
"I beg you: do not be a party to the disappearance of this most precious of assets of your nation and of all our nations - our national independence."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr S√≥crates, we welcome the presentation of the guidelines that Portugal intends to follow over the coming months: naturally, we agree with the priority placed on the Intergovernmental Conference and can only offer our best wishes for you to achieve the aim of fully and faithfully turning the mandate into a new treaty."
"As you yourself said, the Presidency will have more commitments than just this one over the coming months."
"We welcome the list of priorities that you have set yourselves and understand the reasons why, in relation to some of these priorities - Lisbon, Africa, Brazil - Portugal will be especially committed."
"At the same time, we would like to emphasise the fact that, in order to turn your slogan into a reality and demonstrate that a stronger Europe can lead to a better world, we need not just good intentions but facts, which are not chosen by us but derive from the actual priorities of the circumstances in which we find ourselves."
"On this point, I would like to draw your attention and that of your Presidency to the most urgent priority, which is set by a region close to us in the Mediterranean - the Middle East - on which Europe can and must do more."
"This region has not had much of a presence in the recent past but now that the dangers are becoming more acute and the opportunities greater as a result, Europe must demonstrate that it knows how to be stronger in order to contribute to a better world."
"(PT) Mr President, Prime Minister, you will certainly have noted, as I have, the enormous groundswell of both expectation and sympathy you have aroused on all sides of this House, and there must be some reason for that."
"The reason is, of course, the firm and decisive manner in which you have rejected any interference with the decisions taken at the June meeting of the European Council."
"Continue along that line and you will certainly have even stronger support after the informal meeting of the September European Council."
"You also mentioned the Lisbon Strategy and the need for a new cycle."
"We all agree with that."
"We must, however, bear in mind that one of the reasons for the breakdown of the first Lisbon Strategy was the cardinal sin of not having given the Commission the responsibility for steering that strategy, a task for which the intergovernmental model has proved inadequate."
"In recent years, the President of the Commission - and he deserves great credit for this - has tried to make use of the fine detail to move the strategy forward."
"Nonetheless, the Council must accept that the Commission must be even more deeply involved with it in order to achieve the ambitious objectives you referred to, Prime Minister, in your speech."
"As far as foreign relations are concerned, it has to be said that you have started off on the right foot."
"The Summit with Brazil was an unqualified success, as I can confirm from President Lula's comments at the Conference of Presidents in Brussels."
"I would also like to tell you that neither in Africa nor in Europe should anyone be held to ransom by Robert Mugabe."
"Let us say so clearly."
"The summit must be for debate and must not concentrate on that sole or principal topic."
"There are many other issues to which you have referred, which must be the subject of our discussion and our dialogue and partnership with Africa."
"Just one more point, Mr President."
"In the case of relations with Russia, you have had the courage to visit President Putin in an atmosphere you knew would be unfavourable to you."
"You should now try to persuade your colleagues that Russia needs to be involved in [addressing] international problems, for Russia needs to be part of the solution and not part of the problem."
"Prime Minister, you have the support of this House, you certainly have the support of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for the ambitious programme you have presented."
"I am on your side, and wish you every success."
"(PT) Mr President, listening to the President of the Council and the President of the Commission I felt immensely proud to be Portuguese."
"This is a moment that will go down in the history of the European institutions."
"It is the first time in this Parliament that European dialogue at the highest level has taken place in Portuguese."
"In the past, the Portuguese language travelled all round the world. It was, furthermore, the first European language to establish dialogue between East and West."
"Today Portuguese is spoken by more than 220 million people spread across the five continents."
"As the Portuguese poet Ant√≥nio Ferreira once said, 'Let the Portuguese language flourish: may it be spoken, sung and heard, and long may it live'."
"The Portuguese Presidency has just begun and it has already left an indelible mark."
"The first EU-Brazil Summit was a success."
"It was a matter of urgency to include the B of Brazil in the EU's strategic partnerships with the BRIC countries (of Brazil, Russia, India and China)."
"This has now been done. Conditions have now been improved for Europe to give fresh impetus to relations with Mercosur and the Doha negotiations."
"The Portuguese Presidency, therefore, has got off to the best possible start."
"I would like it to have a similar success with its other priorities, including the adoption of the new Treaty and the second EU-Africa Summit."
"Dialogue with Africa is essential in the fight against illegal immigration and climate change."
"With regard to the Treaty, the Council's mandate was, as the Prime Minister has told us, precise and clear: Nothing is open to debate."
"The substance has been agreed, all that is needed is the exact wording."
"My wish is that there should be no obstacles along the way. We do not want Europe to be paralysed by stumbling over a comma or colliding with a word."
"That would send the worst possible signal to the citizens of Europe and the world in general."
"We Europeans need a strong, united Europe, capable of responding to the challenges of globalisation."
"A stronger Europe and a better world and, as Cardoso Pires might have said: E agora, Jos√©?"
"(Over to you, Jos√©). Now it is time to get down to work."
"I wish you good luck, because a successful Portuguese Presidency will mean a successful Europe."
"(NL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to congratulate Portugal on its Presidency and thank it for its pledge to work closely together with this House."
"You can rest assured, Mr President, that we will take you at your word."
"We welcome your intention to organise an EU-Africa Summit and an EU-Brazil Summit."
"As far as the EU-Africa Summit is concerned, though, we should not leave people in any doubt as to the fact that EU sanctions during your Presidency cannot simply be academic."
"To put it bluntly: at a summit such as this, there is no room for leaders who have reduced their own people to a state of misery and famine and who persist in this."
"Whilst a clear-cut position such as this does not make it any easier for you, Mr President, this is the product of a system we introduced ourselves at the time."
"I wish you much luck for the Brazil Summit."
"Brazil is an important country, and a reinforcement of the ties between the EU and Latin and Central America is a welcome development."
"I should also like to ask you a question."
"According to a brochure I read about your Presidency, it is the intention to make a contribution to disarmament and non-proliferation."
"I would appreciate it if you could expand on this a little."
"Finally, I should like to mention an issue that has not been raised before."
"It is clear, Mr President, that, in the next six months, you too will need to face up to all the crises that may develop anywhere in the world."
"There is one which will undoubtedly be at the top of the agenda and which we will be debating this afternoon, in fact: the crisis in the Middle East and Palestine."
"I hope that you too will be able to make a positive contribution in this matter."
"- (PL) Mr President, the priorities put forward by the President of the Council which started with the Portuguese presidency, are cause for great hope."
"It is particularly important to strengthen transatlantic relations, not only in the war on international terrorism, but also in the fields of economic relations and research."
"The presidency has also made equally valuable declarations about helping to stabilise the Western Balkans, and about drawing up a strategy, in conjunction with African partners, for the continent's development."
"We would also happily adopt an outline for the EU membership prospects of Ukraine during the European Union - Ukraine summit."
"Unfortunately the Portuguese presidency has also inherited the so-called 'new constitutional treaty'."
"Let us hope that this troublesome legacy will not obscure the ambitious aims the presidency has set for itself, which are of real importance for the future of Europe and the world."
"Mr President, coming from Scotland, a smaller Atlantic maritime nation, I warmly congratulate our Portuguese colleagues and thank Mr S√≥crates for his enthusiasm, his realism and his ambition today."
"I only wish my own country, Scotland, could take its natural place as a constructive and enthusiastic partner Member State, but we are on our way, for we do have much in common."
"We want to see realism; we want to see dynamism; we want to see reform; we want to see progress; and, in the reform treaty, you have an opportunity to deliver for all of us."
"My party decided, on balance, that we could not recommend the previous draft of the Constitution to our voters, but that is in the past, and we view your efforts with a fair heart and an open and constructive attitude."
"We wish you all the best."
"The EU is far from perfect but what is right with it is to be saved and is to be promoted."
"If you can build on the successes and sweep away what does not work - like this building, perhaps! - I hope to congratulate you in December also."
"(PT) Prime Minister S√≥crates says he has received a clear and precise mandate."
"I agree."
"He knows that the governments of Spain or Luxembourg Governments will argue that the new Treaty is the same as the previous one and will require parliamentary ratification."
"He also knows that the governments of France and the Netherlands will say exactly the opposite ultimately to support the same idea, namely that there will be no referendum for anyone."
"I wonder why he says nothing."
"Are we to have six months of doublespeak, or will we see the political vision to include the people in the decision?"
"I am also puzzled as to why he says nothing about certain other things."
"Europe has no policy on Iraq; does Washington have to decide to call its boys home before we can have such a policy?"
"Europe has two policies on the Iranian nuclear programme; will bombs have to fall in Iran before we see that such an escalation ought to have been prevented?"
"Europe has an irresponsible policy in Palestine and Lebanon; in the one case, it has always supported its President without recognising governments, and in the other it supports the government and opposes the President."
"Does it all have to go wrong before we see that our role ought to be to encourage internal agreement?"
"Last summer there was an unscheduled war."
"A year later, it is looming again."
"Mr S√≥crates, we shall only prevent it if we want to do so."
"Mr S√≥crates, you are part of this great deception: the attempt to hoodwink the British, the French and the Dutch into accepting a treaty without a referendum."
"The other day you said that this treaty was less federalist."
"I ask you: less federalist than what?"
"You really could not make some of this stuff up."
"Fortunately, there are some voices in the EU who are honest and say that we have the substance of the Constitution and all we have done is to change the terminology."
"Others say that we have 90%, or 99%, of what was there in the first place."
"Whether we are playing the game that you are playing or whether we are being honest, we all know the truth, which is that if the British had a referendum on this, 70% or perhaps more would say 'no'."
"I wonder whether it would not be better for everybody if the British just were not part of this European Union."
"Why do we not just get a quickie divorce?"
"We can do it very quickly; let us keep the lawyers out; let us have a free trade agreement; let us have a Swiss-style relationship."
"I think everybody would be a lot happier, most certainly we would be."
"While we are at it, I simply cannot bear listening to you and Mr Barroso blathering on about Africa and what we have to do to help people there."
"A very good start would be for you to stop Mr Mugabe attending the summit in December: that would send a good message."
"However, I will give you a real challenge, a positive thing that you could do."
"Yesterday Mr Barroso talked about the EU being an empire and, when it comes to Africa, my goodness me it is!"
"I urge you to stop the fisheries deals with West Africa."
"Stop your own fleet."
"Stop the Spanish fleet plundering western African resources, killing African fishermen."
"If you do that in your six-month Presidency then you will have done something positive for Africa."
"Please act!"
"(SK) Despite the fact that the Portuguese presidency is facing many challenges, the most serious one being the staging of an intergovernmental conference to negotiate the draft Constitutional Treaty, I am pleased to see that the Portuguese Presidency will also be dealing with other issues."
"The main issue here concerns the strategies in sectors that are within the purview of national states, for example the health sector."
"This week, namely on 12 and 13 July, the minister of health will be holding a Round Table devoted to healthcare strategies in Europe, and I have the honour to be taking part in these round table discussions."
"The meeting will be addressing issues such as discrepancies between the healthcare systems of Member States, legislation in the area of healthcare services, the problem of the rising incidence of cancer in the European Union and the mobility of patients and health professionals."
"I appreciate the fact that the talks will also include the participation of representatives from Slovenia, which announced some time ago that the fight against cancer would be one of the major priorities of its presidency."
"Prime Minister, I would like to wish you every success."
"Mr President, President-in-Office, President of the Commission, this Presidency is embarked upon at an important time for the European Union."
"I am delighted that my country and your country share the same patron saint, St George, who was well known for fighting dragons and dealing with difficult problems."
"I hope that this will be the case with this Presidency also."
"I am delighted that you are giving such emphasis to the issues of Africa."
"The plight of the continent and the fight against global poverty are matters which the British Conservative Party feels very strongly about."
"However, I must also press you, I think, to ensure that the EU-Africa summit later this year takes place without the presence of Robert Mugabe."
"I and my colleagues, including Geoffrey Van Orden, have been underlining this matter for some time because I think it would be intolerable for our Union to welcome such a tyrant to Europe at a time when the suffering of his people is clear and should be uppermost in our minds."
"As to the draft mandate for the IGC, it may be very precise but it is not necessarily right."
"We believe very strongly that, whatever form this constitution is shown to be in, there ought to be a referendum, certainly in the United Kingdom."
"And indeed we believe that the promise made by our outgoing - now former - Prime Minister, Mr Blair, to give the British people a referendum on this issue should be followed and taken on board by his successor, Gordon Brown."
"We have other serious concerns."
"There are serious concerns about our continuing commitment to free competition, about the legal position of the so-called British opt-out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and about the collapse of the third pillar, but I look forward to a positive debate during the IGC on these matters."
"Finally, I want to refer to the resolution on the IGC today, which calls for the issue of Parliament's two seats to be included in the mandate."
"I believe this is the perfect opportunity to demonstrate that Europe is listening to the people."
"The continuing vast expense of shuffling between Brussels and Strasbourg undermines the standing of our Parliament and the matter must be resolved soon."
"(PT) Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I support the programme of the Portuguese Presidency because, Mr President, if there is one thing worse than standing still, it is to go backwards."
"(ES) We are currently undergoing a process of political realism."
"We are not entirely pleased with the mandate, but we feel that it shows political realism."
"We in the European Parliament, and many citizens - the majority of them - wanted the Constitutional Treaty, but we accepted the idea of seeking a solution through a mandate that is very clear, but I do not believe there has ever been a mandate with so many footnotes."
"We must not forget that."
"We are all aware of the skill that legal experts have when it comes to resolving problems."
"Certain issues are striking. For example, we are meeting here under the European flag."
"What are we going to do, Mr President."
"Are we going to take the flag down or is this meeting going to be considered illegal?"
"This is an important point and there is something rather humiliating about it."
"There is another significant problem, and that is how we are going to explain this to the citizens."
"We are going to have Treaties 1 500 pages long, like telephone directories."
"In other words, we must find a way to explain the things we are doing and in doing so we must defend the progress, the legal personality, the extension of qualified majority voting and codecision, the advances in foreign policy ..."
"We must explain all of this, but it is not going to be at all easy and - since the devil is in the detail - we must study the way the mandate is drawn up very carefully."
"I believe that the European Parliament and the national Parliaments and civil society are going to be watching closely."
"Having said that, Mr President, I want to see a Lisbon Treaty emerge from the Portuguese Presidency."
"I want it to be a Treaty of reform and not of counter-reform."
"(PL) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I have carefully listened to your speech today and carefully read the speech you made at the Assembly of the Republic in Lisbon."
"I see that you have set out a wide-ranging programme for the Portuguese presidency and I wish you every success."
"I would, however, like to give my personal interpretation of your programme, and ask three fundamental questions."
"The first and most obvious one is the new constitutional treaty."
"The German presidency made some progress and managed to put together a difficult compromise."
"Each Member State may now feel that it has lost something in the negotiating process - that is the nature of compromise."
"But Europe has gained the chance to strengthen its unity."
"The mandate, which was unanimously approved, must be implemented, and no country, including my own, should be allowed to back away from its undertakings."
"The Portuguese presidency now has the difficult task of creating the consensus required to get the treaty approved."
"I would also appeal, as Bar√≥n Crespo has done, to try and put it in a form that would make it as clear as possible to the ordinary European citizen."
"The second point is establishing a policy of European solidarity, such as the common European energy policy, which will prove that Europe has profoundly and irreversibly united since the historic year of 1989."
"Another example of solidarity policy is the historic idea of free movement of people within the European Union, meaning the full opening of the Schengen area to new Member States."
"Only a Europe without internal borders can be a truly united community."
"And the third task is fulfilling Europe's undertakings towards the rest of the world."
"Portugal has pointed out the significance of Brazil, which has traditional ties with Europe as well as a vast development potential."
"However, the presidency's programme has also ensured renewed dialogue with Africa."
"This is an extremely important task, arising as it does from Europe's historical responsibility towards the continent with its unexploited natural resources, but which is currently racked by poverty, disease and ethnic violence."
"These are the challenges of our times, which can and must galvanise the process of European integration."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Portuguese Presidency does well to devote itself to the dialogue with Africa, in which what is perhaps needed more is the presence, for instance, of an army of small and medium-sized European businesses, to give birth to and shape a healthy economy in those regions, rather than an invasion of Chinese or multinationals that are not always inspired by humanitarian aims."
"It is equally crucial, however, to exclude from that Summit a leader such as Mr Mugabe, whom Europe should condemn not only for his initiatives and anti-humanitarian acts but also for his anti-white and anti-European racism, since racism should be condemned everywhere, not just in some places."
"We are worried, though, by the attitude of Mr Manuel Lobo Antunes towards an extremely swift opening up with regard to the Turkey issue: it is not absolutely necessary to step up the pace, for many reasons, the main one being that there is still a risk of admitting to Europe a country in which sharia law is in force."
"These are very worrying questions, and include geopolitical issues: for example, Mr President, we do not want Europe to end up bordering Iraq, Iran and other countries of that type."
"(CS) Mr President, the Portuguese presidency wishes to bring the European Treaty to completion and at the same time to address the challenges of global competition."
"I must point out that these are entirely incompatible and contradictory processes."
"It is clear from the new text that the Treaty seeks to preserve excessively costly and inefficient social systems."
"It is also clear from the text that the leaders of the EU Member States believe in a Bolshevist fantasy of stable prices and full employment."
"More to the point, the Union has again distanced itself somewhat from its founding principle of free economic competition without barriers, which has simply been expunged from the new Treaty."
"Mr President, I must again point out that the rejection of free economic competition as the driving force of the European economy constitutes a serious warning for all democratically aware citizens."
"It is only a small step from trampling down freedoms in the area of business to trampling down fundamental human rights and freedoms."
"The main thrust of democratic politicians should now be to incorporate free economic competition back into the Treaty with immediate effect."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, let me make a few comments."
"Only a few, because I agree with what both the Commission President and the President-in-Office of the Council have said regarding the Intergovernmental Conference."
"The Intergovernmental Conference is tasked with doing as little as possible."
"Its role is to keep to the IGC mandate, not to develop new ideas."
"I can think of many things that should also be included in a Treaty of this type."
"I know that some elements that were in the Constitution are missing, but this is a historical moment in which what has been agreed has to be transformed into a legally-binding document."
"For this reason, we feel that we should support the Presidency in their clear commitment to the mandate in order to get the job done as soon as possible."
"Whilst I think that symbols and many other elements - particularly transparency - have been lost, since the Convention, which also had input from national parliamentary representatives, we have had more democracy and greater efficiency."
"Efficiency has been improved through more majority voting, through the rules on foreign and security policy and a few other areas."
"There is still room for improvement, but this is better than the current situation."
"Wherever majority voting applies, the European Parliament has the power of codecision."
"If this Treaty becomes reality, the European Parliament will have equal powers of codecision in 90-95% of cases."
"Some things have been forgotten: in future, the European Council, on the basis of a qualified majority, will propose a candidate for election as Commission President to the European Parliament in the light of the results of the European election and after consultations with the European Parliament."
"This will increase citizens' rights, because, through the Parliament, citizens will have a direct line to the Commission thereby generating considerable legitimacy."
"This marks a significant step forward, and ties in with the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"If we speak out for certain values worldwide, we also have to apply those values ourselves and make them legally binding."
"This is why a binding Charter of Fundamental Rights is so vital for citizens' rights."
"The only ones who have been cheated are the British citizens."
"(DE) Mr President, occasionally one hears that this Intergovernmental Conference will just be dealing with the technicalities of the Treaty."
"That is not true!"
"You, President-in-Office, have shown that the political significance of the Intergovernmental Conference is that it will keep to the whole mandate and nothing but the mandate."
"The political significance lies in the clear determination to conclude the negotiations in October, and in seeking to convince all 27 Member States that this is the right way forward for Europe at this historic moment."
"I have no doubt that you will succeed, given the clarity of your programme and your firm political will."
"The chairman of my group has said that you just need to get the ball in the net from the penalty spot."
"Martin, let us not forget, this is not a penalty shootout, but a penalty awarded mid-game!"
"The game will continue."
"There is still the whole second half, or the ratification process."
"Past experience has shown that a few problems may yet emerge."
"So I feel it would be good, President-in-Office, if you were to seek to convince your colleagues in the Council informally of the need for speedy ratification within the next twelve months."
"It would be good if the Netherlands and France, who voted 'no', could be the first to ratify."
"It would also be good, President-in-Office, if you could persuade the new British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, not to bring up the rear in the ratification process, but rather to lead the way."
"That would send a clear message to the whole of Europe."
"(MT) Thank you, Mr President."
"Last week I had the opportunity to visit one of the four detention centres in Malta in the company of the Chairman of our group, Mr Daul."
"Currently, these detention centres are together providing shelter to more than 1 400 people, all of whom are immigrants who took great risks to cross the Mediterranean."
"In fact these people were saved from drowning by our Maltese maritime patrol team."
"I talked with one of the immigrants from Nigeria, supposedly a country with abundant natural resources."
"With tears in his eyes, this young 17 year-old kept insisting that he wanted to go to Europe."
"However, he claimed that even being held in detention was better than having to return to Nigeria."
"This illustrates the fact that our policy designed to promote development in the African continent has so far failed."
"It is this policy that can, in the long term, lead to a reduction in the influx of immigrants to Europe."
"However, this policy must also go hand in hand with other policies that require urgent and immediate attention if we are to step up the fight against illegal immigration, and, in particular, against the network of organised crime that is behind it and that is exploiting the misfortune of these people."
"We saw some of the boats used by immigrants to cross the Mediterranean."
"They are all the same size, have the same type of engine and are in a shocking and disgraceful state."
"They generally accommodate around 30 people, which is enough for these vessels to start taking in amounts of water large enough to sink them at the first sign of wind or sea swell."
"It is little wonder that, before departing from Libya, the immigrants are informed that their journey will take them to either Italy or Malta or lead to death by drowning."
"Each person pays $1 000 for the crossing - a total of $30 000, almost all of which is profit."
"Who knows, maybe this money is going towards the financing of terrorism. Thank you."
"(FR) Mr President, Mr S√≥crates, I welcome the fact that justice and internal affairs constitute one of the priorities of your Presidency."
"We do in fact share an overall and common view of immigration."
"True, we need to implement a genuine policy of cooperation with the countries of origin, which must be based on respect for fundamental rights, but it is also crucial that we open up legal immigration channels at European level, and we await a constructive debate with the Presidency on the definition of the common rights of non-EU nationals working legally in Europe."
"It goes without saying that the statements of good intentions made by the European Councils on the subject of European solidarity in terms of border management and migratory flows must be followed up with concrete measures."
"That is why the Council must, as a matter of urgency, look into the necessary revision - and I would emphasise this point - of the Dublin II regulation."
"Furthermore, we are relying on the Portuguese Presidency to encourage the Council to reach an agreement on the 'return' Directive that respects the right of asylum and the principle of non-refoulement."
"(Applause)"
"(PT) Mr President, the European Presidency that began a few days ago is facing challenges that call for negotiating ability, political will and strategic vision."
"Firstly, there is the institutional issue."
"Now that the Intergovernmental Conference mandate - a precise one, as requested - has been adopted, we hope it will be possible for the Portuguese Government to negotiate a reform of the Treaties with the scope required to overcome the institutional deadlock."
"Among other amendments that stand out, the European Union is no longer rotating presidencies, such as yours, and one Commissioner per Member State."
"Once these national elements have been eliminated, in the name of efficiency, the greatest responsibility is to reduce the distance that has been created between citizens and the EU, and the best way of doing that is to build a Europe that produces results when it comes to its citizens' concerns, such as the economy and employment."
"In this regard, we have recently been talking about 'flexicurity'."
"We believe that, without employment, there is no social model to support and that employment is protected by means of nimble, competitive firms that are constantly adjusting to the market."
"Making the employment system more flexible is not the only answer, nor is it the only way to achieve the economic sustainability that we advocate."
"Europe will be successful if we have the political will to invest in the areas in which it has particular potential and, at the same time, in research, innovation and long-term vision."
"One such area is the new European Maritime Strategy to which the European Parliament will make a major contribution in today's vote."
"When it comes to the exploitation of resources, transport, trade, the environment, scientific research, in the section on protection against environmental disasters, and also against illegal practices and crime, what are needed are fresh, global responses."
"We expect the Portuguese Presidency to give that strategy a decisive boost at the appropriate moment."
"On that subject, I would like to say one final thing."
"Concerns such as peace, security, the fight against terrorism, economic development in our neighbouring countries, the prevention of illegal immigration and energy supplies are all issues that will benefit from an approach that creates allies and includes partners in the South."
"There is, moreover, an increasing need for a new partnership for the Mediterranean and the Portuguese Presidency is in a good position to promote a revival of that strategic dialogue for the European Union."
"Prime Minister, we wish you good luck and the greatest success in the next six months."
"We know that if it goes well for you, it will certainly go well for Europe."
"Mr President, I wish to begin with an urgent matter."
"I have just received the news that in Libya the death penalty has just been confirmed on the Bulgarian nurses."
"I should like to make a direct appeal to Mr S√≥crates to act on behalf of the European Union to ensure that there is a kind of grace or there is direct contact with Mr Gaddafi that this verdict should not be implemented."
"(Applause)"
"We are very shocked that the courts in Libya have reconfirmed the death penalties for Europeans, who should be freed and allowed to go to their homes in Bulgaria."
"Prime Minister, I urge you to do whatever you can to make clear to the Libyan authorities the view of the European Parliament and the European Union in general."
"I should like to hear your views on foreign issues: how you see further developments in relations with Russia; the preparation of a partnership and cooperation agreement; what steps you will be able to take to ensure that, in this second half of 2007, we will be able to develop a mandate to restart and start negotiations on the new partnership and cooperation agreement."
"It is very important to have these talks with the Russians on more transparent energy relations, on the problems in our shared neighbourhood, but also to be able to restart the human rights dialogue, the democracy debate between Russia and the European Union, but also to be able to further develop our multilateral agenda, whether it concerns Iran, the future of the United Nations system, Kyoto and so on."
"Secondly, I should like to hear your comments on how you see the further developments concerning Kosovo, which is also related to our relations with Russia."
"We are pleased that there is now a period of three or four months that will allow for further talks, especially with the new government, which we support very much, given the important role of the democratic party in that government."
"What can you do to ensure that, in the end, there is a result that is acceptable - maybe not completely acceptable, but more acceptable - to Serbia, and which will have the support of Russia in the Security Council and will also keep the European Union united?"
"Mr Ahtisaari's proposals should be a basis, but we should also have a situation in which there is a UN resolution as a basis for the operation of European Union in the future."
"We expect that Kosovo will define its status in the end."
"(Applause)"
"Thank you, Jan Marinus Wiersma."
"With your consent, I will comment on the question of nurses later, once the plenary is full and before the vote."
"(DE) Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we have been given our homework, and plan to send the right messages to Africa and Latin America."
"The Intergovernmental Conference needs to discuss the technical details and implementing the substance of the Treaty and the decisions made at the summit, not to negotiate a new Treaty."
"Today you will have noticed that the problem is not the European Parliament, not the Commission, and not Europe's citizens."
"The only problem you may encounter is the vanity of some Heads of State or Government and Member States in the Council."
"So I say to you: make sure that under your Presidency everyone keeps to what has been agreed, that everyone keeps their promises, that they make good on their financial commitments - I am thinking of Frontex - and that they take responsibility for doing at home what they promised at the European level: that they implement real projects and respect the rules, rather than presenting clever interpretations - particularly France."
"If you ensure that what has been agreed becomes reality, you will generate new momentum in the European Union and have fewer problems."
"- (PL) Mr President, each EU presidency brings with it new challenges, new aims, and new opportunities, but also new potential mistakes and setbacks."
"I carefully read the interviews the Portuguese premier gave to the press on the European Union's eastern policy, and what I read worried me deeply."
"You said, and I quote, '...when negotiating with Russia we should not just emphasise our differences, but also our similarities...'."
"This is a surprising statement which may be interpreted as heralding a change in tone of the EU's eastern policy to a very acquiescent, and, I am not afraid to say it, appeasing tone."
"The European Union must continue to steer the course of the German presidency, which is one of solidarity and unity."
"Only solidarity will allow us to act effectively in our relations with Russia."
"Any lack of consistency will only be interpreted as weakness by our eastern partner."
"There are many issues that need to be addressed: the unresolved dispute about Polish food exports to Russia, and the need to conduct a policy of energy solidarity to prevent Moscow from putting pressure on individual Member States."
"President-in-Office of the Council."
"(PT) Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to begin by thanking you for all your comments in this debate, and your criticisms of my speech and of the Presidency's plans."
"I would like everyone to know that those comments and criticisms are very helpful to me in the tasks I have to perform as President of the Council."
"I think it is also fair to say that, from what I have heard overall, the MEPs' comments regarding the Union's tasks for the next six months largely coincide with the programme I have presented to you here."
"I am delighted to see that there is broad political consensus on what we have to do in the next six months."
"This is extremely important for Europe."
"It has not been difficult, furthermore, to identify those priorities, because we are all aware of one very simple fact: what Europe expects - what the European economy, European society and the world expect - is that this time Europe will resolve its institutional crisis once and for all, because for the last two years the idea on which we have been reflecting was one that everyone has seen as an institutional crisis that Europe has been incapable of overcoming."
"The clear signal that we must send to the world and to Europeans is that we are going to succeed in overcoming that crisis and breaking that deadlock."
"That is why I am pleased to hear in all the Members' speeches the idea that concluding a Treaty at the earliest opportunity should naturally be our priority."
"I do not know whether it will be a penalty, but the fact is that we need to score that goal, and as quickly as possible."
"I am also pleased that the Members support the Presidency's view that, to obtain a Treaty, it is also necessary to take advantage of the current political situation, the current political climate, the current political convergence, so as to transform the mandate into a Treaty as quickly as possible."
"I am therefore pleased to see that the timetable I have presented here, the idea that we must move quickly, also corresponds to a political consensus."
"There is no reason, furthermore, why we should not do so."
"That, as I say, is what the European economy expects, what the other European institutions expect and what the world expects: in other words, that we should move quickly."
"The final consensus, the agreement, the mutual commitment we are reaching is such a clear and precise commitment that nobody expects us to get bogged down in interminable discussions, especially given that discussions are conducted behind closed doors."
"I am therefore pleased to see that there is general agreement on the idea that priority should be given to converting the mandate into a Treaty."
"I have naturally addressed the issue of the mandate and have stated that, if there is one thing the Presidency does not have, it is a mandate to reopen or alter the mandate it has received."
"This is of the greatest importance and also seems to me to be the core issue."
"No one expects that and I am sure all the Member States in attendance that night and that made a commitment to a firm agreement are fully aware of what that would mean in terms of discrediting the institutions and Europe itself."
"I am therefore certain that none of the Member States and no political leader advocate such a possibility, and that you will support me when I say that our whole duty is to keep the mandate as it is and transform that mandate into a Treaty."
"I would also like to state the obvious: that this Union depends on everyone, and everyone is necessary."
"I am well aware of the task facing the Presidency, which is to make it possible to reach an agreement between the 27; not the 26, the 25 or the 24, but the 27."
"That, furthermore, is what distinguishes a union from an alliance."
"We are not an alliance, we are a Union, and because we are a union we are all indispensable and must all be 'on board'."
"That is why I say that we will do our best to move as quickly as possible to obtain what we all desire, which is that in October, at the first opportunity, not the final opportunity, but the first opportunity, Europe should be capable of giving a clear signal to Europeans and the world that it has overcome its institutional crisis."
"I would also like to say a few words on the ratification of the Treaty."
"Ratification at national level is a problem for the Member States, it is not a European problem."
"At this moment, having heard what I have heard, I would like to point out that nowhere in the world, in liberal democracies, is Parliamentary ratification considered illegitimate or incompatible with the best values of modern democracies."
"I believe that the attempt to devalue parliamentary ratification does no credit to representative democracy. I fully understand that there are those who advocate referendums and argue for direct democracy at certain times."
"I find that very positive and believe that referendums and more participative democracy make democracy richer."
"But never, never, in any circumstances, have I argued that such a more direct and participative democracy can be used against representative democracy."
"I consider that a bogus argument and would like to make that clear."
"Parliaments are legitimately empowered to approve treaties and to do so on behalf of the people."
"That is what the theory of democracy teaches us, and I have lived with those values for so long that I am not willing to relinquish them, particularly at this time."
"A second point I would like to speak to you about, honourable Members, is external policy, which is set to be one of our priorities under this Presidency. It will be one of our priorities because it cannot be otherwise."
"If we look at EU foreign policy, it is easy to see that there are some gaps in it."
"We naturally want to fill those gaps. We have already filled one, namely that of Brazil."
"The fact is that the EU has held summits with China, India and Russia but not with Brazil, the other BRIC country."
"This has not happened, but ought to happen, because such a summit lends consistency to our policies towards the emerging economic powers and attaches greater importance to relations between Europe and Latin America."
"Those strategic relations are also vitally important when dealing with questions of world governance. I feel that Europe is now in a better position to influence global political issues having entered into a strategic partnership with Brazil."
"There is one thing of which I have no doubt. European foreign policy has become richer as a result of the agreement reached at the summit with Brazil."
"It remains to be seen, but I have high hopes that that summit may have helped create a better climate for dialogue between Europe and Brazil, which will in turn help the Doha Round and the negotiations for an agreement on world trade to continue."
"I have high hopes of that and I am among those who believe in the benefits of a successful Doha Round, and an agreement in that framework, for the whole world, for the regulation of globalisation and also for the promotion of greater freedom of trade and more development, particularly in the least developed countries."
"A word about Africa as well, and what I want to say is that we need a specific policy on Africa, too."
"Europe has to decide whether it wants to move forward or stay as it is, and we have already been in the latter position for seven years."
"Something has to be done, and I would like to remind you all that we have already made that choice, at least nine months ago."
"The European Council has already decided to hold a Summit, and at the last three meetings it was declared that the summit should be held this year, during the Portuguese Presidency."
"The time for thinking about a summit, therefore, is over."
"Let us hold the summit."
"I should like to say this about the EU-Africa Summit. For a start, I consider that Europe cannot go on paying the price for not having a structured, institutional and strategic dialogue with Africa."
"I think that is a mistake that is already costing us dear."
"We in Europe are paying the price, but the Africans are also paying the price, and there are people whose lives are the worse because we do not have that dialogue with Africa."
"If we in this Chamber think of human rights and hunger, we must also think that a great deal would be contributed by holding a summit with Africa, not only to resolve development problems and to provide a better response to the problems of hunger in Africa, but also to provide a better response to the problems of governance and human rights in African countries."
"That is how I see this issue."
"Now, the surest way of contributing nothing towards resolving problems is to stay as we are: doing nothing."
"I consider that the wrong option."
"On the subject of Africa I would also like to tell you, honourable Members, of my sadness on hearing the news about the Bulgarian nurses, as previous speakers have mentioned."
"I should also like you to know that we have been monitoring that case for a long time."
"As you know, Portugal is one of the countries that has the best relations with the North African countries, including Libya, and we have been keeping a close eye on the matter. We have for a long time been talking to the Libyan authorities about it."
"We now have more responsibility during these six months and are well aware of the importance of the case."
"We are working on it, and indeed, I did so recently, in conjunction with the President of the Commission, when we were in Accra."
"We shall do everything possible to ensure that the case has a happy ending."
"There is still leave to appeal the decision."
"As I say, we are monitoring the case and hope you all appreciate the diplomatic delicacy of the matter."
"Our objective is to see that the case be brought to a satisfactory conclusion."
"As you will appreciate, political rhetoric is not always helpful, but you all know how committed we are to securing a satisfactory outcome to the case."
"Two more comments. Firstly, with regard to climate change, I should just like to say that I have been Minister for the Environment, I have spent a term of office as Minister for the Environment, and I remember the difficulty we had at the time, in 2000, talking about climate change."
"That difficulty belongs to a different era. The situation is now totally different and I believe we have all realised that the operational synthesis between innovation and energy is climate change."
"There is a great desire in various sectors for action to be taken quickly, but I think, as you must all agree, that the decisions we took at the last spring European Council were absolutely essential to give Europe credibility in that field and to put Europe in a political position to lead, to be in the front line, to provide a political response to this global problem."
"We are going to monitor this subject very closely. I myself - if I can fit it into my timetable, although I intend to do so - shall be in Bali, representing the EU, to give a speech expressing the Union's willingness to provide leadership for the post-Kyoto framework and for the world's response to climate change."
"I should like to make it clear, however, that we have an internal agenda to which we must adhere and that agenda includes the Technological Energy Plan, which we shall deal with in conjunction with the Commission, and the creation of the European Institute of Technology, which we firmly support and which will be launching its first Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) and that first initiative is rightly, and indeed symbolically, targeted at climate change."
"Finally, a word on biofuels: there are no magic solutions, but biofuels are the most efficient way at the present time of reducing CO2 in the field of transport."
"I have no doubts about this and if there is a way forward, an appropriate solution that contributes towards such reduction, I consider that we have no right to overlook it, if only because it naturally has a less than favourable impact on other areas."
"I consider that the balance-sheet on biofuels is highly positive and one that should encourage us to continue with them."
"Finally, I turn to immigration. I want to make it clear that the subject of immigration will be one of the most important during our Presidency."
"We shall attach great importance to this issue."
"Europe needs to set out a clear way of thinking on immigration."
"I think the only way we can have an immigration policy commensurate with the problem and also compatible with our values is to define a policy constructed on three pillars."
"The first is to prevent illegal immigration, to strengthen border security, and fight this crime against human dignity."
"The second is to fight for an inclusive, human policy."
"Europe today is a continent that provides shelter for many millions of immigrants, who are also waiting for a definition of immigration."
"Thirdly, as a third pillar, we must have a policy that has been agreed with the countries of origin, to make it possible to regulate migratory flows to our mutual benefit."
"These are the three pillars that should form European policy, but they should be formulated in documentary form, and therefore, during the next six months, we shall be organising conferences and shall continue to work in conjunction with the Commission and Mr Frattini to make it possible to structure and publicise a consistent and comprehensive European Union immigration policy compatible with the response the problem demands."
"Madam President, honourable Members, I should like to thank you once again for all your comments and wish to conclude as follows. We have our plan, we are embarking on these six months with confidence, with the energy and willingness of those political leaders who, throughout their political lives, have always believed in the European project."
"I have said several times before that I was born in 1957, the Year of Europe, and elected to Parliament a year after we came into Europe."
"I am a European politician and, therefore, when I come here, I do so with the greatest honour as one who has this opportunity to serve Europe in such a place."
"We therefore start out with confidence, the confidence of someone who is thoroughly familiar with the European project."
"We have a plan, but a plan is only a plan."
"Naturally there will be unforeseen events, situations that were not in the plan, events that will take us by surprise, and it is just as well that politics is like that, because if it were not so it would not be a matter for politicians, inasmuch as politicians are there to deal with unforeseen situations."
"The plan guides us in our actions and, if unforeseen and unexpected events occur, we shall be here, armed with what is important for a politician: the set of values, principles and guidelines that have always guided us in the construction of a stronger Europe in the service of a better world."
"Thank you, Mr President."
"President-in-Office, we have confidence in you."
"The European Parliament will be at your side making sure you succeed."
"If you succeed, the European Union will succeed."
"We wish you all the best for the Presidency."
"President of the Commission."
"(PT) Mr President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, I also should first of all like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the Bulgarian nurses and their families, and also with the Palestinian doctor, following the disturbing news we have received."
"We are extremely disappointed by these decisions, but I would also like to say that I am confident that a solution will be found."
"In particular, I would like to assure the Bulgarian nurses and their families that the European Commission, in conjunction with the President of the Council and the Member States, will do everything possible to safeguard their right to life and freedom."
"Prime Minister, the debate has clearly demonstrated that Parliament supports the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council."
"As Mr Schulz said, a message of support for the European project has come from the various political and ideological areas."
"The European project cannot be seen as merely the property of one political or ideological sector or another."
"It should unite political forces that have that common objective of making a stronger Europe, a Europe that responds to the aspirations of its citizens."
"That is what we have seen here today."
"We very much agree with the your analysis regarding the need to resolve the institutional issue. The fact is that the non-resolution of the institutional issue has cast a shadow of doubt, of scepticism, of negativity and at times even of cynicism, over everything Europe has done."
"Europe has not been deadlocked."
"In recent years, and the cooperation between the various institutions has been important in this, we have succeeded in dealing with difficult issues, we have approved a budget for the next seven years, we have achieved a hard-won consensus on an issue as divisive as the service directive, at the March European Council, we succeeded in adopting the most ambitious package of measures so far presented concerning the fight against climate change, the relaunched Lisbon Strategy has borne fruit, thanks to a new system of governance."
"The fact is that at present Europe is, broadly speaking, enjoying a successful period; we have economic growth that gives us fresh cause for hope, we are creating more jobs now than our US partners and Eurobarometer results confirm that we have the highest level of confidence in Europe for eight years."
"Times are, therefore, better."
"The fact is, however, that until the institutional issue is resolved, this doubt is always present and, particularly when we are outside Europe, we are confronted with questions to which we have to attach due prominence."
"We are asked how Europeans can want to lead the world in the fight against climate change, how Europeans can ensure energy security, how Europeans can want to transform their economy into one of the fairest, most inclusive and most competitive in the world, when they are incapable of deciding how their own institutions should function and how decisions should be taken."
"This, therefore, is a matter of credibility."
"That is why it is absolutely essential that we resolve the institutional issue and the Prime Minister, the President-in-office of the Council, will leave here today, with, in my view, the very clear support of both Parliament and certainly the Commission, to find a solution in full compliance with the mandate and if possible a solution as early as the October European Council."
"That should be our objective and in that, Prime Minister, you have our total support."
"Lastly, I would like to say that we have taken careful note of the priorities established at the December European Council: immigration and matters related to the new Agenda for Security, Justice and Freedom in Europe."
"One of the improvements we have made to the Treaty is to increase our capacity to take action on matters of justice, freedom and security."
"As previous speakers have mentioned, immigration issues are crucial from a human point of view - they are human dramas that we have to deal with."
"As regards the Agenda for Innovation, the Prime Minister has just now taken the opportunity to lend his clear and unequivocal support to the creation of a European Institute of Technology, to the launch of the first Knowledge and Innovation Community, innovation precisely targeted at the issue of climate change, and anything we can do to give fresh impetus to the Agenda for Innovation."
"This is one of the issues in which Europe cannot afford to lag behind, or to give ground, not only in relation to our US partners but also in relation to other, emerging powers;"
"Europe needs to make more determined efforts in this area."
"I feel that if we achieve these objectives we shall be entitled to be proud of ourselves."
"Finally, with regard to Africa, a problem that has been discussed here, honourable Members, we cannot accept that our relations with a continent like the African continent should be dependent on one dictator or another, whoever it might be."
"The fact is that Europe has partnership relations at the highest level with Asia, where there are dictators, and with Latin America, where some countries are also not democracies. What is more, the red carpet is laid out for some of those dictators in certain European capitals."
"I therefore cannot understand why we are prevented from having high-level relations with Africa, whilst we keep the door open for those who are sometimes actually hampering Africa's democratic development, because we are in some way being held hostage by one dictator or another."
"We therefore resolutely support this priority of the Portuguese Presidency, and it is certain that the objectives, or one of the objectives, of the summit should be to discuss democracy, freedom, human rights and the need to develop our relations for the benefit of good governance in Africa, and all areas of relations between our respective continents."
"If so, I think we can be happy with this Presidency because we are sure that, during these six months, we shall continue to advance towards a stronger Europe for a better world; a Europe where it is demonstrated in practice that only by working together can we produce results that are really in the interests of European citizens."
"(Applause)"
"The debate on the Portuguese Presidency is closed."
"Written statements (Article 142)"
"in writing. - (IT) As well as the reform of the institutions, without which the European Union will not have the role that it should within the world, and the challenge to achieve competitiveness within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be able to tackle vigorously that which, as I have already emphasised on various occasions, is the main stalemate that we need to overcome, namely energy independence and the fight against climate change."
"Energy will represent at the same time the business and the problem of the future, as we can see also from the alarm over the imminent total consumption of non-renewable energy sources and the Kyoto protocol commitments."
"Only with proper independence from external suppliers will we be able to ensure that Europe has a leading role in the world economy in the long term, as well as a stronger position on the geopolitical stage, and is not subject to external threats."
"This is an essential condition when it comes to promoting stability, democracy and respect for human rights throughout the world."
"Let us therefore try to focus our attention, energies and resources on what we already have, which is nuclear power, and on what we can have, which is renewable energy sources, promoting research, cofinancing by the Member States and the private sector, action on tax, reform of the transport sector, and a call to European experts who have gone abroad through lack of opportunities."
"in writing. - (FR) The Portuguese Presidency must focus on the priority objective of the signing by the 27 of a new institutional treaty, in October, in Lisbon, all the more so because the mandate entrusted to the Intergovernmental Conference by the last European Council is clear and precise."
"The launch of a new round of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment is an opportunity to give the social dimension the importance and visibility that it deserves, not least through the improved coordination of employment policies and through the development of 'flexicurity', with the aim of reconciling our fellow citizens with Europe and its reformed economic model."
"I am sure that the Portuguese Presidency will pay special attention to the EU's outermost regions - the specific circumstances of which it is well aware - together with Madeira and the Azores, in order to give fresh impetus to the Community measures benefiting them, not least those concerning the neighbourhood policy and the additional costs generated by the outermost regions."
"It is imperative that the last Brussels summit has beneficial consequences and bears witness to the fact that Europe's renewed spirit is stronger than the national self-interests."
"I sincerely hope that the Portuguese Presidency succeeds in making the most of the major political boost observed at the end of the German Presidency."
"Statement by the President"
"Today the Libyan Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence passed on the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor detained in Libya since February 1999."
"They are accused of deliberately infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV."
"I am greatly disturbed by this news, which is distressing for everybody, especially, of course, for the nurses and the doctor, and for their relatives and friends."
"I met members of their families in April, and I should like to pass on to them our solidarity and support at this difficult time."
"I should also like to send them a message of hope."
"This is not the end of the procedure."
"The matter will now be referred to the Libyan High Judicial Council."
"We believe that the Libyan authorities will take the necessary steps to review and quash the death sentence, paving the way for an early resolution to this situation."
"Once again, we reiterate our fundamental opposition to the death penalty, which is against human dignity."
"We express our solidarity with the victims of the HIV/AIDS infection in Benghazi hospital."
"We appeal to the Libyan authorities to show clemency and to release the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor."

"Convening of the Intergovernmental Conference: opinion of the European Parliament (vote)"
"- Report: Leinen"
"- Before the vote"
"rapporteur. - (DE) Mr President, in this opinion we have given the green light to convene the Intergovernmental Conference."
"We had a very tight deadline for producing the report and holding consultations."
"There was no alternative, although there has been criticism from some members."
"There are two minority opinions appended to the opinion: one from Marco Cappato and the other from Bernard Wojciechowski, but as I said, time was limited."
"Exceptional circumstances require an extra degree of flexibility, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of my committee for their willingness to make constructive contributions, for the discussions on the proposal and for giving their approval on Monday evening."
"We have respected the rules of procedure and so can vote today."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Leinen for having emphasised the presence of the minority opinions."
"Rule 2 of our Rules of Procedure states that we shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate."
"This applies with regard to issues and, in my view, also to methods."
"A system whereby, in connection with a decision that will have consequences for the next few years or decades, we have had one and a half hours in which to table amendments to the original versions, and not even that amount of time in committee, is a sort of binding mandate not to be debated, which Parliament has received on this highly important issue."
"This is not just a formality: since this Parliament's opinion is mandatory, we could have used such an obligation to have a positive influence on decisions during the opening of this intergovernmental conference."
"Instead, we ourselves abdicated from doing so, and also abdicated from being a Parliament and exercising the powers available to us."
"This is the reason for the minority opinion."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 1"
"(DE) Mr President, since several Members addressed me before the vote, I would like to use this opportunity to stress once again that the proposal to include the question of representation for the European Parliament in the Intergovernmental Conference mandate was supported by many Members of this House."
"So, if this is a signal you want to send, here is an opportunity to do so."

"Mr President, the Commission would like to make the following declaration before the vote."
"'The Commission hopes that it will be possible today to find an acceptable compromise in all the institutions on account of the importance of adopting a civil justice financial programme as soon as possible."
"We are already late."
"If an acceptable solution is not found today, it is clear that the civil justice programme will not be adopted in time to be executed in 2007, with very negative consequences."
"Without this financial programme, the Commission will not be able to support associations or other actors from civil society, or the studies and projects that are fundamental to the development of the civil justice policies."
"The Commission could support the compromise set out in amendment 2, which adds a recital to the Council's common position specifying the right of Parliament to be informed in accordance with Article 7(3) of Decision 1999/468/EC and, more particularly, to receive the draft annual programme relating to the civil justice financial programme when it is submitted to the management committee."
"Parliament should also receive the results of voting and a summary record of the meeting of the management committee."
"The Commission, moreover, confirms its commitment to transmit directly to the chair of the competent parliamentary committee - the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs - the draft annual programme, and to inform Parliament without delay about any modification being made to it."
"Finally, the Commission confirms, as firmly stated in the letters addressed by Vice-President Frattini to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, its availability to attend the competent parliamentary committee upon its request, in order to provide its members with all necessary information on the draft annual programme'."

"As one of the groups has requested a roll call vote, I would like to inform them that voting against it will not change the fact that this text remains in the report, but that it will be in a different, less suitable place."
"For this reason I ask you to vote in favour of Amendment 12."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 3"
", rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, One further clarification: just because we are now voting separately on paragraphs 3 and 4, that does not mean the amendments announced by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality will be excluded."
"That text will be inserted elsewhere, in the form of Amendments 20 and 21."
"They are therefore not being deleted from the report, but simply changing position."
"- Before the vote on paragraph 4"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although I have heard the explanation given by the rapporteur, I would like to say that if we adopt paragraph 4, on which we are about to vote, we ought to bear in mind that the text of Amendment 21 is exactly the same as that of paragraph 4."
"So if we act in this way, we will have the same text twice in the report."
"If we wish to change the text, we ought to reject the first paragraph and then approve the amendment."
"(ES) Mr Protasiewicz, please clear up Mr Cocilovo's doubts."
", rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, Mr Cocilovo is right."
"Voting against the deletion of paragraph 3 and paragraph 4 means that if a vote is held on Amendments 20 and 21, we will simply be covering the same ground."
"For this reason I would ask this House that now we vote against, and then vote in favour of Amendments 20 and 21, which means that the text itself will remain the same, but it will only be moved to a more suitable place in the report."
"- Before the vote on Amendment 37"

"So the purpose of this is to remove the ambiguity."
"I am sorry that there was not time to clear this with all political groups, but I hope that they will support it because it is not trying to change the text."
"It is merely trying to clarify and remove the ambiguity."

"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am pleased to present the second ever report of the European Parliament in response to the Annual Report of the European Commission on the Eurozone."
"The Commission's report presents the economic situation in the Eurozone in 2007."
"The results of the report are cause for satisfaction."
"The economic growth rate in the Eurozone rose to 2.7%, which is the best result since 2000, whilst unemployment fell to 7.6%, the lowest in 15 years."
"At the same time the Eurozone has become an increasing factor in stabilising the world economy."
"This generally optimistic picture, however, should not conceal some negatives, and these are what we focus on in our report."
"Firstly, the rate of fiscal adaptation, particularly in countries with large budget deficits, is too slow, bearing in mind that the stability and growth pact obliges Member States to maintain as balanced a budget as possible in the medium term."
"That involves building up a budget surplus in good times to have a financial reserve for times of recession."
"In this context we are critical of the behaviour of some Member States who are not making use of the current period of growth to implement the necessary cuts in public spending."
"Secondly, Parliament points out that the good average results for the whole of the Eurozone cover up substantial differences in the economic situation from one Member State to another."
"Of particular concern is the declining international competitiveness of some countries' economies, most frequently due to wage rises in excess of the increase in productivity."
"Thirdly, we call for a continuation of the structural reforms required by the guidelines of the new Lisbon Strategy."
"We have to increase the speed at which the remaining barriers in the markets for goods and services are removed, and help further integration of the labour and financial markets, which will become an important element in the proper functioning of the Eurozone."
"We would like in particular to draw attention to the speedy implementation of the services directive, which has brought accelerated growth in labour productivity and cut inflation in the services sector."
"This is particularly important, as services make up 70% of the GDP in the Eurozone."
"Fourthly, Parliament stresses the importance of further extending the Eurozone to strengthen economic and monetary union and the common currency."
"We are pleased at the decision to accept Cyprus and Malta into the Eurozone, and look forward to other states joining it in the not too distant future."
"We would like to point out that the process for ascertaining the readiness of countries applying for the Eurozone should be transparent and based on uniform criteria, whose economic rationale and political importance should be in no doubt."
"In this regard we call upon the Commission and the Council to start a serious debate on the nominal convergence criteria."
"Finally, I would like to emphasise the importance of good governance and intensified policy coordination in the Eurozone."
"We need this if we are to make full use of the opportunities provided by the common currency."
"I am pleased at the decision taken by the Euro group in April this year to adopt benchmarks for the fiscal policies of Member States."
"We expect the implementation of these decisions to be closely monitored."
"I would like to take this opportunity to assure Mr Juncker that in this matter he has the full support of Parliament."
"I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Almunia on preparing the Commission's second report on the economic situation in the Eurozone and express the wish that the reports prepared in coming years bring just as good news as this one."
"rapporteur. - Mr President, I am happy for this report to be debated jointly with the report on the eurozone."
"I would add that the report I am presenting was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"Starting with the economic situation, in 2006 the economic recovery in the eurozone became a self-sustaining process with domestic demand acting as the main driver."
"Two million jobs were created in 2006 and unemployment fell from 8.4% to 7.6%."
"In the context of this recovery, I would like to stress the main points of the report."
"Against the background of the recent recovery, any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth."
"It is crucial that wages increase in line with productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment."
"Fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth."
"The report observes that small economies have performed better than large economies since the creation of the eurozone in terms of growth, with notably Ireland, Finland, Greece, Luxembourg and Spain achieving a higher average growth rate than the eurozone average and we say that lessons might be drawn from such developments."
"The report expresses concern about the ongoing appreciation of the euro against most major European currencies."
"Article 111 of the Treaty assigns responsibility for exchange rate policy to the Council but without specifying how this responsibility should be exercised."
"The report calls on the Eurogroup, the Council and the ECB to exercise their respective powers and responsibilities in full coordination."
"The report also calls on the ECB to monitor closely developments in the use of the euro as a reserve currency for central banks and, in the context of its annual report on the international role of the euro, to quantify and analyse the effects of this, particularly as regards exchange rates."
"Mr Trichet will be aware that every time he has appeared at Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee during the last two years I have raised with him the issue of house prices."
"This remains a concern of mine."
"Therefore, the report calls for the ECB to monitor closely these developments, which have the potential to have consequences for the real economy."
"The report contains a request that the ECB present ways forward with their respective advantages, such as including real estate in the harmonised index of consumer prices or devising a specific type of indicator or suggesting specific measures to be taken at national level due to heterogeneities among the national markets."
"I refer later on to the Fed formula."
"Perhaps it is time to develop an ECB formula to help forecast the likely effect of interest rate increases on house prices."
"My report also raises the issue of sub-prime lending and suggests that lessons can be learned in the EU from the potential difficulties for the US economy of sub-prime lending."
"I would like to take a moment to address an issue of particular concern to Ireland but which has potential interest for other eurozone members."
"Last year in Ireland house prices were forecast to increase by 9% by estate agents Hook and McDonald, by between 8% and 10% by Sherry Fitzgerald and by 7% by Friends First and IIB, while Allied Irish Banks forecast an increase of between 3% and 6%."
"The recent Irish Permanent tsb/ESRI index shows in fact that house prices fell by 2.1% between January and May 2007 and a further decline in Ireland is expected."
"Sub-prime lending - that is lending to poorer people, those with an irregular income stream or difficult history of meeting loans - is projected to grow to EUR 4 billion in Ireland this year."
"If the average loan was between EUR 200 000 and EUR 400 000, then between 10 000 and 20 000 such loans exist in Ireland alone."
"Sub-prime lenders are relatively new to the Irish market and generally charge about twice the going mortgage rate to 'compensate' - as they put it - lenders for higher risk."
"In one case a mortgage company operating in Ireland since 2005 has already repossessed 30 homes."
"There are also signs of concern in Britain about sub-prime lending."
"It has been known for some time that there is a Fed formula in the United States."
"The Fed formula devised by the US Federal Reserve, according to one of its former economists, shows that typically, when house prices have been driven up for several years by low interest rates, when interest rates increase, prices begin to decline roughly 18 months to 2 years later."
"I believe that the ECB should follow this formula and develop an ECB formula because, at present, we are leaving it to people who are involved in the industry to make the forecasts, and they are the people - the financial institutions and others - who have most to gain."
"The report urges the Commission to assess the quality of supervision and offshore location of hedge funds."
"It reiterates points made in the past about democratic scrutiny and the need to publish summary minutes."
"It draws attention to the fact that overdraft rates in the euro area vary from 7% to 13.5% and asks that the ECB evaluate this."
"It ends by saying that the number of banknotes in circulation stood at 11.3 billion with a value of EUR 628.2 billion last year, but that it is concerned about the growth in the number of 50 euro, 100 euro and 500 euro banknotes."
"500 euro banknotes alone have increased by 13.2%."
"My report, with the support of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, raises the possibility of criminal activities in the use of these large banknotes and says that it requires further examination by the ECB."
"I hope Mr Trichet will be in a position to respond to this report and, in particular - not today, but perhaps over a certain period - to consider my suggestion about an ECB formula to equate with the Fed formula so that there can be a true and accurate measure of the likely knock-on effect of interest rate increases on house prices in the Member States of the eurozone."
"President of Eurogroup. - (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Central Bank, Madam President of the committee, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen,"
"We, in Europe, have replaced the fundamental debate with simple words."
"We are invited to Parliament - I hardly ever see it - to the plenary, as it is called, and we talk, I note, of the everyday living conditions of Europeans, something that undoubtedly enhances the credibility of our institutions."
"European newspapers, especially this week's, report the words that were supposedly exchanged, during a recent Eurogroup, with an evening visitor whom we had the pleasure of hosting."
"I have read a summary of these long debates in editorials that take up scarcely 25 lines, and we complain that Europeans are poorly informed of what is really going on in Europe!"
"So be it."
