"Text"
"We fought a very bitter referendum campaign."
"We won that narrowly."
"We had public opinion against the European Union for quite some time."
"We are now, if you look at the public opinion polls, one of the more Euro-positive countries in Europe."
"It took political leadership to achieve that."
"It does not happen by itself."
"Let me also say, when we go to the more difficult areas of Europe, that reconciliation is not easy."
"That requires a lot of that leadership, and reconciliation has yet to be fully achieved in all parts of Europe."
"The western Balkans were taken up by a number of speakers, and rightly so."
"Let me assure you that we are aware of the issues of Kosovo, and of the need to move forward with them, taking some of the issues that we have inside our Union into account as well."
"Bosnia has been taken up by several people, such as Mrs Pack and Mr Swoboda, and let me just make a couple of remarks there."
"I have spent four full days this year engaging with the political leadership of Bosnia, trying to move them forward and trying to tell them the dangers of slipping behind when the rest of the region is moving ahead."
"I have probably done too much because at the end of the day, as Mrs Pack said, they have to do this by themselves."
"It is their country, not our country, but we also have the duty to tell them that, if they do not do it, the rest of the region will move ahead and that will not be good for their country. That is what we have been trying to do, and to a certain extent are still trying to do."
"Our process of enlargement, as everyone has been pointing out, is performance-based."
"It requires reforms."
"It requires reconciliation."
"And that applies to each and every one."
"It did apply to Sweden once upon a time, and we managed."
"It applies to each and every one."
"As to the gentleman who was interested in engaging in debate, I did notice that there were a number of - mainly - gentlemen from the Far Right up there who had their reservations on Turkey, to put it in the mildest possible terms."
"If I understood the argument, it was that Turkey is too large, too complicated and too Muslim."
"If you read Article 49 of the treaty, and that is what we have to base our policies on, it does not make any exceptions for big countries, it does not make any exceptions for complicated cases, and it has no religious criteria."
"(Applause from the centre left)"
"So that is what we have to abide by."
"I listened to the moving words on the Christian heritage, and there is much truth in that."
"All the Catholics and Orthodox or Protestants and Anglicans might interpret that in very different ways, but I would caution against defining the Jewish heritage out of Europe."
"They are not Christians, but they are, with all of the problems in our history, also part of our Europe of the past, the present and the future."
"I would also argue that it would equally be a mistake to define citizens of Muslim faith, be they inside our existing Member States, be they in Bosnia, be they somewhere else or be they in Turkey, and exclude them from the applicability of Article 49 of the treaty."
"I think that would be a mistake."
"(Applause from the centre left)"
"I listened with interest in that respect to Mrs Koppa representing Greece in her comments on both the challenges in the western Balkans and reconciliation with Turkey, and I have noted the steps and statements made by Prime Minister Papandreou lately."
"Could I just finally pick up one of my favourite items."
"Someone mentioned, as sometimes happens in this debate, the question of absorption capacity - that we simply cannot absorb too many countries."
"I do not like the word."
"I do not see our Union as 'absorbing' nations."
"I do not know if we have absorbed Britain."
"And I do not know if France wants to be absorbed."
"And I hope Sweden will never be absorbed."
"I see our Union as enriching the countries when we enter, and I have yet to see an enlargement that has made our Union weaker."
"Every single enlargement, although it has been difficult, has made our Union stronger, has made it richer, has made it more ambitious, and I for one do not belong to those who believe that history has come to an end."
"Article 49 applies."
"Finally, one of the gentlemen said there are other countries as well that we have not debated on."
"That is true."
"Article 49 applies to each and every European country, including those that have not yet been mentioned in the debate today."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank you for a very lively and substantive debate on EU enlargement and our strategy - now, next year and in the near future."
"This debate has been in line with the best democratic traditions of this Parliament, and I am grateful for the broad general endorsement of our carefully conducted enlargement policy."
"You have rightly underlined the importance of simultaneous and parallel commitment and conditionality in EU enlargement."
"I agree, and I want to underline the paramount importance of being both fair and firm at the same time."
"We have to be fair and respect the commitments we have undertaken to the countries that are covered by our consolidated enlargement agenda in south-eastern Europe, that is, the western Balkans and Turkey."
"At the same time, we can be as firm and as we are fair, and we need to apply rigorous conditionality when dealing with these candidate countries and potential candidates."
"These only work together - in tandem, in unison - and that is, indeed, the best recipe for driving reforms and democratic and economic transformation in south-eastern Europe."
"It is also the best recipe for anchoring stability in the western Balkans and driving reforms that enhance fundamental freedoms in Turkey."
"I think Mrs Flautre is right that there cannot be, by definition, a more attractive portfolio than enlargement."
"However, I am a man of moderation - believe it or not - and I believe that there are certain limits to how much attraction and fascination a man can take."
"And, as Carl requested, some work will also be left for my successor, for the next Commission and for this Parliament."
"Be that as it may, it has been great to work with you."
"Together we have made a difference."
"Let us recall that EU enlargement has greatly contributed to the fact that Europe today is whole and free."
"Let us keep it that way, and let us complete our work in south-eastern Europe."
"(Applause)"
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 November 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I believe that it is extremely important for the European Parliament to be involved in evaluating the enlargement process."
"This process has been a major success for the European Union, bringing it peace and stability."
"Against this background, we must bear in mind that the countries in the western Balkans are a part of Europe geographically, culturally and historically."
"Among the potential candidate countries referred to in the resolution, I would like to highlight the successful efforts and tangible progress made by Serbia."
"This country has gone ahead and implemented unilaterally the Interim Agreement on Trade which it signed with the EU, thereby demonstrating that it is determined to move closer to the European Union, in spite of the political and economic difficulties it is facing."
"The European Parliament must encourage Serbia to continue on its journey towards the EU."
"On this point, we must ask the Council and Commission to show openness and continue the negotiations with this country in a constructive manner."
"I believe that progress with the process of Serbia's integration into the European Union must not be subject to the recognition of Kosovo's independence."
"The stand against Turkey is a most important issue which will be discussed, within the framework of enlargement, at the European Council Summit in December."
"We support full integration, considering that this objective must constitute a driving force for reform and policy change on important issues."
"We would point out that Turkey has still not honoured its contractual obligations towards the EU and all the Member States."
"It must start to honour its commitments immediately, otherwise it will not come through evaluation in December unscathed."
"The commitments on which it will be evaluated and the timeline are contained in the conclusions dated December 2006."
"They include the application of the Additional Protocol, improved bilateral relations with and recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and a constructive stand on the procedure for resolving the Cyprus question."
"It is absurd that, while seeking integration and a regulatory role in the area, Turkey continues to infringe international law and the principles on which the EU is founded by maintaining occupying troops in a Member State."
"Finally, the energy chapter cannot be opened as long as Turkey prevents the Republic of Cyprus from exercising its sovereign rights in its exclusive economic zone."
"The EU is like a building under construction and therefore, the notion of halting its enlargement would run counter to the very principle it is based on."
"According to Article 49 of the EU Treaty: 'Any European State... may apply to become a member of the Union'."
"This is precisely why the Enlargement Strategy for the western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland is receiving increased attention as part of our activities."
"I unreservedly support this close interest."
"Croatia, Turkey and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have candidate status, having embarked in a responsible manner on the road to integration."
"Iceland, Montenegro and Albania have applied for accession, with the first two currently being evaluated by the Commission."
"There are certainly problems still to overcome, such as corruption, crime or freedom of the media."
"The introduction of the visa-free scheme in Serbia, Montenegro and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, starting on 19 December, will give this process significant impetus."
"However, I also want to draw your attention to the fact that when we are talking about enlargement, we must also look at the Republic of Moldova, which is currently going through a crucial political period, in terms of embarking on the road to democracy and EU accession."
"With this in mind, we must support the implementation of the objectives of the European Strategy for the Republic of Moldova 2007-2013 in order to achieve the results desired by both sides."
"in writing. - I would like to make three observations."
"First, I am glad that Foreign Minister Carl Bildt pointed out the most important message of the Albertini resolution - that the EU remains strongly committed to the enlargement policy and views it as one of the most successful EU policies."
"This is very much due to the excellent work of Commissioner Rehn."
"The second important message is that the rule of law is seen as a key principle of democratic progress and one of the main conditions for further accessions."
"We should also remain clear about the relevance of the Copenhagen criteria."
"The third observation: I strongly suggest that the opening of the accession negotiations with Macedonia be decided by the December European Council in accordance with the Commission's recommendation."
"in writing. - Iceland is already an active and long-standing partner in the wider European integration process."
"Iceland cooperates closely with EU Member States as a founding member of NATO, a member of the Council of Europe, EFTA, the OSCE and the Schengen Cooperation."
"Also, it has been estimated that Iceland has already adopted some 60% of the vast acquis communautaire."
"From this point of view, the application of Iceland for EU membership is a logical step."
"In my view, Iceland has always had a European vocation and Icelandic membership will represent a win-win situation for both sides."
"We are already learning from Iceland's experience in sustainable management of fishing resources, the use of geothermal heat and measures to fight climate change."
"Iceland has proven its determination to join the Union by submitting the answers to the Commission's questionnaire well ahead of the deadline and I look forward to the evaluation to be made at the summit in mid-December."
"If all requirements are met and the principle of own merits is respected, I hope Iceland's accession can be coupled with that of Croatia."
"in writing. - (DE) A differentiated approach to the enlargement strategy is needed."
"While Iceland is a European country which is ready for EU membership, the Balkan States are far from being ready, with the exception of Croatia."
"Unresolved problems are difficult to deal with after accession and remain unresolved for years."
"Therefore, there must be absolutely no doubts about the Balkan States' readiness for accession and wages and social conditions there must correspond to the European average."
"For years, the reports on Turkey's progress have consisted of one long list of problems."
"If Turkey were a car, it would long since have failed its MOT."
"It is true that this country is not a part of Europe either geographically or in spiritual or cultural terms."
"This is clear from its consistent disregard for human rights and freedom of speech, which the plan for the Kurds cannot disguise, and from the Cyprus issue."
"However, perhaps the EU also wants to deviate from its human rights standards."
"This is the only way in which its obeisance to the Beneš decrees can be explained."
"Turkey regards itself as the supreme power of the Turkic peoples."
"As a result, the EU's problems would only increase following Turkey's accession, as its actions have repeatedly made clear."
"The positive aspects, such as an improvement in energy security, can also be achieved by means of a privileged partnership."
"It is high time that we began speaking honestly and clearly."
"in writing. - (HU) As an MEP from Hungary, a country neighbouring the Western Balkan region, I wholeheartedly support the Western Balkan countries' ambitions to join the EU."
"An important step in this area has been the initiative implemented by the European Commission, removing the visa requirement for Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro from 1 January 2010."
"However, the European Parliament's proposal, which would remove the visa requirement as early as by 19 December, would be of symbolic significance and also provide practical benefits."
"The European Union could hardly offer a better Christmas present than visa-free travel to Hungarians living in Vojvodina in Serbia with numerous links to Hungary, benefiting families and friends living on either side of the border."
"I am confident that Member States will give their blessing to this decision this very month."
"The visa waiver is a positive response to the Western Balkan countries' genuine efforts towards European integration."
"Serbia has made particularly significant progress recently."
"Even the report issued recently by the Commission states that the new government of Prime Minister Mirko Cvetković has successfully taken on the fight against corruption, not to mention the extremely important advances that have been made in the area of minority rights."
"The Serbian Parliament has adopted a law on national councils."
"In the wake of encouraging preliminary discussions, a decision on Vojvodina's status will come before the Serbian Parliament next week."
"Apart from the many positive developments, efforts must continue to be made to eradicate ethnically incited violent crimes and the ever-increasing incidence of beatings against Hungarians from Vojvodina completely."
"I would like to thank Mr Albertini for the resolution on the European Commission's enlargement strategy."
"Of course, I agree that candidate countries must continue the process of reform."
"Efforts should concentrate on ensuring the rule of law and equal treatment of ethnic minorities, as well as fighting corruption and organised crime."
"The evaluation of the political situation in Turkey, including reforms which are planned or have been carried out, repeats the Commission's evaluation contained in the Regular Report."
"Progress is evident in the area of meeting the Copenhagen political criteria, but unfortunately, much remains to be done in the broadly-understood category of citizens' freedoms."
"However, most important of all is that bilateral disputes be resolved by involvement of the parties."
"These things should not, on their own, be obstacles on the road to accession, but the EU should strive for their resolution before accession."
"The European Parliament should be an objective observer, because we would like the negotiations to end with agreement, which would facilitate Turkey's accession to the EU."
"As a citizen of Poland, a country which joined the European Union in 2004, I know that the enlargement strategy is one of the most effective areas of EU policy."
"It is crucial to keep to commitments which have been made, and that also applies to the European Union."
"The objective of accession negotiations is full membership, and therefore fulfilling tough but clear conditions should also be a basic prerequisite for them to achieve this objective."
"This applies to all states, including Turkey."
"Our resolution on future enlargements must reflect the prevailing opinion in Europe."
"We must avoid repeating past mistakes and build Europe with its peoples."
"The decisions to be taken are laden with commitments and must be prepared well and explained well so that the majority of European citizens can support them."
"Our Parliament, which represents these citizens, must be particularly vigilant about this."
"Haste would be the worst possible policy and could take us back to institutional instability, even though the European Union is just about leaving it behind with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Today we must test the new institutional mechanism resulting from the Treaty of Lisbon, build a political Europe and consolidate the policies that our fellow citizens want in terms of employment, the economic recovery, the fight against climate change, security of energy supply and common defence."
"We should not reverse the priorities but rather increase the consistency and the effectiveness of Community policies before we aim for new EU enlargements."
"Lastly, I am still opposed to Turkey's accession to the European Union and I continue to hope for a privileged partnership with that country within the Union for the Mediterranean."
"Elimination of violence against women (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Council on the International Day for the elimination of violence against women by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0220/2009),"
"the oral question to the Commission on the International Day for the elimination of violence against women by Mrs Svensson, on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality - B7-0220/2009)."
"I would remind you that today is the International Day for the elimination of violence against women, and the opportunity to hold this debate is particularly important to us."
"Madam President, today is 25 November, which marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment by the UN of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"Throughout my adult life, I have been politically active in women's organisations and in networks for combating this violence against women."
"During my work, I think I have used every possible word to describe the situation."
"I think I have used very many words - we have done so together in this fight."
"Now I feel that we actually need to see some concrete action."
"This is a type of violence that robs women of their human rights."
"It affects and defines women's everyday lives."
"It is a type of violence that determines the course of the lives and the situations of women and young girls."
"We all have a responsibility to break the silence and, within Parliament and outside, to cooperate with all of the forces for good to stop this violence."
"It includes violence within intimate relationships, sexual harassment, physical and mental abuse, rape, murder, the sex slave trade and female genital mutilation."
"During wars and armed conflicts and during the reconstruction following conflicts, women are subjected to violence to a greater extent, both as individuals and collectively."
"Some people claim that violence within intimate relationships is a private matter, a family matter."
"That is not the case."
"It is structural violence and a social issue."
"Society must take responsibility for stopping this violence."
"It is a structural and widespread problem in all regions, countries and continents."
"Putting a stop to all forms of gender-based violence is a fundamental element of a society of equality."
"Male violence against women is, in my view, a clear indication of the unequal power relationship between men and women."
"At the same time, it helps to maintain this power order."
"The work to stop the violence of men towards women and children needs to be based on the realisation that it is about power, control, ideas about gender and sexuality and a prevailing societal structure in which men are considered superior to women."
"Male violence against women is a clear indication of the unequal power relationship between women and men."
"This is a public health problem."
"It is a social problem, which - quite apart from all the personal suffering - involves huge costs for society."
"However, it is, above all, an equality problem."
"We therefore need to tackle the problem of violence against women from an equality perspective."
"It also means that the EU has the power to take action, and it is this action by the EU that I and my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality are calling for."
"Within the EU, we have the Daphne Programme, which provides a certain amount of economic assistance to various initiatives to combat violence."
"That is good and it is necessary, but it is far from sufficient."
"Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality is therefore asking the Commission and the Council whether there are plans for the Member States to draw up national action plans to tackle violence against women."
"Is the Commission planning to table proposals for guidelines for a more coherent EU strategy, and will the Council support this?"
"Existing treaty provisions contain an obligation to work towards equality between women and men."
"When does the Commission intend to organise a European Year against Violence against Women? That is something that Parliament has repeatedly called for since 1997."
"It should be time for this now!"
"Madam President, on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the Commission would like to reiterate its strong political commitment to combat violence against women."
"This commitment is reflected in the communication on the Stockholm Programme, the priorities of which include the need to pay special attention to the rights of the child and to the protection of people who are particularly vulnerable, such as female victims of violence and the elderly."
"With its road map for equality between women and men for the period 2006-2010, the European Commission made a commitment to help eradicate sexual violence and violence linked to the trafficking in human beings."
"Combating violence against women will also be an important priority of the new strategy, which will follow the road map and which is currently being drafted."
"However, it is also vitally important to finance practical measures on the ground."
"The Commission has already done a great deal to help combat violence in Europe through the Daphne Programme."
"Its response in the fields of violence prevention and victim support must now be enhanced by means of more practical measures."
"Firstly, the Commission has identified measures within the context of the Daphne III Programme in order to implement a more consistent EU strategy for combating violence against children, young people and women."
"Thanks to an annual budget of approximately EUR 17 million in 2009, the Commission targeted the at-risk groups directly."
"These funds were in addition to the aid provided by the national programmes."
"The creation of an expert review group is envisaged as part of the Daphne III work programme for 2010."
"This group will be able to help identify necessary measures at Community level and encourage a common approach among the Member States."
"The Commission will also start work on an important feasibility study that will assess whether it is possible and necessary to harmonise legislation on sexual violence and violence against children at EU level."
"The results of this study will be presented in autumn 2010."
"The Commission intends to bring together representatives of the Member States' governments, of Community institutions, of political groups, of civil society organisations, of international organisations, and so on, with the aim of drafting a more explicit Community policy."
"Furthermore, the exchange of best practices, standards and intervention models has already been the subject of discussions organised in December 2007, under the auspices of the European Crime Prevention Network."
"Lastly, it is important to stress that extreme forms of violence against women must be combated with the harshest of instruments."
"To this end, the Commission proposed, in March, a change to the European criminal framework relating to the fight against trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children, which affects the most vulnerable women and girls in particular."
"With regard to the request to organise a European day on violence against women, on the basis of an in-depth study, the Commission has concluded that it would be premature to take such an initiative before a genuine strategy to combat violence has been drafted."
"I would now like to give the floor to my colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner."
"Madam President, honourable Members, as you are all aware, I have always - obviously as a woman myself - been involved in the fight against violence against women, but also in the matter of the empowerment of women in general, not just in the last five years of my term as Commissioner for Foreign Affairs, but prior to that as a minister."
"This is why I would like to add a few words on this point."
"As far as the outside world is concerned, beyond specific interventions in developing countries, about which my colleague will speak a little later, the fight against violence against women has become an important focal point in the EU's human rights policy, and the action is reinforced by the specific guidelines adopted in December 2008."
"The implementation of these guidelines is particularly pronounced at local level in third countries where the European Union is present."
"In around 90 third countries the embassies of EU Member States and the delegations of the European Commission have developed their own action plans, which aim to implement these guidelines and set out a whole list of initiatives to be carried out in the period 2009-2010."
"We are systematically sending out a clear message on this: the violation of women's rights cannot be justified in the name of cultural relativism or traditions."
"In the context of these talks, we will also offer assistance in the form of our cooperation in order, for example, to implement the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, to strengthen the national institutions in charge of matters of gender equality or indeed to support changes in legislation that provides for discrimination against women."
"The subject 'Women, peace and security', which is what Resolutions 1325 and 1820 of the Security Council of the United Nations are about, has captured our full attention."
"Moreover, in December 2008, the European Union also adopted a global approach for the implementation of these resolutions."
"This, I believe, provides a base of common principles, both for operations concerning European security and defence policy and for interventions involving the use of Community instruments."
"These activities should enable us to integrate the 'female' dimension more effectively in the whole cycle of conflict, from the prevention, management and resolution of crises to the consolidation of peace and long-term reconstruction."
"Personally, I have sought support from 40 leading women throughout the world to give new impetus to the implementation of Resolution 1325 by proposing, as you know, the organisation of a ministerial conference 10 years after its historic adoption."
"This idea has been approved by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and I am very proud of that."
"What is perhaps even more remarkable, however, is the fact that, in preparation for this ministerial conference, a growing number of states and international organisations, such as the African Union, have decided to step up their efforts to promote Resolution 1325, notably through the development of national action plans."
"Madam President, I would like to finish on a personal note."
"I value greatly the possibilities that EU policies, whether internal or external, have offered the fight against violence against women, and I am delighted with the support they have received in general."
"I am very happy to see that action which, in the past, was often somewhat limited to a personal commitment is now becoming a completely joint effort."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the elimination of violence against women is a very important topic that requires a greater effort and commitment by all of us: European institutions, Member States and civil society."
"Violence against women not only represents a violation of human rights but also gives rise to serious individual and social consequences that cannot be ignored."
"It is therefore a topic that must be tackled on different fronts."
"On the cultural front, we must fight the idea that there can ever be any justification for violence based on cultural, religious or social aspects."
"We must organise information and awareness campaigns that also reach out to young people and thus take place within schools."
"The organisation of a European Year, called for several times by the European Parliament, could have the right amount of European and international impact to build a more consistent and effective policy."
"On the political front, it is essential to include this subject as a priority on national, European and international agendas."
"I therefore believe it is appropriate to forge stronger bonds - and I am about to finish - between the European Union and the United Nations so that we can all work together in the same direction."
"In this respect, the address by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mrs Migiro, at the European Parliament was exemplary."
"It is therefore my wish for all of us that our cooperation will grow ever stronger."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today - 25 November - women and men all around the world are marking the UN's International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"Violence against women is a major social issue that cannot simply be reduced to a women's issue."
"Rather it concerns the violation of human rights, the right to life and the right to safety."
"The UN estimates that seven in ten women will experience violence from men during their lifetime."
"In fact, violence by men costs more women's lives than malaria, traffic accidents, terrorism and war combined."
"We cannot simply remain passive spectators."
"It is essential that we in the EU take action NOW."
"The Commission must submit a plan as soon as possible for an EU policy to combat all forms of violence against women."
"If we look at the initiatives taken by the various Member States, it is quite clear that some countries take the problem more seriously than others."
"Spain, which takes over the presidency of the Council on 1 January, has put combating violence against women at the top of the agenda for its presidency."
"Spain is the only Member State of the EU to have established an observatory on violence which each year submits a report on the development of gender-related violence and regularly updates its best conceivable strategy for combating such violence."
"Let us support the forthcoming Spanish Presidency's initiative to get an observatory on violence established in the EU for the benefit of all European women."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, it is not only because of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women that, when we consider a resolution on this matter, we should ask whether we have done enough."
"In Europe today, one in four women is a victim of violence, domestic abuse, rape, sexual exploitation, or female genital mutilation."
"One of the most horrific examples of gender-based violence is when rape is used during war as a weapon, as is the case in Congo."
"It is time for a comprehensive EU strategy leading to a concrete action plan aimed at fighting all forms of violence against women, including trafficking in women."
"Commissioner, I would like to inform you that we have today voted, during the resolution on the Stockholm Programme on an amendment which requests a directive, a European action plan, on violence against women ensuring the prevention of violence, the protection of victims and the prosecution of perpetrators."
"I hope that this time our colleagues, you, and also the Council, will not quote the subsidiarity principle, and that very soon we will see this directive and action plan in place."
"We have also brought this issue to the Spanish Presidency which is very much in favour of such a priority."
"I hope this will be priority for all of us."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, it is indeed necessary to establish a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women."
"I also urge the Council and the Commission to take a decision on the full communitarisation of the European policy."
"None of the EU's Member States are succeeding in addressing these problems on their own."
"Zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women must become a top priority of all institutions throughout Europe."
"Parliament's demand to the Council and the Commission for a targeted and more coherent EU policy plan to combat all forms of violence against women is a step in the right direction, as is the observatory on violence that has already been mentioned."
"Furthermore, I wish also to remind the Commission and the Council of my request on addressing violence against women in the gender-related dimension of human rights violations internationally, in particular, in the context of the bilateral association and international trade agreements in force and those under negotiation, as is also established in my report on feminicides, I also wish to ask the Commissioner if she can be a bit more concrete about this."
"Let me just finish by welcoming the presence in the gallery of our friends from the Congolese Association for Peace and Justice."
"They have given us these flowers in order to remind us every day that this is a common fight that we have to fight together and also with the people who are suffering and fighting in the field on this matter."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, violence against women, especially in the domestic environment, is an issue that needs to be debated and I congratulate the Chair of the FEMM Committee for bringing it to the forefront."
"We need, however, to recognise this issue is not only a gender issue."
"It is not only an equality issue."
"Indeed, it is not only a human rights issue, but is a criminal law issue in the first instance."
"And, because it is a criminal law issue, it is a sovereign state matter, and it is up to the nation state to lead."
"According to the Council of Europe, one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime."
"The EU can be proactive in this area by providing resources for education and increased awareness and by opening up the debate on violence against not only women but also against men: according to the UK Home Office, one in six men will suffer domestic violence."
"I recently visited Elevate, a women's refuge in London, to talk to victims of domestic violence."
"They are from all socio-economic groups."
"There is no such thing as a stereotype."
"Violence affects the victim, their families and children."
"Its effects are both insular and outgoing and destroy lives."
"The road to rebuilding these lives is long and needs support."
"Elevate's project offers victims a safe haven and supports them in rebuilding their confidence and ability to function in society."
"Projects like this need support, and need financial support."
"The EU can be proactive by breaking down some of the taboos around violence against women - and men."
"It is an area which we as a society can no longer afford to ignore."
"(NL) Mrs Svensson has tabled an oral question about violence against women and submitted a draft resolution."
"In it, she argues that violence against women is a structural and widespread problem across the whole of Europe and that it arises out of inequality between men and women."
"Although the Dutch Party for Freedom is unable to join action against this problem at a European level, we are nonetheless in favour of these proposals and urge the Member States to take integrated action at an individual level."
"The Party for Freedom condemns, in the strongest possible terms, any violence against women."
"However, there is much violence being perpetrated in Europe against Muslim women, particularly within the domestic environment."
"We therefore also need to consider cases of domestic violence, crimes of honour and female genital mutilation which stem from the Muslim vision of the roles of men and women."
"Although the Party for Freedom finds all violence against women utterly objectionable, we would like to draw attention here to this particular form of violence."
"Let me stress again: this is totally unacceptable."
"For this reason, my party wishes to issue a strong call to Member States to combat these forms of violence and take specific action to investigate Muslim-related violence against women."
"(HU) Minister, Commissioners, I, too, would like to recall what the minister said: violence has no place in civilised societies."
"We are commemorating the tenth anniversary of the resolution passed by the UN to combat violence against women."
"As I was listening to your speeches and those of fellow Members, I was wondering whether in 10 or 20 years' time, our successors will still be saying in this House that violence has no place in civilised societies."
"It is true that time is not on our side as we witness the increase in aggression in our societies."
"The media's influence has something to do with this growth, but it is growing during the crisis as well."
"Psychologists say that aggression is much more prevalent during the crisis than at other times."
"Violence against women is certainly a problem, but we are also having the problem, as male fellow Members are often saying, that men are being affected by violence too."
"Unfortunately, the statistics still indicate that 95% of victims are women."
"In the case of human trafficking, 80% of victims are also women."
"I do believe that this really is now the time for European institutions to deal with this problem more seriously."
"(ES) Mr President, today, millions of individuals and millions of women the world over are shouting out against gender violence."
"Today, we cannot turn a blind eye to this major social scourge exemplifying power relationships that have been unequal throughout history."
"There can be no reason, no argument and no scope for understanding."
"Some women are murdered simply because they are women."
"Faced with this state of affairs, we have the responsibility of using all the means at our disposal to eliminate gender violence, and to move forward and create a more equal society, by way of brave and determined legal measures."
"This responsibility is incumbent on all of us, the European institutions, the Member States and organisations."
"Countries such as Spain have made a clear commitment in this regard."
"The law against gender violence is a necessary and essential instrument."
"It should therefore serve as an example to the rest of Europe."
"I could also mention education for equality, combating stereotypes and legal aid for victims."
"I am sure we could refer to many other necessary policies in this area."
"The incoming Spanish Presidency has named the fight against gender violence as one of its priority objectives."
"I believe this is very important and trust that the House will strongly support each and every one of the initiatives in that regard."
"We must make a joint effort and work together."
"Only then will we be able to support the millions of female victims who cannot afford to wait a single minute longer."
"(RO) As has already been emphasised in this Chamber, violence against women is really an extremely serious issue to which we do not always devote the appropriate attention."
"This problem is at an appalling level in developing countries, especially in countries ravaged by wars and conflicts."
"Rape and sexual violence against girls, women and children have reached epidemic proportions in African countries riven by wars, in particular, the Congo, Somalia, Burundi and Liberia."
"Unfortunately, the huge incidence of violent acts is not only typical of countries in conflict."
"This is also evident on a large scale even in the most peaceful and democratic countries in the world."
"It is our duty to focus our attention and efforts on punishing those who are guilty of violating human rights, while also making efforts to improve women's safety and ensure that appropriate assistance is given to victims of sexual aggression, ranging from medical aid to their reintegration into their family and society."
"Finally, I would like to remind you of the events which took place as part of the development committee devoted to the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and also thank Commissioner De Gucht for attending these events and for the interest he has shown in this matter, as well as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for her attendance at this debate."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dedicate this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist and a woman who paid for her love of truth with her life, to the African women in conflicts, and to the many forms of suffering of women in Europe that often go unobserved."
"These examples are at odds with the degraded and consumerist image that the media often attaches to female identity, helping to create a culture where women are oppressed and humiliated."
"This is also a serious form of violence against which Europe must speak out and intervene in."
"We must urgently set up a consistent European system for statistical recording - it has been said more than once - with particular reference to minors, trafficking, physical and sexual violence, and women in vulnerable categories, such as immigrants."
"Yet we would also like to see tangible results from the European Union guidelines on women in armed conflict, which the Commissioner also mentioned previously, at least through the provision of financial and other support for projects, often organised by small associations, local NGOs, including in countries concerned with reintegrating and assisting women who are victims of violence."
"We are aware that today, we have a new possibility, as offered by the Treaty of Lisbon and the Stockholm Programme, to enshrine this preventive action within the Community."
"However, we must also denounce another aspect of violence: the context in which violence takes place."
"Alcohol- and drug-related violence is growing among young people and minors, and perhaps we do not mention this often enough when we discuss violence against women."
"(PL) Mr President, millions of women are beaten, molested, bought, sold, raped and killed only because they are women."
"More women die from the aggression directed against them than die from cancer."
"We must make public opinion understand that in a modern, democratic society, there is no place for violence against women."
"Let us begin by educating the political class and freeing politics from the influences of those religions which sanction the domination of men."
"This is an essential condition for real equality and ending violence."
"In my country, the conservative right, which is under the thumb of the clergy, refuses to grant women full human rights."
"They promote a patriarchal family, in which the woman's role revolves around kitchen, cradle and church."
"Women do not have the right to an abortion, and there are plans to deprive them of their right to in vitro fertilisation."
"The idealised 'Polish Mother' bravely bearing her cross in the form of a wife-beating husband is an absurdity which must be opposed socially and legally."
"I would like to extend a warm invitation to a conference on eliminating violence against women to be held on 10 December in the European Parliament, organised at the initiative of the Women's Rights Centre in Poland."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, every day in Europe, one in five women is a victim of violence."
"Violence against women is unacceptable, irrespective of the form it takes."
"Yet, in Europe, many women and young girls continue to live in the shadow of aggression or exploitation."
"The figures are alarming."
"Violence against women comes in many forms and occurs everywhere: domestic violence at home, sexual abuse, sexual harassment at work, rape, including within relationships, and also as a tactic of warfare outside Europe."
"In Europe, domestic violence is the main cause of death and disability among women between the ages of 16 and 44."
"As we debate these extremely serious matters, women are being assaulted."
"Talking about it is not enough."
"It is time for action."
"The European Union has a duty to protect its most vulnerable citizens."
"Fighting violence against women is a battle for fundamental human rights, and the Daphne Programme, which supports actions aimed at combating all forms of violence, is insufficient."
"New measures must be considered for the development of consistent European plans."
"I support the initiative of organising a European Year to combat violence against women, which our institution has been calling for now for more than a decade."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to reiterate what has already been said by Mrs Matera and Mrs Stassen on violence for cultural and religious reasons."
"I would like to use this minute to tell you about an experience that affected me personally as a volunteer in one of my missions."
"It is the story of a woman, the story of Karin, the story of a woman who did not wish to wear the burkha."
"To punish her, her husband poured acid over her."
"He did it one night; he did it while she was sleeping."
"Karin now wears the burkha, not because she wants to wear it but to hide the marks of this tragic attack."
"I hope that this day does not remain simply another date on the calendar but that it can help all those women who experience violence every day and that our words can be converted into tangible actions and deeds."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, many women in Europe and throughout the world fight each day to end violence against them, but they cannot and should not carry on this struggle alone, because these acts of violence against women, largely perpetrated by men, are also acts of violence against the whole of humanity."
"It is only right that men also become involved in this struggle."
"That is why I am taking part in the White Ribbon Campaign."
"Initially set up by men for other men, this campaign started in Canada nearly 20 years ago."
"A group of men decided one day that they had a duty to urge other men to protest publicly against violence inflicted upon women."
"This white ribbon is a symbol, it is also the symbol of the carnation that recalls the fight of Congolese women against the suffering they undergo every day - they were here just now."
"Therefore, I call on as many of my fellow Members as possible to join us in this fight against violence against women, because as well as physical violence, there is psychological violence and often, as you know, words can hurt more than blows."
"(RO) Violence against women, in its diverse forms, varies according to the economic, cultural and political background in society."
"It can range from psychological and physical abuse within the family to forced marriage at a young age and other violent practices."
"Any form of violence against women is an unacceptable infringement of human rights and hampers gender equality."
"This kind of violence is prevalent on a wide scale."
"It has more victims than cancer and leaves deep scars on people's psyches and on the fabric of societies."
"This is why we should increase our efforts to combat this problem."
"UN estimates also indicate that acts of abuse are not only continuing, but are actually on the rise."
"Unfortunately, these acts are not acknowledged in most cases or are just simply ignored."
"In Romania, I support the campaign run by the UN Population Fund and the UN Information Centre, entitled 'Women in Shadows'."
"It is intended to raise public awareness of the serious nature of this problem."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, violence against women is a dreadful violation of human rights, regardless of what form it takes, including forced marriage, beatings and rape."
"I find the term 'honour killing' particularly repellent, because there is nothing honourable about it."
"Honour killing is a hideous crime and we must do everything we can to combat it."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is about to be signed and, therefore, the Charter of Fundamental Rights as an annex to the treaty will be particularly important."
"This is why we in the European Union are obliged to do everything possible to combat this violence."
"It has already been mentioned that rape can be used as a weapon of war."
"References have already been made to the Congo, where these dreadful acts have been taking place for years and where rapists even claim young children and elderly women as their victims."
"We have a number of programmes in place and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner has referred to the fact that she has approached women in government all over the world."
"Apparently that is not enough."
"This is not just a problem for women."
"It is a problem for everyone in the world."
"We in the European Union must do everything we can to improve the situation."
"(PL) Mr President, in recent years, initiatives in support of eliminating violence against women have multiplied."
"Unfortunately, this phenomenon continues to exist in Europe, irrespective of the age of the women, their education or their social position."
"We must, therefore, continue to stress that violence against women is neither natural nor unavoidable."
"Violence against women, everywhere in the world, is quite simply a crime and a violation of the right to life, personal dignity, safety, and physical and mental inviolability."
"Talking about violence is not just presenting women as victims but, above all, involves the necessity of condemning the act of violence itself and its perpetrator, who should not go unpunished."
"We need long-term education of women and men which will remove stereotypes and make everyone understand the need to fight this phenomenon."
"(PT) I hope this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women will mark the start of the collapse of the wall of silence and indifference that still exists in our society with regard to this genuine scourge that affects millions of women in the European Union and throughout the world."
"Violence against women is a violation of human rights and an obstacle to their participation in social and political life, in public life and at work, preventing them being citizens with full rights."
"Although the different kinds of violence also vary across cultures and traditions, as already mentioned here, capitalist economic and social crises make women more vulnerable, exacerbating their exploitation and leading to poverty and marginalisation, which also contributes to trafficking of women and prostitution."
"It is therefore crucial that we consolidate financial resources and policies that are genuinely committed to promoting the role of women in society and to promoting equal rights, and that we implement real plans to combat all forms of violence against women, along with eliminating the discrimination that still exists and protecting victims."
"(FR) Mr President, the 2000s have been characterised in Europe by a proliferation of security laws: surveillance, repression, detention and imprisonment."
"Budgets linked to these policies have exploded."
"Yet violence against women is not in decline."
"It follows that, in 2008, 156 women died from injuries inflicted by their spouse in France, where almost one in ten women is a victim of marital violence."
"The security measures implemented for video surveillance, filing or biometrics do not meet the real security needs of women."
"This violence affects all women in all countries, whatever their origin, social background or religion."
"It is linked to discrimination based on gender."
"Sexism, just like racism, consists in denying another person an alter ego status."
"How do we combat sexism?"
"What we require is strong political will to inform, prevent and protect, the political will to abolish all forms of discrimination in which violence takes root."
"Is not the safety of more than half of all European citizens, in other words female citizens, worth a substantial political investment?"
"Mr President, Mrs Svensson, honourable Members, thank you for a very important debate."
"The violence of men towards women has many guises and it may take many forms, but the vulnerability and pain are the same no matter who is affected."
"It is good that so many initiatives are being taken by the Commission in this area and it is my hope that European cooperation will be a force for combating violence and strengthening equality and that we will work strategically."
"This initiative and activity has been called for by many of you in Parliament."
"I would like to reiterate that violence against women is a priority area for the Swedish Presidency: 1."
"Within the framework of the Stockholm Programme that will be adopted next month, there will be greater opportunities to tackle those problems concerning women who are subjected to violence that have been highlighted by Parliament."
"2."
"On 9 November, the Presidency hosted a conference at which Member States and representatives of civil society had the opportunity to share their experiences and information relating to combating violence against women."
"During the autumn, the Presidency also organised a conference in Brussels on victims of people-trafficking, with the aim of highlighting the need for measures to be taken for those affected and the focus on cooperation with countries of origin for human trafficking."
"I would like to express my thanks for this extremely important debate."
"The road is long and the obstacles are many, but our vision must be for the violence against women to stop."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I just have some closing remarks, but first of all, I would like to thank all the Members who spoke in this debate, which is a very crucial debate."
"This is one of the most brutal forms of human rights abuses that are very widespread, not only in the developing countries."
"We are talking a lot about Congo, but we should also talk about other developing countries like, for example, Pakistan."
"Last night, after a meeting in this Parliament, I watched television and there was a programme on 24/24 on abuses against women in Pakistan."
"It was horrible, simply horrible."
"But it is also the truth."
"One of the Members gave the example of the woman who did not want to wear a burkha."
"It is obvious that conflict is exacerbating and making more severe the abuses against women, that sexual violence is used as a weapon of war, that you see after some time that the social fabric and the cohesion of the traditional communities are destroyed, are breached, that ethics disappear and that you end up in a situation where not only rebels and soldiers but also ordinary citizens commit these kinds of horrendous attacks on women and children."
"Several Members have asked whether it is possible to have a European directive on violence against women that would ensure the prevention of violence, the protection of victims and the prosecution of perpetrators."
"Unfortunately, I do not think there is a legal basis for that."
"There is a legal basis in the Lisbon Treaty for some specific actions that can be taken ..."
"(FR) ... particularly as far as people trafficking, the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography are concerned."
"There is a clear reference to that in the Treaty of Lisbon, but the Declaration of Human Rights as such is not a legal basis on which to launch a directive."
"However, I still believe that the Commission must continue to exploit various ways of attacking this problem, especially through programmes that target not only developing countries, but also certain vulnerable groups and our own Member States, because here too in our European Union, which should really set the world an example as far as the protection of human rights and the rights of women are concerned, there are still problems."
"You can rely on the Commission - both the current one and the next one - to pursue and develop this action, for the simple reason that we believe it is necessary."
"It is not a question, as one of you suggested, of whether the Member States, the Commission or the European Union should take the initiative."
"I think that, at all levels and in all of our spheres of responsibility, we really must bear this problem in mind."
"I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure on behalf of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow, Thursday, 26 November 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"I agree with this resolution and I urge the Commission to declare the Year for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"I believe that then, Member States will be quicker to improve national legislation combating violence against women, especially when combating violence against women at home, and would also effectively implement national action programmes for combating violence against women."
"Member States must establish a single system for the reduction of violence against women - to consolidate prevention, protection and aid measures."
"It is very important for this matter to be one of the priorities once the new Commission begins work and Spain presides over the Council."
"in writing. - Today is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"Violence against women exists everywhere and among all classes, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, the socially mobile and the marginalised, but a widespread and structural blindness to this problem has persisted."
"This resolution calls for a targeted and coherent EU policy plan to combat all forms of violence against women, as stated in the EU Roadmap for Equality between women and men."
"National laws and policies should be improved through the development of comprehensive national action plans to prevent, protect and prosecute."
"In Ireland last year, 1 947 women and 3 269 children were admitted to refuges."
"Over 120 women have been murdered since 1996, a significant number by a partner or ex-partner."
"EU studies have shown that one woman in five has suffered violence at the hands of her male partner, and that 25% of all violent crime reported in Europe involves a man assaulting his wife or partner."
"Domestic violence aims to control and destroy the human spirit."
"Reports of planned cuts of up to 30% by the Irish Government to some services amply illustrates their lack of real commitment to prevention, protection and prosecution."
"in writing. - One in five women has been subjected to domestic violence in Europe."
"In Malta, 467 cases of domestic violence were reported between January and October 2009, but these figures are probably not fully representative of the problem in Malta."
"Similarly, statistics in other Member States are misleading."
"This is because women often fear being misunderstood by authorities and judicial bodies."
"The resolution outlines that violence, aside from its criminality, is also a question of discrimination and inequality - an area of EU competence."
"The motion rightly focuses on the prosecution of perpetrators."
"That there should be no legal loopholes that allow perpetrators to go unpunished is important."
"Having said that, however, the rehabilitation of abusive partners should also be considered in order to avoid future repetition of violence."
"Certain Member States do not have sufficiently trained staff to adequately provide support, help and advice to victims."
"For victims, creating shelters is not enough."
"Such women require help from government to re-enter the labour market in order to acquire true economic independence from their abuser."
"Training programmes for victims must be stepped up, to allow them to fully reintegrate into society, and the EU should use its power to fully address such blatant inequalities."
"in writing. - Violence against women is a serious concern in the world."
"Women - and children - are the most vulnerable part of society, those who have to face abuse the most often."
"For instance, in Europe, it is estimated that 20-25% of women are victims of physical violence during their grown-up lives, while 10% of women even have to abide sexual violence."
"As for domestic violence, 98% is violence by men against women, and therefore we need to consider this as a gender-related issue."
"When talking about violence, we are not only talking about psychical violence: and thus the results above would be much worse."
"I believe that we cannot accept such figures and the reality that affects especially women."
"The European Socialists have long been calling for effective protection and for good programmes."
"The Daphne Programme is a good start, but we need to do more at EU Member State level."
"I think that it is very important that the Spanish Presidency has decided to make a priority of the fight against violence."
"No social problem can be solved completely in just six months."
"Therefore, I will do everything to ensure that the Belgian and Hungarian Presidencies continue the work began by the Spanish Presidency."
"in writing. - Coercive sterilisation is one of the most grievous forms of violence against women and an impermissible violation of human rights."
"In several Member States, Roma women have been subject to coercive sterilisation aiming to reduce their 'high, unhealthy' birth rate."
"Despite several cases being recorded and judicial verdicts having been reached in favour of the victims, adequate compensations and official apologies in most cases are still pending."
"I would herein like to welcome the apologies of Prime Minister Jan Fischer, as well as the recent motion by the government of the Czech Republic requiring that by 31 December 2009, the Ministry of Health would undertake a series of measures to ensure that such violations do not occur anymore."
"I hope that other countries, such as Slovakia, will adjoin the Czech initiative and will establish a mechanism to provide adequate compensation to women whose reproductive capacities were destroyed without their consent."
"It is indispensable that Member States investigate without delay the extreme human rights abuses against Roma women, penalise the perpetrators and ensure that all victims are identified and provided redress."
"It is the common goal of European countries to safeguard the health and physical integrity of all women in the continent."
"In the general campaign for upholding human rights, it seems that the problem of violence against women, including domestic violence, is given too little attention."
"The UN campaign to end violence against women worldwide in 2008 revealed that women from the ages of 15 to 44 are more at risk from rape and domestic violence than from cancer, road accidents, war or malaria."
"Various forms of sexual harassment at work have been reported by 40-50% of women in the EU itself."
"It is estimated that from 500 000 to 2 million people, and the majority of these are women and children, become the victims of human trafficking every year, forced into prostitution, forced labour and slavery or bondage."
"Therefore, I am pleased about the fact that this problem has been presented in the resolution prepared by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality."
"It is important to harmonise the approach to combating violence against women, which should, as a result, make these efforts more effective."
"It is also important to give the right kind of help to women, and to people who have already become the victims of violence."
"However, no less important is also an awareness on the part of society that domestic violence must not be an inconvenient problem which is kept closed within four walls."
"Today, 25 November, is not only International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, but also the day on which the Christian world remembers Saint Catherine of Alexandria who, at the beginning of the 4th century, was imprisoned and became a victim of violence, a martyr to conscience and freedom of expression."
"Some people overstate the problem of violence in such a way that I sometimes get the feeling that we women do not have any other problems."
"I firmly believe that for most of the time by far, women are much more worried about poverty, health concerns, education, the value placed on their work in the family and other circumstances in their lives."
"However, we must nonetheless admit that violence is also a problem."
"It is a problem unworthy of a civilised society, a problem which undermines human dignity."
"However, I gather that there is politically correct violence and politically incorrect violence in the European Parliament, for that can be the only reason why my draft amendment condemning the forced sterilisation of women and the violent termination of pregnancies did not get through in the FEMM Committee."
"It is a matter of great shame that there are still so many cases of violence against women in Europe."
"Particular concern must be aroused by the fact that a significant proportion of instances of violence are not reported to the police, especially in view of the fact that they are instances of such serious crimes, such as the crime of rape."
"No strategy for eliminating violence against women can be successful if the victims do not report the fact of violence to the right authorities."
"The law must ensure a resolute reaction in this area, so that victims can recover a sense of justice, and also so that both they and the whole of society can be protected from similar incidents in the future."
"Concern must be aroused by the fact that in several countries of the EU, including Poland, sentences imposed for crimes of a sexual nature are very lenient and, in addition, these sentences are often suspended."
"As an example, we can point to the fact that 40% of sentences imposed in Poland for the crime of rape are suspended prison sentences."
"The imposition of such lenient punishments is, in fact, a slap in the face of the victims on the part of the courts, which take such a light view of the wrong done to the victims."
"A serious approach to the problem of violence against women must involve the necessity of treating the perpetrators of that violence severely, in order to ensure a just recompense for the wrong done, and also to make society safe in future."
"A political solution with regard to the piracy off the Somalian coast (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on a political solution with regard to the piracy off the Somalian coast."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity to briefly discuss Somalia and, in particular, the very serious problem that is caused by piracy off the coast of Somalia."
"I will not go into all of the background: the country has been in dire straits for more than 18 years, the humanitarian situation is horrible, and there is strife throughout the country."
"There is a process with the transitional federal government, but it is fragile - to put it in the mildest possible terms - and it requires sustained efforts by the international community to gradually move the country towards reconciliation and gradually build up some sort of functioning state that can restore some kind of stability to this horribly torn country."
"Piracy is a very serious threat indeed."
"Addressing that requires a broad engagement within the country itself which, as indicated, is enormously difficult given the current security situation in the country."
"Accordingly, as you have noticed, our current efforts have been concentrated on practical assistance that can be delivered outside Somalia for the benefit of the country and the people."
"We are, of course, discussing, as you might be aware, further steps in that particular respect."
"On the specific problem of piracy, the Atalanta naval operation continues to operate successfully off the coast of Somalia."
"All shipments from the World Food Programme have been safely delivered to Somalia from Mombasa to Mogadishu and to Berbera."
"No successful attacks have occurred in the Gulf of Aden since early May 2009."
"This is, at least to a certain extent, the outcome of the commitment of the EU Member States and the rest of the international community, which has helped to produce a high-level generation of significant naval assets."
"The operation's success in this limited respect is also the result of close cooperation between the civilian maritime community and the EU operational headquarters at Northwood in the UK."
"This has allowed the development of best management practices which are also increasingly respected by seafarers."
"There has also been very effective implementation of the coordinated mechanism for the naval protection of commercial traffic in the Gulf of Aden."
"For the time being, therefore, it can be said that piracy in the Gulf of Aden has been contained, but still continues."
"For this reason, the Council has decided to extend the counter-piracy operation until December 2010."
"This means that we have to be able to sustain our current efforts and maintain the right level of military resources."
"In parallel, we expect UN Security Resolution AL1846 to be extended over the coming days."
"In spite of what I have said, there is no room for complacency."
"Pirates continue to extend their activities further to the east into the Indian Ocean, and with the end of the monsoon season, we have recently witnessed a new surge of attacks to the north and north-east of the Seychelles, which is quite a distance away."
"No fewer than 11 ships are currently being held - all of them following attacks in what is referred to as the Somali Basin - with a total of 250 crew members."
"With operation Atalanta, we have reinforced our capabilities in this remote maritime area."
"Additional patrol aircraft have been deployed in the Seychelles, and I can announce that Swedish maritime patrol aircraft will join the force in the Seychelles as well."
"This has proved helpful."
"For the time being, additional protection measures are already in place or planned on a national basis, with France, and more recently Spain, offering an appropriate and effective response."
"There is also the protection of the internationally recognised transit corridor in the Gulf of Aden."
"That is the recommended route through the Gulf, and all ships benefit from naval protection irrespective of their flag."
"We currently have naval units there from the European Union, from NATO and from the US-led coalition maritime forces with very good coordination of the patrols and with the very essential intelligence cooperation that is necessary for an operation of this sort."
"China is now willing to associate itself with this coordination mechanism and to participate in the protection."
"This means that existing mechanisms will have to be evolved and widened."
"It could, in due course, lead to China, and possibly other maritime powers, taking some responsibilities."
"Others - Russia, India and Japan - have also deployed naval assets, and they should be invited to join this mechanism as soon as possible."
"Coordination is, of course, the key to success."
"I know that there is some interest in Parliament in the rather difficult question of the trial of suspected pirates who have been arrested and apprehended by Atalanta units."
"There are currently 75 suspects being held in Kenyan jails."
"The legal process involved amounts to nine different trials and creates a significant additional burden on the Kenyan judicial system."
"The proper conduct of these trials is, of course, essential if we are to maintain both the deterrent effect provided by Atalanta and the overall credibility of our counter-piracy efforts."
"A recent agreement with Seychelles, which I imagine you are aware of, on the transfer of suspected pirates constitutes an important additional contribution in this respect."
"Piracy is a very lucrative business, and it is important that in every single respect, we gear our different activities towards reducing every possibility of the pirates gaining further money from these truly despicable operations that they carry out."
"At the end of the day, of course, what we are doing in the maritime waters cannot be a substitute for what needs to be done in Somalia or on Somalia itself, but that, as I indicated earlier, is something where immediate success cannot be taken for granted."
"We will have to continue the maritime operation and this will require firstly that we are prepared to sustain a long-term commitment of military assets; secondly, that we will have to strengthen coordination cooperation between all of the powers and international bodies involved in this operation; and thirdly, that we must also help to develop regional maritime capabilities as the burden cannot only be on us."
"The maritime international organisations, such as the contact group on piracy, will have an important role to play here."
"Finally, this is one of the areas where we have demonstrated the capabilities of the ESDP in recent years."
"Go back a couple of years and few of even the most ambitious here would have envisaged us operating European Union naval assets in the Gulf of Aden or in the Indian Ocean."
"Imperative humanitarian and other reasons have led us to what has, within the limits of what is possible, so far proved to be a relatively successful operation, but let us not have any illusions."
"Much remains to be done."
"We need to sustain the operation, and the support of the Parliament is very important in this respect."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, this time the focus on the whole question of Somalia is wider, also addressing the root causes of this scourge with sustainable methods."
"The Commission has always maintained that piracy can only be finally eradicated by addressing the underlying causes, beginning with the instability in Somalia and also addressing the country's development needs, which manifest themselves in the most extreme poverty, including massive illiteracy and vulnerability."
"Therefore, a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges of security and development in Somalia, which have been mentioned, is essential."
"This will require the establishment of a functioning state, capable of enforcing laws and providing at least basic services."
"In the medium to long term, governance, including institution-building and security, education and economic development are necessary preconditions for the eradication of the incentives which now exist for Somalis to become pirates."
"On the security side, a rapid approach is essential."
"The African Union has, as you know, a pivotal role to play, not least through AMISOM, which is the African Union force providing security for the transitional federal government in Mogadishu."
"Through the Africa Peace Facility, the European Union is a major contributor to AMISOM, providing funds to support African Union forces."
"The new contribution agreement of EUR 60 million has just been finalised."
"This is part of a pledge made by the Commission at the conference in Brussels in April this year."
"The joint strategy paper 2008-2013 defines Commission assistance to Somalia and, in concrete terms, the EC support programme for Somalia has a budget of, altogether, EUR 215.4 million from the European Development Fund (EDF) for the period 2008-2013."
"The Operation ATALANTA, the EU's first naval operation, will soon celebrate its anniversary."
"This operation is a success, providing deterrence to piracy but also raising the awareness of the shipping community on best self-protection measures."
"But, we all know that much more has yet to be done."
"In parallel to the operation ATALANTA, the Commission uses the instrument of stability, a financial instrument, to support the Kenyan justice system - as the President of the Council has just mentioned - because Kenya has undertaken to prosecute transferred suspected pirates apprehended by the operation, and it is necessary that there should not be impunity."
"This support to the Kenyan judiciary system includes a sort of mixture of capacity-building measures for prosecution, police, judicial and prison services."
"The programme is implemented through the UNODC at a cost of EUR 1.75 million."
"In a broader context, regional maritime capacity development is also an important aspect of ensuring security in the area."
"The Commission supports the implementation of the so-called Djibouti Code of Conduct of the International Maritime Organisation, once again by using our instrument for stability."
"A programme dealing with certain critical maritime routes, including the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden region, will assist the creation of a regional training centre for maritime affairs in Djibouti."
"This centre will focus on the capacity-building and training of maritime administration staff, officials and coastguards of the region, including from Somalia, Puntland and Somaliland, as feasible."
"A regional information-sharing centre in Sana'a, Yemen, has also been identified for funding in 2009."
"The first phase of this programme has already started and technical feasibility studies are launched."
"Let me now turn to another important issue before concluding."
"The Commission is developing an integrated maritime policy - including an external dimension - and also integrated maritime surveillance across the sectors and borders to generate maritime situational awareness of activities at sea, impacting, among other things, on maritime safety and security, but also on general law enforcement."
"The current Swedish Presidency has initiated a significant effort to ensure the inter-pillar coherence of EU maritime policy, ensuring the link between Community action and the work developed under the second pillar, notably by the European Defence Agency."
"We believe that the integration of maritime surveillance has a strong potential to assist EU operations against piracy, as the harvesting of maritime surveillance data from different sources allows authorities acting at sea to take decisions and react in a more informed manner."
"All these different strands of activities, which are also outlined in the EP resolution of last October, constitute the Commission's contribution to the fight against piracy."
"Madam President, Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we welcome with great satisfaction the extension of the Atalanta mission."
"I have sought to devote myself to the Somalia problem for some 10 years and I cannot deny that on too many occasions, Europe has not acted quickly enough."
"The situation in Somalia becomes more dramatic every day due to the consequences of international terrorism and also the problem of piracy and the human tragedy lived out by millions of people, particularly women and children, who suffer violence, face hunger every day and, all too often, are forced to escape across the desert in an attempt to seek shelter on European shores."
"In conjunction with the fight against terrorism, we must also introduce actions that bring new hope to the economy of the region but also introduce European control of the situation of the refugee camps in Libya."
"We have received reports of very serious situations in these camps, both of violence and of failure to respect human rights, often directed against Somalian women."
"During an address organised by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the permanent representative to the United Nations of the Somalian transition government, Dr Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, pointed out that Somalia has been further impoverished by fraudulent fishing of its shores and that many of the pirates are also former fishermen who have not received justice or attention."
"We therefore need to fight hard against terrorism but also strive to bring justice, hope and economy to a country that has become a martyr to years of war."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, through this debate and with the resolution that we in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament will approve tomorrow, it is our intention to express our strong support for the European Union's commitment to fight piracy."
"At the same time, we intend to express our concern regarding the dramatic nature of the situation within Somalia, which reinforces the need for and urgency of an action to promote stability in the country in order to tackle the root causes of the phenomenon of piracy."
"The Atalanta mission is a success story: it has allowed the transport of 300 000 tonnes of aid and has improved safety in the Gulf of Aden for all maritime traffic, demonstrating the capacities and added operational and political value of the ESDP."
"At the same time, we need greater European commitment, alongside the African Union, to support the Djibouti process and for this reason, although we are aware of the difficulties and risks, we express our support for the possibility of an ESDP mission in Somalia, which the Council has begun to examine."
"We therefore hope that, in the context of the amendments and debate, all the groups will help to reinforce this message instead of falling into the trap of using a dramatic situation such as that in Somalia as an excuse for political diatribe within certain countries that have nothing to do with this debate and with the work of Parliament."
"Madam President, we must support the social and democratic development of Somalia in order to bring piracy to an end."
"In addition, we call for European vessels fishing in the southern Indian Ocean to be protected from pirate attacks under Operation Atalanta in the same way as merchant vessels are."
"We call for military escorts to be provided, because that is the most effective solution and also the cheapest and the one recommended by the International Maritime Organisation."
"In addition, we wish persons arrested and charged with piracy to be judged in the countries of the area, as provided for in the March 2008 treaty with Kenya and the Seychelles."
"This is all because fishing vessels run a real and increasing risk of being attacked and hijacked in the area."
"We should recall that Parliament spoke out against this situation a year ago, yet even the Commission has admitted that nothing has been done on the subject."
"In the meantime, the pirates are continuing to carry out attacks."
"The most recent victim, the Alakrana, was held for almost 50 days."
"It should also be recalled that these vessels are fishing pursuant to a European fisheries agreement."
"They are operating legally, in international waters, and controlled by the competent authorities."
"That is why we should increase the protection offered to vessels of this type."
"Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the Atalanta operation represents a successful contribution by the EU to security in the Horn of Africa and it should be continued."
"However, the EU also has a broader common responsibility."
"This involves not turning a blind eye when illegal toxic waste exports or illegal fishing damages Somalia's interests."
"For this reason, we must take a consistent approach to following up on these matters."
"The resolution that we will be voting on tomorrow takes the wrong track in two respects and we do not endorse these approaches."
"It is wrong to want to change the Atalanta mandate now, either with regard to enlarging the area of operations or with regard to the attempt by Members of this House to extend the mandate to include fishing."
"We want the mandate to continue unchanged."
"Secondly, it is highly questionable to launch a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) training mission which has not been properly justified and which will not make a demonstrable contribution to state-building in Somalia."
"We should be working on the principle of caution rather than haste."
"Madam President, we fully support the first part of the statement by Mrs FerreroWaldner."
"That is indeed the nature of the problem and its very root."
"Until we tackle the root of the problem, there can be no chance of either an air-based or land-based military solution to it."
"As to a maritime solution, the officer responsible for Operation Atalanta stated quite clearly yesterday that no maritime solution to piracy is possible."
"I would remind the House that the United States did attempt a land-based military solution and failed in the endeavour."
"It would, therefore, be a mistake to hold back on development aid and on solutions concerning the governance of the country."
"No military solution is possible, but it is not possible either to privatise the functions of the armed forces, as the Spanish Government has seen fit to do."
"It is not a case of replacing armies with private security firms equipped with the weapons of war."
"No, that is certainly not the solution."
"The solution, in fact, is to put an end to all kinds of piracy."
"I mean, to put an end to piracy based in Somalia and also to foreign piracy that is wreaking havoc in Somali territorial waters."
"Madam President, international observers have remarked that the solution to the problem of piracy lies in achieving political stability in the area."
"This is something we all wish for, especially we Greeks, because Greek shipping is being hard hit by piracy in the area."
"Commissioner, what you said was a pleasant surprise to me."
"Until now, the only information we have had, both from international media and from all sides, was about progress in military operations."
"You disarmed me because I wanted to put the following question to you: what progress has been made to date by the political forces in the country, because we are now focusing on the fact that, in order to resolve the problem, we need political stability in Somalia."
"Thank you for the information you have given us and I must say that it would be useful if both the European Parliament and the media concerned with the question of political intervention could be given more detailed information."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Spain has just endured a painful situation in which a vessel, the Alakrana, and all its crew were subjected to blackmail, humiliation and countless risks."
"The Spanish Government is being called to account in Spain, as is appropriate in the case."
"In this House, we are going to talk of Europe and more Europe."
"Accordingly, it has to be stated that after a year in which we have demanded diplomacy and determination, the outcome has been positive."
"Operation Atalanta is inadequate, however."
"It needs to be broadened and made more flexible."
"It has to become possible to protect not only the routes along which humanitarian aid moves, but also Community fishing and merchant vessels."
"The latter must be protected, and that is why, in the resolution to be adopted tomorrow, we shall call on the European Parliament and on its institutions to make certain commitments."
"What we are seeking to do is to say 'yes' to the strong stance taken by states that protect their vessels with their armed forces to deter and, if necessary, legally repel pirate action."
"We must say 'no' to recourse to private security contractors, a move which, according to the IMO, carries with it the risk of unnecessary violence."
"We must say 'no' to the passive and dilettante attitude of governments that are making life easy for the pirates."
"We must say 'yes', however, to diplomacy, 'yes' to aid to Somalia, and 'no' to unsubstantiated charges of alleged illegal fishing."
"Community vessels are fishing in compliance with our international agreements."
"They are doing so legally and must be protected."
"The Community's institutions are duty bound to do so."
"(NL) The complex and dangerous situation in Somalia and its impact on stability in the region is a source of great concern to all of us."
"At the same time, the whole world has borne witness to the problems which this country has been experiencing as a result of sea piracy and its impact on shipping in the wider waters surrounding Somalia."
"In order to resolve this situation, we obviously need an integrated approach, as Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner said earlier."
"I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to express our appreciation for the excellent work which the Atalanta mission has carried out to date."
"Their efforts are very important, because the accessibility of this zone is crucial for international trade and goods transport."
"Our wish is that both the seamen on board merchant ships and the fishermen who work in the region will be able to carry out their jobs in safety."
"We think this is essential."
"Let us therefore continue to support the work of this mission."
"Of course, let us also consider what else we can do and, as the Commissioner rightly said, let us, at the same time, tackle this problem at the source, effectively and on various fronts."
"(DE) Madam President, Somalia is a country in a constant state of emergency and has had no government for almost 20 years."
"We in the EU must help to change this situation."
"This is why we support the Commission's work."
"However, we are very sceptical about the new European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) mission and the plan to train 2 000 soldiers for the transitional government in Somalia."
"What is the real goal of this mission?"
"What is the overall political concept for Somalia?"
"What value can we add to the current US and French training projects?"
"We do not understand how this mission can contribute to state-building."
"What legitimacy does the transitional government have?"
"Why are we supporting it?"
"Why do we believe that the soldiers will help it?"
"How can we prevent the soldiers from joining the war lords once they have been trained?"
"We believe that there are still too many questions relating to this mission for it to be possible to start planning for it."
"Above all, I do not see what value the EU can add and I believe that the money would be better spent on other projects which the Commission is already running."
"(ES) Madam President, if we are to try and understand what is happening in the waters of the Indian Ocean we must tackle the issue of piracy in a responsible manner, refraining from demagogic statements and from taking a party political stance."
"I am saying this despite the statements that I have had the misfortune of hearing in this House."
"Certain Members have taken the opportunity to attack the government of Spain while they had the floor."
"I would point out that the aforementioned government was instrumental in promoting and taking forward Operation Atalanta which we are today commending."
"That operation is clearly inadequate, however, and must be strengthened."
"I therefore wish to ask the Council to strengthen this operation, to enlarge the protected areas for which it is responsible, to increase its staff allocation and to grant it additional competences."
"I refer, for instance, to surveillance of the ports from which the mother ships used by pirates leave."
"Nonetheless, it is clear that Atalanta cannot be the sole mechanism for resolving the Somali problem."
"That is why I am taking this opportunity of calling on all concerned to seek a common strategy on Somalia."
"Such a strategy should include development aid and political dialogue with the transitional federal government."
"I also call on the Council to set up a new operation, in parallel with Atalanta."
"That operation would help to train and equip the Somali federal government's security forces whilst also strengthening the commitment to respect for human rights and the rule of law."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(ES) Does the Member think it is irresponsible to have stated that the Spanish Government should be held to account in Spain, and that in this House we should focus on discussing Europe and European measures in support of Operation Atalanta?"
"(ES) Mr de Grandes Pascual, please do not try to bandy words."
"What I consider irresponsible is for you to take advantage of having the floor to have a go at the government of Spain."
"(EL) Madam President, it is a fact that Somali pirates are a threat to international shipping."
"Piracy not only affects the cost and reliability of maritime transport, it also - and most importantly - prevents the provision of international humanitarian aid to Somalia, thereby exacerbating the serious food shortage in the country."
"Nonetheless, I must point out that countries with a long tradition in merchant shipping, such as Greece and other Mediterranean countries, are particularly affected."
"I understand that the EU anti-piracy mission to protect the sea passage in the Horn of Africa is an important step."
"However, we need to understand that the very things that we all used to think belonged to the realm of fantasy and the film world - I read about them in story books when I was a child - are now knocking at our door, are a visible danger, a reality."
"That is why we need to coordinate, to persuade the Council and the Commission to take more political initiatives."
"(ES) Madam President, piracy is a very important issue for Spain since it is affecting our fishing vessels, and I welcome the release of the vessel Alakrana and commend its fishermen, its owner and the Spanish Government for their efforts."
"Fishing boats are a target for pirates and, it seems, provide irresistible opportunities for hostage taking."
"Pirates have modernised their tactics, as the Council has said, at sea and on land."
"They are profitable and Member States must respond to the situation."
"Operation EU NAVFOR Somalia (Operation Atalanta) was a success, and the Commissioner mentioned that a large number of activities had been undertaken, but we need more and better such operations."
"Fishing boats must no longer be vulnerable; we need fishing boats to be protected and we need the area in which they are offered protection to be extended."
"Above all, we need a solution on land, because it is on land that the problem is created: as the Commission has pointed out, we need democratic stability."
"We are asking the Commission if it would be prepared to organise a summit on piracy in the area, in an attempt to find solutions on land to what is happening at sea."
"(ES) I too, of course, am delighted about the happy ending to the Alakrana case, but I fear that unfortunately it may not be the last such case. As has been said, it is important to remember that pirates feed not just on poverty, but also on the faults and gaps in a system that does not work."
"While it is certainly sad and regrettable that sailors are being kidnapped when, at the end of the day, they are only doing their job, it is also deplorable that there are those who are taking advantage of the lack of government, not only in Somalia but in the region as a whole, to fish the waters illegally or dump pollutant waste."
"Regrettably, Mr de Grandes Pascual, this is what has been happening."
"We condemn any act of piracy, without a doubt."
"Combating this phenomenon, however, requires more than soldiers and mercenaries."
"In fact, reducing it to such terms could even be counterproductive and lead to a worrying escalation in the conflict, especially given that we know that some ship owners, in order to maximise their presence in the area, are risking more than they should and moving further away from protected areas than they should, creating a risk that is always very difficult to address."
"(ES) Madam President, while illegal fishing in the Indian Ocean may be occurring, the Community fleet can certainly not be described as illegal, as has been suggested here."
"The Community fleet fishes within the strictest bounds of legality, with licences issued under the European Community - Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which regulates and manages tuna fishing in the area."
"Secondly, all Community vessels are equipped with a satellite monitoring system, through which they can be located in real time and at all times by the fishing and military authorities."
"Thirdly, the Community fleet has observers on board and complies with a strict regime of providing information on fishing activity through fishing logbooks, catch samples and a ban on transferring goods at high sea, among other measures."
"Lastly, the entire Community fleet has been duly entered in the IOTC regional fleet register."
"I personally would like both the Commission and the Council to acknowledge that the European fleet fishing in that area is doing so within the strictest bounds of legality."
"(PL) Madam President, I would very much like to express my thanks, and to start by saying that we have been given today, in my opinion, very good and dependable information both from Mr Bildt and the Commissioner."
"This information shows the fact that the European Union's efforts concentrate on two areas."
"The first area is humanitarian aid."
"The second is military action, and these two areas of activity are, fortunately, being increasingly effective."
"I would like, however, to ask this: should we not attach at least the same importance to building the State in Somalia, because it is, in fact, a country deprived of proper rule?"
"Should we not also build the local police, as well as a core of military forces?"
"In my opinion, if this third area is not treated in the same way as the other two, it will be difficult to achieve success in the long term."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Madam President, I will be very brief."
"Somalia is a big problem."
"It has been a big problem for 20 years."
"We discussed piracy. But let us not forget the humanitarian situation, which is a disaster."
"Let us not forget the problem of terrorists."
"Let us not forget the region's instability."
"Over time, we need to try and deal with it all. But let us also be realistic."
"The international community, the United Nations and others have been struggling with Somalia for a very long time."
"Results have been fairly limited."
"We are fairly late entrants in this area when it comes to trying to deal with Somalia."
"We are trying to do certain things."
"In Atalanta, we all claimed it a success, but let us not think that it can solve all the problems."
"When we are discussing extending it out into the Indian Ocean, we are talking about absolutely enormous areas."
"And, even if we were to deploy all of the naval assets of all of the countries of the European Union, I would not be certain of absolute success."
"And some of these pirates are, of course, fed money as well, which makes it possible for them to invest in further resources."
"That makes the problem rather challenging."
"That is not the reason for not doing what we can do."
"With the reservation of all of the difficulties, we should try to engage in supporting the transitional federal government."
"That is what we are trying to do with different training programmes."
"Is there a guarantee of this being successful?"
"No, there is not. But the only thing that we can be absolutely certain of is that, if we do not even try, we are absolutely certain not to succeed."
"If we try, at least there is the possibility of us making a positive impact."
"And, if we have received nothing else, we have managed to secure the programmes of the deliveries of the World Food Programme to the starving and suffering people of Somalia."
"That in itself is something to be proud of."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I know very well that this is an issue that is very important in some member countries because of the victims they have had, because of the difficulties there."
"Our Greek colleague who asked me a question that I wanted to answer is no longer here, but I wanted to say what we have been doing and why I said that there was a certain success."
"As our President mentioned, there was the so-called Djibouti Process and the international contact group, of which the Commission was part and where I know that our former colleague, Louis Michel, who is now a European parliamentarian, tried very hard to help and support the transitional government."
"It is this government that is still best placed to bring some stability to Somalia."
"This is our first and foremost task, and we will have to do it with diplomatic and political support."
"Then we have to help and protect the boats and all the people there."
"Then we also have to do what I said before - the colleague who spoke last has maybe heard me before."
"I said before that, institution-building, capacity-building, trying to help the legal process, to help the population, is absolutely fundamental."
"Only then, when we have more stability in the country and steps have been taken to eradicate poverty, can all of that then be done."
"So it is indeed a very complex process."
"In order to be helpful, apart from the other things, we now have concrete support ongoing for 29 projects, worth over EUR 50 million, which is a huge amount of money for these people, that support governance, security and civil society, that support the reconciliation process and institution-building."
"The ultimate aim is to help create a functioning state that will be able to serve the Somalian people and where we also have to combat terrorism."
"Terrorism, unfortunately, is very much anchored there, where we nearly have a failed state, so we have a huge task indeed."
"Somebody asked whether there could be a summit on piracy in the future."
"We, the Commission, would certainly not be against it, but I think this is for the Member States to decide and, in particular, maybe for the next Spanish Presidency."
"If they have an interest, then they might indeed do so."
"I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Thursday, 26 November 2009)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to give this resolution my unfailing support, as it underlines the relevance of Operation Atalanta and its success."
"I understand the immensity of the task to be achieved, given the size of the territory to be covered."
"However, I would like European fishing boats operating in the zone to be seen as very vulnerable vessels and, for that purpose, to receive special protection."
"They must therefore be classified as category 3."
"In fact, tuna boats are particularly vulnerable, insofar as, on the one hand, they have a very low freeboard and, on the other, they are immobile and not manoeuvrable during seine fishing: that is, during a four to five hour period."
"At these times, they are therefore at risk of pirate attack."
"It is this particular feature that justifies this specific request."
"I would also like to clarify that this classification in Operation Atalanta would be in addition to French and Spanish protection operations on board ships."
"The Commission and the Council are right."
"The only possible answer to the situation in Somalia is a comprehensive approach to the conflict there, with coordinated action of all parties engaged in efforts at achieving stability in the region and ending piracy."
"Our immediate objective in the problem of eliminating piracy must, of course, be continuation of Operation Atalanta."
"This should even include extension of its mandate, so that fishermen would also be protected."
"I cannot understand why certain fellow Members do not want to protect fishermen."
"Since we are protecting commercial and tourist shipping, as well as ships carrying food aid, we should also do everything possible to enable fisherman to do their work in safety."
"At the same time, we must not lose sight of the long-term goal, without which a lasting solution to the problem of piracy will never be found."
"I am referring to peace, stability, the elimination of poverty and development of the country."
"Therefore, acting on a long-term basis, we must concentrate on:"
"• strengthening the AMISOM mission,"
"• resolute maintenance and execution of the arms embargo on Somalia,"
"• stabilisation of the country by a coordinated and comprehensive strategy for action involving the European Union, the African Union and the USA,"
"• striving for lasting peace agreements between the parties, and,"
"• support in building State institutions active throughout the country."
"Smoke-free environments (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Council on smoke-free environments by Edite Estrela, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, - B7-0225/2009)."
"Firstly, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups for their joint work and the effort they have made in order to be able to table a joint resolution in such a short time."
"I would also like to thank the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the secretariat of my group and my assistant for their support."
"They have all been outstanding."
"On behalf of the Committee on the Environment, I will begin by expressing my regret that the Swedish Presidency has decided to finalise this dossier without waiting for Parliament's report."
"This attitude shows an unacceptable disregard for those elected by Europe's citizens."
"Hence the question that I put to it on behalf of the Committee on the Environment: can the Council confirm its intention to adopt conclusions on this subject in the Council of 1 December 2009, despite Parliament's timetable?"
"What are the reasons for the Council to rush into adopting the recommendation without the European Parliament's opinion?"
"Since Parliament was consulted on the Commission's proposal, is the Council prepared to take Parliament's view into account when drafting the Council's conclusions?"
"It should be noted that the Committee on the Environment supports the objectives of the recommendation, since tobacco is still the leading cause of death and disease in the European Union."
"The Committee on the Environment would therefore like its timetable to have been respected, which would allow for a thorough debate to be held on the issue and for Parliament to adopt a position."
"Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, also known as passive smoke, is a significant additional cause of death, disease and disability in the European Union."
"Passive smoke contains more than 4 000 gaseous compounds and particles, including 69 known carcinogens and many toxins."
"There is no safe level of exposure to passive tobacco smoke."
"The most conservative estimates indicate that many thousands of people die every year because of passive smoke, and it therefore also puts significant burdens on the economy, in terms of direct medical costs, and also indirect costs associated with lost productivity."
"Considerable progress has been made in recent years in establishing smoke-free environments in several Member States."
"To date, more than a third of Member States have adopted wide-ranging legislation prohibiting smoking in workplaces and enclosed public spaces."
"However, there are still significant differences in the level of protection against exposure to tobacco smoke within the EU."
"For example, workers in the hotel and catering sector make up an occupational group that is particularly vulnerable to the lack of global protection in most Member States and the exceptionally high concentration of tobacco smoke in bars and restaurants."
"At EU level, the issue of smoke-free environments has, up to now, been the subject of several non-binding resolutions and recommendations which do not provide detailed guidelines on how to set up smoke-free environments."
"The issue also appears in a number of directives adopted in the area of occupational health and safety, but is only addressed indirectly in some cases and does not guarantee an adequate level of protection in others."
"I would point out that Article 8 of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which, to date, has been ratified by 26 Member States and by the Community, obliges all parties to guarantee effective protection against exposure to tobacco smoke in workplaces and enclosed public spaces and on public transport."
"We believe that only a total ban on smoking in enclosed workplaces, including the catering and hotel sector, public buildings and public transport, will be able to ensure protection of the health of workers and non-smokers, and will encourage smokers to stop smoking."
"I will end by saying that we hope that the Council takes account of this resolution, which, we hope, will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow."
"Madam President, on 1 July 2009, the Commission submitted its proposal for a Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments, based on Article 152(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The principal aim of this proposal is to implement Article 8 of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control."
"Article 8 concerns protection against exposure to tobacco smoke."
"So far, this convention has been ratified by 26 Member States and also by the Community."
"With regard to the Swedish Presidency's work programme and in order to be able to give the other institutions sufficient time to give their opinions, on 8 July 2009, the Council called on the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions to submit their opinions at the latest by 26 November, 5 November and 8 October 2009, respectively."
"The European Economic and Social Committee has already adopted its opinion and the Committee of the Regions announced that it did not intend to submit one."
"I believe that the European Parliament is planning to adopt its opinion by March 2010 at the latest, which I find regrettable."
"Unfortunately, that will be too late for the Council to have the chance to take it into account."
"It is absolutely nothing to do with a lack of respect - quite the contrary, in fact."
"The Minister for Elderly Care and Public Health, Maria Larsson, confirmed to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 2 September that it is the Swedish Presidency's intention for the recommendation on smoke-free environments to be adopted before the end of the year."
"The text of the recommendation is currently being discussed in the Council and so far, we have made significant progress."
"I am certain that we will achieve our goal for the recommendation to be adopted at the Council's meeting on 1 December 2009."
"However, the Council is not planning to adopt any conclusions in this regard."
"The Council has examined the European Parliament's resolution that was adopted on 24 October 2007 on the Green Paper 'Towards a Europe free from tobacco smoke: policy options at EU level'."
"In the resolution, Parliament called on the Member States to introduce legislation on smoke-free environments within two years."
"Many EU Member States have now adopted such laws, and several are on the way to doing so."
"Parliament also considered that the smoke-free policy should be complemented by other supporting measures."
"The Council shares this view."
"I am pleased to have had the opportunity to report on the Council's timetable with regard to the proposal for a recommendation on smoke-free environments and look forward to hearing your views on the matter."
"Madam President, the Council Decision to promote its proposal on smoke-free environments to the Member States post haste, without giving Parliament sufficient time to process its position is, in our opinion, a mistake."
"Our reaction, apart from today's question, is the resolution that I hope we shall pass tomorrow, on which we have achieved a good compromise and which, I think, expresses the majority view in the House."
"This resolution contains numerous new elements."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) are particularly proud of the emphasis placed in this text on the protection of children from passive smoking and, at our proposal and with the acceptance of other groups, numerous new elements have been introduced."
"I would highlight, for example, the reference to the need for particular awareness and protection because children, unlike adults, do not have the facility to give their legal, moral or even psychological consent to their exposure to passive smoking."
"Parents have a duty to protect, but they need our help, because passive smoking by children has not been researched sufficiently and, consequently, neither parents nor anyone else knows what the consequences are of children's long-term exposure to smoke and to what degree they need to be protected."
"That is why our proposal that the Commission conduct a Europe-wide study into the problem, including third-hand smoking, is particularly valuable."
"The information obtained may provide a massive service."
"Moreover, there are numerous important elements in the resolution and we hope that the Council will bear them in mind."
"The European Union's citizens and environment must benefit from the protection offered by the ban on smoking in public places."
"We cannot ignore the fact that smoking currently remains one of the biggest causes of illness and death."
"We fight with all our might against dangerous epidemics and invent complex and costly vaccines to protect ourselves against new viruses, but making the effort to protect our children, families and the environment from the harm of smoking is much more achievable for us."
"Simple logic, if not the appeal to concepts such as the right of the non-smoking majority, should convince us to make this effort a priority."
"Some recent studies indicate that the ban on smoking in North America and Europe has led to a rapid decrease in certain serious health problems."
"In fact, this effect was noticed almost immediately after the smoking ban was introduced."
"In countries where smoking has been banned completely in public areas, the positive impact on health has been attributed to a number of factors."
"These include not only the removal of smoke inhaled indirectly by smokers, but also the reduction in passive smoking affecting non-smokers."
"I would like us not to lose sight of one essential fact: smokers are a minority in the European Union."
"Of course, no one can suggest curtailing the right of individuals to smoke, not even for the sake of certain principles which we all support, such as strong protection for public health and an environment rid of sources of pollution."
"At the same time, however, the majority made up of non-smokers want a smoke-free environment."
"This reality should guide us when drafting and supporting anti-smoking legislation."
"As the evidence suggests to us that smokers are likely to give up smoking with the help of these support measures, I think that we must strengthen anti-smoking legislative measures as part of a Community policy for controlling tobacco consumption, in order to make a practical contribution to improving public health right across the European Union."
"Madam President, with this resolution, our Parliament intends, as a matter of course, to support the Commission's very proactive policy on the fight against smoking."
"However, we are also asking it - and this is essential - to go even further and guarantee that, in 2011, European men and women will have the right to a clean area in all public places, means of transport and places of work."
"In fact, Europe has the right - it is obvious - and even the duty to offer protection, and thus in this case to introduce a ban, as it did and as it continues to do in respect of a whole series of toxic substances, substances that kill, in some cases, far fewer people than tobacco: chemical substances, pesticides, some heavy metals or even asbestos, to mention but a few."
"When I say that Europe must introduce a ban, and therefore guarantee this non-smoking area for all workers, as an overwhelming majority of citizens are asking us to, that obviously does not mean that we are launching a crusade against smokers."
"I am a liberal and am virulently attached to this notion of freedom, free choice and free will."
"A European text can provide for dispensations, smoking rooms and areas of freedom."
"To legislate does not mean to oppress."
"Here we are talking about public areas, but you cannot tell me that Europe does not have a role in this debate."
"Madam President, I would like to point out that this is, of course, a worker-protection issue."
"That is the only reason that the EU is getting involved in the matter at all."
"We prohibited DCM, dichloromethane, for example - a matter that I was responsible for - precisely because it affects the health of workers."
"Workers have the right to be protected by European legislation, and we are now talking about the health of restaurant and hotel workers."
"A smoking ban in these environments would save many more lives and be much more effective in preventing a lot of poor health than most of the laws that we make here."
"It is one of the most effective instruments we can introduce to protect the health of workers in the workplace, and especially children and other innocent victims of smoke."
"Dozens of substances in cigarette smoke are so toxic that, if you want to use them in a laboratory, you have to have a special permit, and yet this is what we want to release into people's everyday environment."
"It is a completely absurd situation."
"It is not about freedom of choice, because those who become sick have not chosen it at all."
"We can now help those people and prevent them from becoming sick in future, and this is an opportunity that we must take."
"I am delighted that we have succeeded in creating a joint resolution which represents a decent compromise and which can contribute to reducing the incidence of deaths and ill health caused by smoking."
"I welcome the wording of Article 15, which should ensure that the effort to control tobacco is protected particularly against the commercial interests of the tobacco industry."
"The mechanism established in Article 22 for submitting reports is a good one, in my opinion."
"I am disappointed that we have not managed to incorporate a reference to standardised packaging in the joint resolution."
"Studies have shown that standardised packaging would greatly reduce consumption and demand, especially among young people."
"I am also disappointed that, for reasons of time, the proper consultation process was not followed and I hope the Council will back the aforementioned proposals."
"I would also like to add for the record that we have adopted at today's session measures that will put the protection of non-smokers in the European Parliament on a proper footing."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to the resolution."
"Passive smoking is a huge problem, particularly for children."
"The president of the German association of paediatricians once said that smoking in the presence of children constitutes intentional bodily harm."
"I would not express it as drastically as that myself, but it is clear that we need to act."
"I very much welcome the legislation that has been introduced in Ireland, Italy and other countries."
"I think that the legal and practical situation in Germany is shameful from a health policy perspective."
"We have a lot to learn from other European countries in this respect."
"Nevertheless, it is not as easy as paragraphs 2, 10 and 13 of this resolution suggest."
"We have only limited authority at a European level and introducing legislation in this area could be politically counterproductive."
"We can only protect workers."
"We cannot provide special protection for children by taking action at a European level."
"However, it is this sort of protection that is urgently needed."
"Therefore, I would ask you to support the amendments put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) on this subject."
"One word about the controversial tobacco subsidies, which we have been discussing for years."
"The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has always called for them to be abolished."
"Now we have a good compromise in the Council and, therefore, I would like to make a strong personal plea, subject to a discussion with my group, for leaving paragraph 9 unchanged."
"It is an effective compromise and people will not understand it if we continue to pay subsidies as we have in the past."
"We need this change and we should support it."
"Madam President, during the 2004 European elections, Ireland introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace, so we met many irate voters outside restaurants and public houses."
"They were furious about the ban. But this is 2009, and there has been a huge acceptance that what we did was good for workers, good for employers and good for the public health system."
"People have come to live with it."
"This morning, I took the healthy option and walked into Parliament and I was dismayed to see in cars young parents, with children strapped into the back, smoking cigarettes."
"There were parents pushing children in buggies, with a cigarette hanging over the child."
"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do to educate adults about the dangers for children."
"So, I support my colleague, Peter Liese, in his call for the protection of children."
"They are so vulnerable, and it is so sad to see that they are exposed to this danger."
"But let us not demonise smokers."
"Remember that tobacco is a terrible addiction and smokers need all our help and support to kick the habit."
"Those who chose, as others may say, not to kick the habit should carry on with what they wish to do, without doing harm to others, and understand fully the harm that they are doing to themselves."
"This is a good resolution and, obviously, in Ireland, where we are well advanced in this legislation, we are fully supportive."
"(LT) Here in the European Parliament, we often discuss human rights."
"According to a Eurobarometer survey, 70% of European Union citizens do not smoke and the majority would like smoking to be banned in public places."
"There could be some discussion about whether this might discriminate against smokers."
"However, I believe that given the recognised damage to health that smoking can cause, we cannot risk people's health."
"Of course, when talking about a smoking ban on an EU scale, we must not forget the principle of subsidiarity and we must allow the Member States themselves to decide how they will defend and protect their citizens."
"In Lithuania, for example, as our Irish colleagues have already mentioned, we have the Law on Tobacco Control which is one of the most progressive when compared at EU level."
"Of course, there is still more to achieve."
"In Lithuania, tobacco consumption is banned in public institutions, in workplaces, in enclosed areas, in all eating establishments and on public transport."
"In Lithuania, the Law on Tobacco Control was accepted quite willingly and in truth, even smokers themselves admit that they are now smoking less or, in some cases, have even stopped altogether."
"Of course, Lithuania, like other EU Member States, must devote somewhat more attention to the problem of under-age smoking."
"I believe that we are all interested in having a clean and healthy environment, especially for our children."
"Therefore, the good examples set by states banning smoking in public spaces should encourage and inspire those states that are more sceptical in this area to defend the rights of non-smokers and they should encourage EU institutions - having heeded the opinion of the European Parliament - to find ways of adopting legislation of an obligatory nature."
"Madam President, firstly I would like to compliment Mrs Estrela on her initiative."
"I agree with the points that she made."
"In Ireland, I have also seen the transformation in attitudes to smoking and I have seen a transformation in the habits of Irish smokers."
"I was President of the Gaelic Athletic Association, which is Ireland's largest sporting body."
"We introduced a ban in our biggest stadium, which can hold 82 500 people."
"People resisted it but now they accept it."
"There is a complete change."
"I have no problem with people smoking but it affects others and that is the problem."
"Passive smoking has basically been eliminated in Ireland and adults have also cut back on smoking."
"Many have given it up and also - and more importantly - young people are less inclined to smoke now than they were before."
"The final point I would make is that, even in terms of their clothes, people find that there is no longer a smell."
"When you go abroad and go into restaurants, and if you smell smoke, you are inclined to leave, and it is the same for hotel rooms."
"It is a good initiative and, the sooner it is introduced, the better for everybody."
"They will not regret it, I can guarantee that."
"Madam President, people have the right to smoke but I bow to no one in saying that others should not have to breathe in the smoke at the workplace or any establishment that is breathed out by others."
"Personally I hate the stuff - just loathe the stuff - and I welcome the ban that has been introduced in my country. But I do not think the decision should be taken at European level."
"I do not think we should be calling for binding legislation to apply to every Member State."
"I am a federalist but I am not a centralist."
"Decisions should be taken at the lowest practical level and, in this case, that is the Member State, or indeed the regional government, as in Scotland, the first area of my country to go smoke-free."
"It is so easy to disregard the principle of subsidiarity when we think we are doing good."
"In this case, I think we are trying to do good, but with the Lisbon Treaty now adopted, we should be bending over backwards to respect that principle."
"(DE) Madam President, we need clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers to be introduced throughout Europe."
"However, in my opinion 'throughout Europe' does not necessarily mean 'from Europe'."
"Many Member States already have in place legislation to protect non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing laws of this kind."
"Why are some of my fellow Members now saying that we in Brussels can do this much better than the Member States, regardless of the fact that the European Union has no authority on health policy and that we have to implement this via the circuitous route of health and safety at work?"
"In my opinion, the Member States should decide which regulations to put in place to protect non-smokers."
"This makes sense, because they are closer to the local problems and issues."
"I do not understand why Brussels should impose protection for non-smokers in Lapland and in Andalusia which is identical in every detail."
"What has happened to the cross-border implications?"
"We in Brussels have come up against our limits in this respect."
"For me, protecting children and young people is particularly important."
"We need comprehensive protection in this area."
"If we introduce protection for non-smokers on a European level via health and safety at work, we are not protecting children and young people, because they are not employees."
"Therefore, I would ask you to support Amendments 2 and 13 put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Madam President, my thanks to the honourable Members for this important debate."
"It is extremely positive that we are all so committed to succeeding in achieving smoke-free environments."
"I believe that we have many points of view in common."
"As I said earlier, I regret the fact that the European Parliament has not been able to submit its opinion in time, but the Presidency will take account of Parliament's resolution."
"With regard to smoking in the workplace, the Commission has initiated a round of consultation with the social partners at EU level."
"They have been asked to give their opinion of the current legislation and any future legislative initiatives in this area."
"The proposal for a recommendation states that it is particularly dangerous for children and young people to be exposed to second-hand smoke and that this could increase the likelihood of their taking up smoking."
"The proposal for a recommendation on smoke-free environments invites the Commission to report on the implementation, the functioning and the impacts of the proposed measures, on the basis of the information provided by Member States."
"The Commission's report will also provide an appropriate opportunity to return to this issue."
"The issue of tobacco control will have a prominent place on the agenda over the next year as well."
"We will then begin preparations for the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control."
"The conference will be held in Punta del Este in Uruguay on 15-20 November 2010."
"I am sure that at that time the Council will want to discuss this issue with the European Parliament once again."
"I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow (Thursday, 26 November 2009)."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is often the case that good intentions cause problems."
"No one here would question the fact that non-smokers need comprehensive protection."
"However, the compromise motion for a resolution on smoke-free environments on which we will be voting on Thursday goes far beyond the protection of non-smokers."
"Even though the current draft explicitly supports the principle of subsidiarity, it also undermines it."
"The motion calls for strict and legally binding regulations at EU level."
"It abuses valid concern for health protection in an attempt to transfer invalid authority in the field of health policy and of work and social issues to a European level."
"We all want a Europe which is close to its people and the principle of subsidiarity is the key to this."
"The Member States or, in the case of Germany, the federal states, must have their own discussions on the protection of non-smokers."
"This is the only way to identify solutions which suit each country's traditions and culture and are therefore close to its people."
"For these reasons, I would ask you to vote against the motion for a resolution in its current form on Thursday."
"in writing. - (DE) I am a non-smoker myself."
"I am fully aware of the damage to health caused by using tobacco and by passive smoking."
"However, as is so often the case, these plans from the EU go a step too far."
"Some of these regulations are completely absurd and, in some cases, do not even permit smoking in the open air."
"The EU is focusing obsessively on the consumption of tobacco, while there are a number of other activities in daily life which have been statistically proven to be hazardous and harmful, such as fast food, sun beds, alcohol and coffee, driving a car, taking no exercise and having too little sleep, to name but a few."
"I would welcome sensible regulations and awareness campaigns which aim to minimise the risks involved."
"However, all adults should ultimately be responsible for making their own decisions about the extent to which they are prepared to accept the resulting damage to their health."
"A total ban on smoking in businesses is planned for 2012 and this gives very little consideration to those businesses that will suffer most, in other words, those in the catering industry."
"They can expect a drop in their takings of up to 20% which will result in the loss of numerous jobs."
"In addition, in recent years, restaurants and bars were required by law to set up smoking and non-smoking areas on their premises."
"A total smoking ban in 2012 would make these expensive investments obsolete at a stroke."
"The draft Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments is not a sensible measure."
"The Member States in particular have some catching up to do when it comes to the protection of non-smokers."
"Our central concern must be to protect vulnerable groups such as children and pregnant women."
"However, the European Union has no direct authority in this area."
"Health care is, and remains, a matter for the Member States and the countries must take on responsibility for these issues."
"The EU should therefore focus on what it can do to protect non-smokers, which means protecting employees in the workplace."
"However, attempting to achieve the fundamental aim of making Europe smoke-free by introducing a large number of regulations to protect workers is not a satisfactory solution to the problem."
"In order to protect as many sections of the population as possible and, in particular, children from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke, we need more campaigns to raise public awareness."
"This is the only effective means of changing the way in which people in Europe think in the long term and this is the only solution to reducing smoking in the private sphere."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.30 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Composition of committees and delegations: see Minutes"
"The ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission on the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by Alejandro Cercas, on behalf of the S&D Group, Marian Harkin, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Jean Lambert, on behalf of the VERTS/ALE Group, and Gabriele Zimmer and Ilda Figueiredo, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group - B7-0228/2009)."
"Madam President, fellow Members, Members of the Commission, we all know that economic globalisation, the international financial crisis and all future challenges must be addressed at the global level."
"We can no longer tackle these problems at the national or even regional levels."
"Cooperation between the European Union and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has therefore become a key item on our agenda."
"The ILO, with its tripartite method, is doing invaluable work in bringing coherence and rationality to our world."
"Our values are those on which the ILO was founded."
"It and we are working towards a social model that respects people's dignity, and we believe that we can work together."
"It is clear that Europe needs the ILO in order to maintain that social model - we could not do so in an unjust world - and that the ILO gives us the opportunity to be a global player in international relations."
"The European Union and its Member States claim that they are working very closely with the ILO and that they are promoting the programme on decent work for all and the Global Jobs Pact, with the ILO at the helm."
"However, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, there is a lack of consistency between what we all say and what we do."
"It is therefore absolutely crucial this evening to discuss ratification of the ILO conventions, and tomorrow to approve a resolution on the issue, in order to offer certain guarantees to the ILO and also to our own project."
"In your Communication on a Renewed Social Agenda, you called upon Member States once again, but the Member States did not respond."
"You called on them to ratify and implement the conventions, but with little success."
"It now seems that you must take much more ambitious action."
"There is no point in saying that Member States have already ratified the core ILO conventions."
"The ILO has updated 70 of its conventions, and even some third-world countries and developing economies are moving faster than the European Union."
"This is hard for the rest of the world to understand, and Europe is losing credibility and missing opportunities."
"Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, it is somewhat scandalous for Europe to speak out in favour of decent work and in favour of the ILO, and then not ratify the ILO conventions and simply content ourselves with rhetoric."
"This is where the question arises."
"And so, tomorrow, all the groups in this Chamber want you to go further and issue a communication demanding that Member States should ratify the conventions, in order to create coherence between what we say and what we do."
"The lack of such coherence in politics is one of the reasons why we are losing credibility among the citizens and why Europe, too, is losing credibility in the rest of the world."
"author. - Madam President, I am very happy to support the call for the ratification and implementation of the updated ILO conventions by the EU Member States."
"It is certainly worth saying that, when the ILO was created in 1919 after the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the First World War, it was to reflect the belief that universal and lasting peace can only be accomplished if it is based on social justice."
"In the intervening 80 years, the ILO has responded to the needs of people all around the globe for decent jobs, livelihoods and dignity."
"Tonight we are asking all Members States of the EU to ratify and implement the updated ILO conventions; but it is not just the authors of this question who are asking - many other agencies and bodies are also."
"If you look at the United Nations Supplier Code of Conduct, you will see that the ILO conventions have served as a foundation on which most of the Code of Conduct is based, and it is the UN's expectation that any supplier providing goods and services to the UN will adhere to the principles of the Code of Conduct."
"Therefore these conventions need to be ratified and implemented across the globe so that all suppliers can adhere to them."
"Surely we can manage that in the EU."
"The European Commission, in its communication on the renewed social agenda, states: 'The Commission calls upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions that are up to date'."
"In a resolution on the renewed Social Agenda approved by the last European Parliament in May of this year, again we state that we consider that strengthening of the implementation and enforcement of existing labour law under national and community law and under ILO conventions must be a priority for EU institutions and Member States."
"So, tonight, we in Parliament are reinforcing all of those calls."
"We are asking the Presidency-in-Office to be as ambitious as possible on the matter, we are calling on Member States to consider the strong social arguments for ratifying and implementing these conventions, and we are asking the Commission to consider the adoption of a recommendation to the Member States to encourage the ratification of conventions that are up to date."
"We also believe that the EU must ensure coherence between its internal and external policies."
"In this Parliament we hear again and again about exchanging best practice between Member States."
"Surely this is a prime example of where we can achieve best practice among ourselves by all Member States ratifying the relevant conventions and promote best practice externally or globally by, as the Commission itself suggests, setting an example by ratifying the up-to-date conventions."
"Today, 25 November, 7 650 ILO conventions have been ratified globally, with 47 in the last 12 months."
"We expect Europe to lead the way on climate change in Copenhagen; we could do similar good work with the ratification of all ILO conventions."
"Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I would like to emphasise that we consider the messages in this decision on the ratification and implementation of the ILO's conventions to be very necessary and a matter of great urgency."
"Why?"
"For two reasons."
"Firstly, the EU should take the lead in fighting for decent work."
"We should be a global pioneer when it comes to promoting good working conditions and decent work."
"Secondly, as has been mentioned here today, a gap is opening up between what we say and what we do, in other words, a gap between the EU's internal and external responses."
"If the EU forgets or if EU Member States forget or choose not to ratify and implement updated conventions, that is not only bad for the workers of Europe. It is also a very bad signal to send to countries outside the EU that we are demanding should ratify the very same conventions."
"We should practise what we preach."
"It is crucial that the EU takes the lead at a global level, that we show that we are a region that succeeds in combining good working conditions with a high level of competitiveness."
"The ILO is our global player when it comes to regulation at international level."
"It is essential that the EU supports the ILO as an institution and that we take the ILO's conventions seriously."
"Consequently, the Group of the Greens fully endorses the messages in this decision and we call upon the competent bodies of the EU to impress upon the Member States that they should take it just as seriously as we are doing here this evening."
"Madam President, we support the call on the Member States to consider the strong social arguments for ratifying and implementing the Conventions that have been classified by the ILO as up to date."
"Since 1919, the International Labour Organisation has maintained and developed a system of international labour standards which cover a broad range of subjects, including work, employment, social security, social policy and related human rights."
"We therefore supported the initial draft of the joint resolution tabled here."
"Regrettably, however, due to pressure from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the other signatories have allowed the importance of the resolution to be diluted and its power to be undermined, with the inclusion of a reference to the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs."
"However, as we are all aware, it was in the name of the Lisbon Strategy that the European Commission presented to this House some of the worst proposals against labour and social rights, through their emphasis on flexibility and labour deregulation."
"Who could forget the proposal to amend the Working Time Directive, which sought to devalue work and make it even more precarious, to extend the working day and to undermine collective bargaining and the role of trade unions, precisely the opposite of what the ILO conventions uphold?"
"It is because of this regrettable reference to the Lisbon Strategy in particular that we have withdrawn our support for this resolution."
"However, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, we call on the Member States to ratify the ILO conventions and we urge the European Commission to consider our proposals."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, over the last few years, the Commission has repeatedly highlighted its commitment to the internationally agreed Decent Work Agenda, including the promotion of ILO conventions."
"The Commission has actively supported the Member States and closely cooperated with the ILO with a view to adopting ambitious legal standards which meet the challenges of a globalised economy and contribute to the implementation of the ILO's Decent Work Agenda."
"The Council and the European Parliament have underlined the importance of the Decent Work Agenda and of the Commission's activities in this respect."
"The EU Member States have already ratified all ILO conventions covering core labour standards and a large number of other ILO conventions."
"The Commission has reaffirmed its commitment to the Decent Work Agenda as part of the renewed social agenda."
"In particular, the Commission called upon all Member States to set an example by ratifying and implementing the ILO conventions classified by the ILO as 'up to date'."
"In doing so, the Commission underlines both the internal and the external dimension of the Decent Work Agenda."
"In addition, where ILO conventions have involved exclusive Community competences, the Commission has issued timely proposals for Council Decisions authorising the Member States to ratify the relevant conventions combined with a call to ratify the standards as soon as possible, notably the Maritime Labour Convention and the Work in Fishing Convention."
"Finally, the 2008 Decent Work Report provides for the monitoring of the policy developments with regard to the ratification process."
"The outcome of this analysis is expected to be reflected in the follow-up Decent Work Report to be published in 2011."
"First of all, I would like to welcome the fact that the groups have managed to agree on the text of the resolution to be drafted on the subject of ratification and implementation of the conventions revised by the International Labour Organisation."
"We will therefore also support this."
"As is well known, the International Labour Organisation is one of the oldest international bodies."
"It was founded in 1919 with the fundamental aim of creating work regulations governing the development of working conditions and difficult working environments to counter exploitation."
"It subsequently expanded its activities more widely to include social policy and a technical cooperation system as well."
"We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) feel that the work standards devised by the International Labour Organisation help mitigate the harmful effects of competition on the international market, thereby increasing the chances of balanced economic growth being achieved."
"This has particular significance at a time when we are perhaps already emerging from the current crisis, and certainly reinforces the legitimacy of these standards and the fact that they have come about at the end of a tripartite process and were based on a separate democratic process conducted with the cooperation of governments, employers and trade unions."
"We are therefore dealing in this case with rights and commitments at the workplace and a comprehensive system encompassing them, which the countries who accept and ratify the conventions must comply with."
"At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the European Union, as a community, cannot ratify agreements."
"Only individual Member States can do this."
"This therefore raises the issue, at any rate, of the proper application of Community jurisdiction and subsidiarity."
"This is why the text features, very appropriately, a call to the EU to define exactly which legal areas and regulations relating to them come under the Community's jurisdiction and which come under individual Member States' jurisdiction."
"This means that if we can take into account the principle of subsidiarity, we will support the drafting of a recommendation, thereby facilitating the ratification of the convention as soon as possible."
"Madam President, we have an internal market in the EU in which we are able to sell goods to each other in a free market."
"We ensure free competition and cheap goods, and that is all very well and good."
"However, other areas need to be included. Fundamental workers' rights must be ensured and respected throughout the EU."
"EU Member States must not compete on poor working conditions, and the workforce in all the Member States must secure equal pay for equal work. The right to strike is also a fundamental right."
"It is therefore important that there is close cooperation between the EU and the International Labour Organisation, the ILO."
"We share some common values and we can use the ILO conventions as a basis for developing the European social model further."
"Unfortunately that is not possible at present, since the Commission only considers the conventions binding if they have been ratified by more than half the Member States."
"We could start by ensuring that every EU Member State as a minimum ratifies and implements the conventions that the ILO has classified as updated."
"We do not need more talk; what we need is action."
"How else can we ask other countries of the world to ratify and implement the ILO conventions and ask the WTO to include fundamental workers' rights in all trade agreements?"
"The EU must take the lead."
"Only then can we tell other countries that they must all ratify and implement these conventions."
"We must promote decent work in the EU and in the world as a sustainable, strong response to the global crisis we are facing."
"Madam President, it is true, ladies and gentlemen, that in times of crisis, worldwide minimum standards protect workers from inhumane working conditions."
"The EU always supports the core standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in soapbox speeches and in its contacts with third countries and rightly so, because they protect workers against discrimination and social dumping."
"Unfortunately, within the European Union things do not go any further than these soapbox speeches."
"The Member States of the EU and the EU itself ignore the ILO conventions."
"They do not ratify them and they do not implement them."
"This allows the Member States and the EU to shirk their responsibilities."
"For example, the Court of Justice of the European Union has abolished the right to strike and the Commission has applauded the move."
"For example, the convention on the protection of the rights of all migrant workers has been ratified by only three out of the 27 Member States."
"This is scandalous and this situation needs to change 90 years after the founding of the ILO."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the other political groups of our European Parliament, because on this matter of decent work, we all wanted to toe the same line and submit a joint resolution, and the negotiations of the last few days have been extremely positive."
"Since 1919, the International Labour Organisation has been able to guarantee and develop a system of international labour standards covering a wide range of issues, including work, employment, social policy and human rights."
"We must not forget this, particularly at this time of crisis."
"That is why it is extremely important that the conventions have been classified by the ILO as up to date after a tripartite process bringing together employers, workers and governments."
"That is the reason why we have put this recommendation to the Member States, encouraging them to ratify the conventions that have been classified by the ILO and asking them to contribute actively to their effective implementation for the sake of the development and progress of social Europe."
"We hope that this will happen as soon as possible."
"We will be vigilant regarding the deadlines for applying these conventions while, of course, respecting the principle of subsidiarity."
"The PPE Group will be particularly vigilant regarding the application of these conventions in the Member States."
"The fight against illegal work, the modernity of social progress, the building of a genuine social Europe that shows the world the way, is what is at stake, and we really want to help move it forward."
"(EL) Madam President, one of the most important attributes of the European Union is the importance that it ascribes to social policy and fundamental rights."
"We know full well that the application of these rights is a prerequisite to becoming a Member State of the European Union."
"We also know that these rights, when they are infringed, create an obligation on the part of the European Union to impose sanctions."
"The rights established alongside the creation and operation of the Union also extend to the workplace."
"The importance which the Union ascribes to defending labour rights is not only demonstrated when it produces internal legislation, but it is also demonstrated in its foreign policy."
"We know full well that, when it comes to concluding agreements with third countries, one of the preconditions laid down is that basic labour rights be respected."
"That is why the Union could not but be one of the first to support the necessary systematic update of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions."
"The ILO recently updated its conventions following negotiations with workers, employers and governments."
"While the governments of the Member States and the Union are among those who participated in the update in question, we face a paradox."
"The paradox is that, although many Member States of the European Union have adopted unifying directives imposing more advanced labour rights than those in the ILO conventions, they underestimate the importance of the formal question of ratification of these conventions at national level."
"As the image that this gives third countries, especially developing countries, is distorted, it would be reasonable for us to change our attitude and for those Member States which have not done so to proceed with the necessary ratifications."
"Be that as it may, the European Commission should not hesitate to be more proactive in asking the Member States to honour such obligations, so as to increase the credibility of the Union by promoting dignified working conditions, especially in the present financial crisis."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, clearly we must emphasise the importance of implementing the conventions of the International Labour Organisation, but unfortunately, I fear that the system that governs us, namely that of free competition, is making a market and therefore a commodity out of labour itself."
"That creates threats everywhere to labour codes, threats to the reductions in working time that were planned, and downward pressure on the cost of labour, which is very damaging."
"In France, we have an example where a ball bearing business has now closed so that it can be relocated to Bulgaria, and the workers of that business are being asked to go and train the Bulgarian employees."
"So you can see clearly that this downward pressure on labour costs leads to relocations, to downward pressure and to the decline of social rights everywhere."
"Consequently, we should invent a system of upwards harmonisation in terms of social rights and levels of social protection, so that there is no more of this fierce competition between employees, engineered by businesses and our institutions themselves."
"Similarly, we should not continue moving towards what is referred to in this Chamber and at the Commission as flexicurity, but we should, on the contrary, progress towards a system of occupational social security for work and employment, combined with periods of training, which are necessary."
"That is what would allow us to exit the crisis, to train workers to help them move towards the professions that have to be invented for tomorrow."
"(SV) Madam President, now that the Treaty of Lisbon has been adopted and the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights has become legally binding, we have a new opportunity to reinforce the social dimension of European cooperation."
"In order to do this, we need to be able to realise these opportunities in practice, too."
"A good place to start would be for the EU Member States to ratify all of the updated ILO conventions as soon as possible."
"There is also an external dimension to this."
"If the EU wants to be a serious partner in the international work to improve working and living conditions, it is imperative that the EU Member States also adopt the ILO convention."
"If we want to influence the situation in third countries, we must first set an example ourselves."
"I would therefore like to call on the Commission and the Swedish Presidency to act in a progressive way and to do their utmost to ensure that all of the ILO conventions that are up to date be adopted by all Member States."
"Personally, I think it is a little disheartening that my own Member State, Sweden, has not ratified basic conventions such as Convention No 94 on public contracts."
"I would therefore like to call on the Presidency to take action at national level, too, to ensure that his happens."
"This, together with the Charter of Fundamental Rights becoming binding, should reduce the risk of the European Court of Justice making any more rulings like that in the Rüffert case."
"We cannot have a situation in which we have EU legislation that contravenes basic ILO conventions."
"Madam President, the ILO, as colleagues have said, has been around for a long time - since 1919: 90 years of business and still working on the Decent Work Agenda."
"It is important that Member States, as others have said, ratify all of the conventions, especially at a time of economic crisis when workers are under pressure."
"But I think it is also important in this debate to acknowledge the role of the ILO in the developing world and its links with non-governmental organisations and the many programmes which it runs particularly targeting the most vulnerable, for example, working with people with a disability who would never have any opportunity if it were not for these programmes."
"Also, two very important areas that we talk about in this House: forced labour and child labour."
"So if we are looking to the ILO to do good work, as it does, in the developing world, I think the very least that Member States of the European Union could do is to fully ratify the conventions, to lead by example."
"(PL) Mr President, over the many years of its activity, the International Labour Organisation has adopted and presented for ratification by EU Member States a series of international conventions and directives on matters of employment, trade union freedoms, social policy and social insurance, and also collective employment relations and conditions of work."
"Member States should ratify and apply conventions which the ILO considers to be currently in force."
"The European Union should resolutely and actively make its contribution to the extremely important matter of protection of the rights of working people in a globalised world."
"It should be stressed that every citizen, irrespective of background, faith or race, has the right to improve material prosperity, to spiritual development in the context of freedom, and to dignity, economic security and equal opportunities."
"We must remember that poverty, irrespective of where it is found, is a serious threat to us all."
"Madam President, honourable Members, there is a significant convergence of opinion on the usefulness of and need for the ratification of the ILO conventions among speakers from the European Parliament and the Commission."
"Nevertheless, as Mr Őry observed, the Commission can only impose itself in areas where it has exclusive competence and, as I have said, it has done this."
"As far as the role of unions is concerned, in its recent decision, the European Court of Justice recognises collective action as a fundamental right."
"However, this right can be regulated, and this complies with other international instruments."
"I will nevertheless pass on your concerns to my colleague in charge of social policy so that this matter can be followed up in depth."
"I have received three motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 November 2009."
"FAO World Summit on Food Security - Eradicating hunger from the face of the earth (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the FAO World Summit on Food Security - Eradicating hunger from the face of the earth."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the World Food Summit last week in Rome is the latest in a series of high-level events organised this year where food security and agriculture have featured prominently: in January in Madrid, in July in L'Aquila, in September in New York and Pittsburgh, as well as at the meeting of the Committee on World Food Security last month."
"The underlying premise of all these events has been the realisation that we are failing in the fight against world hunger."
"Over one billion people in the world presently do not meet their daily basic nutritional needs, and the situation is threatening to get worse in many developing countries, owing also to the effects of climate change, which is posing additional challenges to these countries' capacity to become food secure."
"The World Summit on Food Security represented an opportunity to sustain the political momentum that has been building up in past months."
"Once more, world food security has been in the spotlight."
"However, the time for discussion is over; now it is time to deliver."
"For the European Commission, the summit was a useful event for three reasons."
"First, there was the pledge to renew our efforts to achieve the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by 2015."
"In my view, that target is still valid, and we should strive to reach it - particularly in those countries and regions where progress towards its achievement has been very limited, for example, in Africa."
"Second, the promise to improve international coordination and the governance of food security through a reformed Committee on World Food Security, which would become a central component of the global partnership for agriculture, food security and nutrition."
"The European Commission has actively encouraged this reform and is assisting in providing core funding for it."
"This is, in my view, a very important step, which will pave the way for a global governance system of food security based on sound scientific advice but one also more open to key actors in the public and private sector and non-governmental organisations."
"These actors are crucial to making the new system more effective than the current one."
"Third, the promise to reverse the downward trend in domestic and international funding for agriculture, food security and rural development."
"If we want to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger by 2015, the commitments taken to increase ODA must be fulfilled - in particular by those countries which have committed themselves to reaching the target of 0.7% of gross national income."
"Some have criticised the final declaration for not setting more precise official development assistance targets for agriculture and food security, but we must recall that significant financial pledges had already been made at the G8 Summit in L'Aquila."
"The priority now is to honour them."
"With strong support from the European Parliament, the Commission has successfully mobilised the EUR 1 billion food facility, of which 85% is already committed for the period 2009-2011."
"However, we need more and sustained assistance over time."
"In order to be accountable for our pledges, we need a global pecking system of commitments, but we also have to develop monitoring mechanisms, specific indicators and benchmarks which can be used to report on the outcomes and impacts of investments."
"However - and let me say this loud and clear - even the most substantial commitment by donors will be worthless if governments in developing countries fail to translate their own commitments into better agricultural policies, strategies and investments."
"In discussing food security, we should also be careful about terminology, and distinguish food security from food sovereignty and food self-sufficiency."
"Efforts to achieve production around the world are not enough in their own right."
"What counts is that people should have sustained access to food, which is basically a poverty question."
"Food trade - regional as well as global - plays an important part in enhancing access to food by providing farmers with an income and by allowing consumers access to cheaper food."
"Self-sufficiency in food or autarchy could be a very costly strategy and will not be necessary when markets and trade work well."
"Therefore, concluding the Doha Round with a balanced and comprehensive outcome would be a major step ahead."
"We should also not forget that global food security is a very complex and multifaceted problem which requires a holistic approach."
"In this area, the European Union has made enormous progress in the past decade and progress will continue to be ensured through the Policy Coherence for Development (PCD) process."
"The various reforms of the EU common agricultural policy have strongly reduced export refunds and the vast majority of support for farmers in the EU is recognised as being 'non-trade distorting' by the WTO."
"Moreover, with the Everything But Arms arrangement, market access to the EU is free for the least developed countries, and the provisions of the economic partnership agreements (EPAs) show an understanding of problems faced by many of the ACP countries in guaranteeing food security to their citizens."
"We have therefore come a very long way in the EU, in enhancing policy coherence for development and thereby creating improved food security conditions for developing countries."
"Other countries and regions should do the same."
"To conclude, the FAO Summit has underscored that if we want to keep to our objective of halving hunger by 2015, then we should step up ODA and increase ODA and private investments in agriculture and we should improve global governance of the agricultural sector."
"Madam President, Commissioner, it is important for us in the European Parliament to discuss the subject of hunger in the world."
"We cannot simply sit silently by while the number of people suffering from hunger, which includes many children, increases."
"I was first elected to a parliament 20 years ago and I can still remember well how international organisations such as the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the United Nations itself and the World Trade Organisation stated their intention of halving hunger in the world within the next 20 years."
"What has happened since then?"
"Hunger has not been halved, it has increased."
"More than 1 billion people suffer from hunger every day."
"The opposite of what these organisations intended has occurred."
"There is a wide range of different causes for this."
"There are countries such as Zimbabwe where an incompetent government has transformed the bread basket of Africa into a famine region."
"A communist president has brought this rich country to a position where people are suffering from hunger and we say nothing."
"However, we share the responsibility for this."
"We spend weeks, if not years, talking about the climate in one hundred years' time."
"The people who are suffering from hunger today and tomorrow are not interested in the climate in one hundred years."
"They want something to eat tomorrow, but we have no answers to their problems."
"Without wanting to neglect the issues of the future, it is a question of simple humanity to concern ourselves with people who are suffering from hunger today."
"Mr de Gucht, when we say that we intend to halve hunger by 2050, I find this almost insulting."
"As a world community, it must be possible for us to reduce the number of people who do not have enough to eat much more quickly."
"We can transport weapons to every corner of the world, but apparently we are not able to do this with food."
"This is a failure of the world community, which I would like to denounce."
"We must find other answers than the ones which we have come up with today."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the figures illustrating hunger and malnutrition in the world, which we are all aware of and see tritely repeated, are so tragic that it is almost obscene to mention them."
"The right to food is associated with the most sacred right of all: the right to life, meaning a life with a minimum of decency and not merely a fight for survival."
"Fighting hunger in the world should therefore be the number one priority of all political agendas and all resources should be mobilised to achieve this objective."
"Unfortunately, we are all also aware that resources, including financial resources, are not always the main limitation."
"The problem nearly always lies in the management and use of resources and in the lack of judicious governance and effective coordination at global, regional and national level."
"The motion for a resolution that was tabled here today - and to which my political group, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, subscribes - contains proposals and recommendations that, were they to be followed, could certainly help significantly to mitigate such a serious problem."
"I therefore urge the Commission to give it the attention it deserves and, based on it, to present legislative proposals and adopt procedures to put them into practice."
"The difficult and uncertain political situation that we are experiencing is also a time of change for those policies that are the best tools for the European Union to use on this issue: the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy, which we are about to reform radically."
"With the new powers given to us by the Treaty of Lisbon, this is also a perfect opportunity for Parliament to go beyond mere proclamations and to take real action."
"The European Socialists are ready for this challenge."
"We hope that the new Commission and other political groups are prepared to accompany us on this mission."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank my colleagues who have already contributed."
"The first point I would like to make is that I think the recent spike in world food prices serves as a wake-up call to all of us."
"The doubling of grain and rice prices has had a disproportionate impact on some of the poorest people in developing countries around the world."
"Indeed, it is estimated that an extra 75 million people around the world went hungry as a direct result of the higher food prices in 2007 and 2008."
"That is something we have to take very, very seriously."
"Indeed, in many countries, we have seen food riots and political instability as a result of the spike in food prices."
"With world population predicted to rise to over nine billion and climate change predicted to have a major impact on our ability to feed ourselves, food security is, I would argue, a major issue that we must confront and address and find solutions to."
"The European Union must do all it can to help developing countries to develop sustainable farming and food production systems that enable them to feed themselves."
"That requires finance - as the Commissioner outlined in his statement - and it requires open markets."
"Here, there is a recognition that Europe has gone a long way to assist in opening up and liberalising markets."
"But also many of the problems that developing countries face result from a failure of politics and a failure of the legal system."
"No amount of help will actually correct that problem until you have got a stable political system and a stable legal system that allows farmers to flourish and to reap the benefits of higher market prices."
"It is estimated that EU production will have to rise by over 70% just to meet rising demand in the future."
"I would argue that European agriculture has a major role to play, not only ensuring that we are self-sufficient here, but also ensuring that we can contribute to global food security in the future."
"Madam President, Commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, the fight against hunger demands a substantial political and financial investment."
"The Food and Agricultural Organisation was unable to generate that investment last week in Rome, and I regret that."
"More than a billion people suffer from malnutrition and 40 million men, women and children die of hunger each year."
"These dramatic figures have risen since 1996, the year of the first World Food Summit."
"The global financial and economic crisis has aggravated the situation, and the populations of the countries of the South are the main victims."
"Ten per cent of the advertising budget worldwide would allow developing countries to be given the necessary support to safeguard their agricultural infrastructure."
"The food crisis is one of the main threats hanging over peace and stability in the world."
"In 2050, small farmers will have to feed more than 9 billion people."
"Soil damage, damage to biodiversity, oil dependency, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and the development of consumption patterns put us in a very fragile situation, more fragile than 40 years ago."
"Poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity."
"The need to support local production is obvious."
"At the end of the 1950s, Europe introduced the common agricultural policy in order to produce the food it needed."
"To do this it protected its internal market and supported its consumers."
"This autonomous choice, this right to food sovereignty, must now be accessible to all the countries or groups of countries throughout the world that want it."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, our resolutions on this issue address the dual challenges of eradicating hunger - which currently affects one sixth of the world's population - and securing a food supply for the future."
"We are facing a situation whereby, on one hand, the world's population is growing, while, on the other, food production is proving to be an ever more challenging endeavour owing to the negative effects of climate change and rising costs associated with food production."
"While the agricultural element of food security is undoubtedly key to solving this problem, we should also firmly focus on how good governance in developing countries is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of successfully tackling world hunger."
"Take Zimbabwe, for example, which Mr Deß has already referred to."
"It was once known as the bread basket of Africa, and was once able to feed itself and many neighbouring countries."
"Now it is unable to do so, after being destroyed by the actions of Robert Mugabe and his henchmen."
"We have all got to work together to overcome this problem and prevent the civil unrest and misery that could arise from it."
"Madam President, Commissioner, if the European Union wants to play a positive role in the world, if it wants to bring to life a new humanism, it should really listen to the deafening cry of hunger resounding across the planet."
"Here and elsewhere we continue to make our fine speeches."
"Honestly, though, can we, here, have a clear conscience when a child is dying of hunger every five seconds?"
"It is not because there are technical problems that children are dying."
"It is the result of this wave of ultra-liberalism flooding the world today."
"Until now, we worked the land to feed people."
"Today, the capitalist system has turned soil and food into commodities, into objects of global speculation."
"That is why we must radically change policy, support the Food and Agriculture Organisation and give it the means to act."
"We need action, as you have said Commissioner, and we demand action."
"However, to ensure that action takes place, the European Union could enforce the principle of food sovereignty for all peoples, could help implement farm work remuneration systems with guaranteed prices for every country and every continent, could respect and enforce the commitments to grant official development assistance to the countries of the South, could cancel the debt of poor countries, could stop the purchase of land by multinationals and hedge funds, and could recognise that agriculture and food cannot be part of the hard bargaining of the World Trade Organisation."
"We must hear the cry of famine and act accordingly."
"That would make Europe grow in stature, and it is urgent!"
"In the ten years or so that I have been a member of the European Parliament, I have regularly heard fine words being used in this House."
"In the run-up to the World Food Summit in Rome, Mr Barroso, President of the Commission, also used fine words."
"He said: 'We have collectively failed in the fight against famine."
"End of quote."
"And he was absolutely right."
"Which makes the outcome of the summit all the more disappointing."
"I have a sneaking feeling that what took centre stage in Rome was the political interests of the wealthy countries, rather than the interests of the one billion hungry people in the world."
"To give you a concrete illustration, I will use two examples: as is increasingly being recognised, the biofuel policy and its promotion are causing price increases and, thus, more famine."
"However, it seems to be taboo to express any criticism of this policy."
"Also, I have, on many previous occasions, already drawn this House's attention to the danger of encouraging third countries to make large investments in Africa, with a view to ensuring their own food security, for example."
"How can countries where millions of people are dependent on UN food aid be expected to export to third countries?"
"Yet, there is no mention of this in the final declaration."
"It is very easy for wealthy countries to deal with controversial topics by simply making well-intentioned, impassioned pleas and commissioning further studies."
"Another thing I take from the declaration is that developing countries will have to rely primarily on their own resources."
"In the light of the international community's failure so far to eradicate hunger, I would call this nothing short of shameful."
"Apart from that, I have also spent some time going through the final declarations of previous world food summits and come to the conclusion that they share a surprising number of similarities - with each other and with the resolution of this Parliament, for that matter."
"They all talk of urgency and invariably call for the implementation of promises made in the past."
"However, should not the repetition of all those calls be a warning signal to us?"
"To quote Mr De Schutte, the UN rapporteur, 'poor people do not need promises'."
"As has often been said before, food security ought to be a human right."
"Madam President, I wish to approach this from a different angle and say that the Bible teaches us that it is one of God's commandments that we should feed the hungry."
"That is my personal duty and our collective responsibility."
"(BG) I personally attended the FAO meeting in Rome."
"I saw with my own eyes what this conference was like."
"I think that we also need to drop the hypocrisy slightly which has affected us because, given the money spent on organising a conference like this, where the outcome is usually only a long series of promises, perhaps we need to use this expenditure in practical terms to calculate, as the speakers before me have said, exactly how many children need not have died today of hunger if these funds had not been spent just on happy stories."
"However, the Commissioner said that the problem was to do with the global production of food, but before we start to remove the speck from our brother's eye, let us first see the beam in our own."
"My country Bulgaria has, based on scientific proof, the most fertile soil in the European Union."
"One hundred and fifty years ago, Bulgarian farmers were able to feed the most densely populated regions of the Ottoman Empire in Asia Minor using 19th century technology."
"However, nowadays, agriculture in Bulgaria is in steady decline, even more so since Bulgaria joined the European Union."
"The quotas which the Commission itself has imposed on Bulgaria are restraining agricultural production, while the land in Bulgaria is going to waste."
"It only takes one farm in one of the 28 regions in Bulgaria to produce the whole quota of tomatoes, for instance, which is assigned to Bulgaria by the European Commission."
"It has been like this because some data 10 years ago indicated that this was the official production level."
"However, no one is looking at what the real production level could be."
"Currently, within the European Union itself, there are restrictions on food production processes which could otherwise significantly improve the situation and actually offer a real measure for fighting hunger."
"Therefore, as long as things are controlled by officials who only look at sheets of paper and are not interested in anything else, all that we will be left with are just promises and no action."
"(PL) Madam President, the number of people suffering from hunger and living in extreme poverty has risen dramatically over the past year, and it is not true that this is the fault of capitalism."
"There are political systems which are significantly worse for human life and the fight against hunger."
"I will give but one example."
"In Europe, several decades ago, a country which has very good agricultural conditions was driven to starvation by communism."
"As a result of this, more people died in a single country than currently die of starvation worldwide."
"That country was Ukraine."
"I would advise caution about what is said in this Chamber."
"In the year 2000, 198 Members of the United Nations adopted specific Millennium Development Goals."
"The Commissioner spoke today about the first, most important goal."
"Today, we must answer the question as to whether this goal is attainable."
"Europeans are asking if our priorities and policy are correct and, in particular, for example, if an expensive battle with climate change is more important than the fight against poverty."
"I received such a question only this week: is the European Union not mistaking means for objectives, and instead of fighting the effects of global warming, beginning the most expensive tilt at windmills in the history of humanity - a battle with climate change?"
"I think the best proof that there is no inconsistency between action to protect the climate and to eliminate hunger would be effectiveness in the latter area, in other words, really to remove hunger from the world."
"Then no one would accuse us of having wrong priorities and of making the fight against climate change more important than the fight against hunger, as Mr Deß has also said."
"Agriculture is going to be very important in the next few years."
"What we have to do is to persuade and help developing countries to invest in agriculture and to abide by their own declarations that 10% of the national budget will be designated to the development of agriculture."
"It is only in this way that we can increase the agricultural potential of poor countries and help in an effective fight against hunger."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, with the exception of Mr Berlusconi, whose country hosted the summit, no leading member of the G8 was present at the FAO World Summit on Food Security."
"So a highly political meeting in economic, social and financial terms was reduced to a run-of-the-mill technical meeting."
"Nevertheless, Mr Diouf's objective was to develop tools and means of production, in order to ensure food security in a sustainable way in developing countries."
"The economic and financial crisis - as we know, since it has been said repeatedly - is only aggravating hunger worldwide."
"The subject was more topical than ever since, for the first time in history, hunger today affects more than a billion people in the world."
"That is a sixth of the world's population, 20% more than in 2005 and 105 million more than in 2008."
"As Mr Bové said, all of that means there is a strong risk of stirring up new conflicts and, moreover, conflicts of an extremely serious nature."
"It is the lack of investment in agriculture that has led to this phenomenon of food insecurity."
"The fact is, agriculture is the sole means of existence for 70% of the world's poor, as Mr Diouf underlined."
"He made an appeal for a total of USD 44 billion per year to fund investments to help small producers."
"His demand has been completely disregarded: there is no timetable, no strategy and no political will on the part of rich countries."
"Commissioner, how much progress has been made in implementing the G8 commitments made in July?"
"Having been in your position, I know the difficulties involved in getting donors on board."
"I still remember the extremely difficult battle, which President Barroso also waged, to obtain that wretched EUR 1 billion, two years ago now, in order to establish this food facility."
"However, Europe's future is intimately linked to the fate of developing countries."
"Commissioner, I do not believe in the formulas of our socialist fellow Member who talks to us of ultra-capitalism and ultra-liberalism - which, moreover, as a semantic assimilation, is morally debatable."
"I myself cannot see the solution in this kind of rather short-sighted ideological ranting."
"Mr Le Hyaric, I must tell you that Marxist obscurantism bears a much greater responsibility than liberalism for the underdevelopment of some countries since they gained their independence."
"That is what I wanted to say, because I did not want to let any ideological ranting or incantation that is short-sighted and that pushes the limits of intellectual honesty go unchallenged in this Chamber."
"Madam President, my colleagues Mr Bové and Mr Belder sketched the problem and the political reality, but there is a new trend in farming."
"Rich countries ensure their staple food or their biofuels by buying up land in poor countries - land grabbing or, as it is euphemistically called, 'farmland acquisition'."
"It happens in Madagascar, for instance."
"This seems to be too sensitive for world leaders to discuss."
"Europe and its leaders have a moral duty to go against this new form of what I would call colonialism."
"The declaration of the FAO Food Summit did not touch upon the issue of land grabbing and in that respect, really missed out on an opportunity to target hunger in the world."
"Why did you not do that?"
"Then there is the common agricultural policy of the EU."
"We produce a lot of food."
"Europeans have food to eat, but that CAP ruins chances for both small-scale farmers and industrial farmers in developing countries, and they lose the chance to earn a decent living."
"That causes food shortages and brings a need for food imports."
"When can we see a free and fair European agricultural policy?"
"Madam President, both the Untied Nations and the European Union have agreed that the growing world population is going to demand greater global output of agricultural productivity of the order of a 50-100% increase."
"We accept that."
"We accept the Commissioner's point of view, not only because we accept it, but because it is a target that the world cannot afford to miss."
"But, at the same time, agriculture is being asked to do it using less land, less water, less energy, less greenhouse gases."
"So there are three points which we need to understand."
"Firstly, governments - and the EU in particular - must invest more in research and development; we simply do not have the information upon which to base a plan for the future."
"Secondly, faced with volatility in global markets, we need a safety net from the common agricultural policy."
"And, thirdly, food security, and all that it implies to the European Union, involves cost."
"These are costs which we cannot pass on to consumers, and therefore I repeat: we need a strong agricultural policy, and we have to win the argument in the budget debate."
"(PT) Madam President, the final declaration adopted at the last FAO Summit by its 193 member countries truly is, unfortunately, a drop in the ocean in the fight against hunger."
"No deadlines have been set and, above all, no concrete resources and conditions have been established to tackle a scourge that affects more than 6 billion human beings."
"According to available data, in the mere 90 seconds it will take to give this speech, 15 children in the world will die from hunger."
"This is the starkest and most cutting indictment of an unfair, exploitative, irrational and, therefore, historically reviled economic system."
"It is a system that is based on real policies and guidelines and, now, Mr Michel, on protagonists and a liberal rhetoric that have led to the current situation: promotion of the agri-industrial model, in line with protection of the interests of the large agri-food industry, and the resulting qualitative impoverishment of the world's farming industry; years and years of inadequate investment in farming, of promotion of abandonment of the farming industry, and of liquidation of small and medium-sized farms, a sector that provides subsistence for 70% of the world's poor."
"Market fundamentalism, policies of privatisation and liberalisation, and free trade have resulted, and are continuing to result, in the abandonment of land, the concentration of land ownership, and production dominated by the few and food dependency for the many."
"Experts estimate that it would cost USD 44 billion to overcome the scourge of chronic malnutrition."
"This is a much more modest sum than what the Member States handed over to big business to save it from the ongoing systemic crisis."
"Madam President, during the World Summit on Food Security, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said 'the food crisis of today is a wake-up call for tomorrow'."
"By 2050, our planet may be home to 9.1 billion people, over two billion more than today - a staggering figure and one which will mean that farmers will have to grow 70% more food."
"Farmers in Northern Ireland want to help to meet that need."
"However, most of them believe that Europe is hindering their ability to produce more food by forcing a reduction in stocking rates through nitrate and phosphate regulations, red tape, a lack of research and development within the industry, and hence an attitude that food security is not an issue."
"CAP reform will determine the farmers' ability to produce food."
"It will also influence the price of food."
"If farmers are not supported by Europe through direct payments, the price of food will have to increase to meet production costs."
"My aim is to promote food production within Northern Ireland and food security within Europe."
"This will only be achieved by allowing farmers to farm."
"CAP reform will play a huge part in this, and food security should be a central component of our work as this CAP reform goes ahead."
"Madam President, as one of the authors of this report, can I first thank the political groups, who worked very closely together to come up with a text which does not have amendments to it."
"I think we should all be very pleased with that. We have different opinions on many things, but I think, on the general point of wanting to do the right thing to assist in feeding the hungry of the world, this text is a step in the right direction."
"I was also the author of a report on global food security and the CAP in the previous mandate, so I have worked very hard on this issue."
"Can I make one very simple point, which seems to escape many: it is farmers who will feed the world if they are given the right climate - and I mean that in the broadest context - to do that particular job."
"The rest of us will talk about it."
"It is our responsibility to develop and put in place the policies to allow our farmers to produce food."
"They will respond if they have two basic elements: one is decent prices and the other is stable incomes."
"The recent volatility has hit both of those and farming cannot survive on that."
"Lest I run out of time - and as one of the authors I beg your forbearance on this - please do not demonise the common agricultural policy."
"Some of the arguments made now are historic and out of date; we have reformed absolutely this policy and perhaps without the CAP, we might have greater problems of food insecurity within the European Union."
"Why do we not adopt the best parts of it and ask the developing world to take onboard a common agricultural policy?"
"Because let us be very tough on this: we should not let the developing world's governments off the hook; it is their responsibility to use the development aid properly; it is our responsibility to ensure that more money is spent and invested in agriculture."
"I think it is time to stop pussyfooting around this issue and be tough with governments and tough with ourselves."
"We have a moral responsibility and we are prepared to take it on board."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, the world is facing two major long-term challenges: combating the effects of climate change and combating poverty and hunger in the world."
"The Commissioner mentioned the figures, as did other members of this Parliament, and they appear in the final declaration of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) World Summit on Food Security: over a billion people around the world are suffering from hunger and 40 million die every year as a result of poverty."
"First the food crisis and then the financial crisis have been hindering achievement of the Millennium Development Goals."
"We are not progressing: we are actually moving backwards."
"The challenges are long term, but the solutions are urgent and are needed now."
"However, in recent weeks, we have received alarming news of resistance among the main gas emitters to making decisions at the Copenhagen conference and the absence of leaders and specific results at the FAO Summit in Rome."
"Our problems are alarming, but no less so is the lack of capacity for action."
"Human beings have progressed because we have identified challenges, determined the responses and taken action."
"In the current times, we know what we are up against but we have lost the capacity for action."
"I therefore support the resolution, which calls on Parliament to take action as a matter of urgency."
"Madam President, Article 208 of the Lisbon Treaty states that the main aim of European Union development policy is poverty reduction and eradication."
"Poverty is also the main reason for hunger."
"Article 208 also states that the Union shall take account of these objectives in other policies that might affect developing countries."
"However, with export subsidies, the EU is destroying markets in developing countries, therefore causing poverty and hunger."
"If we want our development assistance to be effective, we need to make sure that it is not hampered by other policies."
"Otherwise, we will not manage to meet the Millennium Development Goals."
"We should keep that in mind when we review and reform policies such as the common agricultural policy and fisheries policies."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I would like to ask the previous speaker to be specific about what export refunds."
"I made this point in my speech, and I accept that in the past, damage was done through export refunds and that Europe has now reformed its agricultural policy."
"However, when we introduced export refunds for the dairy sector last year, the only country which complained was New Zealand, which is not a developing country."
"Can I please ask for an example of where this is currently a problem."
"Madam President, of course the frozen chicken example that you all well know is already a bit old, but still now, for example, tomatoes that are highly subsidised in the European Union make it to African markets, are cheaper than the local products and therefore destroy jobs and increase poverty."
"So that is still a common phenomenon and I think we have to work on that."
"(HU) An ever-increasing number of scientists in the world are saying that a severe oil, water and food shortage will develop simultaneously by 2030."
"However, it would seem that the first one we must face is the food shortage, as there are already one billion people on Earth suffering from hunger."
"The number of people suffering from hunger is growing at a faster rate than the world's population."
"Therefore, while only one person in six is suffering from hunger at the moment, we must face a situation where in a few decades' time, as many as one person in four or five will be suffering from hunger."
"Two children die of hunger every minute."
"The solution to this situation is obviously not for us to discontinue the European Union's common agricultural policy."
"The European Union can only be strong and play a strong role in the world if it has a strong common agricultural policy."
"However, hunger is not unique to Africa."
"Hunger is present in the European Union as well."
"For example, there are regions in the European Union where people spend less than 10% of their income on food, whereas there are other regions too - some parts of Bulgaria and southern regions in Romania - where people are spending on average more than 50% of their income on food."
"These also include those people - representing the average - who spend many times more than this on food."
"It is worthwhile emphasising this point because we must face the fact that each time we draft a new regulation that makes agricultural production more expensive and reduces its efficiency, such as animal welfare regulations which increase the amount of fodder required to produce 1 kg of meat, we are not only harming the environment by increased CO2 emissions, but every single measure of this sort increases the number of people suffering from hunger."
"It is perhaps precisely this extra amount of fodder which we must use, for instance, in rearing poultry, that will be missing from a starving child's table."
"(RO) The number of undernourished people in the world has passed the one-billion mark, exacerbating the tragic situation that one person in six suffers from hunger."
"Unfortunately, as has been mentioned earlier, the leaders of the main industrialised powers have shown an indifferent attitude to a summit which is so important and necessary like the one organised by the FAO in Rome very recently."
"The leaders of the G8 Member States did not feel it necessary to attend this meeting, with the exception of the Italian Prime Minister."
"I cannot help but mention the huge, unfair discrepancy between the maximum level of attention given by the representatives of this group of countries, which account for 60% of global GDP, to saving the banking system and their disregard for the tragic reality of famine affecting an ever-increasing number of our fellow human beings."
"In fact, this is a crisis which is not of the poor countries' own making, but they are the ones being hardest hit by it."
"We have reached the most serious level of global famine since 1970."
"A child dies of hunger every six seconds."
"Unfortunately, the world's developed countries are closing their eyes to a tragedy which will affect us all through its complex implications."
"The best example of this, and also a warning to us, is the neglect shown to agriculture over the last two decades, which has ended up at the current food crisis."
"Out of the total amount of official aid for development, the funds allocated to agriculture have fallen as a proportion from 17% in 1980 to 3.8% in 2006."
"Food security is an extremely serious challenge which requires urgent solutions, primarily through opening up markets and providing aid to farmers in developing countries so that food can be provided and famine eradicated as soon as possible."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mrs McGuinness on this initiative, which demonstrates the important role that the common agricultural policy (CAP) plays in meeting food provision needs internationally."
"Now that the European Commission seems to want to reduce the burden of the CAP on the Community budget, it is important to stress that while the CAP may not be a priority, food sufficiency must be."
"In past decades, it has been clear that without the CAP, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve food sufficiency."
"Agriculture cannot, therefore, be compared with other sectors of the economy which are able to thrive in a free market, because the food market is not a free market."
"Farmers need the support of the European Union in order for their businesses to succeed, and the European Union, in turn, needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens."
"I therefore believe that we must change the course of the CAP, but not abolish it."
"In order to do this, direct aid must be guaranteed to farmers and a policy of managing agricultural markets must be restored to bring about greater price stability, which would benefit not only farmers but also consumers and third countries."
"A framework of best practices should be established in order to encourage balanced relations between the different players in the food chain, avoiding abusive practices and promoting fairer distribution of commercial margins."
"In addition, a European consumer information policy that highlights efforts by Community producers to comply with European Union regulations in the areas of the environment, food security and animal welfare is needed, since Community producers have to compete with imports from third countries, where the standards applied are much lower."
"Third-country producers prefer to export to the European Union rather than supplying their own countries' markets because such exports are more profitable under World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it was said earlier that, every five seconds, a child dies of hunger and poverty somewhere in the world, and it is estimated that more than a billion people suffer from malnutrition."
"The matter of global food security therefore assumes an extremely urgent character and must be at the top of the European and international political agenda."
"European policies need to be made more consistent so as to ensure that the first Millennium Development Goal is realised."
"The EUR 1 billion food facility is a necessary first step, and it is essential that the implementation measures are focused on small and medium family and crop farms, in particular, those run by women, and on poor populations, those therefore that are most affected by the food crisis."
"Sustainable agriculture must be a priority area."
"Innovative funding mechanisms, such as an international tax on financial transactions, must be explored to accompany adaptation to climate change, while being accessible to the small farmers of the most vulnerable countries."
"(ES) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the wake of the recent conclusion of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) World Summit on Food Security, I would like to express my disappointment at its limited social, media and political impact."
"In particular, I am disappointed that no agreement could be reached on the package of USD 44 billion intended to help the poorest farmers, and sad that everything will continue as before."
"When we talk about food security, agriculture and development, we often forget the issue of water scarcity, an essential problem now and, above all, in the future."
"In the current context of economic and environmental crisis, more than ever we need a commitment by developed countries to create a new forum for international reflection, at the highest level, with the aim of consolidating water as a public good, sharing technologies and developing efficient, sustainable and economically viable systems of water management."
"If we do not look after our water, we will never succeed in combating hunger."
"Madam President, in 18th century England, Thomas Malthus predicted that population increase would exceed food supply."
"Now, in many ways, his ideas have been discredited because we have had a series of agricultural revolutions which have transformed our society."
"But his words were also true: in the lifetimes of many of us, world population has trebled - trebled, quite incredible - and, in too many parts of the world, that has exceeded our food supply."
"We need to be doing more if we want to prevent hunger and control population growth, and the way of doing that is to ensure that women everywhere have control over their reproductivity."
"And we have got to save the lives of children."
"The best way of reducing population growth is to save the lives of youngsters, so that people do not feel the need to have bigger families."
"Here in the Western world, we are addicted to eating meat: a massive waste of resources."
"All I can say is - and I see my time is up, Madam President - as someone who gave up eating meat 20 years ago, if we want to save the world and prevent hunger, then we eat green, not red."
"(DE) Madam President, adequate food is a human right and hunger is a crime against humanity."
"I also think that the human race has enough technical and scientific knowledge to ensure that no one in the world should have to suffer from hunger."
"Of course, money is also needed to combat world hunger."
"However, it is not just about money."
"We also need to meet the following requirements beforehand. Firstly, developing a stable democratic structure in developing countries, secondly, fighting corruption, thirdly, establishing a suitable agricultural system in developing countries and then, finally, investing in agriculture."
"Too little is often said about the first three points."
"In addition, a lot of funding disappears in these countries, gets into the wrong hands and is used for corrupt practices."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to expand on what I said here myself two days ago concerning the tragic food crisis that Africa, above all, has been plunged into, and the clear lack of support from the most industrialised countries, as well as emerging countries, with regard to the problem of global food security."
"During the debates that took place at the FAO Summit in Rome, several NGOs accused the food multinationals of trying to grab thousands of hectares of very fertile land belonging to small farmers in the developing world."
"More than 40 000 hectares have already been acquired in this manner from Ethiopia to Indonesia."
"They also condemned the tendency many rich countries have of favouring the use of chemical fertilisers and new technologies in Africa instead of encouraging the sustainable development of agroecology."
"They castigated agrochemical companies, the use of GMOs and the development of biomass fuels to the detriment of crop growing."
"I call on the European Union to invest as a matter of urgency in the implementation of the global partnership project, which will enable actions for combating famine to be better coordinated."
"It seems to me that subsistence agriculture is undoubtedly the most obvious answer."
"(DE) Madam President, long-term food security is one of the central challenges of the common agricultural policy."
"In particular, in the light of food shortages, we must emphasise the importance of a strong CAP which will take on a key role in future in overcoming global challenges."
"This means that adequate long-term funding for the CAP is required."
"The CAP is an important element of the EU food and security policy and after 2013, it will play a significant role in development policy and in external food security policy."
"Therefore, perfectly functioning ecosystems, fertile soil, stable water resources and further diversification of the rural economy are the highest priorities."
"International cooperation and solidarity, together with balanced trade agreements which promote, rather than jeopardise, food security are an essential element of global food security and this is where a strong CAP can make an important contribution."
"(RO) First of all, at the risk of repeating an idea already mentioned by Mr Stoyanov, I deplore the fact that we have so much uncultivated land in many countries in Europe while we are talking about hunger in the world."
"Secondly, because the motion for a resolution is dealing with this issue, and I am pleased that the Commissioner touched on this subject, I wish to draw attention to the danger posed by the objective of food self-sufficiency, which is very much in vogue."
"This objective, which is not synonymous with food security, might have an undesirable effect in the current conditions because climate change affects every region in a different way."
"This situation makes trade more necessary than ever and not the ambition of every country to produce everything that it wants to eat."
"author. - Madam President, I just want to comment on two matters raised in the debate so far."
"First, the link between hunger and climate change."
"As Ban Ki-moon said in Rome, at a time when the global population is growing and our global climate is changing, by 2050, we will need to produce 70% more food, yet the weather is becoming more extreme and unpredictable."
"So any positive efforts we make on climate change will impact positively on food production."
"Another issue raised once again is the easy option: blame the CAP - as if the CAP were responsible for all of the ills of the developing world."
"The CAP is not perfect, but it has been reformed."
"If we want our farmers to continue producing and ensure food security for Europe, we cannot, by regulation and withdrawal of support, literally force them out of business."
"For example, has anybody done a study on the recent reform of the sugar industry in the EU to see if the decimation of the EU sugar industry has benefited those in Third World countries or if it has just benefited the sugar barons and landowners while leaving the small sugar growers in poverty?"
"In no way do I want to minimise the issue of world hunger, but we need to ensure that when we put forward solutions to the problem, they actually do alleviate it."
"(FI) Madam President, it is excellent that on the same day that we are discussing the resolution on the Copenhagen climate conference, the issues of food security and the problem of hunger are on the table, because these matters are very closely linked."
"Some Members have already mentioned the problem of how, through climate policy, we have also partly caused more problems."
"We have set unrealistic targets for biofuel, for example, which has led to a situation where land has been bought from developing countries for the cultivation of vegetation for biofuel."
"So land is being taken away from the poorest of the poor, who could use it for farming and developing their own agricultural production."
"There have been similar distortions in agricultural policy."
"These have resulted in over-production being exported to the developing countries, thus hampering the development of agriculture there."
"It is extremely important to bear in mind one truth: in the world today, we have more than enough food, but the desire to share it fairly is missing."
"(PL) Madam President, at the last FAO Summit, the participating states did not manage to produce any constructive proposals."
"The absence of a common strategy at international level is concerning, especially in light of the continually increasing world population, which is set to reach 9 billion in 2050."
"We all well remember the effects of the food crisis of 2007 when, as a result of a sudden rise in the prices of basic agricultural products, millions of people around the world were faced with a lack of food."
"I think the crisis should teach us a lesson."
"We must end action intended to limit agricultural production, so popular, strange to say, in recent years in our EU."
"I think that, in the light of global trends on the foodstuffs market, every attempt to restrict the CAP is an unwise move which will, in the near future, threaten the food security of our continent."
"We should help developing countries establish an agricultural policy that will enable them to ensure food security to their citizens."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I also deplore that none of the G8 leaders were present at Rome except for Commission President Barroso, and of course, it adds to the image that this has been a summit which did not bring that much new."
"When you look at the final declaration this is, I think, also obvious."
"On the other hand, I think it is also very important that we managed to keep the food security item on the political agenda and the result of the several summits we have been witnessing in 2009 has certainly been that it is now high on the international agenda and that, whenever world leaders meet, for example, latterly in Pittsburgh for the G20, there is talk of development cooperation and development policy."
"So that in itself is a very positive element."
"I have been in Rome and I must say that apart from the final declaration which is, I must agree, a little bit disappointing, there have been very good discussions and also a very good presence, and something can come out of it."
"For example, there was a whole discussion on the selling of fertile land in developing countries and countries which have no arable land; buying them itself is a very interesting topic to discuss and I think it is also one where we can come to some common understanding."
"The second thing I would like to say is that, as a couple of Members have already said, the CAP is, of course, not ideal."
"Nothing is ideal in this world, but when you look at the effect of the common agricultural policy on the developing world, I think we can claim that it is, by far, the least harmful system of a big trading block with respect to distorting effects in the developing countries."
"The WTO has acknowledged that most, if not all, of our subsidies are non-trade-distorting because they are supporting agricultural income, not the prices of agricultural products."
"I am also a little bit, how should I put it, disappointed that we are blaming ourselves all the time."
"Europe is not ideal either but I think that with the Food Facility, for example, we took a major step forward."
"This involves EUR 1 billion on a two-year basis; it is not about supporting the delivery of food, but is largely focused on delivering seeds and so on, sustaining small agricultural producers in the developing world."
"I think this really is an innovation."
"It has also been acknowledged as such by the World Bank, for example, which is taking over this mechanism."
"So we should not blame ourselves all the time."
"By the way, this facility was an innovation by my predecessor."
"There is one thing I do not agree with him and that was about a gentleman who, in the meantime, has disappeared, Mr Le Hyaric."
"He is not a socialist, my predecessor, he is a communist;"
"I mean you should look at his political group: he is a communist and that probably explains the reasoning he was using."
"Having said this, also in L'Aquila, we took up our responsibility as a European Commission and we pledged USD 4 billion, which is about 20% of the food package and the support package that was agreed in L'Aquila."
"With that, we are by far the largest donor that made pledges in L'Aquila and we are also going to honour them."
"We are also going to commit this sum and to disburse this as soon as possible."
"I will end by saying a last word on the new EU agricultural and food security policy because, in the 2010 work programme of the Commission, there is a plan to present to the Council and the Parliament a communication on a renewed policy for agriculture and food security for the European Union."
"This document will review current issues affecting agriculture and food security, for example, challenges posed by climate change, enhanced attention to nutrition and food quality, safety nets and social protection policies, the impact of biofuels on food production or the use and impact of new technologies and biotechnologies, increased calls for rights-based approaches, large-scale land acquisition, etc."
"The communication will aim firstly at renewing the EU commitment to assist developing countries advancing their agricultural production."
"This remains crucial, notably in view of the increasing demand for food due to a growing global population and changing dietary patterns and the challenges and threats that climate change is posing to sustainable agricultural production."
"Secondly, it will aim at launching reflection on how the EU could best use its experience and know-how to support the emergence of regional policies and strategic frameworks in agriculture and food security."
"Thirdly, it will aim at providing the basis for the whole EU approach to harmonise existing ECMS policy frameworks following the commitments set out in the L'Aquila agenda for action."
"Fourthly, it will aim at proposing ways on how the EU could contribute to accelerating the process towards the achievements of the MDGs and notably, MDG1 in view of the upcoming review of the MDGs in September 2010 in New York."
"Fifthly, it will aim at better positioning the EU vis-à-vis current developments in the global food agricultural governance system, and lastly, at addressing issues that have recently gained prominence in the food security agenda."
"A public consultation on an issues paper was launched on 16 November and will close in early January."
"Thus we will consult all the stakeholders and then come forward with a formal communication by the European Commission."
"I have received six motions for resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 110(2) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 26 November 2009."
"Meat imports from third countries (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on meat imports from third countries."
"Madam President, I apologise because this issue is of great interest and has many facets and I shall be a little long-winded in my statement for the benefit of the honourable Members of Parliament."
"The Commission has in place a robust set of EU animal and public health requirements for meat coming from third countries."
"For a number of years, the EU has maintained a very effective import policy which takes into account scientific developments and the current disease situation in third countries."
"In particular, it pays close attention to foot-and-mouth disease in exporting third countries because, as you know, the EU is free of this disease, which has the potential to cause serious economic harm."
"Very detailed standards and requirements have been established at the level of the World Organisation for Animal Health to prevent the spread of FMD."
"The WTO agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures acknowledges that, while countries may use different standards and different methods of inspecting products, this does not necessarily increase the animal and public health risks."
"The EU cannot impose an exact replica of our internal legislative measures on third countries, just as third countries, to which we export, cannot impose their own national rules on us."
"We can only require that their measures have an equivalent effect to ours."
"Let me take traceability as an example."
"In the EU, we have very stringent rules on the individual identification and traceability of cattle."
"In case of a disease outbreak, our rules facilitate the tracing of potentially infected animals to limit the spread of the disease."
"In addition, our rules allow us to trace and follow food or feed through all stages of production and distribution from farm to table."
"On the other hand, traceability rules applying to third countries exporting to the EU are aimed solely at ensuring that imported meat does not pose unacceptable risks for the EU."
"Thus, the scope of these rules is much more limited than the rules in force in the EU."
"I would also like to stress the fact that the measures on traceability of cattle in the EU were adopted largely in response to the BSE crisis which, as you recall, caused a dramatic drop in consumer confidence and major disruption of the internal market in relation to the trade in beef."
"Let me now take this opportunity to explain in more detail the extremely effective cascade of risk-mitigating measures that we have in place for beef imports and which ensure the highest possible level of protection for EU public and animal health, whilst taking account of OIE standards and remaining fully in line with the principles of the SPS Agreement."
"These measures can be grouped into five main levels of protection."
"They are so comprehensive that only 12 third countries outside Europe are able to meet all these requirements, and consequently, we only import beef from these few countries."
"First, imports of beef are only permitted from third countries or from certain parts of these countries that have been specifically authorised following a Commission inspection to verify the competence of their veterinary authorities and the animal health situation in general."
"Second, the territory of origin of bovine animals must be recognised as free of FMD by the OIE and the European Union."
"Third, beef-exporting countries must have an approved monitoring plan for specific residues from veterinary medical products, growth promoters and performance enhancers which are restricted or banned in food-producing animals in the EU."
"Fourth, all imports of fresh meat must come from an approved slaughterhouse that has been authorised and listed for that specific purpose."
"Fifth, we have specific conditions concerning meat production and storage."
"We have an additional layer of protection by only allowing bone in meat to come from Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand and the United States."
"For the seven other authorised countries, only deboned and matured beef without offal can be exported to the European Union."
"This treatment ensures the inactivation of the FMD virus, should it still be present despite all the previous measures I have described, thus providing an additional safeguard."
"Consignments of meat destined for the EU market must be certified by an official veterinarian who guarantees that all of the above conditions are fully met."
"When the meat consignment arrives in the EU, controls are carried out by the official veterinary services of the Member States at our border inspection points."
"All imported meat must undergo mandatory veterinary checks at EU borders."
"The border inspection posts are obliged to carry out documentary, identity and physical checks."
"Imported meat is subject to 100% documentary and identity checks at border inspection posts."
"In addition, a physical veterinary check is carried out on a minimum of 20% of all consignments of imported meat."
"Furthermore, we have an additional level of protection through our ban on feeding swill or catering waste to animals throughout the EU."
"This measure ensures that susceptible species in the EU are not exposed to the FMD virus should it enter the EU despite all the previous measures I have described."
"All the measures I have described are fully harmonised."
"In 2006, the European Food Safety Authority recognised that these measures are very effective at reducing the risk of FMD entering the EU."
"In its opinion, EFSA stated, 'The EU thus has a sophisticated import control system in place."
"These efforts appear to be very effective with regard to legal trade in meat and meat products'."
"This brings me to my next point."
"Since the harmonisation of the veterinary import conditions in the 1970s, we have never had an outbreak in the EU of FMD through the legal import of meat."
"I am sure I do not need to remind you that the FMD outbreak in the UK in 2001 was caused by the illegal introduction of meat - most probably from Asia - and the illegal use of swill feeding."
"I therefore believe that we should focus our efforts on where the real risks are, and target illegal introductions or personal imports rather than trying to excessively regulate legal imports."
"In this regard, I hope you have all seen the posters in EU airports and at other points of entry into the EU explaining to travellers the rules concerning the introduction of products of animal origin."
"I am aware that some of you have expressed concern as regards our imports of beef from Brazil."
"I would like to remind you that additional requirements were established for imports of Brazilian beef in January last year."
"These include, in addition to all the requirements I have already outlined, that the farms of origin are audited and approved by the Brazilian authorities."
"The Brazilian authorities now also require that bovine animals whose meat is destined for the EU market are individually identified and registered in a database."
"These animals represent less than 1.5% of the total Brazilian bovine population, amounting to about 2.9 million animals in approved holdings."
"As a consequence, the Brazilian authorities reassessed holdings wishing to produce beef meat for export to the EU."
"From a total number of more than 10 000 holdings eligible for export in November 2007, only 1 708 farms are currently approved."
"As a consequence, EU imports of Brazilian beef have dropped dramatically."
"In early 2009, some deficiencies were identified during a Commission inspection, and the Brazilian authorities demonstrated full cooperation to address these deficiencies."
"In any case, the overall findings did not justify any further restriction on imports of beef from Brazil."
"As things stand, imposing further restrictions on imports of beef from Brazil could be interpreted as protectionism by some, and could lead to a challenge to our measures at the WTO."
"We also need to bear in mind that the EU will have to face, from time to time, animal-health or food-safety problems, and we insist that third countries react in a proportionate manner to these problems."
"We should lead by example therefore, playing by the rules governing international trade."
"I would like to conclude by assuring Parliament that the Commission will continue to target illegal introductions which present the greatest risk to our high standards."
"The Commission will also maintain its current proportional approach towards imports of beef from third countries, including Brazil."
"These will ensure we maintain our high level of public and animal health in the EU and that the EU retains its respectability at international level."
"Madam President, the European Union imposes on Community producers the highest standards in the world in terms of food security, health, animal welfare and the environment."
"European stockbreeders are obliged to meet these standards as a prerequisite for receiving European Union support."
"For the vast majority, this support does not offset the increased burden, and farms are being abandoned at an alarming rate."
"This process will continue unless adequate measures are taken."
"Let us, however, examine the issue more closely."
"The growing deficit in European production is naturally being covered by imports from third countries, mainly from Brazil."
"Given the pressure on Community stockbreeders, it would be totally dishonest to allow consignments of meat to enter the Community market if they failed to meet the minimum requirements agreed by the European Union with third countries."
"I would also like to highlight the fact that these requirements are lower that those imposed on our own farmers, because it would seem that imposing exactly the same standards on third-country imports would go against World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules."
"Given that the WTO prevents us from imposing the same standards on imports as we do on European stockbreeders, however, the Commission must, at the very least, guarantee that all meat that crosses Community borders comes from farms that have undergone adequate inspections."
"It would make no sense to block imports from countries like Brazil, since there is a Community demand which must be met."
"Nonetheless, this does not justify closing our eyes and looking the other way in the face of any irregularities that the European Union's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) might detect during its regular inspections."
"I would like to know why the Commission is so keen to downplay these irregularities given that the FVO, on its last mission to Brazil, confirmed that some certification authorities do not meet the necessary inspection standards."
"The FVO also found huge flaws in the traceability system used by Brazil and detected problems with many consignments in transit to the European Union that did not have the necessary certificates."
"In view of this information, how can it be guaranteed that the 1 500 Brazilian farms do fulfil the agreed requirements?"
"on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, when it comes to the issue of meat imports, we in Europe must nail down the principles which form our policy on this, and have a strong but fair system of regulation."
"Those principles must be based on consumer safety and trust, protection of the environment and - vitally - a fair playing field for producers of meat."
"Currently, the system is operating in a way that is blatantly unfair for both farmers and consumers."
"We are forcing our farmers to go through a range of time-consuming and costly practices, only to allow them to be undercut by meat products from outside the EU, with Brazil being a prime example."
"There is huge evidence from the FVO in relation to this."
"This situation is simply unsustainable."
"Farm practices in Brazil are, in many cases, simply not up to the standard that is known and acceptable to European consumers."
"If we are not careful, the incentive to produce high-quality, safe meat will disappear because we are allowing inferior quality products to undermine prices and farmers' incomes."
"Also, naturally, owing to the way the food chain is integrated, once you have meat in the system it will disperse across a wide range of products and become untraceable."
"How is that fair to consumers in Europe?"
"Beef producers across Europe are getting it in the neck, and the situation cannot last for them or consumers."
"There is no faith that the new measures implemented recently are actually being taken stock of."
"There are many examples of claims of cattle being produced and put through farms that are approved, when they do not actually originate from those farms."
"Commissioner, I am not advocating protectionism in any way, but it is time to act."
"We cannot stand idly by and let this practice continue."
"It is simply unfair."
"It is unfair for European consumers and it is unfair for producers in Europe, who are having to take on practices which, at the same time, are not being accepted, and are not practised, by producers in Brazil."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her statement, where she outlined that the range of protections and measures are there to ensure that third-country imports are meeting the highest standards possible."
"I want to look in particular at the FVO report from Brazil."
"Proper traceability systems and designated holdings in Brazil are at the heart of the measures that the EU has requested be put in place to prevent any threat or risk of contaminated meat products being imported into the EU from that country."
"They are fundamental in guaranteeing to EU consumers, farmers and taxpayers that there are no risks."
"Let us not forget that foot-and-mouth disease is still a serious problem in Brazil."
"Yet the Commission's FVO report in February highlighted a catalogue of failures: 50% of the farms which were inspected which were designated for exports to the EU had problems."
"25% of these with serious problems, with missing ear tags identified, cattle on farms which could not be identified - they had no idea where they came from."
"There was a lack of documentation; there were conflict-of-interest issues; EU inspectors found that one of the government supervisors just happened to be married to the person responsible for cattle identification - and it turned out that they actually own some of the cattle on that holding where the stock records were inaccurate."
"My concern, Commissioner, is that the summary of that FVO report stated that all the controls were generally satisfactory."
"But I am sorry, the content does not support that conclusion whatsoever, and we must, as a group of nations, be on our guard."
"I do not need to remind the House of the impact a major disease outbreak can have on taxpayers, farmers and customers."
"In the last major disease outbreak in the UK which you referred to in your speech, foot and mouth erupted and we destroyed a million animals and it cost our taxpayers GBP 4 billion."
"That is the kind of risk we run if we do not get this right, so we must be vigilant."
"I am not asking for restrictions to be put on Brazil; what I am asking from the Commissioner here tonight is an assurance that this matter is taken seriously and that the Commission makes sure that the failings identified in the report are corrected in the next report."
"We need to see a clean bill of health to reassure farmers, taxpayers and consumers that they are protected and that free and fair trade can resume between Brazil and the EU."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her very full statement - possibly one of the fullest and most substantive statements we have heard from a Commissioner lately."
"This issue does merit it and, as one of the last veterans of the first battle of Brazilian beef, it is a pleasure to see so many familiar faces in the Chamber tonight."
"I hope that indicates that we are interested and serious regarding this issue."
"We support you in what you are saying about the import controls and about FMD."
"Frankly, that is not quite what this issue is about, and that is why I am so glad that those who wanted to broaden this issue out to imports from third countries have achieved that aim."
"It is not just about Brazilian beef."
"It is about the wider principle that our consumers, our voters and our farmers demand that imports from those countries which would seek to bring their produce here meet our standards - and that means meet all our standards."
"So it troubles me to hear you accept the fact that Brazil has lower standards of traceability than we do because it might not create such a disease risk coming into the territory of the European Union."
"Our consumers expect exactly the same standards in all things coming into the European Union."
"I accept your point if you are talking about strict disease control, but we are talking about equity and fairness."
"Our consumers demand - and our farmers demand and we, frankly, demand - that we have exactly the same standards of traceability across Brazil and across all third countries."
"For an FVO report to come back that said 50% of the inspections failed or had problems with them is just like throwing red meat to a pack of hungry wolves, as you perhaps see this evening."
"Can you assure us: when is the next FVO report, and will you actually take it seriously and ban whichever countries fail to meet our standards?"
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, the first thing I want to make clear here tonight is that this is not about third-country imports."
"This is about Brazilian beef coming into Europe."
"That is what it is about."
"I am saddened that I stand here tonight and we do not have a resolution."
"I do not know why, but I understand that some of the big groups in this Parliament were not prepared to stand up to the Brazilian Ambassador who lobbied last week in Brussels."
"That goes for the Socialist Group and I will let the Liberals answer for themselves, for I understand they did not stand up at the Conference of Presidents and allow us to have a resolution before us."
"I want to make it very clear."
"The Brazilian Ambassador did not lobby me."
"Maybe he did not think I was worth coming to see; I do not know."
"Or maybe he thought I was too hard a nut to crack because - let me make it very clear here tonight - in the future, Commissioner, I have to say to you that you in the Commission are no longer going to tie the hands of the farmers of Europe behind their backs on meat standards which they meet every day of the week and then come here and lecture us about the WTO and everything else."
"I have to say to you, Commissioner, that we are here for the next five years."
"I do not know how long you are going to be there, but you, if you are there, or whoever takes your place, are going to have to satisfy us in every way, shape, size and form as to how the meat that comes into Europe has got to be of the same standard as the meat we produce."
"We will not accept second best any more."
"You are not going to destroy us any more."
"I hope you pass that on to your officials because we cannot be expected to accept this on behalf of those who are our producers in Europe."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Madam President, I, too, want to raise serious concerns about the safety and suitability of Brazilian beef exports."
"Unregulated meat is imported from thousands of miles away at the expense of native farmers."
"The meat brings with it the risk of contamination such as foot-and-mouth disease, as we have heard tonight."
"The lack of strict regulation in Brazil means exporters also have an unfair competitive advantage over European farmers."
"The extent of hypocrisy on the matter of foreign beef exportations is made even more apparent in the context of climate change discussions."
"Whilst we are told we must commit to an ambitious climate change agenda, the EU turns a blind eye to the fact that the Brazilian beef export industry is responsible for 80% of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest."
"Before a ban in 2007, 30 000 premises in Brazil exported beef to the EU."
"Today only 12% of those exports are authorised, but more and more premises are approved for EU exportation daily."
"Around 100 farms per month are given that right."
"At the start of this issue, the Food and Veterinary Office reported significant problems in Brazil with the certification of farms and traceability of livestock."
"There are grave concerns about unidentified cattle in slaughterhouses."
"It is also widely held that many inspectors have strong connections with, or even own, the farms being granted authority to export beef."
"European farmers must abide by rules put in place for the safety of the consumer."
"The fact that their foreign counterparts do not work under the same regulations gives overseas exporters an unfair competitive advantage."
"The UK beef industry faces real problems from producers outside the EU, who can mass export meat at much lower prices."
"Some of the world's largest retailers, such as Carrefour and Wal-Mart, have already banned Brazilian beef on the grounds of the deforestation the industry is responsible for."
"Each year, an area in the Amazon the size of Belgium is cleared for the lucrative beef export industry."
"It is estimated that cattle rearing is responsible for 80% of illegal deforestation."
"It amazes me how there is one set of rules for British and European farmers and another for farmers in Brazil."
"Which agricultural industry does the EU and the Commission actually support?"
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Madam President, I would welcome much of what Mr Bufton was saying, but I would take issue and question him on one of his phrases there."
"He said that unregulated meat was imported into the EU."
"You said that, Mr Bufton, quite early in your presentation."
"Given the 15-minute presentation we heard from the Commissioner earlier on, would you accept that that is just clearly not the case; that your sort of hyperbole undermines the case in the serious discussion we are having here tonight about a very technical piece of legislation and regulation; and that you are not actually helping the case, you are hindering it?"
"Madam President, I will answer that."
"Certainly if we look at what is happening with meat coming into the country from Brazil and countries like that, where we know there are problems with it, that is unregulated, of course."
"It is quite simple."
"The whole issue is there: it is quite clear."
"So I know the point you are making is a very important point, but I am telling you now that there is unregulated meat coming in from these countries."
"Why on earth have we got this situation now, within the European Union?"
"We have got meat coming across - we have heard tonight about how this meat is not being inspected in these places, in slaughterhouses and so forth, and I mentioned earlier on about the fact that we had the Food and Veterinary Office reporting these issues."
"That is clearly the case."
"We are on the same side with this one."
"Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for her lengthy and full statement."
"Like many here in this Chamber tonight, Commissioner, I have been a little bit mystified by your acceptance that there is nothing that we can do in relation to the import of meat from Third World countries."
"Just earlier in your statement, you said that just as third countries cannot impose standards in the EU, so the EU cannot impose standards on other countries."
"Now, for many of our farmers, that would seem an unfair position to have, and I would respectfully suggest tonight that, yes, we can impose standards until we are sure."
"And, until we get food and veterinary reports that actually tell us that there is compliance with the regulations that we have looked at, then we should not import beef from those countries."
"Many of our farmers are suffering under the huge strain of production and feel the unfairness, and I think that you can hear in this Chamber tonight the anger that many feel in relation to this particular issue."
"Madam President, as one of the co-authors of this question, can I just support Jim Nicholson's plea, regretting that the Socialists, in particular, who are now crying crocodile tears about this issue for populist reasons, refused to support a resolution on this important issue."
"Sometimes late at night we get cross, but sometimes it is justified."
"Commissioner, thank you for your very long and detailed presentation, which I appreciate very much, but can I just say that you missed the elephant in the room."
"I will be blunt."
"You were forced to act only because of pressure from, and action by, the Irish Farmers' Association, which was reported in the Irish Farmers' Journal and followed up by this House."
"Political pressure brought you to your senses."
"I listened in detail to your speech, took notes and will read it again."
"However, I really would like you to accept that you were forced to act."
"Can I draw your attention to your own figures: it is quite staggering that in 2007, there were 10 000 farms eligible to export while currently, only 1 700 are approved to export."
"Does that tell us that the others should not have been exporting at all?"
"There are serious questions which we raise and rightly raise in this House about this importation."
"I have a little time left, so let me stretch this with two points."
"I do not have faith in the current Commission to deal adequately and responsibly with this issue."
"However, I am putting the next College of Commissioners - both President and members - on notice that I and others in this House will pursue this to the very end, because we have got to persuade and cajole our producers to meet high standards."
"They will revolt in time if they see that those standards are debased by imports from third countries."
"You may not realise the anger that is on the ground, but let me tell you it is there."
"We will also face this issue over cereal imports, with tighter pesticide regulations in Europe, and we will face it on animal welfare regulations when we ban caged-egg production in a few years' time and imports of powdered egg from small cages."
"Rest assured, Commissioner, that it may be late but we are wide awake, and the next Commission had better beware."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, what makes European beef different from imported beef?"
"It is not necessarily the taste, nor is it just the price; it is, above all, the health standards that exist within the European Union and that do not necessarily exist in the third countries exporting their meat."
"For example, as far as the production of Brazilian beef is concerned, particular mention was made of veterinary- and health-related shortcomings in a report by the Irish Farmers Association submitted to Brussels in 2007."
"Tests carried out by the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health have also revealed that the bacteriological quality of Argentinian beef was not as good as that of local meat, for instance, when the beef arrives on our plates."
"It is hardly surprising if we consider that it takes around two months for Argentinian beef to arrive in Europe."
"Consumption cycles are much shorter in Belgium, for example, as produce is usually consumed in the month of slaughter."
"That is why the health standards imposed by the European Union must not only be respected by European countries; it is equally important that third countries exporting meat to Europe respect the same standards."
"If this is not the case, it shows that the European Commission, who considers banning premature and unjustified, has failed in its responsibility to defend consumer interests and is penalising European producers."
"Finally, the countries that have banned the import of Brazilian beef, such as the United States, Chile and Japan, are showing Europe the road to take, since for us, quality is an essential requirement."
"Let us therefore act accordingly so as to protect our producers, who are the guarantors of this quality."
"Madam President, the Commissioner said we cannot impose the same standards, but we must ensure they have an equivalent effect."
"She spoke of EU traceability from farm to table, but she also told us that in third countries, the scope of traceability is much more limited."
"If the scope is much more limited - and those are the Commissioner's words - then how can it have an equivalent effect?"
"But my issue is the recent FVO report on beef imports from Brazil."
"My problem is that both the Commission and the FVO consistently play down the impact of their findings and they minimise any adverse information."
"Yes, additional requirements were authorised; but as my colleague Mrs McGuinness said, that was only after sustained pressure from the Committee on Agriculture and the Irish Farmers' Organisation."
"I was a maths teacher for most of my life, and if I gave my students 12 problems to solve - like the 12 visits that the Commissioner had to establishments in Brazil - and they only solved six of them correctly, I would not stamp 'satisfactory' on their exam paper."
"If three had minor and three had major problems, I would not consider that a good outcome, particularly if I had spent years working with them to improve their grades."
"EU farmers want fair trade as well as free trade, and EU consumers deserve certainty."
"The EU Commission and the FVO have a responsibility to ensure both."
"I certainly would not give them an 'A' grade for their work."
"Madam President, I was happy to hear that the Commissioner is determined to maintain food standards in the EU, but there are two issues that I want to pull her up on."
"Firstly, Commissioner, you talked about posters in airports."
"I have got to tell you that I have never seen any warnings or any checks carried out in airports in the EU on imported food products."
"I suggest you reinvestigate that, because it is not happening to the extent that you think it is."
"Secondly, I am not convinced about your argument regarding Brazilian beef."
"I went there myself, saw matters on the ground and support previous speakers in this regard."
"Farmers in the EU conform to the world's highest standards, and rightly so."
"However, these imply a level of cost which we cannot pass on to our consumers."
"It is therefore grossly unfair to expose European producers and consumers to a product which simply does not conform to the same standards as we are expected to achieve."
"Past experience has shown us that you cannot leave it to commercial interests to resolve this problem."
"You have to have a sound EU food policy."
"That is not protectionism - it is a common agricultural policy doing precisely what it was intended to do, which is to supply an assured quantity and quality of food."
"The two points I have made show it to be falling very short."
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I am grateful to Mrs Herranz García for bringing up this topic today in Parliament."
"This is a discussion which is fundamental to food policy."
"I am not interested in shaming Brazil or other countries."
"The basic question is this: Do we need these strict regulations for European agricultural production in the interests of consumer safety?"
"If the answer is 'yes', then this means that consumer protection is regarded as a coherent whole."
"If the regulations are needed, then the same rules must apply to imports as to our own farmers."
"The Commission must not allow imports from countries which do not fulfil these requirements."
"Cattle farmers in Europe must not be punished because one cow in their herd has an ear tag missing, when imports are allowed from cattle herds which do not have a single ear tag."
"This is not acceptable."
"If traceability is so important for consumer protection, then it must also apply to imports."
"If we cannot ensure that this is the case, then it is unfair to our farmers to demand it of them."
"I have the impression that those people in the Commission who are responsible for imports are applying double standards."
"As already discussed, I am not interested in partitioning off Europe."
"I would like to see fair competition for our farmers in Europe so that we can continue to guarantee the food supply of half-a-billion people in future."
"I can assure you of one thing, Commissioner, and you can pass this on to your successor, Parliament will continue to touch on this sore point."
"We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established."
"We have good arguments that we can bring up repeatedly to ensure that food security is guaranteed in Europe in future."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, fellow Members, the European Commission must continue to monitor compliance of third-party imports with European standards, since such monitoring benefits us all."
"It benefits our farmers and stockbreeders, who have worked hard to comply with European standards, it benefits our consumers, who are demanding increasing amounts of high-quality farming products and livestock that comply with rules on plant protection, animal welfare and traceability, and it benefits third countries wishing to export their products to the European Union."
"Lastly, I would like to recall that this problem is not restricted to a single sector or a single country."
"The issue of the competitiveness of European agriculture is a complex one that requires in-depth debate."
"Madam President, my region of south-west England is blessed with a particular blend of climate and landscape which produces good grazing and excellent beef."
"British farmers are amongst the most efficient in the world and they work, after bitter experience, to the highest standards of animal welfare and traceability."
"All these factors, coupled with a growing world population and increased efforts to ensure food security, should mean that they are a happy lot."
"Nothing could be further from the truth."
"They find themselves under attack on many fronts."
"Only this week we see that this Parliament will be entertaining the vegetarian lobby, claiming that meat eaters and, by association, farmers, are climate criminals."
"Yet they see the EU failing to be rigorous in dealing with countries where they are clearing rain forests to raise cattle."
"How can the consumer see any logic?"
"Beef farmers are not asking for special privileges - just a level playing field."
"It is absolutely vital that we support them, not by protectionism, but by making sure that all exports to the EU match their high standards."
"I urge you, Commissioner, to sharpen up your act, stiffen your backbone, reread your FVO report and deliver."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the topic we are discussing this evening is only a small part of a much bigger problem."
"The topic of fairness between the treatment of imports and the conditions imposed on our producers does not concern only meat and meat imports but also affects many other production sectors."
"As you are well aware, Europe is a net importer of meat."
"In our continent, Europe, we produce only 60% of our requirements."
"This means that we are forced to import."
"Yet we wish to guarantee consumption conditions and the health of our consumers."
"We hope this is the last time we have to hear what we heard today, in other words, that it is not possible to impose similar conditions on imports, because this is certainly not the direction in which we should be moving."
"Although we have product traceability conditions which help to raise standards internally for our consumers, I believe it is important to maintain these standards both for our producers internally and for imports from abroad."
"(NL) Commissioner, as the last speaker on the official speakers' list, I will try to sum up this debate."
"I think that one way in which I can do that is by using the Dutch proverb: 'All monks of the same order should have to wear the same habit'."
"My apologies to whomever has to come up with an interpretation of that at this late an hour but, although we in the Netherlands have hardly any monks left these days, we still use that proverb when we want to say that you have to apply the same standards in equivalent situations."
"Therefore, any requirements which you impose on EU producers should also apply to third country producers who wish to enter our market."
"Otherwise, you will simply be making it impossible for our farmers to compete."
"That applies to the identification and registration of cattle and to animal disease prevention measures in Brazil."
"However, it should equally apply to chlorinated chicken imported from the United States and to bovine growth hormones in milk."
"And to cloned animals, and so the list goes on, Commissioner."
"Listening to my fellow members, I get the impression that that is exactly what Parliament is going to judge the new Commission on - whether or not they apply the same standards in equivalent situations."
"And they are not going to judge them on it, as we are doing now, five years down the line, but well in advance of the new Commission taking office."
"Commissioner, you also spoke about foot-and-mouth."
"I agree with you that we have indeed taken some steps forward."
"For example, vaccination has been given greater prominence in the combating of the disease."
"Thank God, because, in my country alone, 285 animals have had to be destroyed, as a result of 26 cases of foot-and-mouth."
"However, Commissioner, the next Commission will also be judged on whether we have been able to market products derived from these vaccinated animals within the European Union."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament's agricultural experts have made a quite simple demand."
"They are asking for no more and no less than the same conditions for production at home, that is within the European Union, as for imports."
"I listened with interest as Mrs Vassiliou spent more than ten minutes explaining to us that essentially, this is not possible."
"She could have answered more concisely."
"She could simply have said: 'Yes, Parliament is right and I will put that in place and take it into account in future'."
"What my group and now Parliament are asking for has nothing to do with trade restrictions."
"On the contrary, it is a crucial requirement for fair world trade and for the mutual exchange of goods."
"We want fair rules in the market economy within the EU and abroad, no more and no less."
"We will be calling for this now and in future from the Commission."
"You can be sure of that."
"Madam President, the debate prior to this was about hunger."
"These two debates are linked."
"The Commissioner is right to do what she can to ensure consumer protection in Europe, and colleagues in this Chamber are right to hold her to account and to hold the highest standards."
"But beef is a cash crop."
"It is produced as cheaply as countries can produce it."
"Tragically, to produce one kilogram of beef takes 100 times more water than to produce one kilogram of soya."
"If we are concerned about consumer protection worldwide, we will do two things."
"First, we will help third countries more to develop the kinds of systems of traceability that they need, and second, we will follow the advice of my colleague Chris Davies in the last debate in encouraging all of our citizens to stop eating meat."
"(DE) Madam President, our citizens have high expectations regarding the safety and quality of their food."
"This concerns not only animal health and food safety, but also environmental standards, production and animal welfare."
"The traceability and accompanying transparency of foodstuffs from the producer to the consumer is only guaranteed in Europe."
"It is in all our interests to ensure that our consumers are protected, that European agricultural products are competitive and, therefore, that the agricultural industry itself is competitive."
"For this reason, I feel that it is essential and that it is one of our responsibilities as Members of the European Parliament to speed up this debate and to ensure that the related political framework is in place."
"(RO) Madam President, Commissioner, as you are very well aware, Romania is not entitled to sell pork and pork products on the European market, in return for which we have been given the right, from next year, to import pork from other Member States and export it afterwards in processed form."
"In addition, we will also have to implement, within a maximum of one year, clear, stringent and costly slaughter rules."
"I am convinced that Romanian pig farmers would be extremely happy if these rules were replaced by a system of superficial and selective controls or by a few posters stuck up at airports."
"I am obviously joking, but the rules, if rules are to be applied, must be the same and mandatory for everyone."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your statement, which I believe reflects the remarkable work you have done during your mandate."
"Europe has chosen a food model to protect its population."
"Our fellow citizens are ready to pay EUR 100 per year per capita if we guarantee the quality of their food."
"The other day in committee, we learnt of the Food and Veterinary Office's report."
"I must tell you that, as a new MEP, I was deeply concerned to see the discomfort of your staff, who obviously could not answer or did not want to answer our questions."
"Commissioner, should we be ashamed of having strict rules to protect our consumers?"
"Should we be ashamed of imposing these rules on those who want to feed our consumers?"
"Are we ashamed when, in order to sell aircraft or cars, these same countries force us to establish this or that factory or impose this or that condition on us?"
"Our market access conditions are important conditions because they affect food and they affect the health of our residents."
"We have nothing to be ashamed of."
"(PL) Madam President, we want to export, but we also have to import."
"Trade accelerates development, it brings benefits to the parties to the exchange, but certain necessary requirements are imposed here, related to quality and meeting suitable standards - this is obvious, and I am sure we are agreed on this."
"Europe has a variety of forms of inspection and audit in order to protect its market from an influx of food which does not meet European standards, or which would be a threat to our health security."
"From what the Commissioner has said, we cannot expect the same audit procedures as we apply to our own producers - have I understood that correctly?"
"What does it mean, as you clearly indicated, that only the effect of these measures should be the same?"
"By way of comparison I would like to ask if, for example, Russia or another country can impose requirements on the import of goods from the EU which we cannot impose, for example, on meat imported from Brazil?"
"Are only the effects important here, as in the case of imports from Brazil?"
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, may I remind the honourable Members that what I said was not that we cannot impose rules on third countries."
"I am sorry that, even after a presentation of 10 to 15 minutes, I failed to explain the rules we impose when we import from third countries."
"I must remind you that at the same time as we are importers of meat from third countries - and at this point we import from Brazil only 5% of our requirements for beef in the European Union - we are also big exporters to third countries: to Russia and elsewhere."
"At this point, our exports to Russia amount to EUR 1 billion per year - mostly from Ireland."
"We are trying to convince Russia that we cannot accept the same rules as applied in Russia."
"There are rules of international trade, and we apply equivalent, but not identical, rules provided that we are satisfied that they are strict enough to protect our consumers."
"This is what we are doing."
"The reason why we applied the safety rules in the case of Brazil is precisely because our FVO missions have shown us that something was going wrong."
"We applied very strict rules."
"I gave you the figures."
"Regarding the last mission to Brazil, there were indeed problems, but I challenge you to look at all the reports of our FVO missions to any of the Member States and make a comparison."
"You will also see very serious deficiencies in the Member States, which we ask Member States and their authorities to put right."
"That is also what we have asked Brazil to do."
"Problems were identified in Brazil."
"In one state, where three holdings showed significant deficiencies, the Brazilian authorities took corrective action to de-list all the holdings concerned and to retrain the auditors responsible for their audits."
"Problems were also identified at three other holdings, mainly in relation to delays of notification of animal movements or to the consistency of the data in the database."
"These problems were recognised to be minor problems by the FVO Team."
"Nevertheless, the Brazilian authorities made an undertaking to review the database to avoid incorrect data."
"The FVO missions have this in mind when they go."
"They know that they will find defects."
"Our obligation is to correct the deficiencies that we find - whether this is in Member States or in third countries - because our obligation is to our consumers."
"I want to assure you that we shall continue sending missions to Brazil and to other third countries to make sure that when deficiencies are discovered, they are put right."
"I must also assure you that we are playing a very fair game for our farmers and producers vis-à-vis third countries."
"There was a remark about Romania, which in the same way as Bulgaria and - in the past - many other Member States, had a problem with classical swine fever."
"We have heard a lot about Romania and Bulgaria."
"I must challenge you to ask your respective governments what assistance we have offered in order to get rid of this problem."
"I am sure that Romania will be able to export meat in the very near future precisely because of the assistance we have offered it and Bulgaria to get rid of classical swine fever."
"In ending I want to assure you that our first responsibility is to our European consumers and that we want a just and fair deal for everybody."
"You can also be assured that our FVO missions to third countries will be very strict."
"We shall remain vigilant and if something goes wrong, we shall try to put it right."
"We shall remain vigilant and strict."
"Whether more farms are put on the list or not depends entirely on the Brazilian authorities, and on whether they are prepared to spend the money that they have to spend in order to have their farms approved in accordance with our standards and to be able to export."
"If they do not, then they will not."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The European Union's food safety regulations are the most stringent and high-level in the world."
"However, compliance with these regulations incurs significant additional costs for Europe's farmers."
"European products cannot be put at a disadvantage to products originating from third countries simply because the latter have been produced according to a lower level of food industry regulations."
"The health of European consumers must not be endangered by products which are not of the appropriate quality and are unsafe."
"Meat products can carry a particularly wide range of health risks if they are not produced in the appropriate conditions."
"This is why the European Commission and Member States must ensure that identical conditions apply to meat products produced within the EU and originating from third countries."
"Ladies and gentlemen, recently, the European Commission has noted a significant rise in beef imports from third countries, in particular, from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay."
"To import any product to the EU, including beef, high Community standards must be met, standards which have recently been made more rigorous by the European Commission."
"Very often, however, products coming from third countries do not meet these food safety standards."
"Despite this, their significantly lower price makes them competitive in the marketplace."
"This is also why a key question at the moment is the support of our farmers, and promotion of European products, which meet high standards and are healthy and safe."
"The subject we are discussing has another aspect."
"We should draw conclusions from the critical situation in the dairy market."
"Perhaps today, when, in many EU Member States, we cannot cope with the overproduction of milk, it would be worth thinking about how to reorganise beef production. Thank you for your attention."

"Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report - 2008 (debate)"
"The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report."
"President of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to have the opportunity to take part in your debate today about the Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors on the implementation of the budget for the 2008 financial year, which I have already presented to you, Mr President, and to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 10 November."
"We have four key messages in this year's annual report."
"First, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on the accounts for the second year running."
"It concludes that the accounts present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position, results and cash-flows of the European Union at the year's end."
"In other words, the final accounts for 2008 present a true and fair view, although due attention should be paid to addressing weaknesses in the systems of a number of directorates-general of the Commission."
"As regards the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions, the second key message is that there has been an overall decrease in the level of irregularity in recent years. But the level of irregularity remains too high in some areas."
"As in previous years, for 2008, the Court gives an unqualified opinion on Revenue and on commitments."
"The picture for payments, however, continues to be mixed."
"For Administrative and other expenditure, the Court gives an unqualified opinion as in previous years."
"The Court also gives an unqualified opinion on education and citizenship, estimating that the error rate has fallen below 2%."
"This result is mainly due to a high proportion of advance payments in 2008, which have a lower risk of error than interim and final payments."
"Systems in this area continue, however, to be assessed as only partially effective."
"For Agriculture and natural resources, the Court concludes that, except for rural development, payments were, in all material respects, legal and regular."
"This is the first time the Court gives a qualified opinion and not an adverse one."
"The overall error rate for this policy group is under 2%, a decrease with respect to previous years."
"Deficiencies in supervisory and control systems related to rural development contributed significantly to the Court's overall assessment of systems as only partially effective."
"The Court also gives a qualified opinion to the policy group Economic and financial affairs due to errors found in transactions relating to the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development."
"For the policy groups Cohesion, Research, energy and transport and External aid, development and enlargement, the Court continues to give adverse opinions concluding that they are affected by material error, although to different levels."
"Cohesion remains the area most affected by error."
"The Court estimates that at least 11% of the total of EUR 24.8 billion reimbursed during 2008 in respect of the 2000-2006 programming period should not have been reimbursed."
"The Commission has claimed that the correction and recovery mechanisms mitigate the effects of the errors."
"However, the Court considers that Member States do not provide sufficiently complete and reliable information on financial corrections to support this claim."
"And the Court found cases of Member States replacing ineligible expenditure rejected by the Commission with new expenditure which was also ineligible."
"As regards the 2007-2013 programming period, almost all payments are pre-financing, for which there are relatively few conditions."
"It is therefore too early to say whether changes to rules or systems have reduced the level of errors."
"However, delays in approving Member States' systems descriptions, compliance assessments and audit strategies have slowed budgetary implementation and may increase the risk that control systems do not prevent or detect errors in the start-up phase."
"Although there continues to be a material level of error in Research, energy and transport, remedial measures taken by the Commission have helped to reduce it."
"Nevertheless, legal requirements remain complex and control systems continue to be only partially effective."
"Payments for External aid, development and enlargement also continue to be materially affected by errors, with weaknesses in systems for external aid and development assistance mainly at the level of the implementing bodies and delegations."
"Overall, error rates appear to be decreasing but legal frameworks continue to be complex and problems remain in some control systems."
"Reducing the level of irregular payments further will therefore require the continuing improvement of supervisory and control systems and, where appropriate, the simplification of rules and regulations."
"The third key message of the Annual Report is that the Court's recommendations from previous years on improving supervisory and control systems continue to be valid because the relevant measures are part of an ongoing process where it will take time before they can be deemed to be effective."
"The priority remains to address the specific weaknesses the Court has found in the areas where the most problems have been detected, many of which I have just outlined."
"Particular attention should also continue to be paid to improving the financial correction and recovery mechanisms in anticipation of the closure of the 2000-2006 programming period."
"In addition, the Commission should continue to monitor the effectiveness of systems and identify where more could be achieved from existing expenditure controls, or where it would be appropriate to consider revising the programmes or schemes involved."
"In the context of such revisions, the legislative authorities and the Commission should consider trying to set a level of residual risk of irregularity to be achieved by the system, that is, the tolerable risk of error, rather than specifying the number of checks to be undertaken, as is the case now."
"But there is a limit to the reduction of the level of irregularity that can be achieved by improving the effectiveness of supervisory and control systems."
"This brings me to the fourth and last key message of this Annual Report."
"Simplification remains a priority if further significant and sustainable reductions in the level of irregular payments are to be achieved."
"The areas where the Court finds too high levels of errors are those where there are complicated and unclear legal requirements, such as eligibility rules."
"An example of where serious efforts have already been made to simplify the expenditure schemes is agriculture, the main area of improvement found by the Court."
"The Court also maintains the view that well-designed rules and regulations which are clear to interpret and simple to apply not only decrease the risk of error but can also reduce the costs of controls."
"However, simplification needs to be applied with caution in order to find the right balance between simplification and establishment of policy objectives, avoiding unintended side-effects such as less focused expenditure."
"In addition, as the Court has also emphasised, simplification should be applied alongside the principles of clarity of objectives, realism, transparency and accountability when revising or reforming the arrangements for European Union spending."
"The intended proposals for a revision of the financial regulation, a new financial framework and a reformed budget will provide opportunities for doing so during the mandate of the new Commission."
"The entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty will also bring changes to the management of European Union funds and the scrutiny of their use, strengthening the role of this Parliament."
"These changes will have important implications for the Court's work and should serve to reinforce accountability and transparency, thereby contributing to building the confidence and trust of the citizens in the European Union institutions."
"Mr President, honourable Members, this is an important moment of renewal for the European Union, and the intended reforms provide a great opportunity for further improving the financial management of the European Union."
"At times of renewal and reform, it is also important, however, to remember the lessons of the past."
"I believe the Court plays a vital role in such circumstances by providing reports and opinions that not only identify existing problems but also make recommendations for the future."
"The Court therefore looks forward to continuing to work together with its partner institutions to make the most of the current opportunities for further improving the European Union's financial management."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Court's annual report for 2008."
"I have already had the opportunity to thank the Court for the very good cooperation enjoyed again this year."
"We have had a very fruitful dialogue and the report is very constructive."
"As you have just heard President Caldeira state, the level of irregularity has decreased overall in recent years."
"Things really started to improve five years ago, and, since 2004, the 'red area', where the Court finds the most errors and for which it gives a 'red card', has been reduced by half."
"For 2008, the report shows a completely clean opinion on the accounts for the second year in a row, as a result of the major achievement of the thorough reform and transition to accrual accounting."
"Secondly, for the first time, agriculture, taken as a whole, has now become 'clean and green'."
"This can certainly be attributed to the substantial simplification efforts of recent years."
"Thirdly, the policy group entitled 'education and citizenship' has also become green."
"For research in general, things are improving and the Court points out that irregularities are essentially linked to the Sixth Framework Programme, which allows hope that the improved and simplified Seventh Framework Programme rules will bring a better result."
"Again, as last year, the Court has found no red light for the management and control systems."
"Moreover, all annual activity reports by Commission services are deemed by the Court to give reasonable assurance, with or without qualifications, that internal control systems ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions."
"This said, the report also clearly charts the work that still needs to be done."
"The 'red area' is now about 30%, corresponding to cohesion spending, which is the one area where the Court has still not found significant progress in the level of irregularities."
"This was perhaps to be expected, given that in 2008, the Court did not audit payments made under the improved systems set up for the new 2007-2013 programming period."
"In this regard, the Commission notes that the Court's findings on cohesion largely coincide with our own general assessment."
"For the structural funds, the Commission had reservations in 2008 because of deficiencies in the control systems for Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, the United Kingdom, France, Poland and Luxembourg."
"The Commission is not shy regarding transparency as to where the systemic problems lie."
"The names of these Member States were published back in June in the Commission's synthesis report."
"The Court also reminds us of the essential role of complete and reliable information from all Member States on financial corrections."
"We need this to prove that multiannual control systems work and to mitigate the effects of the errors detected."
"The Court further recommends that the Commission should continue to strive to gain assurance from the annual summaries of all Member States, as well as from voluntary initiatives by certain Member States, in the form of national declarations, or by supreme audit institutions."
"The Commission agrees that we obviously need to be able to count on quality inputs from Member States."
"We see improvements, but we are also considering strengthening the legal base to accelerate the process."
"Finally, the Court emphasises the importance of clear objectives, transparent and easy-to-understand rules, and effective supervision."
"This reduces the risk of error and the costs of control."
"However, it is not something that can be achieved from one day to the next and, of course, the upcoming reviews of the budget, the financial framework and the financial regulation present opportunities not to be missed."
"What we need to do now is to improve assurances obtained from Member States for structural funds, striving for more simplification, which increasingly will require changes to the legislation governing the various programmes."
"The revision of the Financial Regulation is currently under consultation, and the Commission will make proposals in spring 2010."
"We also need to define together an acceptable ratio between costs and risk - the so-called 'tolerable risk of error'."
"The European Parliament has, in the past, strongly supported the Commission's efforts to achieve a positive statement of assurance."
"Now that our efforts are becoming measurable, I hope I can count on its continuing backing to move forward."
"The 2008 discharge procedure starts in the last days of this Commission and is expected to conclude in the early months of the next Commission."
"Even though it concerns last year's budget, let us make it a forward-looking procedure."
"Mr President, President of the Court of Auditors, Commissioner, today is a successful day for the Court of Auditors, but also for the Committee on Budgetary Control, for the Commission and, above all, for you Mr Kallas."
"You have a highly successful track record and not all of your colleagues can say that about themselves."
"In recent years, we have seen a clear improvement in budgetary and financial management and this improvement is due to the advice and consultancy provided by the Court of Auditors."
"For this reason, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very warmly and congratulate it on producing reports that are increasingly easy to understand."
"The traffic light system is a good solution, because it sends out clear messages."
"We have succeeded in raising the aspirations of everyone involved by the use of this system."
"I would also like to thank the relevant offices of the Commission, because their work has been good and they have realised that something needs to be done in these areas."
"However, 31% of the budget is still coloured in red."
"We will definitely be focusing on this in the years to come."
"There are some areas which are in a better position according to the classification of the Court of Auditors, for example external aid."
"However, we also know, of course, that external aid is only in a better position because it is not possible to control the budget aid and because the use of the funds, for example, via the United Nations, merits complaints by the relevant Director General, but not even a reserve in his annual report."
"Our focus will be on the forthcoming 2008 discharge procedure for the structural funds and external aid."
"There are more than 5 000 external aid positions in the delegations and more than 2 000 in the Directorate General for External Relations and in the development aid department in Brussels."
"This is something which it would be good to discuss with the new Commissioner for External Relations."
"In the case of the structural funds, we have made good progress by naming and shaming those involved, but we have definitely not reached the end of the road yet."
"We must deal with the problems in this area at source."
"You have mentioned some of our Member States and I believe that the Commission must significantly increase its efforts with regard to our two newest members, Romania and Bulgaria, otherwise we will have lasting problems there."
"The Commission's lack of strategy for these two countries is causing considerable concern."
"They need more support, otherwise the EU, as a community based on the rule of law, runs the risk of ceasing to exist."
"I would like to congratulate you and to tell you that you can rely on the solidarity and the highly constructive cooperation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) in the budget discharge procedure."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, allow me to begin in a very similar way to Mrs Gräßle, with an expression of great esteem for Mr Kallas and the Court of Auditors for their ongoing cooperation, which has meant that from year to year, when we look at the statistics, we see a clear improvement in management of the budget, reporting, annual reports and evaluations."
"We also see the efforts which are made in these areas to ensure that our budgetary procedures are correct in every respect."
"Secondly, we see the efforts which are made to reach agreement on areas which do require improvement, and we see that these areas are subsequently improved, starting with procedures and ending at management, monitoring, control and the form of the final report."
"We are very concerned about those areas in which no significant improvement has been observed."
"Mr Caldeira mentioned those areas in his speech."
"May I return to two of them, which seem to be especially significant."
"The first area is that of cohesion funds and funds related to regional policy."
"From our point of view, something which is extremely important is that we receive answers to two questions."
"Firstly, why is it that the programmes planned and declared by the Commission for the recovery of funds which have been spent improperly, or at least for explaining these situations, have not made any progress?"
"Secondly, it was declared that the year 2008 would definitely be better. However, 2008 was just the same as 2007, so those declarations have come to nothing."
"We have a question which we will want to ask during the hearing of the Commissioners: were the measures envisaged properly envisaged, and were the declarations which were made correct and are they still valid?"
"We welcome every kind of simplification, although not if this means accepting provisions which are primitive."
"We welcome the formula of advance payment, because this makes it easier for the beneficiary countries to use the funds."
"After all, the objective was quite simple - get the funds to the user, achieve the intended benefits, and achieve them on time."
"However, it seems that, perhaps especially during the last two years, some of the funds have been used by beneficiary countries to improve the current result on the budgetary side, although not for implementation in accordance with the area envisaged for financial support."
"Therefore, while we evaluate highly the direction in which we are moving, we do have certain reservations concerning some areas, which we will have great satisfaction in discussing during the hearing of the Commissioners."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome and thank the President of the Court of Auditors, with whom we have worked productively during this period."
"As Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, I have always maintained that the role played by the Court of Auditors is fundamental."
"It is fundamental because the Court operates in a very sensitive sector, which people throughout the European Union watch with great interest and with a critical eye where the transparency, accuracy and legality of expenditure and of the management of public funds are concerned."
"I believe that it must be reiterated today that the Court should always be guaranteed independence and autonomy when carrying out its work because this is fundamental if we are to be able to evaluate properly and to make good decisions."
"Likewise, we ask the Court to put Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control in a position to carry out their own work as productively as possible."
"We must find the right balance which allows public funds to be spent effectively and efficiently, because these funds are aimed at important objectives such as economic development and job creation."
"At the same time, there must be severe punishments for serious irregularities and errors, which the Court has also uncovered in the last financial year, whilst an attempt must be made to avoid unnecessary formalities and red tape."
"As Mr Kallas was also saying, Parliament must strive to find an equilibrium in the tolerable risk of error."
"The report, which we have read with great interest, provides some insights, but also includes many grey areas."
"We must strive to achieve the best results regarding these grey areas."
"As my fellow Members have also mentioned, the main problems primarily concern the Structural and Cohesion Funds."
"It is true that the Court, in doing its job, points out errors and irregularities in relation to these funds."
"However, those who are able to look deeply into and to analyse matters can see that, behind the errors highlighted, there are even graver issues, as the judicial experiences of several countries in recent years demonstrate."
"There may be fraud, there may be deception."
"I am specifically referring to one or two errors revealed such as the contravention of rules on procurement, over-invoicing and so on. We must endeavour to make improvements in this area."
"I believe that the Commission should promote Member States which behave in a virtuous manner, and punish and penalise Member States which do comply with the rules."
"Furthermore, I believe it is very important for OLAF to use the Court of Auditors' suggestions as a starting point and to further improve its work because it is in everyone's interest that it does so."
"I think it is only through cooperation among various institutions, namely Parliament, the Court of Auditors and OLAF, that we will manage to safeguard the financial interests of all EU citizens."
"There are certainly a great many positive things to say today."
"For the second time in a row, we can speak of an unqualified opinion on the accounts."
"The level of the irregularities is decreasing."
"The traffic light system, whose lights all used to be on red, is gradually showing more and more amber, yellow and, in particular, green."
"These are all positive aspects."
"Another positive aspect is agriculture, which used to be a real source of concern."
"For years on end, we have regarded IACS - the system ensuring common management of agricultural expenditure - as a good system."
"We had seen Member States such as Greece failing to take part."
"These are obviously all things that are moving in the right direction."
"All the same, there are sources of concern."
"These include cohesion, research and development, energy, transport, and the whole chapter on external aid, development and enlargement."
"In my opinion, therefore, we must try to select a number of issues for attention from the discharge we are addressing today."
"Cohesion will be one such issue."
"I would remind the House of the notorious comment in paragraph 6.17 that up to 11% of the expenditure in respect of the Structural Funds, European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund should not actually have been disbursed."
"In my opinion, we must ask the competent Commissioners many questions about this and look at the precise state of affairs."
"Then there is external aid, development and enlargement; the whole package of funds that we channel to the United Nations."
"Once again, I read in the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors that - like other organisations - the Court has insufficient or even no access to the accounts of the United Nations, which means that large amounts of European funds channelled to this organisation cannot, in fact, be properly controlled."
"A third issue to be addressed is the whole system of comanagement."
"As the general rapporteur has pointed out, 80% of all European funds are actually spent within the framework of comanagement, by the Member States and the Commission."
"We must now, once again, exert pressure on the Member States' finance ministers, in particular, to ensure that they shoulder their responsibility and issue a declaration stating that they have done their jobs properly, that their administration has spent funds correctly, and that this has been subject to controls."
"I myself am responsible for own resources on the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"The whole VAT dossier continues to cause me concern."
"We have published various reports on the subject, including in the previous parliamentary term."
"According to estimates, total VAT fraud Europe-wide amounts to EUR 80-100 billion."
"The Court of Auditors has made a number of observations on this, too."
"Therefore, I should like to devote particular attention to this matter in the discharge."
"I should like to finish off by mentioning the discharge for the other institutions."
"I myself am rapporteur for Parliament's discharge."
"In my opinion, the key issues in this regard should include public procurement procedures, where problems are apparent."
"Finally, concerning the Council's discharge, we granted that discharge earlier this week."
"This Court of Auditors' report, too, raises some very negative points about the Council."
"In my opinion, we must continually exert pressure on the Council to grant access to its accounts such as to allow Parliament to properly control this kind of ... (speaker moved away from the microphone) too."
"Mr President, today's debate is one of the most important debates in the European Parliament, because our voters, tax payers and citizens of EU Member States are very interested in transparency in the operation of European institutions and, in particular, of the European Commission."
"On the one hand, this is an argument for the eurosceptics, while on the other hand, we do know that in recent years, there have been many irregularities in this area."
"I will remind you of the situation at the end of 1999 and the beginning of 2000, when the Court of Auditors published devastating criticism of the European Commission, and it was, at the time, absolutely justified."
"Today, we can see clear progress in this area, but I am drawing attention to the importance of this debate, because if we are looking for sources of greater authority for the European Union and EU institutions, then these principles of transparency are extremely significant."
"If, last week, that authority was weakened by the way in which the most senior leaders of the European Union were elected, it is regained by debates just such as this one today."
"I would like to stress that it would most certainly be good if Mr Caldeira could expand a little on something."
"He spoke of six countries which return information in the wrong way, and mentioned two large countries, Poland and Great Britain."
"We are surely justified in wanting to hear details of these improprieties."
"I would like to stress that advance payments are a very positive development, but they do also have a certain disadvantage because, in fact, governments often use this money for electoral purposes."
"Mr President, I would like to begin by expressing my satisfaction that there appears to have been progress in respect of irregular payments from the EU budget."
"This is a good thing, of course."
"However, it has also been observed, at the same time, that there are enormous problems when it comes to cohesion - and cohesion is the second largest area of the budget, totalling EUR 36.6 billion in 2008."
"It is a massive problem for the ordinary taxpayers of the EU that at least 11% of the total approved amount should not have been paid out."
"This is a huge problem."
"How are we supposed to explain that, year after year - and it really is year after year in this area - billions of kroner are paid out in contravention of the rules or perhaps even in a directly fraudulent way?"
"In its recommendations, the Court of Auditors focuses on improving control mechanisms and simplifying the rules, and that is a good thing."
"The question is, however, whether this waste on a massive scale really can be reduced just through monitoring and simplifying the rules, or whether what we are dealing with is fundamental structural failings."
"Our group believes in solidarity."
"We support the redistribution of money from the richest to the poorest regions and countries both inside and outside the EU, but, if you read the report, the question is whether the EU has found the right way of doing this."
"Is it an effective way of working for every country to pay into a system that then grants subsidies to the remotest elements in the individual countries, including the fact that these are paid by the very richest?"
"Everyone knows that the longer a line, the greater the risk of loss somewhere along the way."
"There is therefore a need for us to have a fundamental debate about the whole issue of cash flows in the EU."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, I am sorry to dissent, but as an experienced accountant, I do not share my colleagues' optimism about the opinion of the auditors."
"The Court of Auditors' annual report on the 2008 accounts shows no significant improvement."
"10 years after the resignation of the Santer Commission, and many promises of reform, the EU's funds continue to be out of control."
"The auditors state that the accounts are fair but fail to state that they are true, and indeed it is difficult to say they are true if they go on to express concern about the quality of the financial information."
"The report reveals that, 10 years after the initiation of the administrative reform, the European Commission does not operate an integrated accounting system, and that directorates introduce transactions in their local systems, some of which have not even been blessed by the chief accountant of the European Commission."
"Moreover, on the legality and regularity of the EU expenditure, the auditors only cleared 9% of the expenses for the year 2008, a percentage similar to the past."
"They give an adverse opinion on 43% of the budget, the part that relates to cohesion funds, research, energy and transport, external aid, development and enlargement."
"For the remaining 48%, they give a qualified opinion."
"Such a report would call for the resignation of the board of auditors of any company and its subsequent liquidation, but here nobody is worried."
"The auditors even identified an amount of EUR 1.5 billion that, in their own words, should not have been paid."
"The first argument you will hear is that the auditors are not saying that it is fraud, but only errors."
"They will say that fraud requires criminal intent, and we have to prove this, and then we need to call the police."
"The second argument that you will hear is that the rules are too complex."
"They have been saying this for years, but the rules have not changed, so should we then blame the European Commission for maintaining complex rules that encourage errors?"
"The third argument is that it is the member countries which should be blamed for the errors."
"Well, the treaties clearly specify that the European Commission is responsible for the management of the European Union funds, and in fact, it is the only body empowered to stop payments when it does not receive sufficient evidence that the funds are properly spent."
"The fact is that these errors mean that taxpayers' money has been abused."
"But, to be honest, nobody cares about this."
"It is just taxpayers' money we are dealing with."
"It is only the money of people who are now struggling to pay their mortgages and educate their children."
"But all this is not enough."
"On top of the EUR 116 billion payments for the year 2008 that have been audited by the Court of Auditors, another EUR 40 billion has gone out of the European Union coffers."
"Thirty-five per cent of the budget is now hidden in a balance sheet account under the name of 'Prefinancing' and for which the auditors cannot tell the European taxpayers if it has been properly spent."
"These additional advance payments have been made precisely in the areas where the Court of Auditors found the biggest number of errors."
"For how long is this Parliament going to allow taxpayers' money to be abused?"
"(NL) Mr President, on behalf of the Dutch Party for Freedom, I should like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors for the institution's 2008 Annual Report."
"After all, this report has made us aware that approximately 11% of the Cohesion Fund for 2008 should never have been spent."
"This represents EUR 4 billion that has been swept under the carpet."
"The Council, the Commission and - with a few exceptions - this Parliament too, for that matter, are anxious to remain silent."
"My party considers this sordid."
"I should like to hear what the Commission intends to do about this."
"How will it make sure that those EUR 4 billion are returned?"
"For example, is it prepared to ask the countries that should never have spent the money to pay it back?"
"If not, why not?"
"I should also like to hear from the European Court of Auditors whether, in the interests of the transparency of the Commission's expenditure, the Court also examines all the declarations issued by Members of the European Commission."
"If so, can the Court send those declarations to Parliament, and if not, why not?"
"I should like to hear a response to this from the European Court of Auditors."
"(PL) Mr President, the debate on the vote of approval is more interesting each year, as Members of Parliament probe ever deeper into the details."
"In this debate it is important, firstly, to ascertain the facts, secondly, to explain the causes of those facts, and, thirdly, to draw conclusions."
"As far as the facts are concerned, then it is very interesting for us as Members of Parliament to note the methods employed by the Court of Auditors."
"However, it is even more interesting that in the results section, the European Commission does not agree with the diagnosis made by the Court of Auditors."
"During the debate, we would like to clarify the differences of opinion between the Commission and the Court of Auditors."
"Secondly, it is very important to ascertain if we are dealing with mistakes, if we are dealing with improprieties, or if we are dealing with crimes."
"Lumping everything together blurs the image, and confuses discussion on the subject as to whether we need to correct mistakes or call in the police."
"As for explaining the causes, I would like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that the document which we have before us shows that we have very serious improprieties in the public procurement system."
"In relation to this, the problem is not only a question of financial movements, but is also one of explaining and simplifying matters related to public procurement."
"The final matter concerns the conclusions."
"There may be very different kinds of conclusions. Firstly, conclusions concerning control methods, conclusions concerning responsibility, but also conclusions concerning future policy."
"They are the easiest."
"It is very easy to draw the conclusion that since the money is being spent incorrectly, and we still have doubts in this area, then the best thing to do is to reduce spending on that area of policy."
"We should be very careful of such conclusions, because financial monitoring is one thing, monitoring of policy effectiveness is another, and a decision on future directions of EU activity is yet another."
"(ES) Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr da Silva Caldeira in particular for presenting this report of the Court of Auditors, which has progressed from being an opportunity for scandal and calls to Europhobia to being a really constructive exercise, with clear motivational messages regarding the capacity for improvement of both the European institutions and the Member States, suggesting the instruments needed to make those improvements."
"All of this has taken place without losing any of the growing rigour and professionalism of the Court of Auditors which, moreover, has been the first to apply to itself all the principles stated by Mr da Silva Caldeira."
"It so happens that I have been a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control at a crucial time, and I thank you for the changes that you have made, because they are a great help to us."
"I would, of course, also like to thank Mr Kallas, because he wisely listened to the European Parliament's requirements expressed in the Committee on Budgetary Control, which was not an easy task."
"The management control system is making progress, and we only hope that it will be extended and deepened."
"I support the statement made not long ago that the best statement of assurance ever has been achieved, but although this is a success story for the three institutions present, the Court of Auditors, the Commission and Parliament, there is still a long way to go."
"For example, we are still concerned about the obvious contradictions in the report, between the Court of Auditors and the Commission, in the important area of budgetary support and adaptation to national reform plans."
"What is also very concerning this year is the control of the third pillar of the European Development Fund, joint management with organisations."
"My colleagues from the United Nations, the African Union and other organisations have talked about this already."
"It represents between 6 and 7% of the EDF and, of course, efficient formulas need to be used or found in order to put an end to this intolerable lack of transparency."
"As far as staffing is concerned, once again turnover is too high and there are too many temporary staff, which means that the sense of continuity that is so essential for this type of programme is being lost."
"There is also a lack of systematisation of the controls that come from the delegations."
"In addition, as the Court of Auditors says, there are significant errors and a high incidence of non-quantifiable errors, which should be improved."
"We are, however, encouraged by the path that the Commission and the Court of Auditors have begun to take together in order to arrive at a definition of a tolerable margin of error, which we think is the right way to go."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, I can see both good things and bad things in the presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report on the EU budget."
"First of all, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for a clearer, bolder and more political report which is easier for us to understand."
"The good areas include the management of the budget as a whole."
"In contrast to recent years, this has improved."
"This is, above all, the result of better management of funds in the area of agriculture and natural resources, which has been our biggest headache over the last few years."
"For the first time, Mr Caldeira, you do not give an adverse opinion in your report and that is good news."
"The report highlights the fact that wherever the EU itself controls and administers the funds, there is proper budget management."
"Whether it is efficient is another matter."
"I would like to congratulate Mr Kallas warmly in this respect."
"It is to your credit and during your period of office that this visible improvement has taken place."
"Congratulations!"
"However, it is now the responsibility of the Member States in particular to improve their control systems."
"If there is continuing cause for criticism of budgetary management in the EU, this is not at an EU level - as we have now seen - but at the level of the Member States."
"This is where the problems lie."
"Cohesion policy, for example, which is implemented by the Member States and which receives around a third of the funds, is the major problem area."
"You say that 11% is irregular and the non-attached Member said that the figure was EUR 4 billion."
"That is not correct."
"It is over EUR 2.5 billion, which you specifically state is taxpayers' money that should not have been spent."
"We must say this quite clearly and we must introduce clear controls."
"However, the consequence is that the European Commission must continue to exert pressure on the Member States and we will support you in this area, Mr Kallas."
"We must implement a policy of naming and shaming."
"We must publicly shame the wasteful Member States, which continue to exist, and describe the situation clearly."
"Overall, you come to the conclusion that the regulations must be simplified."
"We would like to support you in this and we would like to add one other request."
"There must be an increased focus not only on regularity but also on efficiency, to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent correctly."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to refer to Chapter 7 of the Court of Auditors' report which concerns research, energy and transport."
"First of all, I would like to express my considerable gratitude to the Court of Auditors for its thorough work."
"However, it is clear from this chapter that the Court of Auditors is not able to award good marks to this area in its annual report."
"This is an area in which expenditure amounts to more than EUR 9 billion."
"According to the assessment of the Court of Auditors, the error rate is between 2 and 5%."
"In other words, on the basis of this calculation, between EUR 180 and 450 million has been incorrectly spent."
"The Court of Auditors' conclusion is that this is 'partially effective' and I see this in terms of marks at school as at best a C minus."
"In my opinion, it is strange that the Commission does not feel it necessary to give its opinion on this."
"To me, the Commission's silence seems highly eloquent."
"In its recommendation, the Court of Auditors says that the Commission should continue its work of simplifying the financial regulations."
"I agree with this."
"The committee responsible has had discussions along the same lines."
"However, I do not agree that the Commission, in giving its opinion on the Court of Auditors' recommendation, is turning this recommendation on its head."
"The Court of Auditors says that the aim of simplifying the regulations must be combined with the aim of cost-effective control which will be sufficient to ensure that the money is spent correctly."
"In contrast, the Commission says that it wants cost-effective control and suggests that there is a tolerable risk of error, which must be taken into account from the start."
"This is not a reasonable way of dealing with taxpayers' money."
"The Commission should rethink what it has said and Parliament should support the Court of Auditors in its critical activities."
"Mr President, I welcome the report of the Court of Auditors and welcome a clean set of accounts without an adverse report on these accounts for the EU for the first time, especially after so many years of falling foul of this important process and a mission that would have put any private company in breach of multiple EU directives."
"However, I would like to concentrate on the area of continued significant weakness, namely the area of structural and cohesion funds."
"While the Commission may consider it is an achievement that only 11% of the largest part of the budget - cohesion spending - contained errors, I consider it a shocking fact that it has been determined that almost EUR 5 billion of a EUR 46 billion budget should never have been paid out, as described by the Court of Auditors."
"I have to say that my region of Wales, already in receipt of structural funds from that EUR 46 billion pot, could happily have spent and accounted for the spending of that additional EUR 5 billion."
"Wales has not had to return any funds for mis-spending, despite the UK as a whole not receiving a clean bill of health."
"Errors seem to be at the level of implementing institutions, and therefore I ask that the European Parliament and Commission call for the individual Member States to provide a thorough audit for the funds received."
"In Wales, the Welsh Assembly government, via the various institutions, administers EU structural and cohesion funds and, therefore, to conduct a formal audit could not be too onerous."
"However, currently, projects which were funded some seven years ago by the EU are only now undergoing financial audit by the Court of Auditors."
"I am not sure what this achieves."
"We need an annual contemporary signing-off which can identify errors and ensure compliance to the highest standard."
"When taxpayers' money is at stake, as it is across the EU in the case of the regional budget, standards of accountability can never be too high."
"(NL) I should like to say a few things about the European Commission's expenditure in the framework of external relations."
"According to the Court of Auditors, more errors were made in this field in 2008 than in 2007; and these errors were found in all the areas of external policy."
"I find it shocking that many errors are occurring in procurement with regard to projects."
"The Commission keeps a watchful eye over procurement procedures in the Member States, and so I receive regular cries for help from our representatives in municipalities and provinces concerning complicated, obscure procedures."
"The fear of doing things wrong in the eyes of the Commission is great."
"Yet who is the Commission to monitor our local authorities if it makes errors itself time after time in procurement concerning its own projects?"
"What is the Commissioner's own opinion of this?"
"The Commission likes to present itself as the 28th donor."
"I wonder how effective this is, and I find it regrettable, in itself, that the otherwise very good report by the Court of Auditors does not include detailed information on effectiveness, and that this subject is raised merely incidentally in separate reports."
"Could information on the effectiveness of policy be included in future?"
"To give an example, I read in the report that, with regard to budget support, there are insufficient controls on compliance with payment conditions."
"In other words, the Commission has been handing countries a bag of money without applying sufficient controls."
"What conditions does the Commission actually impose, however?"
"Also, to what extent is it gauging whether budget support is actually helping countries' development?"
"I cannot find anything about this in the report, indeed, nor can there be anything there in view of the approach taken."
"On a more general note, when I read how carelessly the Commission spends the funds allocated to it, I really wonder whether we would perhaps do better to leave development expenditure in the hands of the Member States themselves."
"It is clear that the Commission has taken little notice of the recommendations of the Court of Auditors, and so I wish to ask the President of the Court whether it is not dispiriting to find, year after year, that the Commission has failed to put its house in order in this regard."
"(NL) In respect of the 2008 financial year, the European Court of Auditors has found many errors concerning the Structural Funds, regional development and the research programme."
"This is due to the rules on grants being too many in number and too complicated."
"The European Court of Auditors rightly underlines the importance of simplifying the rules."
"In October, authorities from four Member States submitted to the President of the European Commission an opinion on reducing the pressure of EU rules."
"They recommended the establishment of an external, independent commission to reduce the pressure of rules at EU level."
"This represents a step in the right direction in the context of the better lawmaking strategy."
"Where does the European Commission stand on this?"
"Endeavours to improve financial management must not be limited to the simplification of rules, however."
"Enhanced supervision and control are also needed."
"The European Commission and the Member States must draw up an action plan to this end."
"National management declarations to begin with, then, which must subsequently lead to a positive statement of assurance by Europe."
"Does the European Court of Auditors consider such an action plan to be a useful instrument for improving financial management?"
"In my opinion, such an action plan would help give financial management the political priority it so badly needs."
"After all, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim is to ensure that EU expenditure ends up in the right place at the right time."
"(NL) The latest Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors again gives perplexing insights into the way the European Union handles European taxpayers' money."
"The Court of Auditors has ascertained on the basis of realistic samples that, in the 2000-2006 period, an estimated 11% of the total amount of EUR 36.6 billion under the Cohesion Fund should not have been disbursed."
"This means that more than EUR 4 billion in grants has been handed out erroneously."
"Looking at the situation in Belgium, the Court of Auditors, too, says that a large proportion of the funds spent in Wallonia - Hainaut, in particular - was misspent."
"This actually confirms what one of our fellow Members said in this House a few months before the latest European Parliament elections, which was that the European grants had not produced the desired results in Wallonia, particularly in comparison with other European regions, and that it was not only Wallonia itself but also the European Union that was responsible for ultimately approving these projects."
"At present, most financial transfers are very indirect, passing through many intermediate stations."
"Tackling this must be a priority and, at the same time, of course, the existing control mechanisms need to be improved."
"(FR) Mr President, President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, thank you President Caldeira for this very high-quality report, thank you Mr Kallas for all the work you have done, and congratulations on your new appointment within our European Commission."
"We welcome this."
"Regarding the annual accounts, as it did last year, the Court has issued an unreserved positive statement of assurance."
"I would like to congratulate the accounting officer, Mr Taverne, and his predecessor, Brian Gray, while reiterating my incomprehension regarding the negative equity of EUR 47 billion, which is essentially due to the fact that we are not accounting for the claims that we have on Member States based on the commitments that they have made for staff pensions."
"I would like to remind you that the total amounts to EUR 38 billion as at 31 December 2008, which is an increase of EUR 4 billion per year."
"Regarding the underlying transactions, President Caldeira, please could you make it clear to Parliament whether the Court is issuing a positive or negative statement of assurance?"
"The Court's opinion is divided into five paragraphs, which list opinions by political group, and I am having difficulty distinguishing this from the statement of assurance, provided for in Article 248 of the treaty, which also states that the Court may make specific assessments for each major area of Community activity."
"Regarding the content, aside from cohesion spending, the observations are positive."
"With regard to cohesion spending, there are too many errors."
"I would also like to ask you whether you think that the number of surveys - for example, 49 for the Social Fund, which represents thousands of transactions - is sufficient for you to establish your opinion."
"The main problem, however, still lies in the area of shared management with Member States and in the fact that too many errors are due to the complex way in which our European finances operate."
"I would like to finish by talking about shared management and the audit chain, and to reiterate my proposal to include the national courts of auditors more in the process since, according to the Council's Decision, we will never have national statements from the governments."
"Article 287(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon gives you this power to approach the national courts of auditors, President Caldeira."
"I would like to reiterate this proposal."
"(DE) Mr President, Mr Kallas, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to thank you, Mr Caldeira, for your introduction and I would like to thank you and the members of the Court of Auditors for your report."
"Parliament will investigate carefully the information you have provided and will act on it in the coming months."
"I was pleased that the previously unacceptable error rate of the common agricultural policy has fallen."
"However, after reading the Court of Auditors' report, I have the impression that one Member State, namely Romania, is responsible for the majority of the remaining irregularities."
"It seems that we must put more emphasis in future on training staff and implementing control systems correctly in the new Member States, if possible, before their accession."
"The European Structural Funds, which many of my fellow Members have already mentioned, represent another cause for concern."
"It is true that the number of irregular payments has fallen when compared with the previous year, but there are still huge problems in ensuring that aid funding is handled without irregularities occurring."
"I would like to say to the Eurosceptic parts of this House that we are talking about 11% of the total payments and not 11% of the budget."
"This amounts to EUR 2.7 billion and not EUR 5 billion."
"I admit that this is still EUR 2.7 billion too much, but we must be accurate for the sake of honesty."
"These irregularities relate mainly to excessive payments and the incorrect use of funds."
"For example, if European Social Fund (ESF) money is used to pay the salary of a public administrator or if European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) money is used to buy a building plot, then the people concerned obviously do not have sufficient information about the correct use of aid funding or the Member States do not have the will or the ability to administer the funding correctly, or perhaps all of the above."
"When we revise the application procedure, we must put in place clear, transparent rules which are easier to understand."
"The Member States must ensure that the applications are monitored more carefully at a national level."
"It is clear that any waste or any irregularities in relation to European taxpayers' money is too much."
"However, anybody who takes an impartial look at the EU and at this report from the European Court of Auditors will find little cause for offence."
"It offers a number of starting points for our work, which consists of making Europe better and more efficient every day."
"On this basis we will implement the discharge procedure for the European Commission."
"(NL) I should like to thank the Court of Auditors for its crystal-clear Annual Report, and I wish to express my particular thanks to Commissioner Kallas for the effort he has put in over recent years."
"In my opinion, he can rightly claim to have made a great deal of progress during that time."
"I should like to highlight three aspects of this Annual Report."
"The first is the fact that the biggest problems still lie with the Member States."
"Many of my fellow Members have already given the example of regional policy, which I can only underline."
"Therefore, I should like to put the following question to the Commission with regard to the national declarations that exist in some Member States: could you perhaps come forward with a specific proposal to make these compulsory for all the Member States of the European Union?"
"The second aspect I wish to emphasise is the volume and complexity of the European rules: another issue that has already been raised by many fellow Members."
"Can we perhaps start a fundamental debate on the way we wish to spend our funds and the rules underpinning this?"
"In my view, at present, this is based too much on suspicion and too little on trust and, when all is said and done, that just breeds more irregularities."
"The final aspect is agriculture."
"It is excellent, of course, that the whole agricultural sector has received a green light for the first time, but we should not pat ourselves too hard on the back."
"Rural development is where the major problem lies, and let that now be the very policy area within agriculture where we see major expansion in coming years."
"Also, the important thing is not only lawfulness but also efficiency as, with regard to the agricultural funds, we are still greatly underperforming in the achievement of our environmental and nature objectives."
"Mr President, European finances do cause great concern to my constituents and to people in Britain."
"The UK is, after all, the second-largest net contributor to the European budget, so other Member States might benefit from remembering, when they are debating this money, that a large part of it comes from British taxpayers' pockets."
"If there is one single issue that drives a wedge between British people and Brussels, it is a perception that their money may be treated frivolously within the EU."
"The same is true in other countries as well."
"This is not just a debate about a set of accounts, but a fundamental breakdown in trust between the institutions represented here and the people we represent back at home."
"We must take note of this auditors' opinion."
"Yes, it is better than previous years, but just as a businessman thinks twice before doing trade with a company that has in any way a qualified opinion, so our residents will think twice about their relationship with the EU so long as qualifications remain."
"We cannot pretend it is the auditors' fault."
"Auditors do not spend money: bureaucracies and governments do, both here and in our home countries."
"We must clean up their acts."
"However, even a clean audit opinion in itself is not enough."
"Ever since I was 18 years old, I have received a monthly statement from my bank."
"The numbers add up."
"The audit opinion would be clean."
"But I know I have not always spent my money wisely."
"If we are to deserve even a shred of respect from our taxpayers back at home, then in this dire economic time, we must treat their money with respect."
"My message to politicians both in our home countries across the EU and in this unnecessary, expensive second chamber in Strasbourg is that we must stop wasting taxpayers' money."
"(DE) We need a revolution in democracy!"
"Mr President, Commissioner, welcome to the new world of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This represents an opportunity for you."
"For 11 years, I have been following your reports in this House, and before that as a journalist, and when it comes down to it, they are all very similar."
"However, now you have the opportunity to look to the future."
"Make use of the professional competence of this House - we are not gathered here today just by chance in this Chamber; I can see Mr Søndergaard and Mr Chatzimarkakis, Mr Staes and on our side, my fellow-combatant Mr Ehrenhauser - and restructure the work of the Court of Auditors."
"Take a look at what works elsewhere, for example in Germany, where it is possible to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and meaningfulness of expenditure, and in Austria, and develop a concept, perhaps as part of an initiative report from Parliament, which describes how the things that you do can be done much better, so that you can genuinely fulfil your obligations."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my view, we MEPs owe it to every tax-paying European citizen to monitor with the appropriate attention the proper, justified and legal use of their taxes in the European Union."
"We owe this to every tax-paying European citizen, regardless of their nationality."
"Fellow Members, I believe that the European Court of Auditors carried out a thorough, professional job when they drafted their 2008 report."
"I would therefore like to thank President Caldeira and every member of the Court of Auditors."
"I also think that suitable technical cooperation has developed between the European Court of Auditors and the European Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, thereby guaranteeing that Parliament can perform its monitoring task in an appropriate manner."
"Credit is also given to Commissioner Kallas for the definite improvement which can be noted over the last few years in terms of the European Commission's financial management activities."
"At the same time, I agree with my fellow Members who say that the Court of Auditors' report contains not only positive points, but also downright appalling and alarming ones."
"Those items which we must definitely mention include the fact that the Court of Auditors had to declare that the error rate for the use of cohesion funds was 11%."
"In my view, in order to rectify the errors, we must establish without fail exactly who was responsible for what omissions, when and where, so that we can guarantee that we rectify these errors for the next time."
"Mr President, when I meet my voters I often describe this institution as a computer, where the Member States provide the hardware, the Commission provides the software, Parliament is probably the keyboard where you can interact, and in that sense, the control by the Court of Auditors is certainly the control panel of the computer."
"We never purchase a computer on the basis of looking at the control panel, but none of our computers works for a long time without a proper control panel system inside."
"I would like to congratulate the Court of Auditors on being an appropriate control panel for this institution and improving, with every year, its own work, but also reminding us to do our own homework on improvement."
"What I learn from the Court of Auditors' reports after being here for six years is that we often make mistakes and that we should try to remind colleagues back in the Member States what they have to do."
"But for me, the most important message is that, when the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, we need to reduce the complexity, to provide better conditions for our expenditure at local level and to get the money in time to those who are applying for it, whether they are small- and medium-sized enterprises, researchers or farmers, back in our countries."
"The message for us is that we have to improve skills at local level."
"We have to further reduce the complexity at European level."
"We have to go for better cooperation among Member States' auditing systems and we have to work together in the future."
"Thank you for the last five years of cooperation."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(SV) Mr President, I would like to thank the Court of Auditors for an excellent piece of work and also Mr Kallas - it is good that you are continuing."
"Hearing the British Members express their criticism is all well and good, but from what I have seen in the newspapers, a lot of British politicians have been less than honest with their money."
"This does not, of course, mean that we cannot improve, but it remains to be seen whether the situation in the Member States really is so much better than that in the EU."
"In the areas where the EU is directly responsible for the budget, the errors are small."
"The shortcomings are with the Member States."
"EUR 2.7 billion is, of course, a very large amount."
"It is an unreasonably large amount and it is totally unacceptable."
"It is a large portion of the EU's budget and the Member States have a clear responsibility in this regard."
"As several of my fellow Members have already said, I think that the Commission ought to ensure that those countries that are refusing to release their financial accounts and submit an auditor's report do in fact do so."
"As Commissioner or the Commission - you do not, of course, know what responsibility you will have in future - you should ensure that these countries do, in fact, improve so that the information is gathered and the supervision can be monitored."
"Europe's taxpayers require this."
"There is also a need for a better and more efficient monitoring system through which it is possible to highlight examples of good practice."
"Mr Søndergaard suggested something at the end of his speech which may nevertheless be the way forward, namely to come up with a completely new budgetary system that gives the Member States better control of the cash flows."
"(Applause)"
"(NL) Mr President, you may be familiar with the film Groundhog Day, about a man who wakes up to the very same day over and over again?"
"Although I am in only my third year as an MEP, I already feel like the protagonist of that film."
"Every year, the Court of Auditors comes here to tell us that, unfortunately, it is unable to give us a statement of assurance and, every year, the European Commission does its level best to emphasise every ray of hope."
"Admittedly, there has been progress - for example in the field of agriculture - but the underlying problems remain."
"Of course, you could increase the permitted error rate, as the European Commission is proposing, but that smacks of moving the goalposts."
"If players fail to score, their coach does not go and widen the goal, but instead sees to it that they play better."
"This requires teamwork."
"Indeed, a positive statement can be obtained only through teamwork - between the European and national auditors - and by means of the national management declarations, as has already been said."
"Unfortunately, the fact is that some countries are still rather freer with European money than with their own, national, funds; it is easier to go shopping with someone else's credit card than with your own."
"Yet you will be confronted with the bill, Commissioner."
"If you and your successor do not manage to get the control activities right, it will be bad not only for budgetary control in the European Union and for you, the European Commission, but also for the legitimacy of us all and of our work."
"Therefore, you can be sure, Commissioner, that Parliament will be watching you and your successor very closely in this regard."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking Mr Caldeira and his team."
"His report will be very useful to us in our deliberations which lead up to the granting of a discharge."
"I have a sense of déjà vu, because as far as I can tell, the Council is once again conspicuous by its absence, just as it was last year."
"I am being so critical because the Council, as one of our major community institutions, cannot and should not stand outside this debate."
"We rightly expect all the Member States to provide control and transparency, but we also expect this from our own institutions and the Council is jointly responsible for what happens or does not happen in the Member States."
"Of course, the irregularities in the budgets do not affect the Council's budget as severely as they do the agricultural sector, but nevertheless, we will also have questions about public procurement, late payments or overdue payments and repeated overestimating."
"We will be discussing this with the Council in the next few weeks."
"It is true that errors are not the same as fraud and that the recovery of payments is a useful tool."
"Another good tool is the process of naming and shaming in the area of agricultural policy which has proved its worth in Bavaria and in the rest of Germany."
"I believe that we should continue to use this method because it has become clear that the Member States and the companies involved react to it."
"We expect the Swedish Presidency to be ready to discuss this over the next few days and also..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FI) Mr President, Mr Caldeira, Commissioner, I wish to thank the European Court of Auditors for its admirable work for the benefit of the European taxpayer."
"The EU accounts allow a 2% margin of error."
"I would say that it is salaries and other administrative costs in particular that need to be dealt with more accurately."
"We cannot allow any uncertainties when it comes to these."
"There are, however, other cost groups where it would seem to be difficult, or even impossible, to achieve a 2% margin of error."
"According to the Court of Auditors, as much as 11% of the total sums spent on cohesion policy are sums that should not have been spent at all."
"The situation was also the same in the two previous years."
"As the situation is such that the 2% threshold cannot be reached, I would like to ask whether the Commission or the Court of Auditors has thought about whether the 2% figure should be reviewed, so that year after year, we do not have to say that there is no way we will achieve the threshold this year and we will not do so next year either."
"In future, we will have to be more careful and function more cost-effectively than we do now, and the application procedure will have to be simplified."
"(PL) Mr President, an analysis of the Court of Auditors' annual report on budget execution for 2008 leads us to the conclusion that the situation is better than in previous years."
"Especially pleasing is the fact that it has been possible to extend significantly correct management of the budget."
"We have observed an exceptionally clear improvement in the case of expenditure on agriculture and rural development, which account for over 40% of the EU budget."
"This is a crucial change in comparison with earlier reports."
"It is a result of reform and simplification of the CAP."
"We now pay out funds based on simple technical requirements."
"On the other hand, the Auditors show up some areas of dispute, because they found that among the applications for funds made by Member States in the area of cohesion policy, 11% contained mistakes."
"I stress that I am talking about applications."
"It might seem to many people that this unfavourable data is the result of carelessness on the part of the Commission or Member States."
"There may certainly be a little truth in this, but I think the problem lies elsewhere."
"The main reason for this large number of financial shortcomings in the area of cohesion and regional development policy is the existence of over-complicated and complex legal regulations which, indeed, the Auditors admit in their report."
"I encourage the Court of Auditors further to intensify cooperation with their counterparts in Member States."
"Finally, I would like to say that we must devote more attention to the problem of education and to giving better information to beneficiaries of EU and institutional policies which implement and manage specific programmes."
"In conclusion, in my opinion, the Commission should make every effort, most of all, to simplify financial regulations while retaining basic monitoring mechanisms which prevent abuse."
"However, very often the beneficiaries of particular European funds struggle with a forest of regulations which are not completely clear, and which, in practical terms, make it impossible to produce accounts which would fully satisfy the Auditors."
"This should be changed, and I stress: simplify and inform, but also monitor."
"(EL) Mr President, I too should like to congratulate the Court of Auditors on their excellent work, as well as the European Commission, and say that I am very pleased, because I can see that the overall situation has improved."
"I should like to emphasise in particular that this is the first time that agricultural spending is no longer in the red."
"Things are going better overall, but there are still problems with expenditure on cohesion policy, to which several of my honourable colleagues have already referred."
"However, I am quite optimistic about the future."
"We must also look at the good news."
"The system for recovering EU funds is working: in 2008, EUR 1.6 billion were recovered and more recoveries are under way, proof that the system is working properly."
"The percentage of fraud uncovered is extremely low and has been identified in just a few isolated cases."
"There are only problems in a few Member States, proof that the system as a whole is working well and that the objectives of cohesion policy are being achieved."
"In the long term, the system of joint management needs to be reviewed and a greater share of the final responsibility transferred to the Member States, thereby helping to simplify the rules."
"The Treaty of Lisbon makes provision for this in Article 310, on the basis of which cooperation is allowed in implementing the budget between the European Union and the Member States, contrary to the exclusive responsibility of the Commission hitherto."
"Finally, I should like to point out that the Court of Auditors' message on the need to simplify the rules has reached the Council and the Commission and I honestly hope that the changes..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(NL) The 2008 report once again gives cause for penetrating analysis and action, including on the part of the European Parliament."
"I thank you for this report."
"This approach - this cooperation - has led to demonstrable improvements over recent years."
"Nevertheless, as coordinator for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I wish to make a few comments on regional policy in particular."
"Is it true that the 11% error rate in regional policy is based on those three Member States, and how does that relate to your projections?"
"Is it true that most of the shortcomings were found in the procurement procedures?"
"Is it true that it was too soon for the report to reflect the improvements in the expenditure under the new, current, regulation 2007-2013?"
"As you know, many improvements have been made to this over the last year."
"If that is the case, and in view of those changes - those improvements in the current legislation - we can continue to work in the vein of that upward trend of improvements in the period up to 2013."
"It is also important that these improvements in the transposition of European legislation be implemented much more emphatically in the procurement rules, that there be improvements in the powers to overcome obstacles and in enforcement, particularly in the Member States."
"After all, there is strong friction here in the relationship between the European and national levels."
"Therefore, we do have to name the countries concerned."
"This 11% figure will then be able to change from red, which is unacceptable, to yellow and finally to green."
"That is why citizens have elected us, to obtain more results and greater clarity in this field."
"I am also happy to take on board the suggestions for simplification contained in your report."
"(DA) Mr President, the Court of Auditors has my heartfelt thanks for a sound and very serviceable report."
"Listening to the debate here today, I am put in mind of a Danish saying, where we talk about whether your glass is half full or half empty."
"This, in other words, is a question of whether you are an optimist or a pessimist."
"It seems to me that there are perhaps far too many people here today who have been far too optimistic."
"The Commissioner, too, has been too optimistic."
"Quite simply, I do not think this is good enough."
"Had a Danish finance minister been responsible for this budget, where less than half of it can be accepted as error-free and where less than half of it - 47% - is green, the minister in question would, in fact, have been out of a job."
"I find it highly regrettable that there are still so many things that need to be done and I find it highly regrettable that things are moving as slowly as they are."
"I realise that it is difficult and I realise that the rules can be very complicated."
"I also realise that progress has been made, but it is not good enough."
"Looking at the speed at which we have improved the green part of the budget, you can see that things are moving too slowly."
"I call on the Commission to take its share of the responsibility."
"You have the tools. You need to react more rapidly."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the focus until now has been on the cohesion fund and this is certainly justified because of the size of the budget."
"However, I would now like to draw attention to an area in which only EUR 2.7 billion was spent last year, but which causes significant problems."
"The European Court of Auditors, which I would like to thank warmly at this point, has produced a semi-masterpiece, as it has succeeded in bringing transparency to the fragmented administration in the area of development aid and in clearly identifying the problems which continue to occur."
"I would not like to go as far as saying that this area has no universal principle and no transparent structures, but it does have considerable problems."
"There have been improvements, for example, in the payments for projects, but nevertheless it is still the case that no audits can be carried out on some of the projects because the receipts are missing, not to mention the fact that some receipts are not even provided in the first place or that there are no opportunities for follow-up audits."
"The subject of budget aid once again involves particular problems because it is not possible to follow up or trace the money and what it is used for."
"In my opinion, we should carefully consider finally integrating the European Development Fund (EDF) into the general budget, for reasons of transparency, traceability and manageability."
"This would allow us to combine and coordinate the EDF with other fields, such as development aid, foreign policy, neighbourhood policy and other policies in the same area, so that we could obtain a complete and transparent overview."
"This is my proposal."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as has already been stated, the European Court of Auditors 2008 report first and foremost gives us some positive news: the percentage of EU expenditure, characterised by high levels of irregularities, has gone down from 60% in 2005 to 31% in 2008."
"This is a significant result; it signals a positive approach that we must continue to follow."
"As far as the Structural Funds, and more specifically cohesion policies, are concerned, there continue to be problems and difficulties."
"I believe that we should focus our attention on these areas in the coming months and years."
"With regard to the Structural Funds, when compared with the Court's analysis of the period 2000-2006, the management and monitoring systems for the period 2007-2013 are giving rise to stricter regulations and greater reliability and transparency in terms of expenditure, as well as to greater accountability on the part of the Member States."
"The Court of Auditors strongly emphasises the need for greater simplification."
"Therefore, much work needs to be done in order to further simplify the rules."
"Quality of economic growth and transparency in the use of Community resources are two objectives of the same battle which we need to wage."
"I believe we need to do this by also making our debates concerning ourselves and, above all, concerning the citizens, more public."
"Cohesion policies, the Structural Funds and regional policies are, and will, remain a crucial element of the European project."
"They have given substance to the European Union's fundamental values."
"We must work together to guarantee efficiency and transparency in the coming years."
"Mr President, I thank the Court of Auditors in particular for putting forward this morning, in a very clear way, the contents of a massive report giving us the good and the bad - and thankfully not the ugly because, to some extent, we have cleared up the worst aspects of our accounting practices."
"I want to concentrate in particular on agriculture which, because it has been given a relatively clean bill of health, has virtually been dismissed in this debate."
"I do so because I want to caution that we may be going back to the future."
"It is worth remembering this morning that agriculture has improved because we have decoupled, to a large extent, payments from production."
"We are giving the payments directly to active farmers, active producers, and therefore the possibility of errors has been much reduced."
"However, through the vehicle of modulation we are now taking that money and using it in the area of rural development, about which serious concerns have been expressed, hence my comments about our possibly going back to the future."
"I also worry about how we can account for issues like water management, climate change and biodiversity."
"Think of the complexity of the rules that will surround all these things - and rightly so - if public money is being spent in that direction, and the difficulties and cost of complying with those particular rules."
"We are looking at a review of the European Union's budget thanks to the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, whose government does not have a particularly clean record when it comes to its own sets of accounts."
"Again, under that review we will be looking at spending money in areas which the Court of Auditors clearly has concerns about, particularly in the field of research and innovation."
"Let us therefore be very careful that the good work we have done will not be unpicked by what we are about to do."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when I was at school, the teachers often said: Trust is good, control is better."
"(The speaker agrees to answer the question of another Member, in accordance with Rule 149(8) of the Rules of Procedure)"
"(DE) Mr President, I wanted to ask you whether you had noticed that, in the course of this important debate, Mr Martin, who has given us all plenty of advice, entered the Chamber at 10.00, spoke at 10.09 and left the Chamber at 10.12?"
"(DE) I am reminded of two basic rules from my childhood."
"I was once told: 'When someone speaks to you, let him finish talking."
"If you ask a question, then at least wait for the answer'."
"On that principle, it would have been nice if he had stayed in the House, so that he could follow the debate in Parliament."
"That is my opinion."
"The controls and the improvements suggested by the Court of Auditors make a significant contribution to the more effective and more economical use of EU funds."
"As a Member with an interest in agriculture, I am particularly pleased that the use of funds in the area of agriculture was given a positive assessment and that on average, no significant irregularities were found."
"However, this is on average and that is precisely where the problem lies."
"There is a saying in agriculture that on average, the lake was half a metre deep, but the cow still drowned."
"In other words, when, on average, everything is correct and when the overwhelming majority of countries are able to apply the administrative regulations appropriately, it is then in particular that we must deal with the countries which do not toe the line, the bad guys."
"It is important to name names in this respect."
"Mr President, please do not give in."
"You can be more specific in what you say and Parliament will give you its support."
"The situation regarding the error rate in rural development is rather different."
"Even though the error rate is lower than the previous year, it is still significantly higher than that for agricultural expenditure."
"However, I must say at this point that the majority of the problems identified are due to the incorrect application and lack of understanding of complex EU regulations."
"This does not necessarily mean that money is being wasted."
"We must all work together to modify and improve the EU regulations, so that the Member States can apply them more easily."
"(FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Court of Auditors' report for 2008 concludes that there has been an overall improvement in terms of the legality and regularity of the European Union's budgetary transactions."
"Nevertheless, it says that expenditure associated with cohesion policy is still problematic, since it contains the most errors."
"The funds available for cohesion policy represent nearly a third of the European budget."
"It is one of the most fundamental and also one of the most symbolic policies of European integration and of the principle of solidarity that is at the heart of it."
"As such, we need to be demanding and ensure that the procedures are applied properly."
"We do, however, need to take into account the specific characteristics of cohesion policy, which is widely decentralised and therefore managed by regional authorities in the Member States."
"The errors observed by the Court of Auditors are not a result of attempts to defraud on the part of the project promoters, but a result of the complexity of the conditions for eligibility."
"In my view, the solution is not, therefore, to make the procedures more cumbersome, but to simplify them, both at Community level and in the Member States."
"At Community level, simplification measures are under discussion in the Council and in Parliament."
"At national level, personally I am working towards simplifying French procedures, in close cooperation with elected representatives and national and local decision makers."
"In this period of economic slowdown, it would be particularly unfortunate for project promoters, of which there are still many, to have difficulty accessing the European funding available to them."
"(FI) Madam President, we are dealing with an important matter, and I want firstly to say that the management of the budget has got a lot better."
"There are problems, however, and I wish to mention a few of them."
"The first is the institutions' policy on buildings and property."
"When I was drafting the budget for the 2008 Parliament and other institutions, I noticed that things were not really right in this area."
"I would hope that we can launch a thorough investigation into why the price paid for properties and buildings of the institutions is higher than the average market price."
"When the study has been completed, we will know whether there is something dubious about all this or, alternatively, that everything is all right."
"The second matter I wish to draw your attention to is the situation regarding Romania and Bulgaria, which is something that has already been mentioned here."
"We know what the problems are, and we have to find ways to help Romania and Bulgaria, so that things can be sorted out."
"This is also a political issue."
"After all, what is the point of enlargement if we accept as members countries that cannot organise the management of their budgets adequately?"
"The third matter particularly concerns external actions linked to the United Nations, though in any case, we need to be able to carry out checks to ensure that the public know that everything is in order."
"More than anything, however, we need to realise that the number of areas free of error has risen, and for that we have to thank Commissioner Kallas and the European Court of Auditors."
"Both have done excellent work."
"(Applause)"
"Madam President, a simple question."
"It has been stated that many of the breaches in compliance are due to a lack of understanding of the procedures and regulations."
"Do you accept that this is the case?"
"And, if so, what percentage of breaches would be due to this unfortunate situation, not to deliberate breaching of the rules?"
"(BG) I, too, would first of all like to congratulate the representatives of the European Court of Auditors for the report which they presented, and Commissioner Kallas for the evidently much-improved effort on the part of the European Commission in relation to European funds expenditure."
"Coming from Bulgaria, I can see at first hand that the Commission is extremely strict with regard to the expenditure of funds, and its actions definitely have an impact."
"I would like to raise one issue linked to the fact that this is the last report from the European Court of Auditors under the current treaties."
"The following report next year will now be based on the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This contains a number of questions which have been asked and which have still not received an adequately explained response, including with regard to creating the budget and the procedures for spending the budget."
"I believe that all the institutions, including the European Parliament, along with the Council and European Commission, of course, not to mention the active involvement of the European Court of Auditors, should do their utmost to come up with a response to these issues so that we think the same way on them."
"(FR) Madam President, I am not taking the floor under the 'catch-the-eye' procedure;"
"I simply wish to lament the fact that the Council bench is hopelessly empty."
"The Council is a budgetary authority, and we also note that we have many problems in the Member States."
"I wanted to express this regret, Madam President."
"(NL) I have been present throughout the debate."
"One of the most crucial questions I have heard - and I would ask Mr Caldeira explicitly to explain this carefully - is what is the situation with the 11% under Cohesion Policy that should not have been disbursed?"
"Various explanations have been given for this in the debate."
"Some have said EUR 4 billion, others have said EUR 2 billion, and so on. I think it exceptionally important for the start of the discharge exercise that you explain to us clearly and unequivocally what is really involved here."
"I should also like to extend my special thanks to Commissioner Kallas for the work he has done in recent years."
"I think the Committee on Budgetary Control always experienced cooperation with you as very constructive."
"We did not always agree, but you will probably soon be granted another term of office in the new Commission, a new post, and I wish you all the very best in this."
"I would like to say to Mr Martin that I saw that he was asking for the floor on a personal matter, and that I will give him the floor, but in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, I will do so at the end of the debate and after the Commission."
"(HU) Madam President, I completely agree with Mr Audy."
"The Council is very conspicuous by its absence, as are the leaders of the political parties."
"As a vice-chair of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament myself, I felt that the chairmen of the other groups did not think that this debate was important either."
"However, the Council is the most conspicuous by its absence."
"Madam President, I would first of all like to thank all of the MEPs who have spoken."
"Their comments will certainly be very much appreciated by all those who work at the Court of Auditors and who were behind the report submitted today."
"In the time allotted to me in such an intense and interesting debate, it is a little difficult to answer all the questions that have been put to me directly."
"I would first like to address the question from Mr de Jong, who asked me whether I was discouraged about not being in a position, as the President of the Court of Auditors, to give a positive DAS."
"My answer would be that, as an auditor, I would be delighted to give such an opinion when the time came, but it is not the job of auditors to be happy with the opinions that they give."
"Auditors must have a solid basis for their opinions, drawn from evidence on the ground."
"To be very frank, as an auditor I prefer giving an opinion such as the one we have given this year."
"I will not tell Mr Audy whether it is a positive or negative opinion, but it is a realistic opinion that highlights the points on which progress has been made."
"We have seen that there has been a sharp fall in the number of errors in some areas, in particular in the area of agriculture, but there are also areas where more care is needed."
"Therefore, rather than being optimistic or pessimistic, as an auditor I prefer to be realistic."
"I think that this is the way that our message should be understood with regard to prospects for the future."
"Several MEPs have asked what can be done to solve these problems."
"The Court of Auditors has made its contribution in this report and in previous reports by pointing out that its recommendations in relation to improving the supervisory and control systems in the Member States are important, and by stating, with regard to the Commission, that it is equally important to simplify the regulatory framework, which means not making things more complicated than they need to be."
"We cannot move from a stage in which we want to do everything and control everything - which requires excessive controls - to a stage in which there is no supervision at all."
"Otherwise, we will not be able to find the right balance to enable us to achieve the objectives of the policies."
"Several of you have said that this report does not talk about how efficiently the funds are used."
"Did the few errors or irregularities identified prevent projects from being completed?"
"Obviously, the Court of Auditors is supposed to give an opinion in its reports regarding the financial statements, which is a clearly positive opinion, and on the underlying transactions of these accounts."
"This is about whether the transactions comply with the rules that they are supposed to follow."
"However, the Court of Auditors also provides you and, in particular, the competent parliamentary committees, the Committee on Budgetary Control, with all of our reports relating to the effectiveness of the policies and whether the funds in the different areas are being used correctly."
"I hope that you will find significant information in those reports in terms of what could be done better in the context of these policies."
"However, as it says in our report - and I emphasised this in my speech - it is important to seize this opportunity that the reform of the financial regulation and the new framework for the financial perspective are offering us for the future, and the opportunity that the budgetary reform is giving us to consider some fundamental issues."
"Allow me to conclude, Madam President, by saying that our methodology complies with international auditing standards."
"We consider our samples to be appropriate for drawing our conclusions."
"Mr Audy asked the following question: are your samples of sufficient size?"
"The answer is yes."
"Obviously, if we had more resources, we could possibly do more work, but our resources are limited and we are supposed to manage our resources carefully."
"Finally, a word on the role that the Court of Auditors and the courts of auditors in the Member States can play in the future."
"We always work with the courts of auditors in the Member States and with the national auditors by cooperating with one another and trusting one another."
"This approach is provided for by the treaty - and reaffirmed by the Treaty of Lisbon - and in following it, we are doing our best to ensure that, by and large, we can bring added value to the role of external auditing in the European Union."
"Those are my very brief final remarks, Madam President, as I did not wish to take up too much of your time."
"(Applause)"
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you for this debate and for the good words addressed to the Commission."
"I have two points relating to the past, from 2008 and recent years."
"Firstly, one important thing was underlined: transparency."
"I want to remind you that together we have made a big breakthrough."
"All information about beneficiaries of EU funds is now public and this has also been one of the major changes during this period."
"The second fact from the past is that we discussed how much money has been lost and how much money should be recovered, amongst other things."
"I would like to illustrate this with one number, from what is a very complicated title."
"It is in Annex VI to our Synthesis report and is the 'summary of waivers of recoveries', which actually means an amount of money which is completely and irreversibly lost."
"In the 2008 Synthesis report, this was EUR 18 380 363.22, which is under 0.01% of the EU budget."
"This is lost."
"We have discussed all these billions which have not been properly managed in the structural funds, but something is recovered finally."
"The process is not perfect and we have to work hard on this and sometimes errors are corrected."
"It is a long process and we must take it very seriously."
"Now some points for the future."
"In the very near future, we will start discussions on the new Financial Regulation and the new budget perspectives."
"Very many things are linked to this process."
"National declarations and the participation of Member States need a stronger legal basis."
"We can clearly go ahead with this simplification, discussed so much and so many times here."
"As President Caldeira has already said, objectives are defined by more than 500 programmes accepted by the Commission, Parliament and Council."
"Every programme has its own legal basis, its own objectives, and everything must be measured, including the money which has been spent in accordance with these objectives."
"That is a key issue."
"At the last plenary session when we discussed the discharge for 2007, one idea was to reduce the number of programmes and to have bigger projects and bigger programmes which are much easier to survey."
"This is a key issue and, as one Member said was the case with rural development, you cannot measure objectives - especially in external actions, where you have very political objectives - and say that those objectives are being achieved."
"This is a key issue, but one within the framework of the future discussions on financial regulations."
"Concerning dialogue, which was underlined here as important, I must say that we have tried to do our best to have good dialogue with Parliament, with the Committee on Budgetary Control and with the Court of Auditors."
"I myself like to debate everything with people with different views, different attitudes and different assessments."
"That is normal life."
"What I do not like is that some people deliberately and constantly use incorrect facts."
"You cannot have a dialogue when the facts are not correct."
"We can have different assessments, different interpretations and different views, but the facts must be correct."
"I strongly wish that in our future dialogue, this principle will also be respected."
"(Applause)"
"Mr Martin, do you wish to speak at the end of this debate?"
"(DE) Madam President, I am sorry that I have to take this opportunity to make a personal remark which, according to the agenda, I have been given three minutes for."
"However, I will not need three minutes."
"I took a very constructive approach in my speech and in the debate I pointed out very constructively what could now be done on this new basis."
"In order to be able to come to this assessment, I followed the debate this morning very closely."
"I was in the chamber much earlier than my fellow Member stated, left later and am now here again."
"I feel that it is a great pity that Mrs Gräßle obviously feels it necessary to make personal attacks which really are below the belt."
"I would like her to be constructive and I would like to see fewer incorrect stories by her in the German newspaper the Bild Zeitung."
"I would prefer to hear constructive suggestions about how we can rescue the situation and how the Court of Auditors can be given the ability to do this."
"In addition, it is a great pity that Mrs Gräßle, in particular, is the person who unnecessarily makes the work of the non-attached Members more difficult, discriminates against us, prevents us from accessing information, does not allow us the opportunity to work with employees and then feels that it is worthwhile attacking us on the basis of incorrect facts."
"You should learn about democracy, Mrs Gräßle."
"We will stop there."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"It is true that there are still significant deficiencies in some areas, in particular, in the case of cohesion policy, but the fall in the error rate in the area of agriculture and natural resources to below 2% gives me cause to look optimistically to the future."
"Particularly given that this area makes up the majority of the European Union's spending, the comparatively low error rate of 2% can be seen as satisfactory."
"In future, we should put all our efforts into two areas."
"The first of these is cooperation between the Commission and the Member States."
"The aim here is to identify inaccurate and incorrect data in all the different areas of spending and to correct the errors."
"The second area involves improving the EU's methods for paying EU money to the Member States and recovering it from them."
"I would like to congratulate the Court of Auditors on its annual report on the implementation of the EU budget concerning the financial year 2008."
"I would like to draw attention to the paragraph concerning the European Union agencies, in which the Court of Auditors states that it has issued an unqualified opinion for all the agencies audited, with the exception of the European Police College."
"At this stage, it is relevant to recall that we faced a similar situation for the 2007 discharge."
"The Court of Auditors has published a report containing a statement of assurance with reservations regarding the accounts and underlying transactions of CEPOL, indicating in particular that appropriations had been used to finance private expenditure."
"The rapporteur asked for the discharge to be postponed for CEPOL, followed by the Committee on Budgetary Control."
"However, the vote in plenary on 23 April 2009 rejected this proposal by 226 votes for and 230 against, with a massive mobilisation of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance."
"Given that the Court of Auditors has today raised further problems regarding CEPOL, it is essential that we acknowledge the obvious error that was made in granting discharge in April by voting against the opinion of the rapporteur and of the committee responsible."
"Google's project to digitise the world's book heritage (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on Google's project to digitise the world's book heritage by Klaus-Heiner Lehne, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs - B7-0224/2009)."
"Madam President, President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, you will all be familiar with Google, the internet search engine."
"You will probably also know about the new Google Books Project, which everyone has been discussing over the last few months."
"The aim of the project is to scan in books from libraries and make them available over the internet, so that readers have quick and easy access to a large number of works on the web."
"From the perspective of readers and internet users, this is a wonderful idea."
"However, what does it mean for authors, creative people, artists and publishers?"
"What part will they play in the publication of their work on the web?"
"We must look closely at these questions over the next few months."
"You may already be aware that publishers and authors in the US have initiated legal proceedings against Google with regard to the scanning and publication of works on the web."
"As far as I know, the legal dispute has been resolved and the parties have settled out of court."
"However, the questions remain unanswered and they relate not only to the situation with Google, because there are certain to be similar cases in future."
"We must deal with these questions as quickly as possible."
"Does copyright need to be adapted in the digital age?"
"Do we need to change existing structures?"
"In this respect, I am thinking particularly of the role of the collecting societies, which we have often discussed in Parliament."
"Are new monopolies being created on the web?"
"How should we react to this?"
"How will this change the structures in our countries, for example, with regard to the bookshops in the regions?"
"What are the opposing interests in this case and how can we find a suitable balance between them?"
"Authors and publishers want to receive a financial reward for their work."
"This also applies, of course, when their works are made available on the internet."
"Libraries want to put their archives on the web without having to sign a licence agreement with every copyright holder first."
"The interests of consumers are clear."
"They would very much like to have quick and easy access to the content on the web."
"We have not yet reached the point of being able to discuss possible solutions, but we need to ask ourselves a lot of questions and that is the purpose of the written question submitted to the Commission by the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Do we need to make distinctions in order to resolve the copyright issues, for example, with regard to content?"
"If so, what distinctions should be made?"
"The Commission seems to be moving in this direction, as it is first of all focusing on the situation of the library stocks."
"Should there be a process of mass digitisation in future, or is our existing licensing system sufficient to resolve the problem?"
"How can copyright clearance be simplified in the internet age?"
"As you know, copyright is primarily a national right and in this respect, we must once again ask ourselves: is this still an up-to-date approach?"
"How should we deal with orphan works in future, in other words, books whose copyright holder cannot be identified or located?"
"Should we perhaps distinguish between literary works and scientific or academic works?"
"For example, the authors of novels earn their living from the publication of their books, but when scientists make their papers available on the web, they are primarily interested in making a name for themselves in their field of research and are less reliant on the money that their work earns."
"There are numerous questions that we need to ask ourselves and I am pleased to be able to discuss them with you."
"I would like to consider one last important point and that is once again the subject of collecting societies."
"Look at how easy it is nowadays to download music from the internet."
"You simply go to iTunes and buy songs for 20, 30, 40 or 50 cents."
"What are the implications for the collecting societies?"
"Do we still need them?"
"I would be pleased if the Commission could once again give us an idea of what the current situation is."
"In Parliament, we have been asking the Commission for years to take a look at the collecting societies."
"To put it rather imprecisely, these are also monopolistic bodies, which have been established over a period of decades."
"I am interested to know what the Commission is planning."
"My final point is that if you take a platform like Google, which makes everything freely available, this will result in a monopoly being created on the web."
"We need to consider how the situation should be handled in order to ensure that we do not end up with just one supplier, who then decides on the conditions for access to content on the web."
"I am looking forward to a debate with you over the next few weeks and months and I will be interested to hear the Commission's response to the first question from the Committee on Legal Affairs."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs for raising these questions."
"You raised so many big and fundamental questions which definitely need to be discussed in the coming months."
"This issue is definitely intensive, interesting, exciting and very future-oriented."
"I will first of all give an overview concerning this concrete question."
"First of all: the Google Books Project."
"In essence, it is an initiative aimed at providing a tool to find, search and buy books for a wide audience of users."
"For rights holders, it may represent an additional channel of trade, and so an additional source of revenue."
"Let me add that in Europe, the Google Books Project is deployed in collaboration with libraries and concerns only public domain books."
"In-copyright books are only included in the Project by way of the Google Partner Programme addressed to publishers willing to conclude agreements with Google."
"The Google Books class action settlement concerns the Google Books Project in the United States and aims to conclude a litigation procedure which has been going on for over four years."
"If approved, it will provide an additional source of revenue for rights holders but also, and most importantly, make the hitherto unavailable out-of-print and orphan works available for online search and access to US users."
"Moreover, its financial incentives may bring rights holders of orphan works out of the shadows."
"Now, when it comes to the Google Book Search Project, the Commission sees the Google initiative as a demonstration that new business models are evolving to provide almost instant access to vast numbers of works to an increasing number of consumers."
"Because the European Commission favours the digitisation of books in European libraries and beyond, and because digitisation of books is a task of Herculean proportions, where private sector support is needed, the Commission favours initiatives such as Google's Book Search Project as long as they respect intellectual property rights and do not lead to the distortion of competition."
"When it comes to the Google Books settlement, the Commission has been actively engaged in consultations with European publishers and with Google."
"In September 2009, the Commission organised a public hearing bringing together European stakeholders and the settlement parties to exchange views and seek clarification on the various elements of the agreement."
"But meanwhile, important changes have occurred."
"Due to numerous objections raised about the initial settlement by Google's competitors, foreign governments (France and Germany) and the US Department of Justice, the terms of the settlement were revised and these revisions were submitted to the US Court on 13 November 2009."
"First, the revised settlement has been significantly narrowed in scope."
"Now, only books either registered with the US Copyright Office or published in the United Kingdom, Australia or Canada by 5 January 2009 are covered by the settlement."
"All other books are outside the scope of the settlement."
"Consequently, only United States, United Kingdom, Australian and Canadian authors and publishers will, in future, be represented on the board of the Books Rights Registry, the body that administers the terms of the settlement."
"Secondly, publishers from countries other than the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada will now have to negotiate individually to become part of Google Books services in the United States."
"The new version of the settlement gives rise to two remarks."
"First, being outside the settlement is not always an advantage."
"When you are out, you can no longer control what Google does with the copies they have scanned up to now."
"Second, publishers from EU Member States - apart from the United Kingdom - will now no longer participate in a major transformation of the book market."
"The Google Books Project in the United States will receive a major thrust forward, with no European publishers any longer a part of it."
"Even though services negotiated under this settlement will only be available to United States users, this absence could be detrimental to cultural diversity."
"In this regard, the Commission has been calling, and will repeatedly call, on Member States: firstly, to intensify their digitisation policies; secondly, to explore the possibilities for public-private partnerships for digitisation; and, thirdly, to ensure that all digitised material becomes available through Europeana."
"If Member States do that, the Google Books settlement may turn out to be the catalyst, not a threat, for Europe's initiatives in the area of access to digitised culture."
"This brings me to your second question."
"The debate on the Google Books settlement has shown that Europe cannot afford to be left behind on the digital frontier."
"Europe has to act swiftly."
"To this end, the Commission is fully committed to working on a copyright framework that will facilitate large-scale digitisation of European library collections."
"We believe that copyright rules have to be flexible enough in order not to overly complicate the creation of online libraries."
"Madam President, I would like to thank you for your statement, the Committee on Legal Affairs for its question, and Mrs Niebler for her comments and the Commissioner for his answer."
"These are extremely important matters for the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection as well."
"The process of digitising books opens up great new opportunities, but it must - and I emphasise this - must serve the interests of publishing and readers, that is to say, European businesses and consumers."
"The previous version of the agreement with Google threatened the monopolisation of the entire literary output by one private firm, a threat which has not yet been completely eliminated."
"It was Google that scanned millions of copyright titles from all over the world."
"To date, it has made use of these scans illegally, only applying the US principle of fair use without asking the authors or publishers for their agreement."
"The new agreement continues to flout a basic principle of the Berne Convention, which says that copyright holders have to be asked for permission before their works are used, and not simply be given the option to opt out, all of which would put the responsibility, effort and costs on the author's shoulders."
"The agreement applies to books from all over the world published in English in countries which are covered by the Convention."
"When it scanned the books, Google drew on the categories of out-of-print and orphan works."
"Both of these categories are very loosely defined."
"It is quite often possible to find the authors of orphan works if you put your mind to it."
"Out-of-print books are often works which the authors or publishers have deliberately taken out of print."
"Does this not entail the danger that Google may be depriving publishers of the freedom to establish their own publishing policy, and authors of potential earnings?"
"On the issue of consumers: the publishing industry may be undermined in the long term by the Google Project if the copyright holders are not paid the royalties due to them."
"To allow them to remain competitive, publishers will stop producing valuable, expert-reviewed, costly books."
"For consumers, this will effectively mean high-quality publications being replaced by cheap, unverified, unimaginative publishing, additionally accompanied by ubiquitous advertising."
"I therefore expect the European Commission to devise a policy which will allow the development of further digitisation, but without impacting negatively on creativity and on the interests of the market and of readers in Europe."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that the agreement between Google and the US publishers contains some undoubtedly interesting elements and some important prospects for new things for us as well."
"However, together with these positive aspects, it is important to evaluate the problematic issues it contains too."
"For the agreement to be positive, we need to change the way we look at the whole complicated issue of copyright, overcoming the conflict between the demand for freedom of access to online cultural products and the exclusive protection, without exception, of copyright."
"It is true that the system devised by Google would give users as a whole the great opportunity of accessing works, especially those that are out of print or difficult to find bibliographically and, at the same time, would give authors and publishers the opportunity of refreshing their own cultural offering and of expanding their readership."
"However, it is also true that, due to the fact that the agreement covers only books and works registered with the US Copyright Office or published in the United Kingdom, Canada or Australia, and that no specific measure is envisaged for European works or for those of the rest of the world - so far, moreover, Google has merely stated its general willingness to reach similar agreements with other countries as well - Google finds itself, by virtue of that agreement, in a monopoly position, not least because of the enormous advertising resources that will be harnessed for the new system."
"The impact will also have consequences for European cultural industries, first and foremost, because of the delay that Europe would encounter in terms of the whole library digitisation project."
"What is more, a great many European books have already been registered with the US Copyright Office since the 1980s."
"As a result, they would be subject to the new rules for accessing the Google system."
"Many more European works have been held in US libraries that have offered Google the possibility of digitising its own catalogue."
"The European Commission has launched a European project, which to date has had less of an impact than Google Books is expected to have."
"The agreement between Google and the US cultural industries thus raises the issue of the need for a synthesis between protection of copyright and of production and accessibility for users, not least in view of the technological revolutions of the last decade."
"The risk is that Europe will lag behind when it comes to the development of this potential new model."
"I tell you straight, Commissioner: I do not find the proposals that have been stated here adequate for resolving the problem confronting us."
"We need a solution that unifies the countries of Europe and that does not put the burden of responsibility for the action to be undertaken on the Member States."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I welcome the action of the Committee on Legal Affairs in putting this timely question to the Commission."
"The book digitalisation project impacts on several European and Member State policy areas, such as copyright, competition, library digitalisation and culture, and as such requires both debate and measured consideration."
"The digitalisation of books has many clear benefits in both cultural and economic terms."
"It will make literature and learning more accessible to the digital generation."
"It will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and culture."
"It will give students, academics and universities increased access to information and research."
"For Europe to be at the forefront of a successful knowledge-based economy, we must move forward with new technologies and stay ahead in the knowledge race."
"My own Member State, Ireland, was known as the island of saints and scholars, with a great tradition for producing literature; and the encouragement and promotion of reading and literature is always welcome."
"Unfortunately, I have to say that most of the saints are gone."
"However, the digitalisation project must not proceed at the expense of the creative process behind literature and the livelihood of the many stakeholders must not be negatively impacted upon."
"It is important to stress that digitalisation must only be accepted when the rights of the stakeholders, including authors, publishers, illustrators, graphic designers and literary translators, are represented and protected."
"Given the potential threat of digitalisation to the print book market, it is essential to ensure that the rights of holders are fairly remunerated, and this is an issue that I raised directly with the Commission last October."
"In their response, I note that the Commission has already launched a public consultation and has held hearings to exchange views with stakeholders."
"I welcome these positive steps and, if the European Union copyright legislation is to be adapted, there must be an increased engagement with stakeholders so that the change reflects their interests while, at the same time, facilitating a knowledge-based economy."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as a result of the activities of Google Books, the European strategy of taking a slow, targeted approach and of highlighting the many concerns that have been expressed during the course of this strategy has simply been overtaken by reality."
"We are faced with Google's comprehensive digitisation of books, including books by European authors, who have not given their consent and who are now surprised and annoyed to find themselves in Google Books, where they do not want to be."
"On this subject, I would like to say first of all that when we talk about copyright, it is not simply a question of money."
"It is also about the sovereignty of authors, who should have the right to be involved in decisions about whether, how and in what form their books are digitised and used."
"This is a central question and a major necessity."
"Related to this is the highly critical question of so-called orphan works, whose authors cannot be located."
"We need to find an effective and practical solution to this problem."
"Each and every one of us has experienced the situation of lending a much-loved book, not having it returned and then not being able to buy it anywhere because it is out of print."
"Google Books would, of course, be a very good solution in cases like this, because it would preserve treasures from the world of literature and other related areas, which would otherwise disappear from our cultural heritage."
"However, the solution must be designed in such a way that the whole thing makes sense."
"Google Books cannot simply ignore all the issues on the basis of an assumption."
"An attempt must be made to find the author and to protect his or her rights."
"This is where the collecting societies come into action and I would like to see a fair solution being introduced."
"As Mrs Niebler said, we need to discuss the role of the collecting societies in this context."
"Everyone has the right to reject new technologies but, of course, they also have to live with the consequences and they may find in future that they do not form part of the extensive pool of knowledge which has been created."
"This is the central issue today."
"Perhaps statutory exceptions are needed in order to provide a relatively effective solution to the problem."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, for book-lovers in my constituency in the East Midlands and EU-wide, this is good news."
"I believe this is a book revolution about to begin, and I welcome the Commission statement."
"The initiative by Google is an inevitable and logical step forward given the advancement of the digital economy with new market drivers and new consumer demands."
"I believe this kind of private sector innovation should be welcomed as long as it allows space for competition in the future and fair protection."
"Libraries, whilst an important store of information, are vastly underused resources, with nine out of ten books not being accessed, and there are many thousands of books unavailable to consumers due to their being out of print or the non-viability of publication."
"Online books will provide authors with the opportunity to gain some recognition and indeed some money back for their works."
"However, the fact that this kind of settlement providing mass digitisation of books cannot be applied to the EU is one of the most illustrative examples of the EU's fragmented copyright laws."
"We have to make a European copyright framework fit for purpose in the 21st century."
"Europe must seize the opportunity to take the lead and to ensure that the digitisation of books in Europe is facilitated, but also that the Google Books settlement takes into consideration European copyright law."
"We should encourage European players into this space as well in different languages and genres."
"For those like me who like the feel of a page between their fingers, this will not replace the need for fabulous bookshops like those in my East Midlands constituency."
"Indeed, far from doing away with bookshops, the ability to access online books provides us with a whole new way of learning and access to culture."
"Far from destroying our libraries, it will help them to be archived and protected and provide our consumers with more choice of how they access books for the education and pleasure."
"It is an opportunity for authors to expand their market and their audience."
"I believe this is the beginning of a rediscovery of great works and the uncovering of a cultural explosion."
"It is something we should welcome and positively encourage."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, many of us have said that Google is practically a global monopoly, which is trying to appropriate the cultural, literary and journalistic heritage of the whole world."
"Europe should not allow itself to be controlled by Google."
"Moreover, Google's strategy of offering the service free of charge is merely a façade, since it makes commodities out of intellectual works in return for more than USD 23 billion in advertising revenue each year."
"As you said, Mr Kallas, Europe needs to undertake a digitisation programme."
"However, the actions brought by authors in the United States against Google Books for plagiarism of their works should not mean that a digitisation model is established here that would also make a commodity out of original literary, journalistic or scientific works."
"From this point of view, we would like to know exactly what the Commission means by the frequently used term 'collective licence'."
"The idea of creating a European market for authors rights greatly concerns us from this point of view."
"We should not confuse intellectual works, which are common heritage, with the spirit of business, which involves turning culture into a commodity."
"In our view, the European Union, together with the Member States, should therefore guarantee the authors' rights, the intellectual property rights of writers, journalists and scientists."
"The public digitisation systems launched in a number of Member States should be supported and combined with the European project, Europeana, in order to prevent the private appropriation of public cultural property."
"Before making any decisions, I think that Parliament should initiate a European strategic conference bringing together the European institutions, the Member States, authors' unions, libraries and even public telecommunications operators, to create a European public digitisation model that respects authors and their works and which makes them accessible to as many people as possible."
"This project, together with Europeana, should work alongside the other systems that exist in the world."
"(FR) Madam President, the tasks of digitising Europe's literary heritage for the purposes of not only preserving and remembering it, but also of distributing it and promoting its influence, and of providing Europeans with access to their fantastic culture, are major challenges which public authorities should have a greater involvement in."
"At the moment, Google is in the firing line because its commercial strategy involves an attempt to gain a crucial, long-term edge by establishing a monopoly not over the content of a global virtual library, but over access to this content, and also by footing the bill for this digitisation process in return."
"I join my colleagues from Europe's right-wing parties in totally opposing any exclusive situation resulting in a monopoly."
"We can overcome the other major issues concerning intellectual property and compliance with copyright for out-of-print and orphan works."
"Legislation can be adapted to accommodate them."
"However, the real question is this: what alternatives exist in Europe?"
"The Europeana site, which has been up and running for a few months, only has 5% of Europe's works online."
"Half of its content comes from sources provided by France which, for once, is leading the way with Gallica, the portal of the National Library of France, and with the INA (National Audiovisual Institute)."
"However, the funding provided is a pittance in relation to what is needed."
"Google is prepared to invest EUR 15 million a year in rapidly digitising and making available up to 20 million works in 10 years."
"How much are we prepared to put on the table?"
"If we cannot answer this question, Google, I am afraid, will be the only player able to meet the needs of the libraries themselves."
"(PL) Madam President, the potential benefits and possibilities which the Google Books Project offers consumers, researchers and the majority of publishers and authors for the preservation of cultural heritage is, really, beyond dispute."
"We must not, however, treat the legal consequences lightly, and it is on these that I, as a representative of the Committee on Legal Affairs, would like to concentrate."
"Firstly, the conditions which need to be met are, of course, clear."
"I am thinking of the need to respect copyright and of the establishment of a suitable system for paying royalties to authors."
"Unfortunately, the Google Project is based on an Anglo-Saxon legal system and on North American market realities which are completely inadequate for the European Union system."
"In connection with this, Google's activity in the European Union encounters obstacles, not only of a legal nature, but also of an ethical nature."
"Google assumes that a copyright owner who does not want to be part of an agreement is obliged to inform Google of this."
"This is not, of course, in accord with our law, which assumes that before scanning a book and making the scan available, it is necessary to obtain the author's consent and to pay the appropriate fee."
"Another matter relates to what are known as 'orphan books', in other words, works for which it has not been possible to identify the copyright owner."
"In the majority of the Member States, collecting societies represent the interests of known copyright owners, and also of currently unidentified copyright owners, for example, by securing income from sales for a certain period in case the copyright holder is found in the future."
"I would also like to point out the need to adapt European legal provisions in the area of copyright to the challenges of the digital era."
"At the same time, I fully support the opinion of Mrs Reding and Mr McCreevy, and also what was said today by Mr Kallas, that digitisation of works protected by copyright must fully respect the principle of copyright and the fair remuneration of authors, so that they can benefit from access of the wider European public to their works to the greatest degree."
"For we must not, of course, squander this opportunity in Europe."
"(PL) Madam President, the opportunities offered by the internet have inspired Google to revive in cyberspace books which are out of print, forgotten, or which have vanished in the mists of time."
"The grand idea of creating a modern counterpart of the Alexandrian Library has, however, given rise to disputes on the issue of copyright."
"The agreement reached two weeks ago satisfied the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers and some of their European counterparts."
"It allows titles published in four countries to be scanned and made available against payment."
"These countries are the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. internet users from these countries will be able to read 20% of e-books free of charge (with the costs covered by advertisers) and will have to pay to read the remaining 80%."
"From the author's and the publisher's point of view, this will have a two-fold benefit."
"In the first place, it will generate a one-off payment from Google of USD 60 to 300 for the right to scan the book and, in the second place, 63% of the profits generated from the e-book through the Google Books service."
"In other words, authors will make money from publishing even a single page of their own books on the internet."
"Yet few people take into account the fact that non-British European users of Google Books, for example a Belgian or Polish internet user, will not even have access to those 20% of e-books."
"The service covers mainly English-language titles, and any European publishers or authors wishing to join the programme will have to deal with Google themselves."
"Europeans will have free access only to the least attractive categories of book - titles which are in the public domain and whose copyright has long since expired, for example, books in the Bibliothèque nationale de France which have not been taken out for 200 years."
"This will not result in a complete electronic library of European titles being built up."
"In addition to certain reservations regarding the Google Project, such as the company's monopoly on the preparation and distribution of e-books and the need to pay it a share of the revenue and advertising, I believe that the lack of a unified system of copyright in the European Union will make it inefficient."
"The legal commotion surrounding Google has shown the consequences of the lack of uniform copyright law in the European Union as well as the impossibility of giving a unified response to the Google Books initiative."
"It is plain for all to see that harmonising copyright in the European Union has become an urgent necessity."
"Madam President, Google is an American company we all know well, providing online services which many of us use on a daily basis."
"As their European headquarters is located in Ireland, I know they are an excellent employer and real leader in cutting-edge internet technology."
"The digitisation of books, such as the Google Books Project, has the potential to unlock huge volumes of the world's collective knowledge and cultural heritage."
"We should support efforts to make books searchable, readable and downloadable."
"We all agree that a digital library of the scope Google is proposing will mean real benefits."
"This is especially true for our libraries in Europe, which store books dating as far back as the 17th century."
"Few people are able to see those books, but putting them online will allow the world to study and enjoy their contents."
"However, the question we must, as Europeans, ask is whether that vast array of knowledge and culture should be monopolised by one private American company."
"I have no doubt Google wish to uphold their famous motto 'Do no evil'."
"However, what guarantee would we have that they would not use monopoly power to price these books above the range of ordinary citizens?"
"Public access to such resources is of paramount importance."
"In fact, we must do all we can to support our own digital library."
"Europeana makes available online nearly five million items."
"Its mission is to offer the widest possible public access to cultural collections from across Europe."
"I regret that only France has contributed seriously so far and that others, including Ireland, have contributed little."
"Given that my own country has such a rich and impressive literary history, I call on the Irish Government to participate more fully in the Europeana project."
"We must cherish public access to our shared European culture and heritage."
"The clear message to all European cultural institutions must be to digitise and to digitise now."
"(EL) Madam President, it is a question of principle that we must encourage access to information and education."
"At the same time, we should also facilitate access to European and world culture, in which the written word does indeed occupy a special place."
"In this sense, the digitisation of books and free access to them is desirable, but only on the condition of what we are debating today, namely absolute protection for intellectual property."
"However, we have similar institutionalised instruments in the European Union."
"I refer, in particular, to Europeana, which we must strengthen and promote further."
"Europeana is a library, school, film library and music archive all in one and, of course, it respects intellectual property rights and grants free access to all citizens."
"The means therefore exist."
"The question is how we can use our powers, as the European Union, to become pioneers and not simply monitor developments in the private sector."
"(HU) This is yet another example of our migration from Gutenberg's galaxy to the digital one."
"The slow pace of the legislative process is the reason why the business world has overtaken us."
"The legislative process must speed up."
"We need to avert anarchy and we need to prevent the formation of monopolies."
"We must guarantee freedom to readers, writers and retailers alike."
"We must also guarantee cultural diversity and equality for minority languages."
"We must do our utmost to eliminate digital illiteracy."
"This is what we have to do, and it is no mean task."
"Madam President, I am responsible for the new report on Europeana, and I am convinced that we have to find a very good balance to respect, on the one hand, intellectual property rights and, on the other hand, to give easy access to all our users."
"That means we need very clear definitions on how to reform copyright, and we therefore need the work done by the Commission on which sort of European fair use we want and clear definitions on what are orphan works."
"I would like to find out from the Commission whether, if we really do not want to fall behind the United States, we should finance the digitisation of European works of art and fund Europeana to a greater extent from the new Lisbon Strategy."
"Otherwise, we will leave it to Google, and that would not be the best solution to avoid the monopoly structure we already have."
"(PT) Madam President, this is very ironic, is it not?"
"What Google has done, taking on intellectual property and reproducing it for private usage, was clearly illegal at the outset, according to the conclusions drawn by the US Department of Justice itself."
"On a smaller scale, this is what we call piracy."
"Why should there be any difference between individual users who do this and an enormous company like Google?"
"Therefore, our first principle should be that the major players should not be granted any special privileges."
"Our second principle is that we cannot be dependent on the goodwill of a monopoly."
"Like many of those present here, I find Google an interesting company."
"I think that their idea is an innovative and good one."
"However, what if they later raise prices, as, say, the publishers of academic journals are doing, increasing prices several hundred-fold?"
"What if they restrict access to certain books?"
"They have a quota of 15% for books that can be censured."
"We need a digital library that is truly global, regulated by a global consortium, including universities, to ensure that quality is not being held back, and national libraries; a consortium in which Europe will, of course, have far greater power of leadership and decision making than it does at present."
"It started with books; the next thing will be works of art in European museums."
"Europe cannot afford to miss the boat on this matter."
"(HU) While we are talking at the moment about the digitisation of the world's book heritage by a private company, in this case, Google, it seems as if we are only dealing with the present."
"It was stated in one speech that those of us here will continue, at any rate, to use printed books."
"However, whatever option we pave the way for, it will offer future generations as well an opportunity or a disadvantage which we obviously have to deal with."
"Therefore, the main issue here is not only, as has been said, that this will affect Europe's cultural industry."
"No, such a decision will influence European culture."
"In fact, there is an extreme danger that a company will own the world's cultural heritage or, looking into the future, its cultural present."
"This is why it is imperative for Europe to devise its own clear strategy in this area."
"(PL) Madam President, firstly, digitisation is a huge opportunity to make our cultural, European and world heritage available to as great a number of Europeans as possible."
"This fits in very well indeed with the objectives of the new Lisbon Strategy."
"However, it seems that, firstly, this requires standardisation of the whole question of orphan works."
"First and foremost in this area, we should have harmonised European solutions for management of incomes derived from orphan works."
"Member States have different solutions here."
"Secondly, publication of out-of-print works requires special supervision."
"In my opinion, the question of out-of-print works should be harmonised."
"We cannot allow a situation to arise in which there is not strict regulation of out-of-print works."
"Thirdly, we cannot accept the opt-out method in the European legal system, because this allows Google to digitise works without the author's consent."
"I think we should adopt broader measures for the European Union in this area."
"I also think that if we want to compete, in the positive sense of the word, with Google, or also to cooperate with the company, we should certainly speed up work relating to Europeana and, in particular, bring about an acceleration of work in this area in the Member States."
"Madam President, I have a little story to tell to illustrate my point."
"Probably the first copyright case in the history of the world took place in Ireland 1 500 years ago, when a monk called Finian invited another monk called Columcille to his monastery."
"Finian was writing a manuscript at the time."
"Columcille discovered it and got up each night to copy it."
"Finian was not pleased and he asked for it back."
"He did not get it back so he appealed to the High King."
"The High King heard the case and made a judgment, which was - I will say it in Irish first - do gach bó a lao, do gach leabhar a chóip, or 'to every cow her calf, to every book its copy'."
"That is as relevant today as it was 1 500 years ago, because copyright and intellectual rights have to be guaranteed."
"So I say, 'to every cow her calf, to every book its copy' and to every author and artist their copyright and intellectual rights."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission is doing its utmost to develop the digital field in our society."
"It seems to me that Google - and particularly its books project - has appeared as a great integrating factor for the European Union, because, as you know very well, - and this is in all papers - copyright so far has been explicitly in the hands of Member States and national legislation."
"Now we need some kind of common approach, for which the Commission is very happy to provide proposals."
"The next Commission will definitely take all these issues very seriously and this will be a high priority."
"We agree that the books need to go online and fast."
"They will go anyway, whether we want it or not."
"The most important thing is that authors need to be paid for online books."
"We are planning a framework directive on these issues - including collective societies, which need to be transparent and accountable to their members."
"The framework directive will appear somewhere between autumn 2010 and spring 2011."
"We should not fall behind, and we are proposing simple EU rules on orphan book works and also books which are out of print."
"The EU proposal will ensure that books are only digitised with prior permission, and there will also be a serious search for orphan works."
"Let us continue this discussion."
"Once again, we would thank the Committee on Legal Affairs, and the honourable Members Mrs Niebler and Mr Lehne, for their initiative in initiating this interesting debate."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Google Books, the new service offered by Google, has given rise to a number of controversies recently."
"The project is based on free access to large numbers of scanned books, whereby four million of the scanned books are by European authors."
"The situation raises questions about limiting internet freedom and about the challenges faced by legislators as a result of a dynamically developing information society."
"As the European Commission rightly points out, the digitisation of copyright books should fully respect the principle of copyright and properly reward authors, who have the most to benefit from the wider European public accessing their works."
"At the same time, however, the Commission has raised the question of the suitability of the European system of copyright for meeting the challenges of the digital age: does the present acquis allow European consumers access to digitised versions of books?"
"Does it guarantee payment to their authors?"
"The Google Books Project makes books available to a far wider readership than a conventional library would."
"The free distribution of books on the web, however, has come up against restrictions similar to those that have appeared in music publishing."
"The law has not kept up with the development of digital communications, so a new legal framework needs to be created which makes it possible to regulate a changing reality."
"There also needs to be a compromise between the benefits of projects such as Google Books and authors' rights in terms of being rewarded for their works."

"Colleagues, I now have an announcement to make which is perhaps very appropriate as we have just voted on our report on the 2009 enlargement strategy."
"I am very pleased to inform you that we have with us here today a delegation of Members of the Croatian Parliament, the Sabor."
"(Applause)"
"They are led by Mr Mario Zubović, who has just concluded the tenth meeting of the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee."
"Dear Members of the Sabor, we welcome you to our European Parliament here in Strasbourg."
"As you can see, we debated about enlargement this week and we want Croatia to join the European Union as soon as possible."
"(Applause)"
"You are, of course, facing the last and challenging rounds of the negotiation and we warmly encourage you to step up your preparation efforts."
"Dear colleagues, we look forward to welcoming Croatian observers to the European Parliament very soon and we look forward to sitting with you in this House in the course of this parliamentary term."
"Many thanks for your visit here today."

"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(RO) I wanted to highlight above all the quality of the efforts made by Gabriele Albertini in drafting the motion."
"I also wanted to say that I voted in favour of this motion, given that enlargement is an important political gesture for the EU."
"I also want to point out that I have voted differently from my political group on several issues, basically linked to Kosovo, as I hold a different view to the majority of European countries about Kosovo."
"Therefore, I voted differently on Amendment 17 in Article 19, Amendment 22, Amendment 24 and also after citation 4 in point 10."
"I still regard enlargement as being very important, but I also believe that the differences expressed by five of the Member States must be taken into account."
"(ES) Madam President, the votes of the Spanish socialist delegation on Kosovo support international non-recognition of Kosovo's unilateral declaration as an independent State."
"(BG) I voted against the enlargement strategy resolution because it contains many flattering words about the progress Turkey is making under the Copenhagen criteria."
"I do not see any sign of this progress."
"Fellow Members, please understand once and for all that Turkey is a country which, less than 100 years ago, committed genocide against the peoples within its borders and peoples which had recently liberated themselves from Turkish rule."
"Today, Turkey still continues to commit genocide, and its population and political class are proud of these actions committed by their country."
"Twenty years ago, Turkey sponsored terrorist organisations and exported terrorism."
"It continues to foster close links with terrorist organisations even to this day."
"If we want to have a country in the European Union which is still proud of genocide and sponsors terrorism, then go ahead and accept it."
"However, I am definitely against this."
"(FI) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report, but I would like to raise one important issue with regard to it."
"In my view, we in the European Parliament and the European Union need to ensure that all countries aspiring to membership of the European Union demonstrate compliance with the Copenhagen criteria."
"It is very important to make sure that human rights, democracy, freedom of opinion and the rule of law can be implemented."
"Today, we also voted on women's rights and for women to have the right to a life in which they do not have to put up with violence."
"I think that it is very important in this connection to ensure that the rights of women and children are implemented in any country that wants to join the European Union."
"With respect to all this, I am mainly talking about Turkey."
"Turkey has to implement speedy reforms and changes if it is to be ready to join the European Union, although I do not myself share the belief that that will happen in our lifetime."
"It is nevertheless most important that we in the European Union jointly adhere to the agreed rules, the Copenhagen criteria."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also voted no, because I am of the opinion that Turkey must first fulfil all the criteria, before we can make such a positive statement here."
"In particular, I would like to highlight the border dispute between Cyprus and Turkey, which has still not been settled this year, and the illegal occupation of Cyprus, which has not yet been brought to an end."
"However, I did not want to vote against the other accession candidates."
"I would particularly make an exception in the case of the Balkan States which I would like to welcome here in this House as soon as possible."
"(PL) Mr President, I abstained from voting on this resolution, although the question is important, and even very important."
"However, I do not see why the question of combating violence against women should be taken together with the question of reproductive choice."
"During the debate on this subject yesterday, some of the speakers were talking nonsense. Mrs Senyszyn accused the Catholic Church of oppressing women."
"It would be difficult to say something more absurd."
"In Poland, there are no honour killings, circumcision of girls is not a general practice, there is no selective abortion, there are no temporary marriages, and people are not stoned for actual or claimed adultery."
"Women do not suffer discrimination by the law in any way, and all instances of violence against women are universally condemned, both by the citizens and by the Catholic Church."
"Fortunately, extreme statements of this kind did not find their way into the resolution, so I only abstained."
"(IT) Mr President, I have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the elimination of violence against women."
"I am dedicating my vote to the nearly seven million Italian women who are subjected to violence by men each year."
"Of course, I also dedicate it to all those women in Europe who find themselves in the same situation."
"At times, we are tempted to believe that this is a phenomenon that takes place on the fringes of our society when, in reality, violence against women is carried out above all within the home."
"Thus, it is a phenomenon which directly affects us."
"Elderly women have greater difficulty in protecting themselves."
"Therefore, we must not forget about them, because violence is not only physical; it is also cultural."
"It can also mean denying a person their freedom of movement."
"Moreover, before reaching adulthood, women are young girls, and violence against a young girl will prevent her from enjoying life forever."
"I therefore hope that, from this point forward, Parliament will take concrete measures to ensure that all this does not remain just a good intention."
"(SV) Mr President, violence against women is a widespread problem throughout Europe and, indeed, the world."
"In Sweden alone, with a population of nine million, 380 women are abused every day."
"A fifth of the female population is subjected to violence and 45% of all women between the ages of 16 and 64 have, at some time in their lives, been victims of acts of violence."
"This is absolutely appalling."
"Being subjected to violence in the home is a horrendous violation of personal integrity."
"Men and women should have the same chance of physical integrity."
"The violence that goes on across our continent is evidence that the work of promoting equality in Europe still has a long way to go."
"The EU cannot continue to ignore these facts."
"I therefore welcome the resolution on elimination of violence against women and call on the new Commission and the Council to also assume their share of the responsibility in this matter."
"I intend to ensure that the Commission is forced to table a proposal to improve the situation with regard to violence against women."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of this resolution wholeheartedly because I think that we need to join forces across political groups towards a common goal - to denounce, raise awareness of and combat all forms of violence against women."
"I am particularly sensitive to the women in conflict as I shared, provided help during, and lived through, all the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and partly also with the Red Cross in Darfur."
"I think that we now have a fantastic instrument with the Stockholm Programme to enable us to move from words to action."
"I would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for having included empowerment and combating violence against women in the Stockholm Programme."
"I will definitely work towards there being a priority, in the implementation of the Stockholm Programme, for combating violence against women."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to stress that the subject of violence against women is extremely important, and I am very glad that the European Parliament has taken up this problem."
"Worthy of particular attention is the problem of the most aggressive and brutal sexually motivated crimes, which are committed against women but which do not always meet with an adequate reaction from the justice system in some European countries."
"Sentences handed down by courts in such cases are often extremely lenient, which in some cases causes women to lose motivation to report the drastic incidents which have happened to them to the law enforcement authorities."
"This leads to the existence of invisible crime statistics."
"This is why, in cases of these most drastic and serious crimes against women, where violence is used and which are sexually motivated, we should give greater attention to efforts at standardising sentencing, to give a sense of security and also a certain feeling of justice and moral satisfaction to women who have been affected in such a cruel way."
"I would like to stress that I could not vote in favour of the final text of the resolution because of its ideological and radical attitude to the question of abortion, an attitude which conflicts with Christian values."
"(PL) Mr President, I would like to give an explanation of vote on the question of combating tobacco smoking, if possible."
"A very short statement."
"Mr Wojciechowski, the rules state that we must deal with one subject after another."
"We have just discussed the subject of the elimination of violence against women and we will now be moving to the subject of a political solution with regard to the piracy off the Somalian coast."
"One thing at a time!"
"(NL) The Dutch Party for Freedom (PVV) voted against the motion for a resolution on Somalia, and I should like to explain why."
"The PVV takes the view that the monitoring of vessels off the coast of Somalia is not a task for the EU; instead, it is one hundred per cent a task for NATO."
"Europe has no army, nor does it have any business being there."
"This is one hundred per cent a job for NATO."
"The PVV also takes the view that marines should be present on merchant ships to make it possible to resist direct attacks by pirates."
"To reiterate then, the piracy in the sea surrounding Somalia must be stopped, but not this way."
"(SK) The recommendations of the Council on non-smoking environments have the aim of assisting the Member States in their efforts to protect people more effectively from tobacco smoke."
"This is in accordance with international obligations arising from the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control."
"I support the recommendation."
"Smoking continues to be the most frequent cause of diseases which lead to premature deaths."
"These include cardiovascular diseases, cancers and chronic diseases of the airways and, to a lesser extent, of reduced fertility in young women and men."
"At a time of demographic crisis and the development of new fertility methods which are financially costly, we should focus more on raising awareness."
"It is necessary to begin in the family in order to protect our children from the negative effects of smoking."
"I would like to conclude with an important request for consistent monitoring to include responses to the activities of the tobacco industry aimed at torpedoing anti-smoking measures."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to speak about two aspects of the smoke-free environment."
"Firstly, I have voted in favour of the Member States being given the authority in this area, on the one hand, because of the concept of subsidiarity and, on the other hand, because we do not have any authority."
"Although I am very much in favour of a smoke-free environment, I believe that in this case we should play by the rules."
"The second aspect is that I find it annoying that the European Union subsidises the cultivation of tobacco."
"This will be phased out and I have also voted in favour of this, because I cannot bring it into line with the other idea of banning smoking altogether."
"Therefore, we must be consistent."
"If we want to combat smoking, then we should not subsidise tobacco cultivation."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the German conservative group (CSU) would like to see clear and practical rules for the protection of non-smokers being introduced throughout Europe."
"However, in my opinion, 'throughout Europe' does not necessarily mean 'from within Europe'."
"Many Member States already have in place regulations for protecting non-smokers and others are in the process of introducing regulations of this kind."
"I do not believe - in common with the majority of my fellow Members in the European Parliament, which is very pleasing - that we in Brussels must impose regulations for the protection of non-smokers or that we are able to do this more effectively."
"The European Union has no authority in this area."
"We are only responsible for health and safety at work."
"This is where the problem lies, because for me the most important issue is protecting children and young people and this group, which specifically needs protection, would not be covered by regulations that refer only to health and safety at work."
"Therefore, the Member States must take action in this area."
"I have voted in favour and I am pleased that this amendment was accepted."
"Mr President, I come from a country which has introduced a ban on smoking in the workplace."
"Indeed, I was a Member of the Irish Parliament at the time and I fully supported the ban."
"However, we are in a slightly different position here in the European Parliament, where we have to consider the principle of subsidiarity."
"While indeed there may be an issue with regard to the protection of workers' health - we have legislation in this area already, such as on exposure to electro-magnetic radiation - we cannot ask, as we did in paragraph 7, that Member States, where smoking bans already exist, respect the principle of equality between different types of establishment in the hospitality sector."
"Yesterday, we voted on the role of national parliaments and their powers on proposed EU legislation in the area of subsidiarity under the new Lisbon Treaty, so we have to be very careful that we are coherent in the way we vote."
"Finally, I was talking to my colleague at the very beginning and missed the vote on the European Year of Volunteering."
"I want to state that I fully support the Parliament proposal for that Year, having led the campaign to ensure that 2011 was designated during the last parliamentary term."
"(FR) Mr President, I feel slightly emotional explaining this vote as my own mother was born in the tobacco factory in this very city of Strasbourg where my grandfather worked."
"This factory has just closed down."
"When the service in France for producing tobacco and matches, which was a public service at the time, was turned into a limited company, its employees were told that this would be of no consequence to their jobs."
"Today, we can also understand the concern of other public service sectors confronted by the same problems."
"In actual fact, we can definitely understand and justify the campaign against smoking, with its harmful effects on people's health."
"However, unfortunately, French tobacco production has disappeared."
"The tobacco factory in Strasbourg has closed down, but people are still smoking."
"They are continuing with tobacco imported from abroad."
"This is why I personally support the prices set for European tobacco growers, at least for as long as people go on smoking in Europe."
"I prefer to see it grown here rather than imported from elsewhere."
"(PL) Mr President, thank you for allowing me to speak."
"I support the action being taken by the European Union to reduce tobacco consumption, but I do not think this action should be based on reducing support for tobacco producers."
"This is because tobacco production is not related to its consumption."
"If we reduce or eliminate production, or if we withdraw support from farms which produce tobacco, there will still be consumption, only it will be consumption of imported tobacco."
"Fighting the tobacco producers is not the way to reduce smoking."
"That would be rather like trying to reduce beer consumption among young people by starting with a fight against hops producers."
"This is why I endorsed with my vote the position which says that production of tobacco does not influence its consumption."
"(SK) The food crisis is not only an economic and humanitarian problem but also a question of world peace and security."
"I was delighted to support the approved resolution, even though I have reservations over the solution to the question of world hunger."
"The meeting of the World Summit on Food Security did not take the direction desired by the organisers."
"Even though the fight against hunger is a problem with socio-economic, financial and cultural dimensions, the discussions in the meeting were restricted just to the technical level."
"Even FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf was disappointed with the meeting and with the fact that representatives of western countries did not participate in the meeting."
"The representatives of the developed world did not adopt any concrete obligations."
"I cannot help seeing the question of solving hunger and poverty as a media topic rather than a concrete problem requiring an urgent solution."
"The foundation of solidarity is a willingness to assume real responsibility when meeting with others who are in need."
"Written explanations of vote"
"in writing. - The UKIP admires volunteering and recognises the contribution to society it can make."
"However, this report called for the naked politicisation of volunteering for EU purposes, and for the use of the British taxpayers' money to achieve this politicisation."
"Thus, we could not support the motion."
"in writing. - The notion of volunteering is crucial in modern day societies."
"It is something that is done out of the free will of the person concerned and can have an incredibly positive impact on the lives of many."
"The European Year of Volunteering is hence an important initiative."
"I am in agreement with the rapporteur."
"It is for these reasons that I have chosen to vote in favour of the report."
"in writing. - I voted for this proposal in recognition of the many volunteers who do invaluable work without the recognition they deserve."
"Without their contribution to society, for which they receive no monetary remuneration, the United Kingdom would be a lesser place."
"While against the whole principle of European citizenship, I recognise the value of the service provided by volunteers."
"Therefore, I supported this proposal."
"I voted in favour of Mr Scurria's report on the European Year of Volunteering (2011), advocating greater support from the institutions of the EU for this sector, which involves millions of European citizens and is essential for the promotion of solidarity and social inclusion."
"I believe that both the budget and coordination need to be increased at Community level, so as to consolidate the initiatives that form part of the European Year of Volunteering, such as awareness campaigns and transnational exchanges focusing on ideas and good practice."
"The most basic definition of volunteering is goodwill in action."
"It is offered without charge, and it is generous, freely given and without strings."
"It is also a fundamental pillar of any society, as the work of thousands of volunteers, young and old, acting in a formal or informal capacity, in the fields of health, welfare, education, the environment or culture, makes a difference to thousands of lives every single day."
"In view of this, we should welcome the initiative of launching a European Year of Volunteering, which will give due prominence to the anonymous faces of these volunteers, making us all aware of their tremendous work and seeking to create more favourable conditions for them to carry out their activities."
"This idea is in line with those of the Democratic and Social Centre - People's Party, the first and only Portuguese political party to look at the issue of volunteering and make practical proposals to help volunteers, giving them the dignity and recognition that they deserve."
"We voted in favour of this report, despite certain contradictions and small parts of it with which we do not agree."
"Volunteering undoubtedly plays an important role in society, promoting the value of solidarity and mutual aid, contributing to social integration and helping to overcome discriminatory views, among other aspects."
"The report tackles basic aspects, such as social support for the volunteer, focusing on issues like health, safety and training, and the distinction between paid work and voluntary activities."
"Nevertheless, we believe that it needs to be ensured that volunteering does not come to substitute action by Member States, and that it must not be used as a way of fulfilling needs which are the responsibility of the social services."
"We advocate the need to promote the activities of non-profit organisations through effective and sufficient support."
"Such organisations include: cooperative groups; collectives and local societies; local residents' associations; sports, leisure, cultural, youth organisations, and those aimed at children."
"We must also emphasise that voluntary work is equally dependent on workers having free time, and that it is incompatible with exploitation, irregular or excessive working hours, low salaries and job insecurity."
"in writing. - It is with great pleasure that I have voted in favour of naming 2011 as the European Year of Volunteering."
"It is a great boon to the numerous voluntary organisations in all of our Member States of the EU."
"I would like to point out that sporting organisations play a central role in volunteering and, despite this not being stipulated explicitly in the legislative text, nevertheless needs to be acknowledged."
"Indeed, the largest voluntary association in Ireland is the Gaelic Athletic Association."
"The efforts of all involved in this great institution need to be duly recognised and lauded."
"Mr President, volunteering represents the expression of European social values such as solidarity and non-discrimination."
"While it contributes to the personal development of volunteers on the one hand, it creates social cohesion on the other."
"Therefore, it requires due recognition and support from the European institutions, the Member States, local and regional authorities and various members of civil society, each according to their individual expertise."
"The European Year of Volunteering (2011) will enable the activities organised in this field to take on a European dimension, and therefore the hope is that this will have a major impact on civil society."
"The estimated EUR 3 million for preparatory initiatives in 2010, the increase in European Parliament-approved appropriations to EUR 8 million for 2011 and a high percentage - 1.8% to be precise - of cofinancing for the projects, will indeed enable the objectives set to be achieved, with the various levels working together."
"Finally, it is worth mentioning the role that volunteering, if supported properly, can play with regard to retired workers, given the growing number of elderly people in civil society."
"I voted in favour of the draft report on the European Year of Volunteering for a number of reasons."
"It is well known that voluntary activities offer a two-fold benefit: for the individual and for society."
"On the one hand, volunteering offers citizens the chance to learn and acquire new skills and for self-development."
"On the other hand, it also has a social function, contributing to the creation of a sense of solidarity and belonging."
"Bearing in mind the ever-growing interdependence of local communities in a globalised world and, at the same time, the worsening extent of individualistic behaviour, it is becoming vital to encourage social participation by citizens."
"I am referring in this instance to activities involving both young and old alike."
"Furthermore, I think that the exchange of experiences first-hand between volunteer organisations from the most diverse corners of the European Union has a major impact, given that the values motivating them all are the same."
"The purpose is identical: to raise the standard of living and improve the quality of life, ensure a high level of employment, improve social cohesion and combat exclusion."
"In other words, these are precisely the values on which the European Union is founded."
"in writing. - Despite the request for a budget increase which I opposed and voted against at the committee stages, I nonetheless fully support the Report on the European Year of Volunteering overall."
"Volunteers are often unsung heroes."
"They make an immeasurable impact in their communities and on people's lives."
"In tough economic times like these, volunteering becomes all the more important and that is why I and others who brought this report forward are keen not only to raise awareness of the benefits of volunteering, but also to create a European Year where properly-funded initiatives will provide volunteering organisations the opportunity to encourage new volunteers to come forward."
"We must ensure that the European Year of Volunteering is used as a platform for recognition of the contribution volunteers make to our communities, but also use this as an opportunity for us to better understand the barriers to volunteering and what we can do to help remove them and push volunteering forward."
"This is an example of what the EU should be doing - exchanging best practice in areas such as volunteering rather than creating more and more needless bureaucracy."
"I supported the report on the European Year of Volunteering in 2011, intended to promote dialogue and the exchange of good volunteering practice between authorities and stakeholders in our Member States."
"With the increase over recent years in individualistic behaviour, the quest for new ways of individual expression, or even the changing demographic trends, civic participation has undergone major changes."
"Therefore, volunteering must also adapt to enable a larger number of people to get involved in volunteering in different ways and at different times in their life."
"This can mean tapping the potential offered by the elderly and defining new forms of involvement with greater flexibility in terms of duration and ways to participate."
"Europe, which has a long volunteering tradition, must help release the potential this offers."
"Volunteering provides those involved with a channel for learning (it is obvious that participation in voluntary activities provides citizens with new skills, contributes to their personal development and increases their sense of belonging to society)."
"It also embodies such European values as solidarity, civic participation and non-discrimination in sectors as varied as education, culture, the environment, social welfare or health."
"I endorsed the report on the European Year of Volunteering (2011)."
"In the Member States of the European Union, we must give more importance to the question of volunteering, and should plan political action which supports the work of volunteers."
"The amendments proposed by the European Parliament introduce many significant changes to the Commission's proposal, and these should be included by the Council."
"The budgetary amount earmarked for achievement of the objectives of the European Year of Volunteering (2011), which amounts to EUR 6 million, is insufficient (by way of comparison, the budget for the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion is nearly three times higher)."
"Volunteering is a gratuitous and unpaid activity, but this does not mean that it does not generate any costs."
"Volunteering needs financial and political support from all interested parties: non-government organisations, governments, administrative bodies of both national and local government, and businesses."
"Political commitment should be seen in the form of favourable policy which supports the development and infrastructure of volunteering."
"This matter is especially important for Poland, which will hold the EU Presidency in 2011."
"I would like to ask the Government of Poland to follow the example set by the European Parliament and take action to increase financial support for the European Year of Volunteering."
"I fully support the proposal to designate financial means for the creation of an interactive database for volunteers and voluntary organisations, which would be accessible to all stakeholders and which would continue to operate after 2011."
"The year 2011 will be the European Year of Volunteering, and will be intended to honour and distinguish volunteers and their contribution to society."
"It is a wonderful proposal."
"Volunteering occurs in many different forms all over Europe, but everywhere, irrespective of the place, it is characterised by the fact that people want to help others without being paid, or they willingly get involved in environmental protection or work to ensure that every citizen can live with dignity."
"It is worth stressing the fact that volunteering unquestionably has a positive influence on the developing identity of Europe, which has its roots in these values and is a good basis for developing understanding between citizens of the different social groups and countries of the entire European society."
"In addition, volunteering is significant for integration, social policy and education."
"We should also remember that it has great significance for intercultural dialogue and dialogue between generations, and it contributes to the development of social responsibility."
"Volunteering also has economic value, and we must not forget this."
"It is, indeed, an unpaid and gratuitous activity, but this does not mean, however, that it does not involve any financial outlay."
"For this reason, it is important that volunteering receive support from the European Community."
"Volunteering requires policy based on friendly relations, which will support its development and infrastructure."
"I think that supporting the reward and recognition of voluntary activities by using certain financial means will motivate individuals, businesses and organisations."
"I would like to explain my vote on the report of Marco Scurria on the proposal for a Council Decision on the European Year of Volunteering."
"Personally, I consider unpaid voluntary activities to be an important part of our society."
"In my own country, the Czech Republic, the most numerous and long-established voluntary organisations are the voluntary fire fighters."
"Their traditions go back a long way to a period when the need to avert catastrophic elemental disasters such as fires always brought together a few dozen volunteers whose aim was to protect their own property and that of their neighbours and other people they lived with."
"The most widely-spread and oldest organisations involved in voluntary work also include the Czech Red Cross, the Czech Tourists' Club, the Sokol gymnastic association, the Junák youth organisation and the voluntary mountain rescue service."
"All of these people who help in schools, hospitals and sports clubs or in the mountains, or who travel abroad to provide aid, deserve recognition."
"In this regard, it will surely be wholly beneficial to dedicate the year 2011 to this theme."
"For this reason I voted in favour of the report."
"It is generally possible to welcome any agreement which improves cooperation with states neighbouring the European Union."
"If we compare the position of the states neighbouring the EU, then we see that - after Russia - the most important partner is Ukraine."
"The exchange of information in the fields of science and technology, the joint implementation of programmes, worker exchanges and the sharing of expertise in the area of managing scientific and research institutions, these are aims that can only be supported."
"However, I would like to raise a specific reservation over the method of assessing the agreement."
"If the authors introduce efficiency indicators such as 'number of work trips and meetings', and even 'number of different areas of cooperative endeavour' then I have serious doubts as to the familiarity of the report's author with the issue in question."
"Section 7, 'Measures Against Fraud', makes a quite desperate impression, while statement 8.2.2 makes me question my sanity."
"In the age of electronic communications, I cannot understand why a 'report' on an agreement requires work trips and participation in meetings on the part of specialists and officials from the EU and Ukraine."
"In conclusion, I am happy to support this framework agreement because I know that in the Sixth Framework Programme, developments in science and research were already being integrated very actively and with genuinely good results."
"The aforementioned reservations notwithstanding, the GUE/NGL group supports the decision of the Council."
"in writing. - The UKIP is not opposed to cooperation in the field of energy efficiency, but insists that such cooperation must be conducted by democratically elected governments and not by their unaccountable proxies in an anti-democratic supranational organisation such as the EU."
"As we face a flood of applications for EU membership, the vote on this resolution could not have come at a better time."
"The EU is a rock of stability on this continent."
"It cannot remain a club which is closed to other European states, but it cannot open its doors indefinitely either."
"The European Union must, above all, make a success of the enlargements it has already carried out for the new Member States."
"As for the other states knocking on its door, the prerequisite for initiating any accession negotiations remains strict compliance with the Copenhagen criteria (democracy, rule of law, human rights, gender equality, market economy, etc.), along with unconditional observance of international law."
"Accession negotiations with candidate countries must be based on objectively measurable criteria, such as respect for rights and economic criteria, and avoid any kind of subjective reference based on values, religion or culture."
"In my view, what we therefore need to do is as follows: confirm the Balkans' suitability for EU membership; remember that enlargement and consolidation are inextricably linked; insist, in the case of Turkey, on compliance with the accession criteria; and, in the event of the negotiations' failure, propose a special association agreement."
"In spite of all the criticism that can be levelled at it, it has been unequivocally shown that many countries harbour an enormous desire to join the European Union."
"The brutal and turbulent history of several of these countries, particularly in the Balkans, has strengthened their conviction that they would be free of both the expansionist tendencies of their neighbours and the influence of Russia if they were sheltered under the umbrella of the European Union."
"Looking at the countries on the list, it is relatively easy to spot the inequality between different countries in terms of their enthusiasm and espousal of the conditions for joining the European Union."
"As I see it, Iceland stands out from this group, as its tradition of democracy, the high living standards of its citizens and its respect for the community acquis put it first in line for the accession process."
"Aware of the need to adhere strictly to the criteria set out in Copenhagen, and to meet the commitments resulting therefrom, the European Union should not, through blind obstinacy, refuse to embrace those who show themselves ready to do the same."
"This resolution is yet another case where, in relation to enlargement and a statement published by the European Commission, entitled 'Enlargement Strategy and Main Challenges 2009-2010', the majority in Parliament wants to acknowledge Kosovo, even saying that they 'welcome the Commission's intention to strengthen its relations with Kosovo, including exploring the possibility of Kosovo's participation in Community programmes.'"
"This encourages the future accession of a territory that has proclaimed its independence in blatant violation of international law, ignoring the fact that it is a state that is the product of an illegal war, a state that operates on the basis of an illegal statute which is not recognised by the UN."
"Neither is the issue of Turkey adequately covered, given that this country continues its military occupation of an EU Member State - Northern Cyprus - and does not respect the rights of the Kurdish people as it should."
"In view of this, although we believe that the issue of EU enlargement is primarily a decision for the people of each country that wishes to join, we voted against the report as it stands due to the negative aspects of the strategy that it seeks to follow, although this has no legal value."
"in writing. - I voted for Amendment 4."
"I very much believe that we have to underline that by non-muslims, we first and foremost mean the Christians, therefore a mention of Christians explicitly next to other religious communities is needed."
"Christians are still persecuted in Turkey and it remains one of our biggest concerns."
"Christians and their communities are still not able to exercise their belief freely as they should be in a democratic state."
"I am convinced that Turkey will be ready for EU accession at the moment when it becomes as easy to raise a Christian church in Turkey as it is to raise a mosque in Brussels."
"The process of EU enlargement should always be carefully considered and any new accession should always respect the common points of reference between the countries that make up the EU."
"I understand that the accession of Turkey is seen as grounds for a preliminary debate, yet this indicates that there are doubts which, at the very least, justify this debate."
"The debate would include issues such as whether Turkey can, geographically speaking, be considered part of Europe, whether its secularity is merely the result of the army which keeps it in check, whether an EU with borders stretching to Iraqi Kurdistan would be wise, and whether, due to its enormous demographic mass, Turkey's accession would throw the EU off balance."
"Moreover, there is a non-negotiable obligation to respect the Copenhagen criteria, the first of which has to do with human rights."
"With regard to the resolution on the Commission's enlargement strategy paper for 2009, we would like to make it clear, on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State."
"We feel that Kosovo is an exceptional case, and we would like to point out that it has not been recognised by Spain or by four other Member States."
"Consequently, both in the Committee on Foreign Affairs and today in plenary, we have supported the amendments that were in line with our viewpoint."
"Our vote in favour of the resolution is due to the fact that we do not want our position on Kosovo to be understood as a negative attitude to the enlargement process that the countries of the Western Balkans, Turkey and Iceland are now involved in."
"I strongly oppose the Commission's enlargement strategy with regard to Turkey."
"The clear majority of EU citizens is against Turkey joining the EU and yet they must help to fund payments of billions of euros to Turkey in its role of official accession candidate."
"Turkey is not a European country, either geographically or culturally, or in terms of safeguarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law."
"The enlargement strategy takes almost no account of the concerns of the citizens of Europe."
"Instead it represents the geostrategic interests of the US."
"In addition, the unresolved conflicts on Turkey's borders will become EU problems if Turkey were to join."
"I regret the fact that the entire enlargement strategy, which includes Iceland and the western Balkans as well as Turkey, was discussed as a whole and this made it impossible to have a proper, selective, differentiated debate."
"The arrogance with which the subject of Turkey's accession is being handled is reflected in this procedure."
"The unwelcome voices of those opposed to accession, who represent the majority of the population, are largely being ignored."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the Commission's 2009 enlargement strategy paper concerning the Western Balkan countries, Iceland and Turkey, since 6-15 years ago, Lithuania, together with the Baltic States and other Central and Eastern European countries, was in a similar situation to the candidate countries."
"Membership of the European Union gave my country and the other new EU Member States and their citizens many new opportunities, and helped to boost the economy and to strengthen democracy and human rights."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union will have a new, more powerful engine that will drive our ship forward more successfully and through the waters of the financial and economic crisis, taking us to a new stage of EU enlargement."
"Only once they have joined the EU will the Balkan countries, the infamous 'powder keg' of Europe, where the world wars were sparked off, be able to remove the barriers to cooperation between the citizens, the business structures and the cultural and scientific experts of the various states that have appeared there in recent years."
"It is important not to close the door to Turkey, which can be said to be Europe's link to the Muslim world."
"Turkey's rapprochement with the EU is changing this country in a good way and there is evidence of many positive steps to strengthen democracy and human rights."
"Although we are not yet discussing EU membership for Ukraine, Moldova or the countries of the South Caucasus in concrete terms, such a prospect in the future can contribute to stability, economic strengthening, reduced corruption and the consolidation of the rule of law in these countries."
"The EU enlargement process is taking place at the moment against the background of a harsh, far-reaching recession, which has hit both the EU and the countries involved in the enlargement process."
"I welcome the progress made by Turkey in meeting the criteria for joining the European Union, especially the fact that this country signed the Intergovernmental Agreement for the Nabucco pipeline."
"The implementation of this agreement remains one of the biggest priorities in the area of EU energy security."
"I support the requests made to the Turkish Government to continue reforming its social policies, to improve social dialogue on the labour market, as well as to step up efforts in the area of women's rights and gender equality, especially when it comes to combating gender violence."
"in writing. - We vote against the motion for a resolution 'The Commission's 2009 enlargement strategy paper concerning the Western Balkan countries, Iceland and Turkey' by Gabriele Albertini, because we believe that neither Turkey nor the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows any progress in meeting the Copenhagen criteria, nor do they demonstrate any political behaviour which would allow them to become EU members We hope to improve their efforts in order to meet the accession criteria, a fact that will be examined in the future."
"In any case, we do not wish to vote for a motion for a resolution that will give rise to vain hopes and will be used exclusively for internal consumption."
"The motion for a resolution on the European Commission's current enlargement strategy is very balanced."
"It rewards the progress made by the accession candidates but, at the same time, clearly identifies the problems."
"Turkey, in particular, has taken a major step backwards."
"Therefore, I welcome the explicit criticism of the serious threats to, and genuine restrictions on, freedom of speech and of the press."
"The completely disproportionate tax penalty imposed on the opposition Dogan Media Group is a targeted attack against those who criticise the government."
"Objections have rightly been made to the discrimination against religious minorities and Turkey's refusal to implement the Ankara protocol."
"In addition, it is also important that we take a careful look at Turkish foreign policy."
"Its openness towards Armenia and the Kurds has so far been nothing more than gesture politics and has even been opposed by the Turkish parliament and by large sections of the population."
"The statements made by the Turkish Prime Minister also call into question Turkey's hoped-for role as a mediator between East and West."
"Turkey's flattery of the Iranian President, its invitation to the Sudanese President, who is wanted for genocide, to attend a conference, and its dealings with Israel, seem to indicate that it is turning away from the West."
"Therefore, our call for the Turkish Government to coordinate its foreign policy with that of the EU and to drop its objections to the cooperation between NATO and the EU is simply consistent."
"in writing. - I am in favour of the EU being open to countries who meet the criteria for membership."
"I am concerned that this resolution presents enlargement as being imperative for the countries in question as well as the EU."
"It does not conceive of the possibility that it may be in the best interests of the countries concerned to remain outside the EU for a variety of social, economic or other reasons."
"EU membership is a big step for the countries concerned and it deserves the fullest possible debate and consultation involving the citizens of those countries."
"For this reason, I abstained."
"The International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women is an incentive by the UN and the Council of Europe which aims to discuss and give greater visibility to the victims of domestic violence and other types of mistreatment."
"The situation of this issue in Portugal is worrying."
"The number of crimes of domestic violence recorded by the Portuguese Association for Victim Support (APAV) has increased by 9% on the same period in 2008."
"According to the APAV, physical and psychological abuse, threats and sexual assaults have seen a major increase compared with the 2008 figures."
"Twenty-six women have died this year in Portugal already, as victims of domestic violence."
"Nonetheless, the vast majority of acts of violence are not reported through fear and shame."
"The EU needs to step up its efforts to combat this issue."
"I agree with the need to encourage Member States to draw up national plans of action for combating violence against women."
"We support any initiative that might help to change attitudes, in conjunction with the organisation of a European Year to combat violence against women, so as to expose it and alert both the public and the authorities to this worrying situation."
"I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the elimination of violence against women as I believe that the Commission and the Council need to consolidate EU action in this area."
"The EU urgently needs a more comprehensive policy on combating violence against women, specifically through the Commission drawing up a draft directive to ensure a clear legal basis for combating all forms of violence against women, including trafficking."
"We should acknowledge and welcome the fact that the Spanish Presidency makes this issue a priority in its plan of action."
"In a week when the frightening figures for cases of domestic violence have hit the headlines in Portugal, I believe that violence against women and children is a topic that requires consideration and serious action by governments."
"I condemn all kinds of violence, but particularly when it is used against those who are in a more vulnerable position - socially, economically or emotionally - as children and women often are."
"The Member States should therefore seek to eliminate all forms of violence against women and children, especially trafficking for sexual exploitation, sexually motivated attacks and domestic violence."
"Respect for human life and dignity is not consistent with crimes whose victims are many European women and children, which is why firm policies on the prevention of violence and the punishment of its perpetrators are necessary."
"On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, we wish to raise awareness of this serious social, economic and political problem that undermines women's rights in many different areas, including at work, among their families, and in society in general."
"Violence against women is a violation of human rights and an obstacle to their participation in social and political life, and in their public and professional life, preventing them from acting as full citizens."
"Although the many types of violence vary according to culture and traditions, economic and social crises of capitalism increase women's vulnerability, both collectively and individually, adding to their exploitation and driving them towards poverty and marginalisation, which also feeds the trafficking of women and prostitution."
"It is therefore crucial that we consolidate financial measures and policies that are genuinely committed to strengthening the role of women in society by promoting equal rights on both a Community and national level, and by implementing real plans to combat all forms of violence against women, along with eliminating residual discrimination and protecting and supporting victims."
"As we mark the 10th anniversary of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, it has to be said that the preventive measures which have been implemented with this purpose in mind have not achieved the expected results."
"How can we explain this phenomenon?"
"Judging from the debates which have been held in this Chamber, we can put a label on it: gender inequality."
"If this inequality was the fundamental cause of this phenomenon, countries in northern Europe, which are renowned for their very progressive culture and customs, ought to have the best results."
"In fact, this is not the case; if anything, it is the opposite."
"According to the Norwegian daily newspaper Aftenposten, 6% of young women in Sweden aged between 15 and 25 have been raped in one year."
"Courage is required to be able to say that the rise in acts of violence against women has coincided with the mass arrival of immigrants from outside Europe whose culture and traditions are totally opposite to ours."
"The burkha, forced marriages, polygamy, female genital mutilation, honour crimes and other forms of behaviour from another era are unacceptable."
"It therefore makes it absolutely absurd to continue to encourage this immigration while wanting to combat violence against women."
"It makes perfect sense for the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality to remind us, as we mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, that, in spite of the countless legal instruments and UN declarations, not to mention the numerous resolutions in this Parliament made over many decades, we are still far from a situation of zero tolerance with regard to violence against women."
"There is no denying that violence by men against women is a violation of human rights and must be punished as such."
"This Parliament must therefore remind Member States of their obligations to reinforce their legislations and policies to enable them to combat effectively all forms of violence against women."
"Unfortunately, we have again over-egged the pudding in the resolution tabled before us and, in particular, we have ignored the principle of subsidiarity."
"Making a request to the Council and Commission for a legal basis to be created for combating all forms of violence against women displays the height of ignorance of the treaties."
"A legal basis cannot be created."
"It either exists or not."
"Asking for a further high-level conference to be held will only incur expense which would be better allocated to specific measures."
"I welcome the vote in the European Parliament on the resolution for eliminating violence against women on this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women."
"The declaration of this day by the UN in 1999 and the adoption of this resolution today are valuable instruments for reminding national governments of their obligations arising from the international treaties concerning the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women."
"This is why I support this resolution, with an immediate request for Member States to reinforce their national legislations and policies on combating all forms of violence against women."
"At European Union level, it is particularly vital to guarantee assistance and support for all victims of violence, especially those affected by human trafficking, regardless of their nationality, as well as to ensure protection for women who are victims of domestic violence whose legal status might depend on their partner."
"When we talk about violence against women, we are discussing something that is clearly a reality in all the Member States, as one in four women is a victim of violence."
"In an EU that sees itself as the champion of rights and freedoms for all its citizens, we must make every effort to put a stop to this scourge."
"The adoption of this draft resolution is a very important step towards finding new solutions, hence my vote."
"I voted in favour of this resolution as violence against women is still a problem which is all too prevalent in Romania and worldwide, making it necessary to adopt urgent measures to combat this scourge."
"Legislation is no longer the problem, but its application in the situation where many women are reluctant to report to the authorities the acts of violence they are subjected to, preferring to endure the suffering in silence."
"I believe that a powerful campaign is needed across the whole of society, based on continuous, long-term activities aimed at influencing attitudes so that everyone realises that violence against women is not permitted and not excused."
"I agree that coordinated action is needed at the same time from the authorities and civil society in order to support victims of domestic violence."
"in writing. - I welcome Parliament's commitment to this cause."
"In particular, it is critical to ensure that the women in some of the most vulnerable circumstances, such as in 'trafficking of women', fall under this assistance."
"I am appalled that the ECR Group, which contains the British Conservatives, has submitted an amendment to this proposal which reduces its coverage."
"I would point out that many victims are those who live in poverty or are immigrants or from minority groups within our populations."
"Removing these women from assistance aimed at helping these most vulnerable people is as illogical as it is inhuman."
"I am equally appalled that the Greens should disagree and promote deletion of sensible wording covering tolerance of prostitution, where it is clear much violence against women occurs."
"Women are easy victims for any form of violence due to their unequal position in all class societies, in which they are open to class and gender oppression."
"Physical abuse, rape, trafficking and so on are forms of violence which demonstrate the gender dimension of the class aspect of female inequality."
"However, violence is a social phenomenon with specific economic, political and social causes."
"These causes, which are rooted in the capitalist relations of production, cannot be eliminated as long as these relations exist."
"The grassroots movements must demand measures to prevent this phenomenon and relieve the victims, women and children, by seeking radical changes in favour of the people at social and political level."
"We radically disagree with the creation by NGOs and private individuals of counselling centres and agencies to support maltreated women."
"The state alone must be responsible for these."
"Not only will the measures proposed in the resolution be unable to eliminate the problem, because they do not touch the causes; they also seek to manage and hence perpetuate the problem."
"in writing. - The ECR Group fully supports and stresses the great need to increase awareness and action to combat violence against women."
"However, we do not support calls for an EU legal base and further directives (as in paragraphs 10, 11 and 27) to address the problem."
"Whilst we acknowledge that work needs to be done in this area, we believe this is an issue for nation states to legislate upon."
"Furthermore, the ECR Group believes that the issues of sexual and reproductive choice and health rights are an issue of conscience for each individual Member and Member State to decide."
"For these reasons, the ECR Group has chosen to abstain."
"Somalia is one of the most blatant cases of the total breakdown of the central power and the return to a belligerent, tribal way of life, as the country is an epicentre of violence and instability which spreads far beyond its own borders."
"The coasts of Somalia have been constantly threatened by armed groups which not only fight for control of the coastal areas, but also carry out intolerable acts of piracy against other vessels, especially commercial, cargo, fishing, humanitarian aid and leisure boats."
"The severity and frequency of these events demands an uncompromising reaction from the whole international community, which must include the European Union."
"The EU must commit itself to combating piracy and doing everything within its power not only to analyse its causes and consequences, but also to mobilise all Somali and international forces that are available and equipped to deal with it."
"I must also praise the entire crew of the Portuguese frigate Corte-Real, in the person of their commander, who have distinguished themselves in the fight against this scourge, and have recently been the subject of a tribute by the International Maritime Organisation."
"When discussing the issue of Somalia, we need to remember that there is no military solution to the crisis there, and that we must take into account the country's lack of financial resources, caused at an international level by the debt crisis, which created a vacuum that was exploited by illegal fishing in its territorial waters, and which was one of the main reasons why Somali fishermen lost their livelihood, as the Somali Government was forced to suspend the country's coast guard due to a lack of resources."
"One of the essential issues, therefore, is to ensure the supply of technical and financial aid, including support for a process of conciliation and mediation between the parties involved in the civil war."
"The Commission and the Council should thus review their political strategy for Somalia, including Operation EUNAVFOR Atalanta, and should focus on the more general situation in the country at present, particularly the need to address the humanitarian situation on the ground and help to eradicate the underlying causes of this catastrophic situation which is causing suffering to millions of Somalis."
"Finally, we would like to stress that resources intended for aid and development, or the European Development Fund, should not, under any circumstances, be used for military purposes."
"in writing. - I am deeply proud to see the UK leading the work of the EU's first naval ESDP mission, Operation Atalanta, with a British Commander at its head and its operational HQ in the UK."
"Atalanta's work in the protection of vessels delivering food aid to displaced persons in Somalia and in protecting vulnerable vessels off the Somali coast is vitally important."
"Labour MEPs echo calls for the unconditional release of all hostages including the two Britons - Paul and Rachel Chandler from Kent - held by Somali pirates."
"Our thoughts continue to be with their family, and we praise the ongoing efforts of the UK Foreign Office, who are using all possible connections in East Africa to negotiate the pair's speedy release."
"Finally, on the scope of the Atalanta mission, we note calls in the resolution for its expansion to be considered."
"However, I want to put on record that we believe that at the current time, this is not a prospect, and to underline that we must focus on the continued success of the current mission as it stands."
"The current situation off the coast of Somalia is wrong on every level and has an impact on all countries."
"I think that it is therefore crucial that, pending a political solution to the problem of Somalia, and while there continues to be instability in the area, we should follow a strategy of heightened security for Operation Atalanta, even reinforcing the latter in terms of the means of action open to forces deployed in this operation."
"I voted against Resolution because I think that piracy is not a military problem but a development problem."
"I therefore believe that the problem should be dealt with at its root, and that the solution cannot be a military one, either by land or by sea."
"The officer responsible for Operation Atalanta stated that a maritime solution is impossible, and that the situation in the area needs to be stabilised."
"I think we need to tackle the problem of governance, the stability of institutions and economic development in the region."
"However much we paper over the cracks, the problem will persist."
"By voting against the resolution, I also want to condemn the privatisation of the actions that are within the remit of the armed forces, as in Spain, private security companies are being allowed to go out on vessels with weapons of war."
"Moreover, I think we need to put an end to the pirates in Somalia, but also to the foreign pirates that are pillaging in Somali waters."
"in writing. - The relative success of Operation Atalanta, now renewed for a year, underlines the fact that although the European Security and Defence Policy has the potential to achieve significant results for Member States, it is still unclear why NATO alone could not match this and thus avoid duplication."
"But piracy remains a clear and present danger in the seas around the Horn of Africa."
"We need to redouble efforts to defeat this menace, not only to protect our shipping, but to send a clear message of our resolve to the agents of al-Qaeda currently enjoying safe haven in Somalia."
"National security does not end at national borders."
"Leaving the scourge of piracy unchecked will multiply the EU's security concerns in the long term."
"I also urge the Commission to reconsider how more political support for the relatively stable, prosperous and democratic breakaway former British territory of Somaliland could help to tackle the threat of piracy in the region."
"I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on a political solution to the problem of piracy off the Somali coast because sea piracy is a real problem and will continue to be a problem in waters off the Somali coast."
"The EU must protect maritime vessels passing through this region by means of international negotiations and protection measures."
"One part of the solution requires international support in bringing stability to Somalia."
"The other part of the solution is Operation Atalanta, recently launched by the EU in order to stop piracy off the Somali coast."
"Six frigates, three maritime patrol aircraft and 1 200 personnel from the United Kingdom, France and Greece will take part in the operation."
"Other states will contribute to the operation in the future."
"Operation Atalanta has succeeded in providing protection for high-risk cargos by escorting them."
"Thirty-six pirate vessels have been intercepted and 14 direct attacks have been avoided."
"However, to be able to enjoy the benefit of this escort, the responsible national bodies and the sea vessels must notify Operation Atalanta and request protection."
"It is vital that sea vessels avoid taking needless risks and request, on an official basis and in good time, protection from Operation Atalanta."
"in writing. - We are in favour of robust international action to deal with piracy and have no doubt that the Royal Navy and allied navies from the US and other European nations will do a good job."
"However, we see no reason for the EU to run up its flag on a naval operation."
"We are opposed to the interference of the EU as an institution in defence matters."
"This brings no additional military capability and merely duplicates or adds complexity to the well-tried arrangements under NATO."
"Operation Atalanta was conceived as a political opportunity to add a maritime dimension to ESDP during the French Presidency."
"Despite the presence in the seas off the Horn of Africa of the US-led Combined Task Force 151 and a NATO Maritime Group, it was decided to concoct yet another fleet and a further command chain."
"We are also deeply concerned by proposals for an ESDP training mission to Somalia at a time when the EUPOL mission in Afghanistan has been a failure and many European countries have been unwilling to provide troops and police for urgent training missions in Afghanistan."
"Incidentally, we do not recognise such terminology as 'EU fishing vessels.'"
"I welcome this resolution enabling Parliament to support the Commission's highly voluntary anti-smoking policy."
"Exposure to cigarette smoke is the main cause of death and illness in Europe, with smoking imposing a heavy burden on health care systems as well."
"I hope that the Commission's measures will go further and that in the years to come, we will have the right to a healthy environment in all closed spaces and in the workplace."
"I cannot fail to mention that we still have a hypocritical policy in Europe."
"We want to have fewer health problems caused by smoking, however we support the retention of subsidies for cigarette manufacturers, even though they are gradually being reduced."
"I think that the common agricultural policy should be defined to reward products which help maintain and improve people's state of health, not jeopardise it."
"I hope that the Council meeting in December will discuss protection for children, especially in cases where they are exposed to smoking by adults in private cars or in other closed spaces."
"I believe that adults have a responsibility in this respect, and where the legislator can intervene, it must do so."
"I believe that we must protect non-smokers from passive smoking, but also make smokers aware of the impact of their addiction on themselves and others."
"They must not be left in any doubt about this."
"In Belgium, we also have a head-start on this issue because our country has already advocated a total ban on smoking in the hospitality sector and at all places of work by 2012."
"Having said this, I would still like to express two concerns."
"Firstly, are we heading towards a society that imposes blanket bans?"
"What do we do about individual responsibility?"
"I feel a sense of unease about a society resembling the one described by George Orwell in his novel '1984'."
"Secondly, if smokers have to be made to break their harmful habit for themselves and others, this must be done with the utmost respect."
"Tobacco is a drug."
"Banning it completely would be tantamount to denying that most smokers are in a state of dependency."
"A total ban may be regarded as an act of exclusion, which may prove to be counterproductive."
"Why, therefore, have we not provided the option of reserving areas specifically for them?"
"Despite voting in line with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I must express some concerns I have about the present motion for a resolution."
"Firstly, I believe that smoke-free policies should be decided by the Member States and that the role of the European institutions, while respecting the subsidiarity principle, must remain at the level of non-binding recommendations."
"On the other hand, I also believe that Member States should promote smoke-free policies, but that they should not impose any restrictions on freedom of choice for operators, particularly in the hotel sector, where owners should have the option of being smoke-free or not."
"Against this backdrop, the act that was recently passed in Portugal was a well balanced one."
"My second concern is with the proposed end of direct subsidies linked to tobacco production."
"As Portugal is also a tobacco producer, I think that this type of policy needs to be extremely carefully analysed; otherwise it could be severely detrimental to farmers who find themselves unable to continue production without being given a viable alternative."
"This is my opinion on item 9 of this resolution."
"The protection of human health and the quality of life of employees at their places of work and that of the general public forms the basis of this resolution, and that is why we voted in favour of it."
"It is necessary to increase the protection of non-smokers by preventing passive smoking, but also to create the necessary conditions for monitoring and encouraging smokers to give up the habit."
"The policy of prohibition should be implemented in situations where it is shown to be necessary."
"As for direct production-linked subsidies, we advocate the incentives for reconverting tobacco production facilities."
"We believe, however, that we should not create a situation where we have to promote the importing of tobacco from outside the EU and thus benefit the big business of multinational tobacco companies."
"I voted in favour of deleting item 13 from the original text, which read: 'Calls on the Commission to submit a proposal to Parliament and the Council for legislation on a smoking ban by 2011 in all enclosed workplaces, including all enclosed public buildings and public transport in the EU, in the field of protection of workers' health.'"
"The deletion was approved, in keeping with the subsidiarity principle in this matter."
"I believe that there is still a long way to go for each Member State in creating smoke-free environments, carrying out effective awareness campaigns and applying best practices for the implementation of Article 14 (measures to reduce demand are dependent on levels of addiction and those giving up smoking)."
"I do think, however, that these actions should be implemented by each Member State, in the first instance."
"The original text of the resolution mixed up and confused the production of tobacco with its consumption."
"I therefore welcome the adoption of the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which removes part of item 9 from the original text, deleting the references to the production of tobacco."
"These two changes have improved the final resolution."
"I consider the remaining points positive, so I have voted in favour."
"I abstained in the vote on the resolution on smoking."
"I have never smoked in my life, but I find this constant harassment of smokers completely anti-freedom."
"The current bans are more than sufficient."
"I distance myself from this constant, counterproductive harassment."
"The desire to get rid of tobacco plantations in Europe will result in increased imports from third countries."
"Health policy and, therefore, the protection of non-smokers clearly come under the authority of the Member States and should not be the subject of central regulations."
"The Member States must have the freedom to determine the extent to which they want to protect non-smokers."
"It must be made clear that the EU has no authority in this area."
"For this reason, I have voted in favour of Parliament's resolution for next week's summit of EU health ministers."
"Mr President, I voted in favour, though I would have liked to see a tougher resolution."
"Smoking is the greatest single cause of premature deaths in Europe."
"Tobacco smoke is an environmental pollutant that contains over a hundred compounds that do harm to the health."
"Nevertheless, parts of Europe allow not just users of tobacco but those around them to be exposed to it."
"Passive smoking is a moral problem, because those who suffer have no choice."
"It is necessary, in particular, to protect children."
"Studies suggest that a child whose parent uses tobacco actually 'smokes' every fourth cigarette that his or her parent smokes."
"Every year, smoking leads to the premature death of almost 100 000 Europeans."
"Many Member States have already implemented some excellent measures."
"When Finland finally also banned smoking in restaurants and bars there was an outcry."
"Now, two years later, people are only grateful."
"That reflects the nature of public health policy: lasting results might be achieved through prevention and awareness-raising, but it takes the resolve of the legislators to deal with the resistance."
"I disagree with some of the other Members here that the Community does not need binding legislation on health and safety at work."
"It needs to be recognised that the recommendations have not been sufficient everywhere."
"I do support paragraph 13 of the resolution, in which the Commission is urged to put forward a legislative proposal for smoking to be banned in indoor workplaces and also on public transport."
"Smoking is expensive for society, and, furthermore, the 70% of Europeans who do not smoke end up paying the bill."
"I therefore agree with the view that Parliament expressed in 2007 that the content of the Tobacco Products Directive needs to be made more stringent and incorporate the liability of the manufacturers for the costs of health care due to the consumption of tobacco."
"The Union first needs to take the mote out of its own eye."
"It is high time we brought the gradual phasing out of subsidies for tobacco farming to a complete end."
"Mr President, I voted for the resolution supporting smoke-free environments because I believe that it is vitally important to monitor the progress being made towards the widespread introduction of smoke-free environments in the European Union and to facilitate the exchange of good practice between Member States and the coordination of the policy for protecting citizens against the risks of smoking."
"I also voted in favour of keeping paragraph 9, declaring the end by 2010 of the direct production-linked subsidies for tobacco growing because of its implication for health issues."
"I also support my fellow Members from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who have reminded us that smoking remains the number one identified cause of death and illness in the European Union. Thank you, Mr President."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I voted to remove the explicit reference to the year 2010 in paragraph 9 of the motion for a resolution."
"In my country, tobacco growing is a vitally important and critical industry for a large part of the population in regions where it is their only form of livelihood."
"One of those is also the region which I come from, Blagoevgrad."
"My country was one of the eight largest tobacco growers in Europe which, a year ago, wanted current subsidies to be extended until 2013, in spite of the agreement stipulating that the link between the amount of resources allocated and the production volume had to end by 2010."
"Every time we meet with tobacco growers, one of the questions they most frequently ask is: What will become of us?"
"I cannot promise them miracles, but we are working in collaboration with our government to devise measures which will not allow them to be left without any choice, having lost their principal means of livelihood."
"Fellow Members, I can understand the arguments of those who are campaigning against smoking."
"However, I urge you to ensure that we do not mix up the fight against smoking with the risk of us destroying tobacco growing in Europe."
"I call on you at a time of economic crisis to ensure that we remain prudent and wise."
"I agree with all reasonable measures aimed at combating smoking and protecting non-smokers, which is why I voted for this resolution."
"However, I must express some doubt about the effects which any kind of measures directed against tobacco growers would have."
"Romania currently has approximately 1 600 hectares of tobacco plantations providing a production of roughly 3 000 tonnes. However, a small volume of tobacco is grown in Romania, compared to the quantity required for Romanian processors, estimated at approximately 30 000 tonnes."
"The difference in quantity, of approximately 27 000 tonnes, is made up by imports, mostly from regions in Africa or Asia."
"If we discourage tobacco production in Member States, we will only encourage even more of these imports from third countries, to the detriment of European producers."
"This is a proactive and ambitious resolution we are dealing with."
"However, I am dismayed by the vote cast by a majority of my fellow Members, Christian-Democrats in particular, who, in the wake of intense lobbying by relevant pressure groups and stakeholders, have rejected Article 13."
"They believe therefore that Europe does not have its place in this debate and provides no added value in terms of guaranteeing European citizens healthy areas in all public places, at work and on public transport."
"In other words, they are not bothered about discrimination being created among workers in Europe."
"Just to give one example, people in Ireland will be very well protected by a national law, while we can only wonder if, one day, people in Greece or the Czech Republic will have this chance, or rather this right."
"As further proof of their 'brainwashing' by pressure groups, they have also rejected Article 9, which simply refers to one of the reforms to the common agricultural policy already decided on, namely the end by 2010 of direct production-linked subsidies for tobacco growing."
"The proposal in the resolution dealing with non-smoking areas envisaged a considerable change - the imposition of a smoking ban in pan-European public institutions and public spaces."
"The intention of the resolution was to task the Commission with preparing the necessary legislative act, which would come into effect in 2011."
"Although very many delegates, including myself, voted for a ban on smoking in public rooms (in particular, workplaces), the People's Party unfortunately took an opposing position."
"The majority of Parliament has not shown any consideration for protecting the health of every European citizen and, in particular, those people who do not smoke themselves, and yet are forced to breathe in smoke in public spaces and, as a result, suffer health problems themselves."
"I hope that this subject does not end up in oblivion, and also that it goes up the current agenda once more, since many Member States have not thus far imposed a ban on smoking in public places, although they have had the opportunity to do so."
"I share the concern, through this resolution, of making progress in the battle against passive smoking imposed on those who do not smoke."
"However, some people are taking advantage of the situation to insert a provision in this resolution opposing the subsidies paid to tobacco growers."
"I am personally in favour of providing this support to those practising what is a dying art."
"You should be aware that tobacco accounts for less than 10% of what goes into cigarettes; are so many questions asked about the additives that account for more than 90% of their content, and about their harmfulness?"
"in writing. - Given that over 40 million people die of hunger and poverty each year, including one child every six seconds, and that the global food crisis is one of the major threats to peace and security in the world, I have voted to support this timely Resolution."
"The Resolution calls for the Commission to conduct a full impact assessment of the EU's policies and programmes in the areas of agriculture, development and trade in order to guarantee a coherent, sustainable policy approach to global food security."
"As the Resolution stated everyone has the right to safe and nutritious food, the European Union must act to ensure these policies can deliver sustainable food security."
"We Danish Social Democrats believe in the phasing out of the EU's agricultural aid."
"Today, we gave our backing to the resolution on the 'FAO World Summit on Food Security' - a resolution that focuses on the major challenges we are facing in relation to eradicating hunger and ensuring better opportunities for developing countries in future - but we very much reject the glorifying statements that the resolution makes about agricultural policy and aid in paragraphs 3, 9 and 14, amongst others."
"The Swedish Conservatives have today voted against the resolution on the FAO World Summit on Food Security."
"We are concerned about hunger in the world and believe that a focus on food security is important."
"However, in contrast to the resolution, we Swedish Conservatives believe that the common agricultural policy (CAP) is part of the problem rather than the solution and that it needs to be reformed."
"There is a strange situation in the world today: a billion people are suffering from obesity, yet at the same time, a billion people are starving."
"This situation is disastrous and requires effective measures, particularly on the part of the wealthy European Union."
"However, we do not believe that the EU's common agricultural policy, as it currently stands, is the solution."
"Our agricultural policy has been successful in the past, but it has no place in the future."
"Since this resolution opposes the revision of the current European system for agricultural aid (something that could benefit the climate, the world's poor and Europe's farmers), we could see no other alternative than to abstain from the vote."
"I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the FAO World Summit on Food Security - Eradicating hunger from the face of the earth, because I believe that urgent measures are necessary to put a stop to this scourge, which affects a sixth of the world's population."
"In light of the impact of climate change on agriculture, particularly reduced productivity due to water scarcity, especially in countries which are already struggling with these problems, we must ensure that we develop coherent agricultural policies that are consistent with protecting the climate and fighting hunger."
"We Swedish Social Democrats have today chosen to vote in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on the FAO World Summit on Food Security."
"More than a billion people are currently suffering from starvation."
"Extreme oscillations in prices and a dramatic increase in the price of food on the world market have also caused a global food crisis, which has made it even harder for the poor people of the world to obtain access to food."
"However, we would like to point out that we do not share Parliament's view that we should not reduce market support measures and aid payments to farmers within the framework of the EU's common agricultural policy."
"We do not believe that these support measures and payments will help to bring increased security of food supply to developing countries in the long term."
"On the contrary, these measures will have the opposite effect."
"Subsidised, cheap European food is being exported to developing countries and, on account of its competitive prices, it often knocks these countries' own food production out of the market, so denying these countries the chance of more long-term self-sufficiency."
"No one can remain indifferent to this global problem when they know that 40 million people die every year of starvation and that a child dies of malnutrition every six seconds."
"The European Union is the foremost donor of development and humanitarian aid, but only a small part of this is channelled towards the agricultural sector, which could meet the food needs of thousands of people who continue to suffer from malnutrition."
"The European Union should therefore review its aid and development policies as a matter of urgency, and give greater precedence to supporting agriculture in developing countries, a sector which is the source of income for more than 70% of the workforce."
"The common agricultural policy must also adapt internally to the crisis that we are undergoing, which includes higher production costs for European farmers, by refraining from dismantling its market support measures and/or reducing agricultural subsidies, giving special attention to the support of small and medium-sized farmers and their access to credit, so that they can keep up their levels of production in spite of the escalating costs of materials needed for production."
"Although we do not agree with all the points made, we chose to give our approval to this resolution, as it underlines the importance of principles that we consider fundamental to a real fight against world hunger, particularly:"
"Emphasising that 'the fight against hunger must be based on recognition of the right to food sovereignty',"
"Recognising 'the right of local people in every country to control farmland and other natural resources vital to their food security'."
"The resolution also draws attention to the importance of agriculture in combating hunger and stresses the importance of farmers' incomes."
"It remains to be seen whether, in the future, this Parliament will live up to what it has approved here today, or whether, as is often the case, it makes these good points, but later, when it needs to actually put them into practice, goes back on its word and approves legislation that violates these principles."
"We should not forget that the successive reforms of the common agricultural policy, following the liberalisation of agricultural markets undertaken by the World Trade Organisation and coinciding only with the interests of the big agri-food companies, have contributed to the impoverishment of the global agricultural sector."
"Agricultural production should be used primarily to feed people, not to benefit export monopolies."
"We, the Danish Liberal Party's MEPs, voted in favour of the resolution on food security as we want to emphasise the importance of the EU taking global responsibility in the fight against hunger and poverty."
"We are opposed to paragraph 9 of the resolution, however, which puts question marks against the continued liberalisation of EU agricultural policy."
"The Danish Liberal Party wants to see a gradual abolition of agricultural aid plus the establishment of common rules that ensure a level playing field for Europe's farmers in terms of competition."
"Long-term food security is one of the central challenges of the common agricultural policy."
"Especially in the light of food shortages, we must emphasise the importance of a strong CAP which will take on a key role in future in overcoming global challenges."
"This means that adequate long-term funding for the CAP is required."
"The CAP is an important element of the EU food and security policy and after 2013, it will play a significant role in development policy and in external food security policy."
"Therefore, perfectly functioning ecosystems, fertile soil, stable water resources and further diversification of the rural economy are the highest priorities."
"International cooperation and solidarity, together with balanced trade agreements which promote, rather than jeopardise, food security are an essential element of global food security and this is where a strong CAP can make an important contribution."
"Net food importing countries are hardest hit by rising food prices, yet many of these countries throughout the world are the least developed."
"The EU must take measures to counteract this."
"Hunger is a scourge that is affecting increasing numbers of people."
"As the EU is a place of solidarity, it has to be at the frontline of combating this growing problem."
"The world food crisis is one of the major threats to global peace and security, so all global and European food security policies need to be stepped up."
"The authors of this resolution, although forced to highlight the problem of hunger and the problems raised at the Food and Agricultural Summit in general, have nonetheless concealed the basic cause of the problem, namely the capitalist system of exploitation and the strategy which the EU also loyally serves so that capital can profit."
"The food production and distribution multinationals are uprooting farmers and concentrating the land, thereby striking a heavy blow at poor and average farmers."
"The working and grassroots classes, even in developed capitalist countries, are finding it harder and harder to safeguard healthy, safe food, while the food multinationals are raking in massive profits and buying up huge swathes of land, especially in Africa, calculating that food production needs to double by 2050."
"The EU leads the way in the liberalisation and privatisation of all food production factors - water, energy, transport and technology - and is imposing the same on third countries through the WTO and bilateral agreements."
"The CAP underpins the policy of uprooting small and medium-sized farms and supporting the monopolies and their profits."
"Farmers and workers are fighting against this policy, fighting to overturn this system of exploitation and secure sufficient, healthy, safe food for everyone."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"1."
"Nicaragua"
"The next point is the three draft resolutions on Nicaragua."
"Mr President, the policy of the current President of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, proves the continued relevance of the old communist maxim: 'once we have gained power we will never give it up'."
"In the 1980s, the Sandinistas were unable to maintain an armed dictatorship and, forced by international opinion, had to accept democratic rules of play."
"Ortega was elected President in elections in 2006."
"The Sandinistas returned to power."
"From the very outset, he began to use the tried and tested methods of intimidation and elimination, under a variety of pseudo-legal pretexts, of any kind of political competition."
"The Sandinista apparatus began to duplicate state apparatus, following the example of the Cuban Committees for the Defence of the Revolution."
"In December 2008, the European Parliament drew attention to the campaign of harassment being perpetrated by state authorities, parties and people associated with the Sandinistas against human rights organisations and their members, journalists and representatives of the media."
"Amnesty International wrote of the violence which followed local authority elections."
"Attacks and beatings of journalists multiplied."
"Now, by manipulating the Supreme Court, Ortega is trying to bring about changes to the Constitution which would allow him to stand for re-election."
"We can foresee, with a high degree of certainty, that the next step will be proclaiming himself President for life, for Fidel Castro is the model for the populists of Managua and Caracas, and there have never been free elections under Castro."
"I call on the European Commission to draw conclusions from this situation and to check, in a situation of the violation of international human rights standards, if there is not a need to reconsider existing cooperation agreements with this country, so that the human rights clauses do not turn out to be merely empty words."
"Mr President, last Saturday, in response to an appeal from opposition politicians, tens of thousands of Nicaraguan citizens demonstrated against the policy of President Daniel Ortega, a policy which is leading directly to the introduction of a dictatorship in Nicaragua."
"I will remind you that on 19 October, the Supreme Court decided to remove constitutional obstacles which prevented President Ortega from standing for a further term of office."
"The fact of this change itself is not outrageous, because, of course, there is no such law in many European countries, but what is outrageous is the way in which this decision was made."
"As we all know, President Ortega does not have a two-thirds majority in Parliament, and so he had to turn to violating the constitution in order to remove the ban on his re-election."
"If we allow Daniel Ortega to run for President again in 2011, we may wake up in a situation in which Nicaragua is controlled by a real dictatorship."
"Therefore, I would ask the European Commission to draw attention to this problem during further negotiations on the EU-Central America Association Agreement and to use every possible means to turn President Ortega back from this road."
"author. - Mr President, I am very thankful for the support in this House for the delegation of Liberal International which I led to Managua."
"We came in peace on the invitation of a parliamentary majority to speak about the Constitution, the election, the election campaign and human rights and civil liberties."
"We were cursed, we were called pirates and that kind of thing."
"We were threatened with expulsion from the country, threatened with being persona non grata, and it was said that we were staging a golpe - a coup d'état."
"But, more importantly than that, they cursed my country and they oppress their own people."
"I think that the European Union should monitor what happens in Nicaragua and should send observers to the elections in 2011 and support the democratic opposition."
"I also hope that we will do the same and will be objective regarding the result of the election in Honduras."
"Let us see whether the elections on Sunday are free and fair, and let us make a decision then."
"It could be that, if we recognise the result of the elections, it will put an end to the constitutional crisis in that country."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, there is an alarming trend in today's Latin America to consolidate populist regimes by extending the mandate of current presidents - preferably for eternity."
"This was Hitler's way to power."
"Lenin's was that of indifference, but the results were just the same."
"These presidents with extended powers have not been able or willing to improve the quality of life of their subjects."
"Cuba is a murky and painful example of how lives of normal people have been mutilated and spoiled for decades."
"In Nicaragua, we can see a warning example that such kinds of rulers do not change."
"They return to power only to misuse it once again."
"It is, therefore, our task now to condemn strongly these violations of the Nicaraguan Constitution and to link this issue with much more efficient control over the use of funds given to Nicaragua for development."
"It is very disappointing that the Organisation of American States has not reacted to these flagrant violations of the constitution by one of its member states."
"Mr President, I am pleased to see that Mr van Baalen has returned to Europe safely and that he was only expelled when he was already on the plane."
"Having said this and on a more serious note, I would like to say on behalf of my group that we are not getting involved in this game."
"What I mean is that, while the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) refused us an urgent debate on Uganda about the laws against homosexuals and another urgent debate on Iran about the executions being carried out there, they would now like us to get involved in the game of being for or against Ortega, with the demonstrations going on over there."
"That is just not on!"
"I think that the urgent debates held in this House, with the aim of actually providing assistance to people or causes experiencing difficulties, must not be used to serve our MEPs' personal political interests."
"Therefore, my group has decided not only not to sign this resolution, but not to vote and to oppose what is going on here."
"This brings discredit upon the European Parliament."
"Mr President, along the same lines, I think that it is not only sad but clearly shameful that a sitting as important as this, on urgent matters, is being manipulated in this way, and I am therefore surprised not only that the subject today is Nicaragua, but also that on other occasions when we were supposed to have discussed much more serious matters, that did not happen."
"Today, moreover, we have the added factor that other subjects that were on the agenda have been dropped precisely because this one has been included."
"This is entirely inappropriate from the point of view of the content of debates on urgent matters."
"For example, we could and should have discussed the Western Sahara."
"We should have discussed the current situation of people such as Aminatou Haidar, who is at present suffering as a result of a clear violation and deprival of her most fundamental rights."
"We should also be discussing the situation of the very many people who are in refugee camps, or in the occupied areas of Morocco, a context on which a clear position is really needed."
"All of this could have been debated today, and this is not the case because the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is making us talk about a subject that I do not think deserves the consideration or has the significance appropriate to this type of sitting."
"Mr President, this is a regrettable debate about a false state of urgency that does nothing but discredit the European Parliament."
"The urgent thing would have been to debate the recent tragedy caused by Hurricane Ida when it hit El Salvador at the beginning of November."
"This hurricane caused more than 200 deaths and missing persons, destroyed infrastructures and essential equipment, particularly in the areas of health, education, water and sanitation, exacerbating poverty in the country."
"The urgent thing would have been to discuss the availability of extraordinary funds and the redirection of available EU funds to the emergency situation, launch a plan for reconstruction and risk reduction, and support the people of El Salvador."
"The urgent thing would have been for this Parliament to condemn the military coup in Honduras and demand the return to power of President Zelaya, who was legally elected by the Honduran people."
"The urgent thing would have been to demand respect for the fundamental rights of the people of the Western Sahara."
"Unfortunately, none of this was possible due to opposition by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Therefore, as my colleagues have already stated, we refuse to collaborate with this false state of urgency, which is a disgrace to the European Parliament."
"(DE) Mr President, I agree wholeheartedly with the previous speakers."
"I would like to remind everyone that the Colombian President also attempted to extend his term of office in breach of current Colombian law and, therefore, this matter should also be taken up."
"Most importantly, however, I would like to highlight the fact that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation in Germany, a foundation which has close links with the German Free Democratic Party, was involved in the coup in Honduras."
"There was a debate about this at least in Germany."
"The foundation's scholarship holders distanced themselves from this policy in an open letter."
"We must not forget that Mr van Baalen is the president of Liberal International and on the website of the Friedrich-Naumann foundation, it states that he discussed the possibility of a coup with the armed forces in Nicaragua."
"I think it is appropriate that in these circumstances - and this has not been contradicted - a country such as Nicaragua is bold enough to expel a politician of this kind."
"In all honesty, we must admit that the situation would be just the same in Europe."
"What is happening here is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discredit and publicly shame those countries, states and governments in Latin America which are trying to introduce more social policies."
"On behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, I would like to say clearly once again that we will not support this."
"Mr President, I do not understand the reaction from our esteemed colleagues on my right-hand side in this hemicycle on the choice of subjects that we are debating today."
"I do not understand why it is not urgent to take the floor, discussing the issue of the treatment of one of the Members of this Parliament who has visited a country exercising his right as President of Liberal International."
"I do not understand why we cannot take the floor and speak about this issue and also speak about this new tendency in Latin America to try to change arbitrarily the constitution of the country and stop a tradition that has always existed concerning one or two terms of office of the Head of State in that country."
"Already, our esteemed friends here have talked about four other subjects, and I would like to know when we are going to discuss the matter at hand, given that there are only three subjects on the agenda."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(LT) I wholeheartedly support the opinion of my group that this matter should not be included on the agenda, as there are much more relevant and much more pressing problems throughout the world."
"If we are to discuss Nicaragua, we should firstly talk about the fact that this is a country with the highest debt in the world and that it is one of the poorest countries in Latin America."
"The communist experiment was not the answer there, but neither was the neo-liberal experiment."
"It is a country where there was too much interference by the superpowers, America and the Soviet Union, and that is why that country is constantly on the verge of civil war."
"It is understandable that there are strong-arm tendencies there and those must be condemned."
"However, let us not forget that we also have strong-arm tendencies in Europe."
"Therefore, let us concentrate on far more important matters."
"(DE) Mr President, various things have already been said on this matter."
"One speaker explained that this is the wrong subject for debate, because there are more urgent issues that involve more significant violations of human rights."
"That may be the case, but I believe that we Europeans, who work to ensure that values such as human rights and freedoms - for example, the freedom of the press - are respected everywhere, must defend this freedom whenever we become aware that it is under threat."
"It was also said, for example, that the Friedrich-Naumann foundation was involved in the coup."
"As a member of the FDP, I explicitly reject this claim."
"These are rumours which have been spread around and which are completely without foundation."
"My third point is that it was said that Mr van Baalen was accused of discussing a coup and this is why he was expelled from the country."
"If you cannot openly discuss all kinds of subjects - for us this is part of the freedom of the press and of speech, two freedoms which we have here and which we value highly - is this really a reason for expelling someone from the country, simply because a subject of whatever kind was discussed?"
"The fact that this happens in public is no justification for expelling someone from the country, simply because a discussion took place."
"This is totally the wrong approach."
"Mr President, Nicaragua remains one of the poorest countries in the Americas."
"The fact that President Daniel Ortega has failed to improve his country's situation, despite myriad Socialist utopian promises upon taking office, would suggest that Nicaragua needs a change of leadership now."
"The country's constitution permits Heads of State to serve only one term, sometimes a wise policy in a region prone to instability, but Ortega is once again showing his contempt for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law by abusing the Constitutional Court's powers."
"In this respect, he is no different from his fellow leftist Hugo Chávez of Venezuela."
"Both men have made their names denouncing caudillos, but they themselves are turning into caudillos of the Left and, as such, represent a genuine threat to regional democratic stability, especially given the chaos in nearby Honduras."
"Daniel Ortega has failed his people and his country many times over."
"If we truly believe in democracy and freedom, we cannot ignore the plight of the citizens of Nicaragua."
"(DE) Mr President, one thing has come out of this rather difficult debate."
"The Member from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has indirectly confirmed that the question of a coup really was the subject of these discussions."
"She has defended what took place by using the argument that it must be possible to talk about anything, even a coup."
"That is one remarkable result of this debate which helps to clarify the situation and I am grateful for this."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable colleagues, as you know, the European Union is engaged in a difficult dialogue with this country aimed at preserving democracy and restoring its citizens' trust in the country's democratic institutions."
"At the same time, the EU is trying to maintain a balance with our long-standing commitment to support the development and stability of this developing country and the Central American region more generally."
"Since the municipal elections held in November 2008, which were tainted with allegations of widespread fraud, international donors' confidence in the current government has fallen to an all-time low."
"Failure to respect fundamental democratic principles, including free and fair elections, led the donor community to systematically review their cooperation portfolios and, in certain instances, reorient or suspend cooperation activities until conditions improved."
"Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner took the decision to suspend all budgetary support payments to Nicaragua as of 1 January 2009."
"This decision had been preceded by a discussion with Member States in the Council."
"Following numerous contacts with the Nicaraguan authorities which gave credible commitments that corrective steps would be taken, the Commission proceeded at the beginning of October with a single payment of EUR 10 million of our budget support programme to the education sector."
"This represents a small part of the funds that have been suspended, which amount to an additional EUR 46 million."
"There was criticism last week in the Development Council that there were no previous discussions on this with the Member States."
"Without going into the details of this, I think it is very important that, when we take that kind of decision, we have a kind of a procedure whereby we at least try to make sure that the European Commission and the Member States are taking the same line with respect to individual states."
"If, in the end, it is not possible, then of course everybody is allowed to do what he or she thinks to be necessary."
"The government of Nicaragua has announced that the next regional elections in 2010 and the general election in 2011 will have national and international observation teams."
"The government has already officially invited the EU to carry out an observation mission."
"The government has also committed, inter alia, to improving its civil registry and electoral role with the support of an EC project and to appoint credible and professional electoral authorities next year."
"On the other hand, recent developments, such as the ruling by the Constitutional Chamber, certainly cast a shadow on the seriousness of the Nicaraguan Government to live up to its commitments."
"The EU has, on a number of occasions, most recently by means of a local troika démarche on Monday 21 November, expressed concern on this development."
"At the end of the day, implementation of these commitments will be crucial for the progressive resumption of our budgetary support programmes."
"We continue to work in close cooperation with the Member Sates as well as with the European Parliament, as this debate shows."
"Whether it is timely or not is, of course, a matter that should be looked at by Parliament itself."
"The item is hereby closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"2."
"Laos and Vietnam"
"The next item is the four draft resolutions on Laos and Vietnam."
"Mr President, we once again have an urgent debate on Vietnam and Laos."
"It is true that we have had other similar debates in the European Parliament, but we cannot really allow the current urgent debate to go unheeded."
"We are, in fact, fairly concerned."
"Since 2006, when Vietnam was removed from the United States' blacklist for repression and human rights violations, the level of repression against human rights activists has been on the rise."
"I would like to mention just one case which I think is typical, that of Mrs Tran Khai Thanh Thuy."
"She is a writer, blogger, journalist and activist who is currently in prison for vague reasons, the most plausible of which is that she was defending freedom of expression and human rights in her country."
"She is diabetic and in a poor state of health."
"We fear for her life and are demanding not only adequate health care for her in prison, but also her immediate release."
"I love Vietnam."
"Vietnam is a great country and will take over the presidency of ASEAN in 2010."
"I believe that adopting measures which are more in line with international democratic standards could only help strengthen its moral authority further."
"Mr President, the human rights situation in Vietnam is disturbing."
"Religious persecution, in particular of Christians and Buddhists, is the order of the day."
"Anyone who speaks out in favour of freedom and human rights is intimidated and kept under systematic surveillance."
"At the end of September, hundreds of monks from the Bat Nha monastery were attacked."
"Major damage was caused to the entire monastery complex while the police simply sat by and watched."
"The monks who sought refuge in the nearby Phuoc Hue temple were beaten up."
"This sort of abuse must not be tolerated."
"It is outrageous that the numerous calls from the European Union and other parts of the world for improvements in the human rights situation have simply been ignored."
"There are hundreds of reasons for at last introducing changes, particularly as next year, Vietnam will hold the presidency of the ASEAN group of countries."
"The situation in Laos is not much better."
"At the beginning of November, more than 300 peaceful demonstrators calling for more pluralism and democracy were brutally beaten up by the secret police."
"All efforts to bring about a political dialogue in this country are crushed immediately by the single ruling party."
"The 5 000 Hmong refugees who are currently living in camps in northern Thailand and who are a persecuted minority are also in an appalling situation."
"They have not been granted the status of refugees."
"The organisation 'Doctors without Borders', which was represented here in Parliament this week, has said that it is almost impossible for it to provide humanitarian aid in the camps because people are constantly and generally completely arbitrarily being arrested and forced to return to Laos."
"Any claims that these people are returning voluntarily are simply not true."
"We Members of Parliament call on the Commission and the Council to give us accurate information about which of the agreements reached with these two countries on human rights and democracy are being observed. Which of the agreements have been consistently blocked?"
"For the sake of the citizens of Vietnam and Laos, it must be possible to exert pressure on the governments of these two countries."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, it is welcome news that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has established a regional Human Rights Commission."
"Against this background, it is shocking to meet Vietnamese monks who have been the victims of a violent attack."
"We on the Subcommittee on Human Rights had the honour to meet them recently."
"The position of religious communities seems to be becoming more and more difficult in Vietnam."
"We really have to condemn the fact that more than 300 monks and nuns from two monasteries had to leave as a result of violence and that religious communities are continually being harassed."
"It is important that Vietnam takes notice of the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which propose, for example, that United Nations Special Rapporteurs be invited to the country to monitor the implementation of freedom of opinion and religion, as well as other basic human rights."
"In Vietnam, hundreds of people are being held in detention for their political and religious beliefs."
"Indeed, I believe that the violent attack against Buddhist monks at the end of September clearly shows that Vietnam is refusing to improve its human rights situation."
"In Laos, a country under military dictatorship, the leaders of the students and teachers movement set up a decade ago are still being held in secret detention."
"The recent peaceful demonstrations held in support of respect for human rights were suppressed by the secret police, while the Hmong community continues to be subject to persecution."
"Both Laos and Vietnam must fully comply with international standards in terms of protecting human rights."
"The persecution must stop against members of religious communities, minorities and, in general, against citizens doing no more than defending their political rights"
"It is the European Union's duty to monitor closely the development of human rights and to use all its influence to reverse this negative trend."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, negotiations which are in progress on a new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the EU and Vietnam must also include respect for human rights and civil liberties."
"The information reaching us shows that the situation in this regard in Vietnam is extremely disturbing, especially in relation to the repression being used against internet users."
"The internet is a medium which is founded on free exchange of information and views on every subject, and that on a world scale."
"Meanwhile, Vietnamese legal regulations on use of the internet penalise free speech in areas considered as sensitive, such as human rights and the propagation of democracy."
"Rules introduced in 2008 concerning blogs require that their content be limited to personal matters, and ban the dissemination of antigovernment materials and material which undermines national security."
"(The President asked the Member to speak more slowly)"
"Foreign non-governmental organisations report that bloggers who raise political subjects are held in prison."
"The institutions of the European Union must not be indifferent to these disturbing facts coming from Vietnam and, in addition to political action, legal action is also necessary."
"Therefore, I appeal for inclusion in the new Agreement between the EU and Vietnam of a binding clause on the matter of human rights."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the ALDE Group is of the opinion that Laos and Vietnam are no democracies."
"Human rights are not guaranteed in either country, nor are religious or other rights."
"It means that we wholeheartedly support this resolution and ask the Council and the Commission to act likewise."
"Mr President, once again, I would like to stress the dramatic situation of Christians in Laos and Vietnam."
"In both countries, the entire structure of the state and the apparatus of repression has been directed at the destruction of Christianity - of both the Catholic Church and Protestant groups."
"In Laos, this is the result of a programme of the ruling communist party, which treats Christianity as a religion representing Western imperialism."
"In Vietnam, what is taking place is being done in contravention of formally existing law."
"The repression takes a variety of forms: arrests, torture, deprivation of freedom, intimidation and confinement in psychiatric institutions."
"Such practices must not be allowed to pass without a strong reaction from European institutions."
"Although quite a number of people in Europe are fighting Christianity by legal means, it is our obligation, the obligation of all of us, to take action against the barbarity we are witnessing in some of the countries of Asia."
"(FI) Mr President, in September, Laos took one important step forward in the improvement of human rights by ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"The Covenant covers such areas as freedom of religion, association and speech and gives individuals the right to express their political opinions."
"Theory and practice, however, are sometimes a very long way from one another and the journey from the former to the latter can be a long one."
"Once again, a huge amount of political will is required."
"The leaders of the student movement arrested in the demonstrations in October 1999 and other prisoners of conscience must be freed immediately, as also must those arrested in the peaceful demonstration held on November 2 this year."
"It is especially important that the Laotian authorities show their democratic mindset by drafting and implementing legislative reforms as soon as possible."
"National legislation must be made consistent with the international agreements that Laos has committed itself to."
"Only legislative reform and multi-party elections can bring democracy and, at the same time, a respect for human rights in the Lao People's Democratic Republic."
"(FR) Mr President, in July 2007, I celebrated in this very Chamber the fact that 2006 had been a year of political openness for Vietnam."
"I called on Vietnam to accommodate all the religions represented on its territory and to allow its population to choose their form of worship freely."
"More than two years on, I note that the situation has not progressed in the right direction."
"Freedom of worship is still not a reality in Vietnam, while the number of arrests of Buddhist monks, for instance, just to give one example, is rising."
"Just as Vietnam is about to assume the presidency of ASEAN - and I must welcome in this House its efforts in the areas of health, education and the reduction of inequality - we want to use this resolution to remind this country of the importance of human rights and ask it to set an example as a future president of ASEAN."
"Furthermore, I welcome that the Laotian Government has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights."
"I therefore hope that this pact can be fully complied with, particularly with regard to freedom of expression and assembly."
"Finally, we request the Laotian Government to do its utmost to release everyone arrested on 2 November 2009 during the attempted peaceful demonstration, as well as the leaders of the 'Student Movement of 26 October 1999'."
"(PL) Mr President, in this Parliament, we spoke of Vietnam, particularly in the context of the religious persecution of Buddhists, in the previous Parliamentary term."
"Today, the time has come to talk once again about the violation of religious rights in both of those countries, this time against Christians."
"This is, unfortunately, a permanent feature of political reality in these two countries."
"The European Parliament, which is so sensitive to violations of human rights and the rights of minorities, must make a statement on this matter."
"There is one more thing - I have come here today not only as a politician, but also as a blogger, and a fairly well-known one in Poland."
"As a blogger, I would like to protest at the persecution of our fellow internet users and bloggers in Vietnam."
"We must vigorously defend them."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, persecution and discrimination on religious grounds are nothing new in Vietnam."
"They have been going on not for just one day or one month, but for 50 years."
"I shall limit myself to mentioning the most recent episodes, such as the demolition of the cathedral in Vinh Long City, replaced by a public park, or the deployment of riot police and bulldozers to remove the statue of the Virgin Mary from the Catholic cemetery in Hanoi."
"What is more, a priest and his parishioners were denounced for bringing someone who had threatened a priest to the police headquarters."
"Thus, Christians are going from being victims to being criminals."
"The increase in authoritarianism is reaching worrying proportions."
"In fact, the Hanoi Government has demanded that 10 internet sites, which regularly disseminate dangerous political material, be blocked for security reasons and to combat those movements that oppose the party."
"The situation is also extremely worrying in Laos, where Christians are being persecuted relentlessly by means of arrests and threats, to the point where they are even being expelled from their villages at times."
"Mr President, religious freedom is a natural human right for each and every person."
"It is not a favour granted by whoever holds power."
"Therefore, our intervention and commitment is vital."
"(PL) Mr President, we should note with satisfaction every measure which is intended to stress the importance of human rights and to highlight instances in which they are not observed in some parts of the world, in countries where people's fundamental rights are violated."
"When, however, we turn our attention to the violation of these rights, we must pay particular attention to those situations in particular countries in which there are violations of the rights of people of different religions and of their right to free expression of their faith and attachment in the area of religious liberty, and to demonstrate their convictions in this realm."
"Therefore, we should raise the alarm in every instance of drastic violations in this area."
"We should also remember that, here in Europe, we should always be an example of a place on the world map which remains a model of great tradition, liberty, freedom and respect for other religions."
"This is why it is with a certain unease that I notice something."
"It is something which cannot, of course, be compared to the facts referred to here in this Chamber."
"I am thinking of a trend which is appearing in the judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, which seems to encroach on the area of freedom of religion and the traditions of particular countries, in this case, the ruling on Italy and crosses."
"I think that rulings of this kind may also create a certain bad atmosphere, where some symbols and emphases are open to misinterpretation."
"In summary, every gesture and every action which increases the importance of human rights is significant, and we should talk openly about this, especially in the case of countries where basic human rights are violated."
"Mr President, Vietnam and Laos sadly remain the only vestiges, along with Cuba and the People's Republic of China, of one-party Communist dictatorships, where parliamentary democracy, pluralism of debate - including freedom of the media and internet blogging - and peaceful practice of religion are alien concepts."
"In Vietnam, outspoken Buddhist monks and Catholics are not tolerated by the Hanoi Government, and in Laos the Hmong people are persecuted, and many have fled to Thailand."
"I agree that - with all the good will in the world, and in spite of endless international and UN commitments, including those made recently to the EU in trade agreements - Communist dictatorships can never be liberal democracies."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission maintains that in recent years, there has been a substantial improvement in the general political situation in Laos, and agrees with Parliament that the ratification by Laos of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is a welcome step towards respect for the freedoms of faith, association, speech and the press."
"The Commission also welcomes the ratification of the Convention on Disability Rights and the UN Convention against Corruption."
"In April, the Laos Government approved a decree allowing the formation and registration of national civil society organisations."
"This marks a significant step towards achieving freedom of association and allowing civil society a role in the development of the country."
"However, we share the concerns of Parliament regarding political prisoners."
"As to the three individuals mentioned by Parliament, the authorities repeated in October 2009 their earlier statement to our delegation in Vientiane, namely that Mr Keochay had already been released in 2002."
"Two of the other three, Mr Seng-Aloun Phengphanh and Mr Tongpaseuth Keuakaoun, were reported to be in good health."
"The authorities claim to have no knowledge of Mr Bouvanh Chanmanivong."
"The Commission has consulted resident diplomats and others about the alleged arrests of several hundreds of demonstrators in early December 2009."
"However, we have not been able to confirm the information referred to."
"The Commission shares the opinion of Parliament that the detention of 158 people held in Nongkhai requires urgent solution."
"The Commission calls upon the Laos and Thai Governments to allow the prisoners to resettle in third countries which have offered asylum."
"Regarding other Lao Hmong in camps in Thailand, a proper screening should be undertaken in order to determine the status of the offences."
"Let me now turn to Vietnam."
"The Commission shares the concerns of Parliament about recent signs of a more hard-line attitude of the Government of Vietnam on human rights."
"The recent arrests and trials of peaceful bloggers and human rights defenders, as well as tensions with religious groups such as the peaceful Buddhist community and the Batna monastery, have caused legitimate concern in Europe."
"We urge Vietnam, as party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to honour its international human rights commitments and to release all those prisoners, in particular, human rights lawyer, Le Cong Dinh, democracy advocate and writer, Tran Khai Thanh Thuy, and Catholic priest, Father Nguyen Van Ly, who are currently in detention for having peacefully expressed their views."
"We also agree that a more independent media would have a useful role to play to channel social discontent peacefully in times of economic stress."
"That is why we encourage Vietnam to adopt a press law that will be in line with Article 19 of the ICCPR on freedom of expression."
"Nevertheless, we are confident about our mature human rights dialogue and cooperation with Vietnam."
"We believe in constructive engagement."
"However, in order for such engagement to remain a sustainable option, dialogue and cooperation need to show tangible results."
"There will be no better demonstration that dialogue is the best option than Vietnam's own performance."
"The item is hereby closed."
"The vote will take place at the end of the debate."
"3."
"China: Minority rights and application of the death penalty"
"The next item is the five draft resolutions on China: minority rights and use of the death penalty."
"Mr President, my group has withdrawn its signature from the 'China' resolution."
"Why? Not because we regard human rights as secondary and subordinate to commercial interests - after all, we submitted a resolution from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament without any concession, highlighting our commitment - but because, in order to achieve a change in China's behaviour, we need to have dialogue, and this erratic resolution devoid of any structure ruins any chance of dialogue."
"It certainly has everything in it: Tibet, the Dalai Lama and his succession, the religious crusade and even, in case anything had been missed out, criticism of any present, past and future Communist regime."
"Is this the way to open doors?"
"No."
"The tragedy is that they will close on the very people whom we want to save at this precise moment, in other words, the Uighurs and Tibetans threatened with execution."
"I urge China to stop being afraid of freedom of expression so that it can open up to the world, not only through business and culture, but also through sharing essential values."
"I call for the issue of abolishing the death penalty to be put on the agenda of the next EU-China Summit on 30 November."
"I also ask the Commission and Council to continue to want to include in the new partnership under negotiation the clause about respect for human rights in China."
"author. - Mr President, I support calls for the end of the death penalty in China, more especially when the death penalty is used to terrorise minority ethnic groups and nations within the Chinese state."
"The European Union, the United States and other world powers, however, in their criticism of human rights violations in China, are very soft."
"In the case of violation of workers' rights, those criticisms are virtually non-existent."
"This is because they wish to build business links with Chinese business and the bureaucracy that controls the state so that they may profit from the appalling exploitation of workers in China."
"China is a gigantic sweatshop of exploitation of workers."
"For example, tens of millions of migrant workers lead lives of shameful misery, with their children suffering the consequences of the horrific conditions under which they live."
"The EU-based and the US-based multinationals participate in this exploitation to facilitate their super profits."
"The Chinese regime is increasing its repression, and that repression has increased since the Chinese Stalinists decided to go for the capitalist market as a means of developing the economy."
"There is massive repression of journalists and campaigners for justice, for communities and for workers."
"Recently a Socialist colleague of my own was banned from China."
"Laurence Coates, a Socialist who writes under the name of Vincent Kolo, who is the editor of 'chinaworker.info', was detained at the border and banned from China."
"'Chinaworker.info' campaigns for workers' rights and free trade unions."
"We should stand with workers in China."
"Independent and democratically-run trade unions and the right to strike should be campaigned for, as well as the release of all political prisoners and detained labour activists."
"We should call for freedom of expression and assembly and international solidarity with workers in China to fight this horrific bureaucratic regime, many of whose members aspire to be oligarchs, obviously, as they did previously with the same system in Russia."
"author. - Mr President, while we are getting closer to China in terms of trade and environmental cooperation and China was host to the wonderful Olympic Games last year, it is clearly backsliding in terms of ensuring human rights to its citizens."
"The response of the Chinese authorities to peaceful protests in Tibet last year and Xinjiang this year was completely out of proportion, to say the least."
"People everywhere in the world should have the right to protest against government policies they do not like."
"Instead of this, we had a violent and brutal reaction from the Chinese authorities against the protesters and hundreds of people killed."
"Now we have a further nine people, mostly Uighurs, executed without mercy as a demonstration that any dissenting voices will be met by brutal and lethal force by the Chinese state apparatus."
"While we admire the Chinese culture and make progress in exchanging goods and investments, it is our duty to speak loudly and clearly and condemn the killings and executions."
"Therefore, we once again reiterate our call to the Chinese officials to impose a moratorium on the death penalty and grant more freedom to its provinces striving for greater autonomy, while respecting the 'one China' policy."
"Mr President, in recent years, China has seen huge economic growth."
"Many Chinese people's quality of life has improved."
"Unfortunately, there has been no progress of this kind in safeguarding and respecting human rights in China and this applies to all its citizens, regardless of their religion or ethnic group."
"On the contrary, the oppressive measures taken against the Uighurs and the Tibetans have increased."
"As far as the death penalty is concerned, it is a positive sign that the highest Chinese court has once again reviewed all the sentences since 2007 and we assume that some death sentences will be revoked."
"However, sadly, China is the world leader in executions."
"In 2008 alone, at least 1 718 people were executed."
"The estimated number of unreported cases is much higher."
"Even the minimum figure means that China is responsible for more than 70% of all executions throughout the world."
"In addition, China has increased the number of crimes liable to the death penalty."
"This means that Chinese people can be executed for committing more than 68 crimes."
"That is why we are calling in this resolution for China to suspend its planned executions and introduce a moratorium on the death penalty immediately."
"(Applause)"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my position regarding this motion for a resolution is similar to the ideas of a man who belongs to those minorities that are discriminated against, a man who has won the Nobel Peace Prize and who presides over the world's leading power: Barack Obama."
"The principles of this resolution are ones I share."
"However, I believe that we absolutely must not repeat the mistakes of left-wing political parties, which want to recite rights, rather than actually earn them."
"Minorities should be defended in China as in every other part of the world but, before submitting such a demanding resolution, we must have a strategy, a coordination of all the different sides and of the whole of Parliament, so as to avoid delaying and damaging negotiations with the Chinese Government."
"We cannot think that we can solve the problems relating to minorities and to the death penalty in China without giving any thought to the Chinese Government."
"That is impossible."
"In this respect, President Obama has done well; he has made no concessions whatsoever, but he still maintains a good relationship with the Chinese Government which, we must admit, is trying to initiate a better dialogue in all negotiations with the Western world."
"I wonder: why submit a resolution - albeit a commendable one - just days before the Nanjing meeting without coordinating, as a precautionary measure, everyone involved?"
"Why submit a resolution that has already been submitted on many other occasions just when we are fortunately starting to get somewhere with the Chinese Government?"
"Why submit a resolution which may potentially damage the beginnings of a new relationship with the Chinese Government?"
"For these reasons, although I support the principles of the resolution, which are the same as my own, I shall abstain from the vote, because strategically, I believe it may harm, not help, the new path we are embarking on with the Chinese Government."
"(DE) Mr President, it was said that this was a speech on behalf of our group."
"Following thorough consultation over the last week, our group proposed in the Conference of Presidents that this point should be included on the agenda."
"We want to discuss this point and we want it to be put to the vote."
"The speech expressed the personal opinion of my colleague and not the opinion of the group."
"Mr Posselt, I understand that, but we have agreed that we have a specific amount of time and each group has one minute of speaking time."
"In China, those who seek to exercise their labour, social, civil and basic political rights continue to be repressed."
"This repression is particularly cruel and indiscriminate when it is used against ethnic minorities such as the Uighurs or the Tibetans, but the Han Chinese do not escape either, as in the cases of the Sakharov Prize winner, Hu Jia, and the lawyers and activists who are being persecuted following President Obama's visit to Beijing."
"The administrative detention of hundreds of thousands of people, systematic torture in prisons, religious and political repression, executions - all these methods are incompatible with the People's Republic of China's obligations as a member of the United Nations."
"Moreover, they are ineffective methods, which will not succeed in silencing or containing those who clamour for freedom and human rights."
"This is the case in China, just like the rest of the world, for the Chinese are not Martians; they are no different to people elsewhere."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, we, as Liberals, are against the death penalty in general, but here the death penalty in China is used to oppress minorities, like the Tibetans, the Uighurs and others."
"Furthermore, China is not a democracy."
"Human rights are not respected."
"China has a harsh policy against Taiwan."
"China should be put under pressure."
"This is difficult, I know."
"It is an enormous market, but we should fight for our principles."
"Therefore, we support this resolution."
"Mr President, someone here asked why this resolution to promote dialogue was put forward."
"It was done so precisely because preparations are being made right now for the EU-China Summit, and the Human Rights Dialogue is a precondition for that."
"Our duty in the European Parliament and on the Subcommittee on Human Rights is to remind the Council and the Commission that the results of human rights dialogues also play a very prominent role at the summits themselves."
"I am sorry that Commissioner de Gucht is not even listening to what I am saying but chooses to talk to his colleague instead."
"It is important for the EU and China to engage in dialogue, and I believe that China, too, will realise that the country can only make progress by making its decision-making procedures more transparent and by guaranteeing its citizens the right to express their opinion."
"It is, in fact, impossible to imagine that China would act any differently in this respect from any other nation which has had to recognise the fact that, in order to develop its society, it needs all those creative forces that it now oppresses and tyrannises."
"If we believe that human rights are universal, we really cannot regard China as the exception, as Mrs Gomes remarked - and I quite agree with her."
"So let us apply the same yardstick to China as we do other countries."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, I have been a long-standing critic in this House of the lack of human rights in the People's Republic of China."
"I have criticised the bullying of peaceful Taiwan in excluding this country from all international organisations, including the World Health Organisation."
"I have criticised the repression of peaceful Tibetan culture, the persecution of Falun Gong, as well as other religious minorities, and the presence of widespread censorship in China, including the media and also the internet and Google."
"I condemn as well the brutal and widespread use of the death sentence for lesser crimes - such as economic subversion and pimping, believe it or not."
"Nevertheless, my group, the ECR, regards it as a personal conscience matter whether the death sentence is justifiable in the most serious crimes of terrorism and murder."
"There can be no doubt that, in the recent riots in Xinjiang province, many innocent Han Chinese were brutally murdered."
"Nevertheless, of course, we do now welcome the PRC's expressed desire for having much better and harmonious relations with its ethnic minorities and, in particular, the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities."
"Of course, I, like all members of my group, call for fair trials for all those detained."
"(PL) Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) endorses the draft resolution."
"I must confess that I was surprised by the suggestions of some fellow Members, from different groups, that we should not, today, discuss the subject of yet more cases of human rights violations or the widespread use of capital punishment in China."
"An argument in favour of this was said to be the forthcoming EU-China Summit."
"Fellow Members, we should not succumb to the temptation of applying double standards or a conspiracy of silence just because we are dealing with a country which is an important trade partner of the EU."
"I am certain that one of the European Parliament's fundamental roles is to uphold human rights."
"This is so, irrespective of whether we are talking about a world power, or about small countries such as Laos and Vietnam."
"The People's Republic of China is the country which carries out the most executions in the world."
"It does not observe a minimum of human rights - those recognised by international legal standards and including the right to a defence and a fair trial."
"Several days ago, we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"If it had not been for the courage to criticise communism, if it had not been for the courage to speak the truth, Europe would look different today."
"(LT) I would hope that in the 21st century, the death penalty will die out and that the instruments of the death penalty will only be found in a museum."
"However, until then, there is still a long road to travel, and I hope that China resolutely follows that road."
"For several decades, China has led in terms of the rate of economic growth, but sadly also in terms of execution statistics."
"Of course, Beijing would say that there is no other way in such a huge country and that not even the USA has abolished the death penalty."
"However, despite this, if we are seriously considering a strategic partnership between the European Union and China that would be very important to both parties, then Beijing should undoubtedly change its policy regarding the implementation of the death penalty, as well as its policy on dialogue between ethnic minorities, for the sake of their harmonious coexistence."
"(DE) Mr President, I have already mentioned in this House that the World Uighur Congress, the central organisation for free Uighurs, is based in Munich, for the same reason that thankfully many Czechs and many other people lived in Munich: because Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were also located there."
"The city still retains this spirit of freedom today."
"At the same time, Franz-Josef Strauß, who always defended these freedom radio stations against calls for their closure, ensured that we developed a relationship with China very early on."
"The two things are not mutually exclusive, but complementary: positive contacts with China, but clear defence of religious freedom and human rights."
"Several homes in Munich were searched by the police during a raid this week and Chinese agents who do nothing but terrorise and spy on Uighurs were arrested."
"This indicates the sort of methods that China uses."
"These methods are unacceptable."
"They range from terrorising people in Munich through to death penalties in Ürümqi."
"This is why we must make our opinions quite clear in this regard."
"(DE) Mr President, I take it for granted that the European Parliament will speak out when it is possible to save people from execution and, therefore, I support the call for a moratorium on the death penalty."
"However, the process of defending human rights must not be misused for the purpose of lecturing China from a position of moral superiority, calling China's integrity into question or creating an absurd caricature of the reality of life in China."
"This does not help those people in China who are working on behalf of human rights, freedom and social harmony."
"Our goal must be to help these people and not to encourage European self-righteousness."
"I am also opposed to including a positive reference to the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People in an urgent resolution."
"That is not relevant and it has nothing directly to do with human rights."
"In addition, it is not a generally acceptable position."
"I would like there to be a wide-ranging discussion in future before an EU-China Summit on the relationship between China and the EU, covering all the subject areas."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to endorse what Reinhard Bütikofer has said."
"My group had proposed that we discuss the imminent executions of the Uighurs in China and the participants in the protest demonstrations against the fraudulent elections in Iran who had been condemned to death, because these are two countries where executions are likely to take place very soon and, therefore, an urgent debate is needed."
"It is true that the Chinese hold the world record for executions, as you have said, and that the Chinese regime is unjust, because it disregards human rights."
"I would like to state explicitly that this is an intolerable situation."
"However, in the Conference of Presidents, we asked for the two things to be kept separate: the urgent issues which we are discussing now, in other words, the imminent executions, and the question of the relationship between the European Union and China on economic, cultural, political and defence issues and in other areas."
"We want to discuss this in a debate on the EU-China Summit and to summarise it in a resolution."
"This is why the mishmash that has come out of this has nothing to do with urgent issues."
"This is also why our group is insisting on a vote on the urgent matter which we proposed and not on the hotchpotch that you have submitted."
"(HU) Mr President, it is a major event that this issue has been urgently included on the agenda now."
"The group of Hungarian MEPs from Transylvania also proposed this issue for discussion."
"We want to thank some of the groups for their participation and support, but we are surprised that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament withdrew its signature from this proposal for a decision."
"I regret that at the meeting the day before yesterday, certain sections were removed from the draft text as a whole, namely, those relating to the criticism of Communist regimes and the protection of minority communities."
"The EU should finally face up honestly and openly to Communism's enduring legacy and to Communist regimes still surviving today, which includes China."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are strongly opposed to the death penalty, wherever in the world it is enforced."
"We are also opposed to the oppression of ethnic and religious minorities and both of these things are sadly happening in China."
"Many people hoped that China would show more respect for human rights as a result of the Olympic Games and also that, because the Chinese are aware that the eyes of the world are on them, they would commit fewer abuses of human rights."
"Unfortunately, that has not been the case."
"The executions have continued and, therefore, it is very important for us to discuss this today, following the executions in November of nine Uighurs, which many people in the world are completely unaware of, and before that of two Tibetans."
"The summit between the EU and China is not far off and, as several of the previous speakers have mentioned, China is an important trading partner."
"This is what makes it so difficult to bring up the breaches of human rights repeatedly, but that is why it is particularly important to talk about this subject today in the run-up to the summit."
"We would like the death penalty to be abolished everywhere."
"It is good that Parliament introduced a moratorium on the death penalty in 2007 and we must do everything we can to keep this subject in the forefront of people's minds while the death penalty is still in place."
"(PL) Mr President, as a Pole, I always feel my heart beat faster when there is talk of human rights in China."
"On 4 June 1989, Poles regained their liberty by voting in the first free election, in which we returned a non-communist Prime Minister."
"The same day, 4 June 1989, the Chinese regime crushed protesting students under the caterpillar tracks of its tanks in Tiananmen Square."
"The free world had found a recipe for overcoming Soviet communism, but had not found one for overcoming Chinese communism."
"The primacy of economics continues to be victorious over values and human rights."
"This was clearly evident last year, when the mighty of the world proudly declared they would boycott the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics, and then all of them followed their economic interests and queued up in the first row of the parades, deaf to the cries of the oppressed people of Tibet."
"I fear that if we put off making a resolution, we will unduly restrict this matter."
"Of course, abuse of the death penalty is a horrible crime, but there are also arrests."
"People are killed in labour camps in China, people are beaten with cudgels, they are imprisoned, freedom of speech is stifled, there is censorship."
"This should all be found in this resolution."
"It is good that the resolution has been tabled, but most important of all is that the primacy of human rights values should be victorious over economics."
"That is what I wish for everyone."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, let me first outline the state of play in EU-China relations."
"Our policy towards China is one of constructive engagement."
"As two major actors on the global stage, our strategic partnership is increasingly focused on addressing global challenges."
"A key goal of the 12th EU-China Summit, to be held on 30 November in Nanjing, will precisely be to work together to ensure success for the Copenhagen climate summit and to address EU-China relations, including human rights, the financial and economic crisis and other international issues."
"But a strategic partnership is not about thinking alike on each and every matter."
"It is true that Europe and China may disagree and have different views on some issues, such as on human rights and democracy."
"The strength of our relationship allows us to discuss these matters frankly."
"Human rights issues, including the death penalty and respect for the fundamental rights of ethnic minorities, are systematically raised during our regular political contacts and, in particular, during our human rights dialogue with the Chinese authorities."
"This was the case during the recent 28th round on 20 November in Beijing, where we had a frank discussion on these issues."
"The EU's principled opposition to the death penalty and the call for its abolition in China are robustly conveyed on all occasions."
"The same is also true for the respect of the rights of ethnic minorities."
"Let me reassure this House that we will also continue to raise those issues in other fora, including at the highest level."
"My colleague, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner, had an extensive debate with you on Tibet in March, where she outlined the EU's position."
"I would like to recall some essential elements that the EU position encompasses."
"We have always supported the dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Dalai Lama."
"For the EU, human rights are universal, and the situation in Tibet is a legitimate concern of the international community."
"Tibet's situation has invariably been approached as such."
"We have consistently passed this message to our Chinese counterparts and listened very carefully to their views."
"Commissioner Ashton also had the opportunity to express, here in July, her concern over the unrest in Xinjiang, deplore the loss of life and express her condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims."
"The EU supports any effort that will help reconciliation in this region."
"The EU respects China's right to bring those responsible for violent action to justice but reaffirms its long-standing universal opposition to the use of the death penalty, under all circumstances, as well as the importance it attaches to the right to have a fair trial."
"The EU has raised these concerns repeatedly with the Chinese authorities and reiterates its concerns in the two declarations published on 29 October and on 13 November, as it always does in such situations."
"The statements called on China to commute any other death penalties passed in connection with the disturbances in Tibet and Xinjiang."
"Moreover, the EU will continue to press to be allowed to observe any further trials arising from Tibet and the Xinjiang disturbances."
"We all share the goal of a more open, transparent China, adhering to international standards on human rights and working together to address global challenges."
"We all hoped that the Olympic Games would be the start of more Chinese flexibility with respect to the human rights of individuals."
"Up to now, this has not materialised."
"We must continue to work on the development of our strategic partnership and the respect of human rights as an integral part of our continued dialogue."
"The 12th EU-China Summit in Beijing is a privileged occasion to do so at an important stage of our respective evolution."
"The debate is closed."
"We shall now proceed to the vote."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"China has recently said goodbye to US President Barack Obama and will soon say hello to European Council President Fredrik Reinfeldt."
"We must, however, see more action than just diplomatic gestures."
"China has stated to its own people and the world its commitment to human rights, including those of the minorities residing within its borders."
"Nevertheless, their record speaks otherwise."
"Lately, there have been a number of disturbing incidents involving executions that were conducted with questionable trials and with uncommon haste."
"These activities were all conducted in secrecy."
"There is also the serious case of the Uighur minorities, where the Chinese Government is implementing birth control policies that are phasing the group out."
"As the European Union speaks out for minority rights and abhors the death penalty, we urge the Chinese Government to open up the process by which citizens are tried and sentenced to death, and commute the sentences of those who were not given fair and open trials."
"We urge the Chinese authorities to respect the rights of minorities living within their borders with regard to both UN resolutions and their own constitution."
"We also urge China to improve its human rights with the support of the international community."
"Mr President, I understand the displeasure felt by some Members here that our resolution on China was actually scheduled for a date after the visit by the Chinese delegation and hence might, by chance, give an impression of an unsuccessful journey, although the atmosphere was, in fact, excellent."
"It is everyone's desire that cooperation continues in a positive spirit, without, however, forgetting the facts."
"Diplomacy cannot ignore human rights, but we need diplomacy and awareness of the situation to promote them."
"Only recently, I was on a visit to Pakistan, where I met the President, the Prime Minister and prominent ministers to discuss human rights and the fight against terrorism."
"I would say that sometimes in our resolutions on human rights, we also need to mention the good news."
"There is cause for that now."
"A year ago, Pakistan's new democratically elected government appointed the first Minister for Minorities, who himself represents the Christian minority."
"The government's achievements in this area have been significant: the country has approved a 5% quota of public offices reserved for minorities, religious festivals for minorities have been made official, minorities are to have their own special day of celebration on 11 August, and the Senate is planning the same 5% quota for that institution."
"The most important project relates to the reduction in incidences of violence."
"Minorities together with Muslims are forming local 'inter-faith harmony' committees, whose purpose it will be to soothe tensions and improve dialogue between the various groups."
"There will be one in 112 local areas."
"Ideally, they will also be able to prevent recruitment by the Taliban very effectively."
"Pakistan is the most crucial country in terms of global security."
"If the government succeeds in eliminating terrorism by such peaceful means as these, the example will be worth following."
"The situation should be interesting to watch."
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)"
"1."
"Nicaragua (vote)"
"Before the vote:"
"Mr President, I would like to remind you that my group has decided not to take part in the vote for the reasons I mentioned earlier."
"Therefore, no abstentions, but no participation either."
"(FI) Mr President, in my opinion, too many Members in the last debate were allowed to go over their speaking time, by as much as double in some cases."
"Could you kindly remind everyone that, if necessary, the microphone can be turned off?"
"That might be necessary for us not to lose the speaking time allotted to us."
"Yes, some of you were given the floor twice, but not in one item."
"As far as disconnections are concerned, I have been generous to everyone and have not switched anyone's microphone off today, but next time I will."
"Mr President, I wish to emphasise that our group is actually present but, for the same reason as the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, we have decided not to participate in the vote to indicate our opposition to the fact that the debate has taken place, just like the votes."
"Mr President, our speech takes exactly the same perspective."
"For the reasons that we explained during our speech, we will not participate in this debate ... in this vote."
"We participated in the debate, but we will not participate in the vote, as it concerns a false state of urgency, as we have already explained."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I must draw your attention to a small technical error in Paragraph 6."
"The words 'criminal' and 'disciplinary' will be removed from this paragraph."
"2."
"Laos and Vietnam (vote)"
"3."
"China: Minority rights and application of the death penalty (vote)"
"(DE) Mr President, excuse me, but there is an error in paragraph 3 of the German version and I would like to ask you to have it corrected there and, if necessary, in all the other language versions."
"The German version reads: 'Condemns the execution of the two Tibetans and another nine Uighurs'."
"Of course, this is incorrect."
"Uighurs are not other Tibetans and Tibetans are not other Uighurs."
"I would like to ask you to have this corrected in all the language versions."
"Mr Posselt, thank you, that will be corrected."
"That concludes the vote."
"Voting time"
"The next item is the vote."

"I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned."
"(The sitting was suspended at 16.25)"
"Resumption of the session"
"I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 26 November 2009."
"Announcements by the President"
"In opening the last session of the European Parliament in 2009, I would firstly like to offer you all - all fellow Members - my sincere wishes for the approaching Christmas season, for the Chanukah festival, which has already begun, and for the coming new year."
"On behalf of all Members of the European Parliament, I would like to express similar sincere wishes to the administration, to all those who work directly with Parliament and assist us in our work."
"I would also like to mention the attack on the Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi."
"The attack deserves our unequivocal condemnation."
"Political discussion must not be conducted in such a fashion."
"Yesterday's incident should never have taken place."
"We hope Mr Berlusconi will be able to leave hospital soon and we wish him a quick return to health."
"With your permission, I would also like to mention an anniversary which is important to me personally."
"Yesterday, it was 28 years since the imposition of martial law in Poland by the then Communist authorities."
"As a result, almost 100 people lost their lives, including the nine miners who were shot during the strike at the Wujek Mine."
"Many thousands of democratic opposition activists were interned, and others were even imprisoned."
"This was intended to break up and destroy the Solidarity trade union."
"I refer to these events because I would like to draw attention to how greatly Europe has changed in the past two or three decades, but also to how we ought to strive for peace and human rights in our continent and throughout the world."
"I would also like to take the opportunity to remind you that on Wednesday at 12.00, a ceremony will be held to present the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought."
"This year, the prize has been awarded to Lyudmila Alexeyeva, Sergei Kovalev and Oleg Orlov, who represent the Russian human rights defence organisation Memorial."
"Our continent experienced very great suffering during the 20th century, so we understand very well the importance of striving for human rights around the world, and especially in the continent of Europe."
"This event, therefore, holds particular value for us."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, apologies if I am not speaking in accordance with proper procedure, but I wanted to express my solidarity and that of my group with Prime Minister Berlusconi."
"I was speaking on behalf of the entire European Parliament."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, together with Mr Sassoli and all the members of the Democratic Party within the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, would like to echo your words of solidarity towards the Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and stress that this was an abominable, unacceptable and unjustifiable act."
"We are ardent opponents of Mr Berlusconi, but we are political adversaries."
"We do not view Mr Berlusconi, or any other opponent, as our enemy."
"There is no other way to fight and win except through political and civil battle."
"We will not allow anyone to force the liveliness of political debate down a dangerous road of hate and violence, which is the first step towards authoritarian and antidemocratic practices."
"It is right that, once again, this Parliament shows its superior equanimity, respect and democratic maturity."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like, also on behalf of my group, to informally offer my truly heartfelt thanks, first of all to you, who labelled what happened in the most appropriate terms, which is to say 'undignified', but even more so, if possible, to my Italian fellow Members, and in particular, Mr Pittella, for their words."
"I do not intend to engage in political speculation of any kind."
"What happened really could take us almost to the edge of the abyss, the precipice, and so the unanimous call that came from Parliament is the only one that can guide us at this difficult time."
"I therefore thank Parliament and thank Europe for their contribution to life and to democratic development in Italy."

"The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on 10 December pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed."
"The following amendments have been proposed:"
"Monday - no changes"
"Tuesday"
"I have received a request from the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group for the inclusion of an oral question to the Commission on the subsidiarity principle."
"It was a written request submitted to the Bureau of the European Parliament."
"I would like to ask a representative of the EFD Group to say something about this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have asked that this oral question be added to the agenda since we believe that Parliament should receive an appropriate answer on such an important point, and that is why we are asking for this amendment to the agenda."
"(Parliament agreed to the request)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, please note that this item will be included as the last item on the agenda for Tuesday evening."
"The tabling deadline for motions for resolutions is Tuesday, 15 December at 10.00, and the tabling deadline for joint motions for resolutions and amendments is Wednesday, 16 December at 10.00."
"The vote will take place on Thursday."
"So it is the last item tomorrow, motions for resolutions on Wednesday and the vote on Thursday."
"Mr President, if we understood correctly, you referred to a resolution in connection with the motion that has initially been tabled."
"However, we have not expressly agreed whether there is to be a resolution or not."
"That is, in fact, quite right."
"The request was submitted with the resolution."
"Wednesday - no changes"
"Thursday"
"Are there any comments about Thursday?"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, several urgent matters are scheduled for next Thursday."
"As the third of these urgent matters, we are due to discuss the situation in Azerbaijan."
"The media, including the Western media, have reported on a scuffle that involved two young bloggers and another two people in a public place."
"An arrest was made and a sentence handed down and I believe it is only right to get to the bottom of the matter and ascertain whether everything has been done in accordance with the law."
"At the same time, however, extremely serious events have taken place in the Philippines in recent days: 57 people in a convoy in support of a presidential candidate were massacred by an armed group, which exploited the revolutionary situation to take up arms against the government, to the point that martial law has been declared in the Philippines."
"I therefore ask you, ladies and gentlemen, that the situation in the Philippines replace the 'Azerbaijan' issue as the third item on Thursday."
"There is a clear disparity between the seriousness of what happened in Azerbaijan compared ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"One-minute speeches on matters of political importance"
"The next item is the one-minute speeches on matters of political importance."
"(DE) Mr President, I do not know whether what I am going to say still relates to the agenda, but I think that this is the most appropriate time to mention it."
"One of the consequences of the Treaty of Lisbon is, of course, that the number of MEPs will change, and for Austria this means that two new Members will be joining this House."
"These Members are ready, they have been elected and it is important that they come here soon."
"I would like to ask you what steps have already been taken to enable these Members to take their places here quickly, either as observers or as full Members, or what you intend to do to make this happen quickly."
"The first step in this matter should be taken by the European Council."
"I spoke in the European Council last Thursday and said clearly that it is extremely important for Parliament that the Council take the initial legal steps to enable us to accept the additional Members and to know from which countries they will come."
"This must be done in accordance with the principles of law, and that step should now be taken by the Council."
"I am continually appealing for the Council to take the appropriate steps."
"The next steps, after an initial decision from the Council, should then be taken by Parliament."
"(ES) Mr President, I would like to condemn in this House the continual provocations, abuses of power and threats by the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez."
"With his dictatorial method of government he is threatening, among other things, freedom of expression in Venezuela and democratic order in Latin America."
"President Chávez has closed down thirty radio stations and some television channels."
"He is threatening and punishing journalists in Venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime."
"Because of all this, Mr President, it should also be pointed out that while there are power cuts, water shortages and food shortages in Venezuela, and poverty is continuing to grow due to poor management by the Chávez Government, the Venezuelan tyrant is trying to cover it all up by blowing up border bridges and threatening Colombia."
"He is praising international terrorists and aligning himself with the despotic dictators of the world, and his words and speeches are continual provocations and war cries aimed at destabilising the American continent."
"This is why Parliament, which is always committed to freedom and democracy in any part of the world, must strongly condemn the autocratic and dictatorial policies of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like further details on the consequences of the 40% reduction in world fishing quotas of tuna."
"On 15 November in Recife, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) decided that all contracting parties must reduce their fishing capacity by at least 40%."
"This measure means that the world fishing quota of blue fin tuna will reduce from 22 000 tonnes currently to 13 500 tonnes in 2010."
"Indeed, the ICCAT Member States decided to target overcapacity of their fishing fleet in order to halve it by 2011."
"The fishing season for tuna seiners will also be reduced to one month, with no possibility of extension."
"These measures, which are necessary for preserving the species and which will be transposed into European Union legislation, will endanger the activity of European fishermen."
"I would like to know what action is envisaged to support the fishermen's livelihood and to halt plans to reduce the fleet."
"What measures have been taken to reduce the very significant socio-economic consequences of transposing these ICCAT decisions into EU legislation?"
"(RO) As is well known, the implementation of the strategies and operational programmes for the 2007-2013 period is still in its initial stages, and Romania has the opportunity for the first time to benefit from EU funds as part of the cohesion policy."
"The regional development policy is one of the European Union's most important and complex policies."
"Its objective must be to reduce the existing economic and social disparities, but in different regions of Europe."
"I would like to mention the efforts made by all Member States to integrate the general priorities of the cohesion policy as part of the operational programmes."
"However, I believe that the European Union must adopt a strategic role so that the operational programmes can be implemented as quickly as possible in all Member States, thereby promoting the measures intended to consolidate its institutional capacity according to the specific needs of each Member State."
"Mr President, I would like to denounce the deep economic crisis that the Catalan and the European nut sector have been suffering for several years."
"The continuous fall of nut prices threatens the future of our European producers."
"I would like to warn you about the non-interventionist policy of the Turkish Government."
"There are 500 000 tonnes of nuts stored by the Turkish public body for nut purchasing."
"This body wants to sell off these 500 000 tonnes of nuts in January 2010."
"In the light of what the Turkish authorities said at a bilateral meeting with the European Union on 2 October 2009, such a situation would seriously damage European producers, with a new dramatic drop in nut prices."
"I asked the European Commission about this question two months ago, but none of the existing special safeguard provisions will be applied to protect our producers."
"These are the worries I wanted to share with you."
"(RO) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you are aware, Romania would like to become part of the Schengen area from 2011."
"With this in mind, it has submitted to a number of assessments, five to be exact, four of which have already been completed."
"I would like to remind you in particular of the evaluation of the maritime border, which was rated so highly by the Schengen experts that Romania has even been presented as a model of good practice."
"However, we have one more test to undergo, and I am sure that we will come through it successfully."
"Taking the example provided by Romania, I am proposing to you that we look at the expansion of the Schengen area in a more optimistic light."
"In other words, we should no longer regard this process as a threat to the security of our borders, but rather as an opportunity for strengthening cooperation between Member States in the area of justice, freedom and security."
"I am pleased to note that these ideas also feature in the Stockholm Programme adopted last week by the European Council."
"This programme regards the extension of the Schengen area as a priority for the European Union's internal policy."
"(ES) Mr President, in Honduras, as everyone knows, there was a coup d'état on 28 June."
"Almost six months have passed, and Parliament has still not found time to condemn this coup."
"What is more, MEPs from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Conservatives and Reformists have visited the country to endorse the consequences of this coup d'état by their presence."
"Through their support, they were confusing the European Parliament with the political groups and endorsing elections run by a de facto Government that were held under conditions that did not guarantee their legitimacy."
"A perverse precedent is being created through the coup in Honduras, as from now on, moderate, temporary, relatively bloodless coups are going to be not only accepted by the continental right, but actually applauded and encouraged by the European and North American right."
"What has happened in Honduras is extremely regrettable!"
"Mr President, I want to deplore the deeply worrying decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday to close the Democracy Society Party, which represents largely Kurdish interests, and to ban from politics its leading MPs."
"This is a very retrograde step and will be used as a pretext to return to violence by extremists."
"It closes off the democratic political option which the Prime Minister, Mr Erdoğan, has said he wants to pursue."
"One of the problems is that the AK Party Government has failed to reform the very law which was used to close the Democracy Society Party - in fact, the law under which the AK Party itself almost got closed."
"So this is not in the interests of the Government of Turkey or its people."
"The ALDE Group will be calling for a plenary debate on this subject as early as possible in the new year because it is a really bad step backwards for Turkey."
"Mr President, we all know the importance of recycling, and it is a given fact we would expect our paper to be recycled, once used."
"I recently visited a printing company in my constituency of London, where I found out more about ink-jet printing."
"The complicated process used to recycle ink-jet paper makes it an expensive operation, and the use of additional bleach means it is not environmentally friendly."
"The ink cannot be separated easily from the paper, which means that much of today's printed matter cannot be recycled."
"Companies such as the one I visited in London that use other forms of printing which are environmentally friendly need to be encouraged and incentives offered to make the process economically more even-handed."
"I would like to see a market-driven solution supported by Member States, a solution where the industry self-regulates with a code of practice, taking the lead in environmental agendas."
"Nevertheless, the EU has an important role to play in promoting awareness of these issues and supporting alternatives to ink-jet printing when and where appropriate."
"(EL) Mr President, I asked for the floor in order to draw the attention and awareness of the European Parliament to an aspect of immigration policy which relates to unaccompanied minors and child rights, an issue which needs to be addressed by the Union as a whole and not only by the countries of entry, such as Greece."
"As you well know, under Community legislation, every request for asylum or residence must be examined in the Member State first entered by the applicant, regardless of his or her actual destination."
"This places a burden on the structures in the entry country and works against the rights of applicants being dealt with en masse under the briefest of procedures."
"They are often sent on with no guarantee that their rights and life will be respected or remain in the country with no protection or social care and, as a result, in the case of children, they fall victim to abuse and exploitation by various gangs."
"I believe that, as the European Parliament, we should work to change and adapt Community and national legislation, so that unaccompanied minors reach the country which is their final destination, are not deported, and are ensured a dignified and safe stay in the European Union."
"(EL) Mr President, last week, I had meetings with various politicians from Arab states, namely the Emirates, Egypt and Jordan."
"I should like to convey their concern about Iran's nuclear programme."
"I met Israelis who are extremely concerned and their main concern is the support which Turkey is currently giving Iran."
"They asked what the European Union's official position was on support by Prime Minister Erdoğan to the Tehran administration and about the statements by Mr Erdoğan that Iran's nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes."
"I have to admit that I did not know what our official position is on Turkey's statements and behaviour in terms of Iran's nuclear programme."
"The progress report says one thing and Mr Erdoğan says another."
"(EL) Mr President, the fact that the Commissioner present, Mrs Boel, called a text on the review of the Community budget in connection with the common agricultural policy inadequate at a public meeting of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a good sign."
"In my opinion, under no circumstances should the debate on the financial review anticipate the review of the common agricultural policy for the post-2013 period."
"We are not simply calling for the ratio of agricultural spending to the overall Community budget to be defined."
"We are calling, first and foremost, for the agricultural policy that we want to be defined, to finalise the contribution of the agricultural sector to the production of public goods, and then to decide on the resources to be made available for the targets set."
"This is the message which I wish to convey and which I wish to impart to Commissioner Boel."
"(BG) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the free movement of persons is one of the fundamental freedoms of the European Union, and one of the pillars of the Single Market."
"However, a number of Member States are still continuing to impose restrictions on Bulgarians and Romanians with regard to access to their labour market."
"The arguments for maintaining the restrictions are contrary to market logic, especially during a crisis."
"Even the Commissioner for Employment declared some time ago: 'The right to work in another country is a fundamental freedom for people in the EU'."
"He is absolutely right too."
"Maintaining these restrictions against workers from the new Member States creates anomalies in the market and contradicts the principle of non-discrimination which is enshrined in the treaties on which the European Union is founded, thereby tarnishing the European Union's image."
"I urge the European Commission to coordinate with Member States the lifting, as soon as possible, of labour market restrictions for Member States which have recently joined."
"Fellow Members, I am also asking for your support so that we can achieve a truly free market and equal rights for all European citizens."
"(FR) Mr President, I would like to come back to a recent event, namely the Swiss vote on minarets."
"Admittedly, the vote was held in a country outside the European Union, but it clearly concerns an issue that is not unfamiliar to us."
"I would like to come back to this event because it also provides an excuse to talk about secularism, and we can never talk enough about secularism in this House."
"There is an urgent need for the principle of secularism to dominate the organisation of our society."
"I would like to talk in simple terms here."
"Firstly, the opposite principle to secularism is not religiousness and still less spirituality."
"The opposite principle to secularism is religious communitarianism which lays down regulations and laws that are above civil law and encloses individuals into infra-societal groups."
"Our European Union, as a result of its history, is multicultural and multiethnic."
"It is and will increasingly be so, and only secularism can enable emancipated individuals and their communities to live and thrive."
"(ES) Mr President, clinical trials are a benchmark method of clinical research and are considered to be the most reliable source of information on which to base treatment decisions."
"I would, however, like to alert the House to the fact that a recent study by the European Society of Cardiology has once again demonstrated that there are serious limitations to this methodology as a result of low levels of participation by women in such trials."
"The differences between men and women, in terms of risk factors, disease presentation and response to treatment have been scientifically proven."
"The result is that the spectacular achievements in recent years in terms of prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases have not been reflected in a significant decline in women's mortality rates."
"It is therefore essential that as European institutions, we promote research that is specifically aimed at women, either through their more extensive inclusion in clinical studies, or through designing studies that are conducted exclusively on women."
"(NL) Mr President, I, too, wish to talk about last Friday's decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court to ban the Democratic Society Party (DTP), which has resulted in no less than 22 members of the Turkish Parliament being either expelled from the parliament or deprived of their political rights for five years."
"Unfortunately, these parliamentarians include Leyla Zana, to whom we awarded the Sakharov Prize in 1995."
"It is already the fourth time that a Kurdish party has been banned; time and again, Kurds endeavour to stand up for the rights of their people under a different name and time and again they are suppressed for allegedly propounding ideas counter to the unity of the Turkish State."
"Yet the essence of democracy includes freedom of association and freedom of opinion, and so this divests of all credibility the so-called 'democratic opening' initiative launched by Prime Minister Erdoğan earlier this year with regard to the Kurdish question."
"I should very much like to support Mrs Ludford's call for a debate on this in January."
"(FR) Mr President, the following is an extract from a letter written by William Bourdon, Taoufik Ben Brik's lawyer, to Mr Sarkozy, President of the French Republic: 'I have had the opportunity to denounce, as all his Tunisian lawyers have done, the legal farce which has resulted in Taoufik Ben Brik being sentenced, without in-depth examination, to a staggering six months in prison."
"I can unequivocally and formally attest to the fact that the dossier of the proceedings which led to this conviction was totally fabricated and was based on the personal vendetta of President Ben Ali."
"Throughout this year, 2009, he has been unable to travel since the fragility of his immune system is such that he is always at risk of being exposed to serious diseases."
"I believe that his family have succeeded in bringing him essential medicine, but I am not certain of this."
"His Tunisian lawyers have only intermittent access to their client, and some are systematically denied any possibility of visiting him."
"The only time that his wife has been able to see him was for a few minutes a few days ago, and she has been unable to see him again since.'"
"Mr President, please write to the Tunisian authorities to request the release of Taoufik Ben Brik."
"(FR) Mr President, I am going to follow on from Mrs Flautre's speech and invite you to write to the Tunisian authorities."
"This year, we are going to award the Sakharov Prize, the symbol of the European Parliament's commitment to human rights."
"We have a partnership agreement with Tunisia which contains many provisions relating to democracy and human rights."
"Nevertheless, the presidential elections in Tunisia have just been held in lamentable conditions that are unworthy of the provisions contained in the agreement with the European Union."
"We cannot remain silent."
"Human rights defenders in Tunisia are being scorned, arrested and humiliated."
"This can go on no longer."
"That is why, Mr President, I urge you to write to President Ben Ali and to call, in particular, for the release of Taoufik Ben Brik, a committed journalist whose only crime has been to criticise the so-called democracy in Tunisia."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I had requested that the picture of a young Iranian woman, Neda Agha-Soltan, be displayed in Brussels alongside that of Aung San Suu Kyi."
"Mrs Soltan was killed as she was seeking freedom and transparency in Iran and has become a symbol for freedom and, above all, for women fighting for freedom."
"My request has been signed by 75 Members and five political groups."
"I believe that it is particularly important that it is granted, especially at the current time, as Ayatollah Khamenei in Iran says that he intends to repress any kind of protest and any kind of opposition."
"I hope that my request is granted."
"Mr President, along with the approaching winter season, the threat of a new gas crisis is emerging from the east."
"A few weeks ago, Prime Minister Putin made it clear to us that Russia may again violate its gas-supply contracts with EU Member States."
"To avoid this, he called on the EU to lend as much as EUR 1 billion to Ukraine in order for it to be able to fulfil its gas-transit commitments."
"So we may expect another round of strange political play directed by our Russian partner."
"This is unacceptable."
"Although particular Member States are concerned by this on different levels, the EU will have to take unified measures and adopt an assertive standpoint on this crucial issue on principle, out of solidarity."
"Moreover, this is a signal to speed up our new projects for the diversification of long-term energy supply so that Russian influence can be minimalised."
"(SK) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty has also had a favourable effect on the conditions for further expansion of the EU."
"Nobody can now argue any longer that the Union lacks the institutional capacity for expansion and decision making, as this is now in place."
"There are no reasons, therefore, for delaying or hindering the process of further expansion."
"This applies particularly to the Western Balkans region."
"There have recently been intensive and generally positive developments in the region."
"The reports published recently on progress in the individual countries confirm this, as does the EU expansion strategy for 2010 published by the Commission."
"Together with the introduction of a visa-free regime for entry into the Schengen area, a real chance is arising for the countries of the region to make progress on their European path."
"It is up to them to make use of it."
"The EU too, however, must not dither but must proceed responsibly and rationally, fully respecting the circumstances and the European Parliament must play an active role."
"(SL) This week, overnight from Friday to Saturday, after more than two decades, the citizens of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro will finally again be able to enter the European Union without a visa."
"That will be a great day and an opportunity for celebration."
"However, I would like to use this opportunity to call once again on the European Commission and the Council to do everything possible to lift the visa requirement for the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania as soon as possible."
"We must not allow any new divisions in the Western Balkans or lose any time, particularly to the detriment of the younger generation."
"It is hard to believe that the majority of young people in these countries still know nothing about the European Union."
"Our responsibility is to tear down the new visa walls which came into existence in the Western Balkans after the fall of the Berlin Wall."
"This also goes for the population of Kosovo."
"The Western Balkans needs a clear European perspective."
"Let us not give in to unfounded fears."
"(RO) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two really historic events have marked the end of 2009: the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force and the Copenhagen Summit."
"I would like to use my speech to express my satisfaction with regard to the way in which the European Union is proving, at the moment, to be the main actor when it comes to finding viable solutions in the combat against climate change."
"I am similarly pleased that Member States have managed to reach agreement at all and present a common position, even though reaching agreement among the 27 Member States is no easy task."
"The outcome will perhaps not match up to our ambitions and expectations, but the decision made by the European Union Member States to offer EUR 7.2 billion to the developing countries is all the more important as these countries are in urgent need of financial support."
"It is also possible that this example could encourage the other UN countries to take the same action."
"The fact should also be applauded that even the countries in the European Union which have been severely affected by the financial crisis to date have expressed their solidarity, made an effort and are going to make a contribution, even if it is only a token gesture by some of them, as an indication of their commitment to the battle against global warming."
"(EL) Mr President, may I start by expressing my full solidarity with the fight by the trade unionists in the European Parliament and wishing them every success."
"A massive wave of anti-labour measures is being unleashed by the Greek Government and flexible forms of work are being made the rule and imposed across the board."
"The social security system is also being decimated and wages and pensions are being frozen."
"The Greek Government, the European Union and the representatives of capital are trying to terrorise workers by brandishing the bugbear of Greece's budget deficit and public debt."
"They are engaging the workers in social dialogue, which is a set-up, in order to force them into consent, limit their justified anger and divert grassroots reaction."
"The first response to the anti-grassroots attack by the government and the European Union will be the national strike on 17 December announced and organised by the All Workers Militant Front (PAME)."
"They are demanding measures to satisfy modern grassroots requirements which can only be met by a united front of the working classes, the poor and middle classes in the towns and countryside, to confront and overthrow the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union."
"(DE) Mr President, on 8 December, the ESDP mission, Operation Atalanta, celebrated one year of existence."
"According to the Swedish Presidency, the operation has demonstrated its ability to counter piracy effectively and there has been a significant fall in attacks."
"That last statement, however, is highly questionable."
"According to a report by the International Maritime Bureau, in the first nine months of 2009, there were more attacks in total than in the whole of 2008."
"The number of armed attacks also rose by 200% overall."
"The financial efficiency of this operation is also highly questionable."
"The cost of damage caused by piracy in this region is estimated to be USD 200 million in total, whereas the EU and its Member States are investing USD 408 million per year."
"The new planned ESDP mission in Somalia, once again, will not get to the root of the problem, but merely deal with the symptoms."
"What would really be worthwhile would be for the EU to set up an effective coastal watch to prevent illegal fishing ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(FR) Mr President, the SESAR programme, which aims to modernise air traffic management in Europe, is a major project."
"How is the Commission going to prepare for the forthcoming SESAR deployment phase and, in particular, for the financing of this programme, which is essential both for the environment and for our scientific and technical standing?"
"Will the Commission follow the recommendations of the 2007 report, according to which a highly qualified individual should ensure political monitoring of this programme?"
"Indeed, a number of obstacles will have to be overcome - of a legal, psychological and technical nature - to unite national airspaces and to succeed in getting controllers from the various countries to work together."
"If Europe is not able to create a single airspace, how will it be able to build a strong political union?"
"(HU) Mr President, given that both you and the Commission expressed your intention to monitor the implementation of Slovakia's national language law, I would like to draw your attention to the following points."
"The government has published the implementing provision, which not only overrides laws, but also introduces further restrictions."
"The implementation proposal specifies that the law's legitimate purpose is solely to protect and support the national language in official dealings, as well as to protect the rights of users of the national language."
"It states that, in the case of natural persons and legal entities, the protection of these rights has as its legitimate aim interference with fundamental rights and freedoms."
"It is therefore glaringly obvious that this is a reference to the rights and freedoms of persons belonging to minorities."
"The implementing measure also points out that, regardless of whether the proportion is above or below 20%, the minority language can only be used anywhere if a third person who is present agrees to this."
"I think that this absurdity is unacceptable in Europe."
"(PL) Mr President, at the last EU-Russia Summit, the parties signed a memorandum on the principles of an early warning mechanism on energy matters."
"The European Commission hopes that in future, this will allow us to avoid an energy crisis similar to the one we experienced at the beginning of the year, when the dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the supply and transit of gas resulted in Moscow cutting off the supply of gas for nearly three weeks, effectively paralysing several European countries."
"The approaching winter and the associated increase in gas consumption mean that we have to develop principles which should govern the European energy market."
"The European Union must understand that breaks in gas supply are not only a threat to the economy, but they also threaten the foundations of European integration, which, strengthened by European solidarity, support the free market."
"I also hope that this winter will not have to be a test of the truth of the declarations made, and of whether solidarity is an insignificant, empty word or a real guarantee of cooperation between Member States of the European Union."
"Mr President, as you probably know, Romania has recently concluded a two-year period in which different elections were held every six months."
"The last electoral consultation was presidential and was won by the current president with the very narrow margin of 70 000 votes, coming mainly from the diaspora."
"What bothers me as a citizen is that, during the entire electoral campaign, I was not able to post anything critical of the current president on my blog, the Europolis, while public access to my blog was interrupted altogether."
"I consider this unacceptable, both because it represents censorship of the right to free speech and because it shows that the Internet, too, is controlled by those in power and/or their supporters."
"All in all, it is regrettable that, 20 years after the revolution, in which many people died so that democracy would take firm root, such attitudes are tolerated - possibly even encouraged - by those who temporarily enjoy the fruits of democracy, being elected to power even with such narrow margins."
"(FR) Mr President, since 2007, rail transport of goods has undergone a wholesale liberalisation of supply."
"Operators that do not have a public-service mission will, from now on, face increased competition."
"In many countries, this means an increase in supply in the most profitable segments of the market, namely combined transport and full-train transport."
"By contrast, transport by the single wagon load technique is of little interest for private companies given its very limited profitability."
"If we really want to develop rail freight as the driving force behind sustainable mobility, it is essential to support single wagon load transport."
"Otherwise, transport will transfer entirely to the road, which would run counter to our aims in terms of reducing carbon dioxide emissions."
"Supporting single wagon load transport must therefore be considered a public-service mission since it is an integral part of a sustainable mobility strategy."
"In the context of the European Commission guidelines describing the conditions for state intervention, we believe that it is entirely possible to include support for single wagon load transport, whether in the form of compensation for public-service obligations or in the form of aid for ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ET) Mr President, I would like to talk about a very practical but, for my home country of Estonia, an extremely important subject."
"A few years ago, the three Baltic countries - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - essentially lacked any railway link with Europe."
"The actual infrastructure was in a bad state and it was used very little."
"Since then, there have been positive developments, both in renovation of the present railway and in carrying out studies in order to construct railways conforming to European standards."
"In order to implement Rail Baltica - the name by which we know this project - it is extremely important that both the European Parliament and the European Commission show considerable support for the Rail Baltica project, despite the fact that the population of this region is not exactly the biggest, and the financial situation facing the Baltic States is dire."
"This project is important not only to ensure a normal railway link, but it will also have a considerable effect on all three countries with regard to regional and social policy."
"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania need a railway link with Europe, both for economic reasons and to keep environmental economy in focus, because rail transport allows for larger cargo loads to be transported with less pollution."
"At this moment, the main link is the Via Baltica..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to say a few brief words about two subjects."
"Firstly, the question of equal treatment is linked, with the same level of urgency, to the outstanding problem of the equality of men and women."
"It ought to be a given that men and women of equal calibre with the same qualifications and in the same position should receive the same pay."
"In Austria, everything is turned on its head, because the better qualified women are, the worse their advancement is compared to their male colleagues with the same qualifications."
"Very recent figures show that women's disadvantage increases with age, for example, women over 60 earn around 34% less than their male colleagues."
"Secondly, I would like to make the comment that children require protection."
"I would have liked to have seen the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child enshrined in the Austrian constitution."
"I hope that this discussion will soon be taken up once again in Austria and that it will have a positive outcome."
"(RO) I am delighted to announce in this House that Mr Traian Băsescu has been reconfirmed as President of Romania."
"Our accession to the European Union in 2007 took place during President Traian Băsescu's first term of office and thanks to his direct contribution."
"A new mandate will allow the president to continue with the reforms and full implementation of European norms and values in Romania."
"In the wake of these presidential elections, a single conclusion can be drawn: presidential elections, which complied with stringent international requirements, have passed off in Romania, as was also confirmed by the OSCE observers, as well as by the decision of the Romanian Constitutional Court and the recounting of void votes, after which the incumbent president increased his lead over his opponent."
"We believe that President Băsescu's democratic victory, supported by the Liberal Democratic Party, also marks a victory for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats)."
"Our colleagues in the PPE Group, headed by Wilfried Martens and Joseph Daul, expressed their support for President Băsescu, which we thank them for once again."
"(RO) During the second quarter of 2009, the revenues of the 27 Member States amounted to 43.9% of GDP, while their expenditure was 49.7%."
"During the same period, at EU27 level, taxes and social contributions amounted to approximately 90% of Member States' general revenues, whereas social welfare costs were only 42.2% of GDP."
"The 27 Member States' budget deficit grew from 0.8% in the second quarter of 2008 to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2009."
"During the same period, the employment rate dropped by 2% and industrial production by 10.2%."
"The sectors most affected were construction, agriculture, industrial production, trade, transport and communications."
"I believe that it is imperative for the future European Commission to present a programme of work focusing on economic development, reducing unemployment and guaranteeing decent living conditions."
"(SV) Mr President, anti-Semitism is spreading across the world, even here in Europe, within the EU."
"Surely it goes without saying that the European Parliament must get to grips with this hydra - which is becoming increasing prevalent and widespread - and try to nip it in the bud."
"It must also be made clear that, of course, the policy of the state of Israel can be criticised - just as any other state can be criticised, because no state functions perfectly."
"However, the state of Israel's policy is a separate matter to anti-Semitism."
"I assume that the European Parliament will vigorously oppose any tendency towards anti-Semitism."
"At the moment, these tendencies are frequent and widespread."
"(PT) Mr President, the issue I am bringing to the House's attention today concerns VAT arrangements for Portuguese farmers."
"According to Community legislation, there are three possible schemes: the general scheme, with organised accounting; the option of the scheme for small and medium-sized enterprises; or the flat-rate scheme in which there is no repayment but there is a right to compensation."
"Unfortunately, ever since Portugal joined the EU, this right to compensation has been 0%."
"Infringement proceedings are currently being brought against the Portuguese State."
"This form of taxation affects approximately 18 000 farmers in relation to 5.3% of their sales."
"I should like to make it quite clear that a way needs to be found to make Portuguese legislation conform to the Community acquis."
"Colleagues, we have come to the end of the one-minute speeches."
"I would like to explain that I have a lot of names on the list - at least twice as many as we have time for."
"Today we had more time than usual, but you must remember that if someone spoke in the one-minute speeches last time, one month ago or two months ago, then they will not have as much chance of speaking again today."
"We must pay attention to those who have not spoken at all."
"I am sorry but those are just the rules."
"On the list I have the names of twice as many Members as it is possible to take."
"I am very sorry that not everybody could take the floor."
"Mr President, I appreciate what you say, but the fact that you have got twice the number of names of Members who want to speak shows you how important this particular part of our job - representing our people - actually is."
"Could I perhaps ask you to take this back and look at some other way whereby we would not sit here for one hour and then not be called because - and I am not complaining, I know it is a difficult task you have - at least then we could be told not to turn up this week, or whatever."
"You would decide beforehand how many you were going to take, and the rest of us could then come back the next time or raise our points in another way."
"I think, rather than waste the time of Members, it might be good."
"I think there is always a reason to sit with us and to listen to the discussions."
"I do not think we should speak in such a way."
"Today, almost everybody who did not speak during the last part-session was able to take the floor."
"Crisis in agricultural sectors other than the dairy sector (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on the crisis in agricultural sectors other than the dairy sector."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, firstly I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here today to explain the current economic situation within the agricultural sector."
"The financial and economic crisis has also had an impact on the agricultural sector."
"We have seen slowdown in demand, evolution of exchange rates, difficult access to credits - all of these have had an impact on the prices for agricultural products and also on farm income."
"Official estimates of agricultural income will only be available at the end of this week, but we can already expect that the income will show a significant drop in 2009 compared to the previous year, given the relative development in the cost of production and the agricultural market prices."
"After the initial fall that we saw in autumn 2008, this renewed drop in agricultural income can be expected to more than write off the exceptional income increases generated by the hikes that we saw in agricultural products starting in summer 2007 and then one year later."
"Mr President, if you would allow me, I shall just go through some of the different sectors."
"First of all, cereals."
"We saw in 2008 a significant drop in prices, mainly because of a good harvest."
"However, we have seen that prices over recent months have increased specifically for wheat and corn or maize."
"In the light of these developments, it would not be appropriate at this moment to take exceptional measures, such as opening an intervention tender for maize, nor to intervene with export refunds."
"The situation is slightly different for feed barley, with reduced exports and low domestic prices, but intervention - as you know - has just been opened, and this should help the feed-grain markets."
"In the pigmeat sector, the situation is still fragile."
"The economic crisis hit it at a time when it had not fully recovered from the difficulties experienced back in 2007."
"Prices this year are lower than last year, but at the same time - and sometimes we have to look at it from the positive side - we can see that feed prices are much more stable than back in 2007 and 2008."
"Though exports are below the 2008 level, we expect them still to be much higher than in 2007."
"All in all, I do not see sufficient justification for introducing an additional market instrument at the moment, but I can assure you that we are monitoring this situation very carefully."
"As regards fruit and vegetables, the economic crisis has led to lower domestic consumption, and also we have seen a certain decrease in some export markets."
"This has affected the fruit and vegetable prices that producers obtained."
"However, given the characteristics of the sector, we decided in the last reform on fruit and vegetables that the way to tackle the challenges faced by the sector is to make producer organisations more attractive and also make them responsible for crisis management."
"Producer organisations account today for 40% of the total output of fruit and vegetables."
"They can associate into economically stronger units also on a transitional basis, which is significant, as today's crises do not recognise national borders."
"In the 2007 reform, we provided incentives for producer organisations to do this."
"We also equipped them with new crisis management tools, like green harvesting or non-harvesting, which complement the traditional withdrawals."
"We have also created a legal framework enabling fruit and vegetable producers to influence and stabilise the market, but there is a need for more bottom-up action, for which the Commission cannot take the responsibility."
"I therefore encourage the creation of producer organisations, and I think that Member States and farmers should take a look at the number of producer organisations you have in different Member States."
"It is not very wise if you have producer organisations competing against each other instead of competing against the retail sector."
"Olive oil prices reached a record level four years ago due to unfavourable climate conditions."
"Since then, three consecutive satisfactory harvests and the economic crisis have led gradually to very low prices."
"For this reason, the Commission reactivated private storage aid earlier this year."
"We saw that the market reacted immediately and prices recovered steadily."
"Despite the good harvest forecasts - the fourth in a row now - stocks at the beginning of the harvest stood at a low level."
"As far as we can see, consumption will recover."
"To summarise, I see some timid signs of recovery."
"I agree that close monitoring of the situation is needed and that this will allow action where necessary."
"This is a quick run-through of the short-term measures, but let me assure you that we are also looking into the medium- and long-term issues, in particular, at matters like the distribution of the value added in the food chain, and also how to deal with price volatility."
"I am sure we will come back to these important issues as well."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, last year, and this year, too, dairy farmers made their concerns known very loudly, including in Brussels."
"The impression you get from the media is that it is only the dairy farmers that are in a difficult situation."
"The fact is that other farming sectors are also affected by this."
"In contrast to our dairy farmers, the pig producers, pig fatteners, poultry farmers, fruit and vegetable growers, wine growers and even cereal farmers are used to there being good and bad years and therefore do not make their voices heard so loudly."
"Nevertheless, I think that it is good for us to highlight the situation of these farmers today, too."
"Commissioner, you said that the financial and economic crisis has affected the whole of the agricultural sector and that we ought to consider how we can respond to this."
"When talking with the farmers affected on the ground, I hear the same things again and again: by and large, they say they are coping with the markets, apart from situations where it is extremely difficult, like it was last year and is this year for the dairy farmers and others."
"However, what the farmers do not understand is that we in Europe are burdening them with ever more red tape."
"They say that they want to work their land and feed and care for their animals rather than spend the whole day keeping books and records about what they are doing."
"For centuries, our farmers have produced food without keeping vast quantities of records."
"The yields on the land have increased, the performance of the animals has improved and today, we inundate our farmers with red tape."
"I have recently read that the agricultural ministers are discussing a reduction in red tape."
"Our farmers hardly dare believe this anymore."
"I hope that we can finally make some progress on this and allow our farmers to do what they do best, in other words, produce food - healthy food for half a billion people."
"We should support them in so doing and ensure that they are able to achieve this in future."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, here we are once again discussing the crisis in the agricultural sector."
"In recent months, Parliament has spoken several times on the difficulties that have seriously beset the milk sector, and asked the Commission and the Council to take urgent action."
"We have achieved results, albeit only partial results, but on the basis of these initiatives, a special fund of EUR 300 million has been made available to deal with the emergency."
"However, we must now take note that the crisis that has affected the dairy farming sector is rapidly extending to other sectors of European agriculture, with the wheat, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets showing alarming signs, as Mrs Fischer Boel has just said."
"As for milk, we are facing a cyclical phenomenon that goes hand in hand with the difficult economic situation that has inevitably resulted in a fall in demand and in the ensuing stagnation of the markets."
"This crisis is starting to take on a decidedly worrying dimension, as demonstrated by the numerous protests led by farmers in many regions of Europe."
"These are symptomatic of a pressing and alarming situation and of widespread concern for the future of the sector as a whole."
"That is why, at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 1 December, we decided unanimously to invite the Commission to the House to report to us on the status of the crisis faced by our agriculture and the trends that the various productive sectors are going through."
"On this front we expect, first of all, the Commission to make use of all the measures at its disposal to stabilise the market and to stimulate the recovery of consumption but, at the same time, we believe that this opportunity should also be seized upon to look to the future, and help guarantee that the common agricultural policy will continue to be an important European policy, which will look after the interests of all citizens and all European regions, from northern Sweden to southern Cyprus."
"Farmers expect immediate answers, and today we are here to accept responsibility to speed things up, to tackle the crisis in a decisive manner, and to put the lessons of recent experiences to good use, thus avoiding wasting time and quickly remedying a situation that is in danger of becoming even worse."
"We would like to receive an answer and also news from the Commission in this regard."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the outline of the situation."
"However, I want to concentrate on just one area where we can act, and that is the low-level presence of unauthorised GMOs in feed imports and its impact on the EU feed industry, because this is an over-arching issue."
"I sent a letter to President Barroso - signed by a number of MEPs - and he replied that the Commission have moved quickly to authorise three modified GM products, and a fourth on the way."
"However, we are still playing catch-up."
"The problem next year will be Brazil: they have streamlined their approval system down to 22 months, and the problem will not go away."
"We are all aware that the agri-sector is beset by low margins, and the least, I think, that EU farmers can expect is that the cost of inputs should not be increased by the failure of the EU to act sufficiently quickly to establish authorisations."
"It is one thing to have poor output prices, but it is a double penalty when inputs are not available at world market prices."
"In Ireland, since May of this year, the extra cost of delayed authorisations has been EUR 23 million."
"Finally, the issue of low-level presence will always be with us, and, while speedy functioning of the authorisation system will improve the situation, we still need a technical solution."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Fischer Boel, you gave a very brief response on the subject of the crises and I did not hear you mention any possible solutions to these crises."
"The crisis is not only in the dairy sector, that is true; we also have a crisis in the cereals sector, there is further concentration in the vegetables sector, and in the last ten years, we have lost 50% of our pig producers."
"This is not only due to the fact that we are experiencing an economic crisis, Commissioner, but also to the fact that the orientation of our agricultural policy has been wrong in recent years."
"You would really have to say now that liberalisation has failed and that the world market approach is not the answer for agriculture."
"The next few years will be crucial in terms of where our agriculture is heading."
"We are therefore thankful that, in Paris, the 22 agricultural ministers have clearly indicated where it should be heading."
"There is much that we agree with here."
"We need reliable planning in agriculture, and agricultural policy must be sustainable."
"That is something that we have also advocated for a long time."
"The prices are falling for farmers, but not for consumers."
"That indicates that our agricultural policy only really serves the interests of the large concerns."
"You quite rightly said, Commissioner, that we need to strengthen the position of farmers in this regard, but you always refuse to give an answer to the question of how we should actually do this."
"We will try to provide answers to this."
"It will, in fact, be crucial over the next few years."
"Farmers must not merely be producers of raw materials."
"They need to actively seek market power and, in this, producers need our support."
"Constant pressure on prices in the agricultural sector will lead to poor quality produce."
"Ever greater industrialisation in the agricultural sector will result in the continued loss of biodiversity, and industrialised agriculture will also increase CO2 and methane emissions."
"To talk of climate protection, but still continue along the path of industrialisation cannot be the answer!"
"Therefore, we, as Parliament, must take our job very seriously over the next few years."
"We hope that our cooperation with the new Commission will be constructive."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Madam President, we all understand the concerns of many of the other sectors within agriculture, and they almost certainly thought that we were placing far too much emphasis on trying to resolve the problems facing the dairy sector."
"But those of us who were involved in it knew there was no alternative, that the dairy problems had to be resolved, and hopefully we are now on the way to resolving some of the problems that part of the sector faced. We must now focus on other areas."
"We have spoken about the problems facing the grain farmers, for instance, who have suffered the lowest prices in many a long day - and in my area, potato farmers and apple growers too."
"Indeed, I can give you a list of other areas where there are serious problems."
"But one of the greatest problems - and here I want to come back to support what Mrs Harkin said - is the delay in approving new strands of GMO grains for imports into the European Union."
"We are driving up the cost of feed, which is hitting our pig farmers, our poultry farmers and our beef farmers, and speeding up those approvals would go a long way to helping the situation."
"We are in major danger of over-bureaucracy, red tape and legislation strangling our farmers; you will see that on 1 January when you implement the CPID which, in my opinion, is a total waste of time."
"The mid-term review brought us many changes, and we are about to embark on even more."
"But I think we need to re-examine the effect these changes have made in the industry."
"I know from experience in my area that many sheep farmers and suckler cow farmers are simply leaving the industry."
"This is a very worrying trend."
"We need to look at both these sectors, at how we are actually supporting them."
"Can we do more for them?"
"Can we keep them there?"
"Because we should remember that many of these sectors, such as sheep and suckler cows, are in environmentally sensitive areas, they are in mountainous regions and areas where there is no alternative, and I think we need to have another look at how we are supporting those parts of the industry."
"Madam President, Commissioner, you said that the agricultural crisis is deep, which we already knew."
"Indeed, small- and medium-sized farms can no longer cope."
"However, Commissioner, this is not the result of a technical problem, but of the policy of deregulation that you have pursued, of the undermining of the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy, your refusal to return to paying minimum prices for work and your comprehensive free-trade approach that goes against the very principle of Community preference."
"The time has come, on the eve of a new period of reflection on the common agricultural policy, to consider agricultural work as a mission of general interest, contributing to the common public good."
"A new agricultural policy must also therefore be a food, environmental and territorial policy."
"We must first identify the objectives and the direction of this policy before deciding on budgetary aspects."
"In any case, this would mean paying guaranteed basic minimum prices for work done and lead to a productive agriculture industry that adds value and provides employment, encouraging agricultural development that respects food sovereignty and combats famine."
"Today, all the evidence points to the fact that social, environmental and health effectiveness depends on agriculture on a human, individual farmer scale, not on an industrial scale."
"These should be the subjects of our debates if we are finally to end the agricultural crisis."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the current crisis that the agricultural world is enduring is the obvious result of the rapid territorial expansion that the European Union set in motion in recent years and, above all, the excessively quick globalisation of the markets."
"The agricultural sector must be safeguarded and protected, by applying the principles of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in particular, Articles 32 to 38, with particular reference to the objectives which, in order to be achieved, must follow specific legal rules."
"In this sector, the rules that govern intervention in the event of a market crisis do not allow us to make a significant response to the requirements of the agricultural sector with specific protection of farmers, at an extremely difficult time that affects agriculture as a whole and, in particular, the fruit and vegetable sectors, such as, for example, apples and peaches, and cereals, such as wheat and maize."
"Farmers must not only be helped, but they must also be guaranteed market protection, as laid down by the fundamental rules of the treaty."
"Unfortunately, this currently only occurs on a limited basis."
"We have seen it before with the milk crisis and with the current fruit and vegetable crisis, for example."
"It is now time for Europe to take more incisive decisions so as to give truly 360-degree support to our farmers, our farms and our land, which, unfortunately, is all too often neglected."
"It would, then, be better to think seriously about what is being done in the European market to promote our agricultural products in the face of those from outside the Union and, I would repeat, for fruit and vegetables in particular."
"By creating specific rules, which must, though, be respected by the whole European Union and which we must ensure are also respected by those third countries with which we have significant trade in agricultural products, we will perhaps be able to begin having a market that is less distorted and could better protect our farmers and the EU's agricultural products."
"(EL) Madam President, sectors of the rural economy are really suffering: wheat, olive oil, fruit and vegetables and cotton."
"You should know that anger is rife among peach producers in Greece."
"I need only tell you that, as we speak, approximately 200 000 tonnes of peach compost have remained unsold."
"The situation in the wheat sector is still critical and the facility for public intervention in the Member States needs to be activated at once."
"We must support protected designation of origin and protected geographical indication products."
"Livestock farming is also facing a huge crisis."
"The dairy sector has been mentioned and we have quite rightly taken an initiative to protect it."
"Livestock farmers in northern Greece have blockaded the Evzona customs post and one of their reasonable demands is for the name of the place of origin to be included on labels for dairy produce."
"In my opinion, including the place of origin protects both producers and consumers."
"We need more measures to promote agricultural products, both within the European Union and outside Europe, in third countries."
"We need to rationalise the markets still further and monitor the transparency of the supply chain in an effective manner and we must reduce any gap between producer and consumer prices."
"As I maintained within the framework of the debate on the 2010 budget, it is especially important to maintain a satisfactory margin of agricultural spending in the budget in order to meet unforeseen requirements in other agricultural sectors."
"(HU) Almost the entire agricultural sector in Europe is in a state of crisis."
"This has been caused not only by the global economic crisis and recession, along with a contraction of domestic and external markets, but also by the common agricultural policy, a neo-liberal policy which the European Commission has continued to pursue in previous years."
"This has made a major contribution to the present crisis."
"If the agricultural sector already has such huge profitability concerns, what will happen if the agriculture budget is slashed after 2013, which many people want to see?"
"This will raise a question mark over food supply security in Europe."
"The current situation is particularly alarming for livestock farmers, pig farmers and producers of fruit and vegetables."
"I welcome that the Commissioner wants to provide more money to the producer organisations, but this is still not sufficient to resolve the sector's concerns."
"Another alarming fact is that the European Union has become a net importer of beef for the last six years."
"We are now at the mercy of external markets."
"Madam President, if you want to know how tough it is for farmers, just take a look at the UK Government's modified low-income threshold."
"This is the level below which a family is deemed to be living in poverty."
"The latest figures in the UK show that one quarter of all British farmers fall into this category."
"But helping farmers is not just about agricultural policy."
"We should be working here in a holistic way."
"Consumers want to buy high-quality food that is produced as close to home as possible."
"The European Parliament must listen to consumers' demands for clear country-of-origin food labelling so that they can be sure where their food comes from."
"We already have country-of-origin labelling on many foods, and there is no reason why mandatory country-of-origin labelling should not be extended to the remaining sectors, including the main ingredients of processed food."
"We have that opportunity coming up in this Parliament early next year."
"Let us make sure we take it."
"(PT) Over the years, and through successive amendments to the common agricultural policy, we have warned about its consequences and tabled alternatives."
"Unfortunately, no one would listen, and today we have ended up in a disastrous situation, as is the case with Portuguese agriculture."
"We warned against the consequences of liberalising international trade in agri-foodstuffs."
"We said that agriculture cannot be treated like some kind of industrial merchandise, and it should be left out of the World Trade Organisation's talks so that it does not become exposed to stock market and financial speculation."
"We have always said that food sovereignty and security should be prioritised and due recognition should be given to those who work the land."
"That is why we have opposed cancelling production aids and ending milk quotas."
"We have always pointed out that agriculture in the southern EU countries has special characteristics that need to be respected if we are to safeguard their production of high-quality foodstuffs, including wine, olive oil, fruit and vegetables, and rice, as well as meat and milk produced under very different conditions from those prevailing in other areas."
"We therefore insist that these policies must be revised to take account of the high prices of production factors, such as diesel, electricity, fertiliser, feed, credit and insurance."
"We need to help farmers by adopting policies that support producers and create jobs in rural areas."
"It is time to prioritise family farming and the countryside - which is becoming more and more deserted - as well as regional produce and native species."
"Our farmers deserve it, because they are the ones who produce what is required to feed us."
"Madam President, it looks as though I have temporarily joined Mrs Harkin's fan club by drawing your attention to the underlying crisis in the livestock feed market with reference to minute traces of GM material that might be found in a 60 000-tonne cargo of soya beans."
"If these traces are not from an EU-authorised variety, the cargo is not allowed to unload."
"The cost to the shipper in such an instance amounts to GBP 2.3 million, but there is also severe disruption down the line with lorries returning empty to feed mills who then have the problem of sourcing alternative protein at very short notice."
"After immense pressure on this subject, the EU Commission has approved four more varieties of GM maize that they regard as a safe contaminant."
"It can take several years for such approval to take place whilst, meanwhile, new GM maize varieties are being adopted by farms in America all the time."
"This problem will resurface again within a year or so."
"At present there are also several GM flax and cotton products which can easily be inadvertently mixed in trace amounts amongst a large cargo of soya, and they will also cause a shipment to be refused."
"It is perverse that, whilst there are small tolerances allowed for stones, soil, dead insects, metal filings and wood chips, there is no tolerance whatsoever for a single wholesome grain of maize."
"The uncertainty that this zero-tolerance policy creates has resulted in steeply increased insurance premiums for shippers that get passed on to the livestock producer - to say nothing of the angst generated when a producer is informed that his feed order cannot be fulfilled."
"This is a most unsatisfactory situation and creates an unnecessary crisis in the production of meat and eggs."
"I urge the Commission to approach this whole issue in a more practical and sensible fashion by bringing in a tolerance level for GM admixture similar to that for other contaminants."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for her analysis, but I would like to stress how, in some productive sectors, there is now a crisis jeopardising agriculture in some areas of our great Europe."
"In particular, the crisis that has been affecting wheat in recent months has now brought prices down to the point where they are too low to cover costs and, in many regions of Europe, there is a reduction in the areas sown for the current year, which should be 30%, especially in remote areas that have limited possibilities in terms of alternative usage."
"On the other hand, with regard to fruit and vegetables, the Commissioner pointed out an aspect that is characteristic of the new common organisation of the market, which leaves producer organisations to deal with the crisis."
"Of course, the resources allocated to this within the framework of operating programmes are limited resources that are by no means adequate to intervene in the event of structural crises that are as widespread as the one we are experiencing."
"They may possibly meet requirements, as you said, either by green harvesting or by destroying a small portion of the harvest in the event of small imbalances between demand and supply in normal years, but certainly not in the case of a widespread crisis such as the one we are experiencing."
"The same could also be said for olive oil and for other sectors, but I believe that at this point, it is important to ask the Commission for a package of proposals, for an exhaustive proposal that covers all the other sectors which, apart from milk, have still not seen specific action to deal with the crisis we are experiencing."
"(ES) Madam President, the agricultural sector has not been immune to the difficulties suffered by the economy in general."
"Months ago, we had the opportunity to debate the situation of dairy producers, but even then, many of us said that the crisis was affecting the other sectors of agriculture."
"The whole sector is in a difficult situation: with low prices at source for the majority of products and many farms whose figures are beginning to fall below the profitability threshold."
"This situation has demonstrated the imbalance that exists between those in the agricultural and food sector value chain."
"The need to make the price-setting system transparent and to restore balance to the negotiating capacity of the parties concerned, within the framework of current legislation, are issues that are still to be resolved."
"Another issue that concerns us in this difficult context is the decline in the competitiveness of our farmers who, unlike their competitors, face high production costs."
"What I am asking is for common support measures to be put together, and for the solutions not to revolve around the capacity of each Member State to respond."
"(DE) Madam President, firstly, I would like to say that I am very grateful that we are debating this item today, because from the media, you might get the impression that the crisis has only been in the dairy sector."
"That was, and is, not the case, and it is therefore extremely important for the farmers affected that we discuss their situation in the European Parliament today."
"The economic crisis has hit farmers hard."
"The last financial year was one of the worst of the decade."
"For many farms, profits have fallen significantly, and therefore the situation is very difficult for many farmers."
"Economic crises expose deficiencies - deficiencies caused by people."
"Crises only become disasters if nothing is done about them."
"It is precisely because economic crises expose human errors that we are able to address those errors."
"In any crisis, there is also an opportunity, and it is of precisely these opportunities that we must make greater use."
"In order to do so, firstly, the Commission must react quicker and more consistently in the event of any disturbances of the economic balance."
"Secondly, we must create the necessary political framework to enable farmers to regulate the market themselves."
"Thirdly, the legal authority of producer organisations must be significantly improved."
"Fourthly, we must significantly improve and simplify the use of agricultural raw materials for the production of renewable energy by way of market regulation."
"Fifthly, rather than merely talking about a reduction in red tape, we must actually address this problem at long last."
"Thus, my appeal, once again, is the following: let us learn from the crisis and utilise the opportunity arising from it - we owe this to ourselves and, above all, to all of our farmers."
"In this regard, I await a catalogue of measures from the Commission at the beginning of 2010 that we can then debate in detail in the committee responsible."
"(PT) Commissioner, I would like to thank you for being here in this Chamber again - that has been a constant throughout your mandate - even though the Commission is in this transitional phase."
"The problems of agriculture have no sympathy for the whims of the political calendar, however, and farmers are expecting us to provide solutions to their problems, difficulties and anxieties."
"As we are all aware, the economic crisis has also affected agriculture - not just the dairy sector, as the media would have us believe, but other sectors as well."
"Milk, fruit and vegetables, cereals and olive oil have been hit hard in recent months, just as meat production had been previously, due to the enormous hikes in production costs that occurred then."
"The situation for fruit and vegetables is likely to get even worse when the market is opened wider still to Moroccan products under the new agreement that is currently being adopted."
"It is a fact, as the Commissioner has pointed out, that the markets have shown positive signs in recent weeks, but we should not get too excited about that because, if the upswing comes, as we all hope it will, it will certainly bring with it an increase in the price of oil and hence an inevitable rise in agricultural production costs."
"Therefore, Commissioner, despite the political calendar, Parliament has to demand that the Commission provide answers to these questions."
"Farmers are waiting for political signals from Parliament and the Commission, and therefore, the timing of this debate that we are having here today makes perfect sense, in the hope that the Commission can give some signals and say what information it has and what measures it proposes in the short term to mitigate these problems."
"Madam President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for coming to listen to us once again, and I want to highlight just a number of issues which have been very prevalent in Northern Ireland within the agricultural industry over the last number of months."
"You may have read, Commissioner, that in County Fermanagh, we have suffered extreme flooding over the last number of weeks."
"This has led to very severe difficulties for farmers, not least, gaining access to stock in the fields, with many roads closed and impassable because of rain."
"It will also affect their ability to spread slurry, and just the general losses that they have."
"I would encourage the Commission to look into this issue and indicate whether there can be direct help for farmers in this sector."
"I would also encourage the Commission to look at the potato industry in Northern Ireland."
"A number of potato farmers have written to me recently because they have been very badly affected by the very high levels of rainfall in recent weeks as well."
"They are expressing extreme concern about their ability to get potatoes out of the ground and, with frost fast approaching with the onset of the winter months, they fear that they will lose their crops."
"So, again, this is an industry - and part of the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland - which is going thorough a very difficult time."
"Just recently, I also met with a number of egg producers, farmers who are currently in the process of changing to the enhanced cages."
"They would like from the Commission a guarantee that they will not be required to change those cages again for a considerable period of time, and again I would encourage the Commission to look into this."
"(IT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the crisis that the agricultural sector is going through is extremely serious and is in danger of becoming irreversible."
"In my region, Apulia, olive production is the main activity and one of the largest sources of income."
"This year, the price of olives has fallen to EUR 30 per 100 kilograms, and the wholesale price of oil to EUR 2.50 per kilogram, and at these prices, producers are operating at a loss."
"Extra virgin olive oil, green gold, which has always been the pride of my land, is in danger of turning into civil and social death."
"There are roadblocks and demonstrations by farmers throughout the region."
"You say that everything is in order and that prices are rising again, but I put to you another situation that I am aware of, because I experience it each day."
"Urgent measures are required and I would ask that, as for milk, a solidarity fund be activated also for olive production and fruit and vegetables."
"With regard to olive production, I would ask for additional urgent measures and, in particular, Commissioner, that Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 on the characteristics of olive oil be amended to include nuclear magnetic resonance imaging as a method of analysis."
"This would allow us to reveal the ongoing fraud perpetuated on supermarket shelves by bottles bearing the wording 'extra virgin oil', which instead contain mixtures of rectified or refined oils."
"(DE) Madam President, Mrs Fischer Boel, thank you very much for your report."
"This is an important signal to our farmers, who are having to live with this strained market situation."
"In your report, you also referred to the fall in demand in the agricultural sector."
"This is precisely why it is important to invigorate this sector and stimulate sales."
"Now, more than ever, the Commission needs to recognise crises at an early stage, irrespective of the branch of production, and quickly and efficiently take steps to counter them."
"I am convinced that such a sensitive sector as food production is in particular need of market instruments."
"The added benefits of agriculture in the form of keeping open our cultural landscapes, care of the countryside, biodiversity and many other things besides are irreplaceable."
"We need to retain all of this and to take it into consideration in our future debates on the new agricultural policy."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your explanation concerning the variations in price for the different types of agricultural produce."
"You reached the conclusion that we had to continue to monitor the situation in order to take action where necessary."
"You did in fact put your finger on volatility - the number one enemy of the modern day farmer - and I would simply like to advocate the need to re-establish and maintain a public policy on pricing and regulation, and the need, certainly in the future, for this public policy on regulation to be established through, for example, a price and margin observatory that would set prices fairly for all those involved in production, be they producers, processing companies or distributors."
"If, today, we let it get to the stage where pricing is being regulated privately, there will always be a mark-up for distributors, a mark-up for processing companies and a loss for producers, and therefore significant problems for local agriculture."
"Finally, Madam President, we cannot ignore the fact, either, that we must also be able to negotiate with the United States - particularly with regard to the price of wheat, which is fixed in Chicago - because we are dealing with a global issue and not just a European one."
"(ES) Madam President, Commissioner, it concerns me that frequently a lack of coordination means that sustainability criteria are not applied to agriculture."
"I would like to ask two questions: firstly, at a time when we are experiencing desertification in southern Europe, which is seriously impacted by climate change, and given that land use is the most important thing, why is money being paid to pull up olive trees and vines?"
"This means that Europe is paying to have more desert!"
"Are you going to stop this?"
"Secondly, the agreement with Morocco: if Europe is conducting a common foreign policy, it must defend the interests of its citizens and of European production."
"Europe is negotiating the agreement with Morocco on its knees, without taking into account the principle of reciprocity, without guaranteeing health and that insecticide and food quality programmes will be maintained."
"How is it possible that this process is not only opening the door to products on top of the quotas, but that it is also putting quality at risk?"
"(HU) It is of paramount importance that we are now talking about the crisis affecting the agricultural sectors as several plans have been leaked on the manner in which agricultural subsidies will be phased out after 2013."
"Let us always think about how severe the consequences have been of the liberal measures implemented just recently."
"Let us learn from these examples so that we do not make the same mistakes again."
"The importance of agriculture will grow significantly in the coming years as the number of people suffering from hunger on our planet continues to rise."
"On the subject of simplifications, unfortunately, farmers feel that every time simplification is mentioned it never actually happens."
"They must comply with increasingly complex systems."
"A succession of new animal welfare measures is being introduced."
"All these increase the costs which their competitors do not have to contend with. In addition, every single new animal welfare measure requires ever-greater energy consumption, which will mean ever-increasing CO2 emissions."
"(DE) Mr President, during the debate on his guidelines, Mr Barroso said that sustainability and the preservation of biodiversity would be priority policy objectives in the European Union in the current legislative term."
"These objectives must therefore be pursued in all policy fields and, of course, in particular in the area of agriculture."
"I would like to urge you emphatically today to promote and support those measures - and only those measures - that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity and to sustainability."
"Mr President, I welcome this debate."
"We cannot do much about many of the problems which have been mentioned, but others we can do an awful lot about."
"Colleagues have mentioned particularly the problem of over-regulation; that is something that many farmers mention throughout the European Union."
"People also mentioned GM foods, and I totally agree with them on that: there is need for action in that area."
"However, one area which I think is also important to us is the area of live exports."
"There is a danger that we are going to put so many regulations in place that it will be cost-prohibitive, particularly for farmers and people exporting cattle from an island nation like Ireland."
"Sometimes I think it would be interesting to compare, for instance, the travel schedule of MEPs coming here to Parliament today with the travel schedule of animals being exported overseas, and I think sometimes the stress levels on MEPs might be greater."
"In that regard we would need to be very careful and not over-regulate and price ourselves out of the market."
"Thank you, Mr Kelly."
"Whereas everyone should be encouraged to speak other languages in this Chamber, let me note that you began your speech by saying 'Merci, Monsieur President'."
"I am assuming you were not asking for my mercy, but were trying to say 'thank you' - not in Greek, I should add, which is 'Ευχαριστώ, κύριε Πρόεδρε'!"
"(ES) Mr President, the situation in the agricultural sector is not only of concern."
"I would call it unsustainable: farmers' incomes are declining and every day there is a greater difference between what farmers receive and the market price for consumers."
"Succession is already a Utopia, and association agreements are repeatedly infringed, as in the shameful case of tomatoes from Morocco, a situation that has been recognised by the European Anti-Fraud Office with no decisive action by the Commission."
"Plant health rules and controls are applied to varying degrees, creating entirely unfair situations."
"If we add to this isolated cases, such as the decrease in duty for the banana sector, which is going to have entirely negative consequences, or the fact that it is impossible for livestock farmers to afford input costs, you will agree with me that the future of the sector is, at the very least, uncertain."
"Moreover, for agriculture in the most remote regions, the future is not only uncertain but extremely worrying."
"Farmers want to continue farming, but it is becoming more difficult for them every day."
"The Commission must accept the importance of agriculture."
"Face up to it boldly!"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed the case that there is currently a crisis in many agricultural sectors."
"There are, no doubt, many reasons for this."
"One of them is probably the liberalisation of agricultural policy in recent years."
"If we remove more and more safety nets from the common agricultural policy, then the price fluctuations will increase."
"This is causing ever greater problems for our farmers."
"Therefore, in the short term, the aim must surely be to find a solution to this crisis."
"Above all, however, in conjunction with the revision of our agricultural policy, we need to consider what we can do about these price fluctuations."
"Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we, as Parliament, have a duty to be active."
"The fact that the agricultural ministers have met in Paris outside of the Council in recent days in order to discuss this issue is surely, in principle, a good thing."
"However, in Parliament, it is our job to demonstrate our new role to our farmers."
"We need to find democratic solutions for our future agricultural policy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I will now try to respond to some of the questions raised, but I think this discussion here clearly shows that there is a common understanding of the difficulties that our agricultural sector is facing."
"First of all, I was a bit astonished to hear that we should have removed the safety net to the agricultural sector."
"That is certainly not the case."
"We actually have a safety net in place in situations where the farmers need support."
"We have a continuous safety net, which is the direct payments."
"That is certainly in place, and that is accountable for the farmers."
"Then we have the different intervention systems, the private storage, the export refunds systems to enter into effect when we find it necessary to trigger these tools."
"On simplification, red tape, bureaucracy - I completely agree with you that we should try to ease the situation as much as possible for our farmers, and that is the reason why, in the Council meeting on Wednesday, I will present to the Council some deregulation proposals to be discussed."
"The Council presented 39 different proposals, and we can actually accept quite a number."
"Others are more political, related to the period after 2013, but I am sure that you would find the proposals extremely interesting."
"Those that have raised the GMO issue, I presume you know that I think completely along the same lines, and I think that it is important to find a solution on a technical figure on the presence of non-approved GMs."
"I expect the next Commission to present such a proposal."
"It is true that the European Union is the biggest importer of agricultural products, but at the same time, the European Union is the biggest exporter of agricultural products."
"This is because of the fact that we have an extremely good brand: European products are considered to be high quality on overseas markets."
"Therefore, the idea that we should now protect our own production would be damaging for our agricultural sector."
"So we need to go on being visible on the export markets, and I think that for the future - and I hope there will be full support from the European Parliament - we need much more money for promoting our high-quality products on the new emerging markets."
"I think we can do much better, but we need a bit of support."
"Then on the issue of the regulatory framework - I did not hear this exact phrase, but I think that is what is behind the comments on this issue."
"Today, it is already possible for farmers to enter into a contract with the industry, with the dairy, for a certain volume at a fixed price."
"It is already possible for farmers to do this."
"And you know in the high level group for the dairy sector we are looking into some voluntary ways of improving this system."
"Biodiversity: I completely agree that this is important, and that was exactly the reason why we included biodiversity in the new challenges when we agreed on the health check of the common agricultural policy in November 2008."
"So this has high priority, and I completely agree with the comments from the honourable Member."
"On the measures: we can actually use all the tools that we have available at the moment."
"But new initiatives cannot be presented by a caretaker Commission."
"I am sure that you are aware of this problem, and therefore I hope that we will be able to see the new Commission in operation as soon as possible."
"Next, I am very happy to see that the European Parliament will now have a role as an important player for the future, thanks to the Lisbon Treaty introducing codecision."
"This is not only codecision on the pure agricultural issues but also on the budget."
"So here, you will have a huge influence on the budgetary possibilities for the agricultural sector for the period after 2013."
"Though I might not experience it from this place, I can guarantee that I will keep an eye on you when you take upon yourselves the new responsibilities for the agricultural sector."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The economic and financial crisis has also dragged us into a farming and social crisis, and I therefore welcome this debate in Parliament, although it has come rather late."
"Producers (of cereals, pork, olive oil, fruit, vegetables, etc.) are experiencing extremely difficult conditions at the moment due to the slump in demand, and they are getting very low prices for their products compared with their production costs."
"There are also difficulties in obtaining credit."
"These problems are seriously affecting their income."
"Price volatility in agriculture is a highly complex issue that affects planning and the predictability that farmers need, with serious impacts on profitability and investment levels."
"It is therefore essential to guarantee conditions for the sustainability of holdings as well as a degree of price stability, so that producers can safeguard their livelihoods by improving product quality, which will have a positive impact on the whole chain from producer to consumer."
"Prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference (debate)"
"The next item is the oral question to the Commission (B7-0232/2009) by Mr Moreira, on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, on prospects for the Doha Development Agenda following the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference."
"A few weeks ago, I had the honour of leading a delegation from this Parliament's Committee on International Trade, which attended the Seventh Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in Geneva."
"Although the Doha Round - that is, the Doha Development Agenda - was not on the official agenda for this ministerial conference, the fact is that a large majority of the official delegations from the WTO member countries took the opportunity to announce their positions on the subject and state that they wanted to conclude the Doha Round by the end of 2010."
"It is public knowledge, however, that no progress has been made recently in the negotiations."
"That is why I have the honour of asking the Commission the following questions on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, which I chair:"
"Firstly, can the Commission provide an assessment of the 'state of play' in the main negotiating areas of the Doha Round, especially in agriculture, NAMA (non-agricultural market access) and services?"
"What were the main achievements of the Commission at the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference?"
"Which, in her opinion, are the issues that remain under discussion, and which are the most difficult subjects in the negotiations?"
"Secondly, what impact will the WTO Ministerial Conference have on the ongoing Doha Round negotiations?"
"How will the Commission ensure that the core negotiations are focused on development?"
"Can the Commission provide an evaluation of the likelihood of a successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round by the end of next year?"
"For my third and final question, how does the Commission intend to include the members of the European Parliament delegation in the ongoing Doha Round negotiations and in the WTO structure?"
"Having put the question on behalf of the Committee on International Trade, I should like to end by emphasising that this parliamentary committee attaches great importance to shouldering the new responsibilities and making use of the new powers granted to it under the Treaty of Lisbon, and it would also like to establish closer and more fruitful cooperation with the Commission in the area of international trade."
"That, of course, in return requires the Commission to be willing to cooperate with Parliament, starting with its reply to the questions we have put to it."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Seventh WTO Ministerial Conference in Geneva was an important opportunity to exchange views with all WTO members on their priorities for the organisation."
"I think it is important to underline that this Seventh Ministerial Conference was not a negotiating conference: it was more a discussion on various topics."
"Our priority list, of course, begins with the Doha Development Agenda."
"If it can be completed, Doha will deliver a good outcome not only for Europe, but also for the whole world economy."
"All of us will suffer if protectionism increases, just as all of us will gain if the economy picks up."
"Doha is the best trade policy instrument available on both those fronts."
"Doha would also deliver the development that so many of the poorest countries in the world are looking for."
"It would do that through new rules on market access, farm reform and customs facilitation in particular."
"In all areas of the Doha negotiations, the development element for the countries concerned has already been taken into account."
"But, of course, we can conclude the Doha Round only if all WTO members are on board. The reality is that the United States has serious concerns and constraints which it is discussing with the large emerging economies."
"In a few months we will see how these discussions are evolving as the deadline for the G20 to conclude the Doha Round in 2010 comes closer."
"I think we all agree that, if we want a conclusion of the Doha Round before the end of 2010, we have to see modalities in place on agricultural and non-agricultural market access (NAMA) before the end of March 2010."
"That is the ultimate deadline."
"Meanwhile, we will continue to push so that the interests of the European Union in areas such as trade and services, and protection of geographical indications, are covered."
"Apart from Doha, the Ministerial Conference addressed some important issues for WTO members."
"Our priorities included the need to strengthen the role of the WTO in monitoring and analysing protectionism; WTO accession - such as, for instance, the accessions of least-developed countries into the WTO, which we certainly think must be promoted; the rising number of regional free-trade agreements - here, we need to ensure that these actually complement the multilateral trade system; and finally, there is the contribution of trade policy to the fight against climate change."
"On many of these issues, WTO members agreed that the organisation can and should work."
"So I expect this to go forward."
"On your last question, of course we will keep Parliament closely informed on these developments, in particular, on the Doha Round."
"The Lisbon Treaty actually offers an excellent opportunity to take our collaboration with Parliament a step further, and this will be a key priority for the Commission's trade policy in the years ahead."
"Mr President, we support the multilateral trade system and the World Trade Organisation as the guardian of a rules-based trading system and of a system which guarantees more effective management of globalisation and fairer distribution of its benefits."
"It is precisely the WTO acquis which, during the current economic crisis, did a great deal to prevent its members from taking recourse to restrictive trade measures, at the same time leaving sufficient margin for manoeuvre in the aim of economic recovery."
"As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), we support the integration of the Doha Development Agenda on the basis of an integrated, ambitious and balanced outcome to negotiations."
"We urge the Commission to maintain a firm negotiating position designed to really strengthen access for European goods and services to the markets of both developed and emerging economies."
"As far as agriculture is concerned, I call on the Commission - and I should like you to note this down, Mrs Boel - to adhere strictly to the negotiating mandate received from the Council, which also makes the limits on its negotiating position subject to equal concessions by our trading partners."
"I would emphasise the need for our position on geographical indications to be stoutly defended."
"The outcome of the Doha Development Agenda needs to safeguard more effective integration of developing countries, especially less developed countries, into the global trading system."
"Finally, we are calling for work between the World Trade Organisation and other international organisations to be strengthened, so as to safeguard mutual support and cohesion between trade and non-trade aspects, such as environmental sustainability, food sufficiency and security and decent working conditions."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha talks were opened in 2001 to correct the imbalances, in fact the injustices, of the international trade system that was introduced following the Uruguay Round, when the WTO was created."
"It was thus acknowledged that the Uruguay Round had not kept all the promises it had made concerning developing countries, and that the countries of the South were at an unfair disadvantage where trade rules were concerned, particularly in the field of agriculture, because these trade rules allow the richest countries both to protect their market and to continue to fund their production, including that intended for export, bankrupting many farmers of the South in the process."
"Cotton has come to symbolise this situation."
"In opening the 'development round', the WTO members have therefore committed themselves to amending multilateral trade rules in order to ensure that trade really does benefit economic and social development in every country, on every continent."
"Thus we should always remember that this round of negotiations is not a round like any other, and that, even if, as in all negotiations, everyone is waiting for progress to be made on the issues that concern them - for industrialised countries, that means industrial products and services - it was agreed, from the outset, that this round was, first and foremost, about restoring the balance in favour of developing countries."
"Today, in the wake of the Seventh Ministerial Conference, as before it, negotiations have essentially stalled on the slopes of Capitol Hill in Washington, just as they sank, in the past, in the sands of Cancún, and, back then, this was largely due to the demands made by the European Union."
"Having demanded too much during the negotiations, industrialised countries have thus jeopardised the final outcome of the round of negotiations and the credibility even of the WTO."
"Everyone is focusing solely on personal goals instead of on the overall goal, which is to create a multilateral trade framework that is based on fairer rules to encourage fairer trade, and which promotes sustainable development and the eradication of poverty."
"The first outcome of this stalemate is the increase in bilateral trade agreements, which are often even more unfavourable to the countries of the South."
"This is a step backwards."
"The European Union must therefore adopt a clear position."
"The priority is to conclude this round as a development round and not to try to outdo one another where industrial products and services are concerned."
"These negotiations must not be approached in a conventional and narrow-minded manner, where everyone is simply out for themselves."
"This leads to a deadlock and makes one lose sight of the main issue: the need to create a new way of regulating the international trade system that will form part of the new global governance that everyone has called for, particularly since the G20, in order to address the real challenges of today, which are fair development on all continents, the eradication of poverty, food security, respect for social rights and decent work, and the fight against climate change."
"During these negotiations, the European Union must show what it is doing to ensure that trade rules will help improve this situation in the future."
"It is on this basis that each of the following points of discussion must be considered:"
"on agriculture: honouring the July 2008 commitments; concluding the negotiations on procedures; guaranteeing, in particular, special and differential treatment, respect for special products, and safeguard mechanisms; developing agricultural support in accordance with sustainable agriculture and food security;"
"on NAMA products: asking developing countries for tariff reductions - I am finishing here - that are in line with their level of development;"
"and"
"on services: protecting the right of every country to continue to regulate its public services."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, two weeks ago, the Seventh Session of the World Trade Organisation Ministerial Conference was held in Geneva."
"I had the opportunity, as the representative of the delegation of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, to attend the conference and, as co-author, to contribute to the present joint motion for a resolution."
"There are four lessons that can and need to be learned from these experiences."
"The economic and financial crisis also brought a sharp fall in world trade."
"A speedy conclusion to the negotiations in the Doha Round is therefore crucial in order to give new impetus to the world economy."
"The revival of fair and free world trade is something that Doha can, and indeed must, achieve."
"The European Union has gone a long way to accommodate its partners, in particular those in the developing countries."
"For example, we have promised to abolish all export subsidies for agricultural products."
"Now we need to bring the negotiations to a conclusion."
"For this to happen, we need a signal of political will."
"In the ALDE Group, we are determined to achieve a conclusion to Doha."
"Now!"
"It is therefore vital to join forces in order to bring the Round to a conclusion."
"The European Union can and must play a leading role in this."
"We should also take on a bridging role, for example, to bring together the United States and the emerging economies and developing countries, just as we call for in our joint resolution."
"We must now also raise the public's awareness."
"We need broader support from the citizens."
"We should emphasise the advantages of global trade, as free and fair world trade is good for all of us."
"I do not see any alternative to Doha."
"The alternative would be competition for bilateral agreements, which would put access for the weaker countries and the inclusion of human rights and environmental aims at risk."
"That must not happen."
"We therefore need a conclusion to the Doha Round now."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Doha Round has been dragging on for eight years now and the vast majority of developing countries did not actually want this Doha Round in the first place."
"At the beginning, it was the US and Europe who wanted to force the consent of the developing countries by the use of the concept of 'development'."
"In the meantime, however, the negotiations have failed twice."
"Only the large agricultural exporters, Brazil and Argentina, and perhaps India, are really interested in something actually happening here."
"The EU, too, has also de facto taken a step back if we look at the EU's routine demands over the last few years and also at what is now on the table for the next few years."
"However, we really need to take an objective look at what has come out of the last few years, other than a twenty year liberalisation policy."
"This liberalisation policy is partly responsible for the economic and financial crisis that we are experiencing."
"We cannot behave as if we can carry on in the same way."
"I do not want to mention the consequences for the world climate if we carry on as before and have no proper rules."
"We have now had a conference in Geneva, where, in the midst of the crisis, everyone claimed that we have to carry on as before and we can simply wait until the crisis is over and then continue where we left off."
"It is claimed again and again that the Doha Round will give new impetus to the economic recovery."
"However, all of the figures point to this not being the case, and besides, the implementation times and periods will be much too long."
"Another recurring claim is that the developing countries will then be able to share in the recovery."
"However, if we take stock in an objective way, we have to say that it will not bring about recovery for the majority of developing countries, but rather the opposite."
"Instead, the net effect for most of the developing countries will be negative."
"We cannot therefore recommend to many of the developing countries that they cooperate with us in the middle of the crisis."
"Even if none of the members of the World Trade Organisation or any of the large political groups in the European Parliament dare to say so, we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will say it: we call for an end, finally, to the Doha Round, which has been stuck down a blind alley for years and is completely inappropriate at this present time."
"We believe that the WTO needs to work on a reform and that, in its present form, it is unable to help in resolving the global crisis."
"In future, we need fair trade, not merely trade that is, in principle, free."
"Looking at the agricultural sector over the last twenty years, what has this permanent liberalisation actually brought?"
"It has resulted in an enormous pressure for rationalisation in the industrialised states."
"Processes have been industrialised, and the developing countries have essentially got nothing out of it except destabilised markets."
"Instead of giving the principle of food sovereignty its rightful status in the discussions, we have instead given absolute priority to the principle of total free trade."
"For this reason, the resolution of the Greens calls for no further political capital to be invested in the dead Doha Round."
"We call for a new start to the process."
"Mr President, Commissioner, we are, of course, in a period of economic recession or crisis and it is unpleasant, but such crises come and go, they are a cyclical component of the market economy and they must not be used as an excuse for introducing excessive regulations restraining the economy, as such regulations will remain even after the crisis itself has ended, and this also concerns international trade."
"The European Union must therefore avoid succumbing to the lure of protectionism in commercial relations, as we would damage not only ourselves through this, but especially those whom we seek to assist, in other words, especially the least developed countries, whose full integration into the global commercial system we must promote."
"On behalf of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, I would like to applaud the approach of the European People's Party Group and the ALDE Group, who have drafted together with us a balanced draft resolution on the development agenda from Doha following the seventh conference of the World Trade Organisation."
"Progress in international trade must serve this development agenda and if the US has problems with that, then the EU must take a leading role in the successful completion of the Doha Round and also in mediating the full participation of these least developed countries in world trade."
"European integration began with free trade."
"The EU or the European Community began as a trading zone and the European Commission - in both its current and future line-ups - will be aware, I hope, of where the roots of European integration lie and will return to them."
"We should continue to mediate the full participation of these least developed countries in world trade and also the signing of further bilateral and regional free trade agreements as a supplement to the multilateral framework."
"Mr President, Commissioner, the questions raised by the committee chair in this debate reflect global circumstances."
"The balance of our global economic order is disastrous."
"Two billion people live in extreme poverty."
"Climate change has already forced more than 40 million people to flee their homes and the proliferation of global financial trading has led to the worst economic crisis in 80 years."
"Mr Zahradil, we have here an historic task to initiate a completely new regulation of the global economy, guided by the aims of sustainability, environmental protection, social justice and food security."
"Looking at Geneva, I can only say that the World Trade Organisation conference has failed in this task."
"Despite all assurances, the opportunity that a gathering of the states might bring was lost."
"The Doha mediators are clearly still operating within the framework of a completely out-of-date and - I think we should be honest here - failed negotiation mandate."
"In the opinion of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, this needs to change as a matter of urgency, because the failure of Geneva and of Rome and the complicated negotiations now in Copenhagen are directly linked."
"I therefore call on the Commission to work directly with the European Parliament in formulating a redefined negotiation mandate to further develop and transform the WTO."
"This must include the importance of the world trade architecture in the creation of the world crises, and potentially also in combating them, whilst also addressing the necessary re-regulation of trade relations."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - (NL) Mr President, the impasse on the Doha Round inevitably cast a dark shadow over the WTO Summit at the start of this month."
"At a time of economic crisis, with an equally bleak outlook for 2010, the successful conclusion of the Doha Round is a top political priority."
"The estimates regarding substantial revenues in terms of commercial turnover and increases in prosperity give me reason to hope for the actual fulfilment of the Geneva commitments to make 2010 a breakthrough year for the Doha Round."
"As a Dutchman, I am very curious to hear the Commissioner's opinion on two proposals put forward by my government at the WTO Summit."
"How do you view the formation of a group of 'green forerunners' within the WTO, consisting of countries wanting to eliminate trade tariffs for sustainable products in order to promote their use?"
"Also, Commissioner, do you share the opinion of the Dutch representative that the growth of the WTO negotiating system has not kept pace with globalisation?"
"Might you work towards a solution?"
"(FR) Mr President, despite the obvious failure of trade liberalisation over the past 30 years, which has led to the wholesale deindustrialisation of developed countries and the impoverishment of underdeveloped countries, despite the financial and banking crisis, and now the Member States' debt crisis, which all independent economists agree was caused by financial and commercial globalisation, the Director-General of the WTO, Mr Lamy, still wants to speed up the process of full international trade liberalisation."
"All the statistics available to us show that globalisation has led to mass unemployment and salary cuts, which will end only when European salaries are brought into line with those in China or India."
"Is this the economic development model that Europe should be proposing to Europeans?"
"There is another model: the legitimate protection of European economies against unfair competition from low-wage countries."
"This protectionism must go hand in hand with the creation of a new international monetary system that guarantees fair trade."
"It is unacceptable, because it is illogical, to separate trade negotiations from monetary negotiations."
"Mr Lamy and all those in favour of uncontrolled free trade are not defending the common good but rather the interests of the financial and commercial institutions that pay them."
"If the European institutions continue in this direction, the crisis of legitimacy affecting the WTO and the IMF today will inevitably affect them tomorrow."
"If this is your objective - to destroy European industry and agriculture and to transform our continent into an underdeveloped economic area - then do as Mr Lamy says."
"If, on the contrary, you want to save Europe, then relocate Mr Lamy, as Maurice Allais, the French Nobel Prize winner for Economics, is insisting."
"This is the only relocation that Europe could welcome."
"(HU) The European Union's trade deficit has increased alarmingly three and a half fold in the last five years."
"A trade deficit increase of this magnitude is unsustainable."
"The EU's trade with China is responsible for half of this trade deficit increase."
"It has decreased significantly as a result of the global economic crisis, but half of the remaining deficit, and in fact, the entire trade deficit recorded for the first half of 2009 is equivalent to our current trade deficit with China."
"I recently read a book by an American author which describes the following scenario."
"Fish caught off Europe's shores is frozen and then shipped to China."
"Over there it is thawed, filleted, frozen again and shipped back to Europe."
"This is done because wages are so much cheaper in China that it is worth the huge energy consumption to freeze, ship, freeze and ship back the fish to Europe."
"Every single job lost in Europe is responsible for an increase in CO2 emissions of many hundreds of kilos."
"The current trade system encourages the growth of CO2 emissions."
"Rising European unemployment means greater CO2 emissions."
"Since the signing of the Kyoto Protocol, China has trebled its CO2 emissions because there are no sanctions linked to this."
"The new WTO regulations are only acceptable if they also integrate climate protection aspects."
"If we want these regulations to prevent the rise in CO2 emissions, instead of encouraging them, sanctions are required."
"(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the aim of the Doha Round was clear."
"It was supposed to be a round to promote development, a round allowing developing countries to correct the imbalances created by the liberal policies implemented to date within the framework of the notorious Washington Consensus."
"It is not surprising - although I deplore the fact - that during this crisis period, positions favouring equitable trade are on the retreat."
"In the face of the United States, which will not move until the health reform has been passed, and in the context of growing opposition from trade unions and the main industrial lobby groups, Europe is not managing to shift the boundaries, and it is therefore unlikely that an agreement will be reached soon."
"The majority within this Parliament is therefore taking advantage of the fact to return to its ideology, that of aggressive trade, based solely on the interests of gaining greater market access."
"Blame the crisis."
"In acting in this way, in seeking, above all, the opening up of the markets and the removal of all barriers to trade, those on the right wing are, in addition, completely forgetting that it is in our interests to have strong trade partners that are fully integrated into the system of world trade."
"The reality is that no developing country could end up strengthened by such an agreement."
"Together with Mr Désir, our group's rapporteur on this resolution, we have tabled several amendments to the joint compromise text produced by the right-wing European political parties."
"Of course, I would like to see my own group's resolution adopted, but this will not happen."
"That is why our amendments make several points."
"Firstly, it is absolutely vital that public services remain outside the framework of the negotiations, because they relate to people's fundamental needs and cannot be left to the markets."
"Next, special treatment should be given to products which are sensitive for developing countries, particularly in the agricultural sphere."
"The food crisis has been swept out of people's minds by the arrival of the financial and economic crisis."
"Let us not forget that food sovereignty should be our absolute priority, the first of the Millennium Development Goals."
"Finally, we believe that the public intervention area in developing countries should be maintained, not only by ruling out any liberalisation of public contracts, but also by protecting new industries."
"These few points, which are not an exhaustive list, are the absolute minimum in order to ensure that the Doha Round will truly promote development."
"If they do not appear in the final text, I will call upon my group to vote against it."
"(Applause)"
"(IT) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to point out that several months ago, outside a meeting of the World Trade Organisation steering committee, of which I am a member, a colleague from Namibia expressed his disappointment that the prices of certain European agricultural and non-agricultural products in Namibia are lower in comparison with local products."
"This is one of many market distortions for which Doha must provide a solution."
"In this regard, we, as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, tabled an amendment that calls - not only with reference to Europe, of course, we are very much addressing the United States as well, as the Commissioner is well aware - for all forms of export subsidies to be completely abolished, and in short order."
"Secondly, on the issue of services, among the many things to be said, I would point out that a clear distinction needs to be made between services and public services."
"We need to fight and make a commitment in the context of Doha in order to attain liberalisation of services, which often means taking on veritable national oligarchies that stifle development of local economies."
"These national oligarchies exist in the communications sector, the banking sector, the insurance sector and others."
"We must really try to draw a distinction here from everything that instead concerns public services which, of course, must be the responsibility of the national state."
"Thirdly, a point that has not yet been raised: we are now in the era of the Treaty of Lisbon and so I call on the Commission here, just as our compromise resolution does, to review the interinstitutional agreement."
"We must come to a wholly new modus vivendi in relations between Parliament and the Commission so that Parliament is kept fully abreast of any negotiations and of the various stages of negotiations, so that Parliament can adopt recommendations during negotiations, and so that Parliament can play a full and responsible participating role as is the case, moreover, in other, though similar, negotiations with EU accession countries."
"(FR) Mr President, on 5 December, Maurice Allais, the economist and Nobel prizewinner, said that the true origin of the crisis lay with the World Trade Organisation and that reform was required as a matter of urgency, his analysis being that current mass unemployment was due to the wholesale liberalisation of trade - a liberalisation which benefits only the rich."
"Deaf to the suffering of the people, the WTO, the G20 and the Commission persist, just to please international finance and the large capitalist multinationals, in wanting to complete the Doha Round at any price and in declaring an absurd war on protectionism."
"In order to achieve this, they do not hesitate to falsify economic history, by ascribing the crisis of 1929 and the Second World War to protectionism."
"They take disgraceful cynicism to the furthest degree, claiming to be doing this in the interests of the poorest countries."
"As Maurice Allais and clear-headed economists show, the total liberalisation of trade causes competition that pits everyone against everyone else as well as relocations, giving rise to pay restrictions, mass unemployment, and thus a crisis in our economies."
"If we do not react, universal free trade will end up ruining our civilisation much more quickly than global warming."
"It is urgent and essential for us to embark on a path of moderate protectionism, which is reasonable, socially just and equitable, representing a mutually advantageous cooperation for different peoples and continents."
"(DE) Mr President, we need a revolution in democracy."
"I recall very clearly that the debates that we are hearing today started ten years ago in this House."
"I would appeal to you, Commissioner, to take particular account of what Mr Désir has said, but also of what the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and some of the Members on the left have said."
"Do you not see that, with the approach with which the European Union has entered the negotiations, we cannot, as honest brokers, overcome the imbalance in relation to what we are currently seeing in Copenhagen, and that in reality, we need a new approach?"
"In much of what they are doing today, the developing countries are no longer developing countries."
"They are emerging economies, industrialised countries and very self-aware."
"If we, in Europe, do not succeed in daring to start anew with fair requirements, then we will end up exactly where we do not want to be, namely with protectionism and with a repeat of 1933 and subsequent years in Europe."
"(RO) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I do no want to get into an argument with some of my fellow Members who have spoken before me, but I believe that the role of the World Trade Organisation has become all the more important as the current complexities affecting the economic environment require a multilateral institution to oversee commercial practices."
"The World Trade Organisation will continue, via the Doha Development Agenda, to improve conditions for global trade and investment by applying clearer rules."
"Given the important role played by the Doha Development Agenda in economic growth and in the reduction of unemployment and poverty, I believe that the Agenda must be concluded during 2010 and the development criterion maintained as its central pillar."
"The Agenda can then become a solid framework for coordinating the activities of numerous economic players, helping us to emerge from recession and undertake economic reconstruction."
"Finally, I would like to recommend that the European Commission provide the European Parliament with regular updates about the relevant stage in the negotiations on the Doha Development Agenda."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner, in particular, for very clearly laying the European Union's ideas on the table in the negotiations in Geneva, because, for us, the Doha Round is about providing a new framework for the global economy, which is undergoing this crisis."
"I do not think that it is particularly easy for 153 States to agree on a common solution, but for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular - and these form the backbone of the European economy - trade facilitation, of course, is one of the most important points that we need to get across if we want to enable worldwide economic growth of 2-3% in future, too, in order to be able to secure employment not only here in Europe but also in the many poor countries of this world."
"It is therefore also important for us to protect the products that we produce, particularly in agriculture, by means of designations of origin, so that the added value can also be duly exploited locally."
"(FR) Mr President, first of all, I would like to report an alarming fact and propose what might be a remedy for it."
"Firstly, the alarming fact that I have found out is that the WTO is in the process of lamentably failing to attain the goal for which it was created and established, that of reducing poverty - in the poorest countries - as has been pointed out on several occasions here."
"Now, today, a billion people are suffering from malnutrition, of whom 700 million are, paradoxically, farmers."
"The remedy, from the agricultural point of view, is that we must without doubt put a stop to monoculture intended for exportation, particularly in the continent of Africa, and give priority to subsistence agriculture in these countries instead of prioritising international trade."
"Either we go on in the same way and the continent of Africa will continue to go under, or we radically change direction and can start to breathe, particularly in Africa, and, I say again, this will be through subsistence agriculture, which must take priority over international trade."
"(PT) It is time to change priorities in international trade and to reject free trade on the grounds of the negative contribution it has made to the financial, economic, food and social crisis that people are now experiencing, with growing unemployment and poverty."
"Free trade only serves the interests of the richest countries and the main economic and financial groups."
"A profound change is needed in the negotiations to prioritise development and social advancement, the creation of jobs with rights, and the fight against hunger and poverty."
"That means abolishing tax havens, investing in food sovereignty and security, supporting quality public services and respecting the right of governments to preserve their own economies and public services, particularly in the areas of health, education, water, culture, communications and energy."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to refer to what one of the honourable Members said - that the European Union should be the honest broker in these negotiations."
"I do not disagree but I do not want the European Union to be the only banker in this round."
"There is a broad recognition that the European Union has played a crucial role in keeping the train on track."
"The reason for this is that in previous rounds, we have been very vulnerable because of our agricultural sector, and this has not been the case in these negotiations."
"We have put a strong offer on the table and this has meant that we are now in a very favourable situation."
"But I have to say as well - not only here, but I have said it elsewhere, including in the negotiations in Geneva - that the European Union is not going to give any further concessions in agriculture."
"We have stretched to the ultimate limit of what we can do and this actually has been recognised."
"The Doha Development Round was certainly meant to be a development round."
"I think that the negotiating text on the table today shows that, if we conclude this round, it would indeed deliver on development."
"For instance, the market-opening obligations for developing countries will not be the same as for the developed countries, and the poorest countries - the least-developed countries - will not have to open their markets at all."
"The European Union has supported this flexible approach."
"Today, the European Union is the only industrialised bloc that has completely opened its markets for the least developed countries with duty-free, quota-free access in all areas."
"No other industrialised countries have done as much as we have, but these blocs will be forced to do the same as we have if we can conclude this round."
"Regarding whether the agreement is good enough; I think that being able to get consensus between more than 150 different countries with totally different approaches probably will mean that you would never get the best of all worlds."
"But I think that the offers on the table from the European Union are strong and will certainly result in benefits to global trade."
"Finally, can I just reiterate the willingness and openness of the Commission regarding the new role that Parliament will play in the future on cooperation and transparency within the discussions that we will certainly be having on trade issues for the future."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, trade can be the basis for lasting and fair development."
"We will not eliminate poverty and hunger from the world without the help of the market."
"Those who think differently sentence the poor to the perpetual use of aid, perpetual dependence and perpetual uncertainty as to the future."
"Only building a true market economy can pull poor countries and their residents out of the trap of contemporary dependence."
"Globalisation can be a blessing, and not a curse."
"Suspension of negotiations in the Doha Development Round of the World Trade Organisation has done most harm to developing countries."
"This is all the more distressing because it has happened at a time of food, fuel and economic crisis."
"We should do everything possible to restore trust in the multilateral system of trade."
"If a solution to this problem is not found, the poor, the excluded and the threatened will be left where they are. Thank you very much."
"Concluding the Doha Round remains a problem, and the Seventh Ministerial Conference held in Geneva at the beginning of December did not create the conditions by which to strengthen the multilateral framework of international trade."
"The fact is, the WTO's work is crucial to the global economic recovery."
"The post-crisis world, which will be a world of interdependencies, will thus have to protect itself from economic nationalism and excessive protectionism by focusing on the regulation and preservation of a fair trade environment."
"Now more than ever, we must remember that our objective is the ambitious and balanced conclusion of the Doha Round."
"Through its constructive proposals on the agricultural component (numerous concessions and a thorough reform of the CAP), the European Union can be considered to have made a vital contribution that moves it closer towards an agreement."
"Therefore, these numerous concessions must now be matched by progress in relation to Non-Agricultural Market Access (NAMA) and services."
"The WTO is an international body that can help to combat inequalities and to strengthen the trade capacities of developing countries."
"Nevertheless, it must be able to be reformed and to take account of the interactions between trade and sustainable development."
"Mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Sweden-Volvo;"
"The next item is the report by Reimer Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund: Sweden - Volvo;"
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are, in fact, once again debating a proposal for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"The periods between these reports are getting shorter and shorter."
"This time it relates to applications from Sweden and Austria in connection with redundancies in the automotive sector and from the Netherlands in connection with redundancies in the construction sector."
"I would like to remind you once again that the purpose of this fund, with an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million, is solely to help workers who suffer the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to support them exclusively through further education and training and the opportunity to get appropriate work once again."
"For us, it is once again important in this connection to emphasise on a general note that, in future, only single proposals or single reports should be submitted rather than multiple applications for the mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund as in this case, which will hopefully be the last time this happens."
"We would like to point out, once again, that the assistance provided by the Globalisation Adjustment Fund should not replace measures which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, or measures for restructuring companies or sectors."
"For us, there still remains one point of criticism - and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will certainly not let up in this - and that is that payment appropriations are clearly being systematically transferred from the European Social Fund, but the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is ultimately a separate and specific instrument with its own objectives and deadlines."
"The total amount in question for these three applications that we are talking about today and on which we must take a decision this week is EUR 15.9 million."
"In this regard, the Swedish and Dutch applications are based on Article 2(a) of the legal basis, namely at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in an enterprise in a Member State."
"The Austrian application is based on Article 2(b), namely at least 500 redundancies over a period of nine months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises."
"As I said, the Swedish application relates to a total of 4 687 redundancies at the car manufacturer Volvo and 23 of its suppliers and downstream producers."
"Sweden has applied for EUR 9.8 million from the Fund for this."
"The Austrian application concerns 744 redundancies in nine enterprises, of which 400 are targeted for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"For this purpose, Austria has applied for EUR 5.7 million."
"The present Dutch application relates to 570 redundancies in one enterprise, Heijmans N.V., of which 435 are targeted for assistance with a total sum of around EUR 386 000."
"In accordance with the Commission's assessment, which, after thorough examination, we are also able to support, the applications fulfil the eligibility criteria set."
"Without wanting to pre-empt my colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would like to point out that this committee, as has also been agreed in the procedure here, will issue an opinion prior to the decision by the Committee on Budgets and it will also look at the details very closely."
"For example, it has pointed out that, in the Swedish case, of the 4 687 redundancies mentioned, only 1 500 are targeted to receive the assistance."
"In the case of Heijmans, for example, it can be established that a further 400 redundancies have occurred, mainly involving workers with fixed-term contracts, which are not included in the application."
"In this regard, there are always individual questions that quite rightly need to be asked here, but which nevertheless should not prevent us from giving the green light in general for the authorisation of the funds that have been applied for."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I would like to thank the rapporteur for supporting the proposal put forward by the Commission aimed at releasing resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in response to layoffs in the automobile sector in Sweden and Austria and the construction sector in the Netherlands."
"Mr Böge, your support was accompanied by several comments, in particular, two points of a budgetary nature which I have already had an opportunity to discuss in the previous debate and which I would like to return to today."
"The first budgetary point you raise relates to funding sources."
"You tell us that the European Social Fund cannot be the only source of funding."
"The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is, from a budgetary perspective, a special instrument which does not have its own resources."
"Resources must be transferred before they can be released which firstly means identifying budget items that offer suitable opportunities and secondly, proposing to the budgetary authority that the sums identified in this way be released via a budget amendment."
"This activity is performed on a case-by-case basis, according to need."
"It is true that the European Social Fund has been the main source of funding so far."
"This is not merely a result of the similar nature of this fund."
"It is largely down to the fact that the fund has significant resources at its disposal."
"In 2009, the European Social Fund has almost EUR 11 billion available in resources for payments."
"By the end of November, EUR 6 billion of this overall amount had been used."
"The total volume of payments to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund represents EUR 53 million in 2009, i.e. 0.5% of the allocated budgetary resources of the European Social Fund."
"Up until now, the method we have chosen and which was, from a certain viewpoint, logical and easier than other methods, did not delay or put at risk fulfilment of the objectives of the European Social Fund."
"Nevertheless, however, I agree that it is necessary to diversify the sources of payments and I can assure you that the Commission is addressing this issue."
"I hope therefore that we will be able to present a number of possible scenarios to you next time."
"The second point you raise is not exclusively budget-related, but relates rather to decision making, since you ask that in future, the Commission submit its proposals for releasing resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in individual documents."
"The Commission is aware of the advantages of this case-by-case approach, which would completely eliminate the risk of secret agreements or guarantees, for example."
"It is true that the method originally used was an entirely normal approach which, to a certain extent, facilitated administrative handling of the problems, but in my opinion, the pragmatic and political fundamentals speak very strongly in favour of a case-by-case approach and the Commission will use this method from now on."
"Mr President, unusual times call for unusual measures."
"With its Globalisation Adjustment Fund, a very special bespoke instrument, Europe is matching its words with deeds."
"The mass redundancy of more than 700 regular workers at Dutch construction company Heijmans N.V. - not to mention the numbers abroad, for example in Belgium and the United Kingdom - calls for targeted action."
"The construction sector occupies an important place in the Brabant region, which is also my home region, and the effects of this kind of mass redundancy are palpable far beyond the region itself."
"Europe's action is rightly aimed at preserving expertise and skills."
"The crisis has meant people now losing their jobs even though experience has taught us that there is a great shortage of skilled professionals, particularly in construction."
"A mobility centre, along with the preservation of expertise and also of jobs where possible, is a good choice of instrument for Heijmans, therefore."
"The Dutch ministries and also the regional authorities, for example, those in the province of North Brabant, are now working to accelerate highly targeted investment in projects, infrastructure and construction."
"We are seeking thus to show the people losing their jobs that we are providing active input, including in financial terms."
"I would again point out - this week in particular, against the backdrop of Copenhagen - that we are in particularly urgent need of energy supplies and energy measures in the fields of construction and also of transport."
"We have amended the rules in Parliament in other fields - I would draw your attention in this connection to the accelerated disbursements and advances from regional funds - and so an active contribution by Parliament must be supported."
"A company such as Heijmans, which always focuses on continuity and quality, would also profit from this."
"It is in that spirit that we give these three proposals, particularly the one concerning Heijmans, our wholehearted support."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, applications of this fund are becoming more and more frequent."
"The main reason for this is the economic crisis that our continent is experiencing."
"The crisis affects fundamental sectors of European industry, as shown by these three latest requests in the automotive and construction fields, which have received a favourable response."
"I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that, without the latest revision to the regulation governing the fund, during which the economic crisis was added to the eligibility criteria, many of the requests currently reaching us could not, legally speaking, have been given a favourable response."
"This shows that, in the face of the crisis, within this institution of the European Parliament, when political goodwill is present, high-quality political instruments are made available to our fellow citizens."
"Political goodwill can still do its work, since, on reading the report by Mr Böge, I find that the essential points for improving the fund's operation are there: speeding up the handling of requests in order to be responsive in the face of the crisis, ceasing to present requests jointly, and using funding other than from the European Social Fund."
"On this latter point, the best solution would be to allocate to the fund payment appropriations in its own right, as for other funds, but we know the Council's position on this subject and I fully understand what the Commissioner said."
"I am pleased to note the convergence of goodwill."
"In this regard, I have no doubt that the undeniable usefulness of this fund, combined with the will of Parliament, will mean that our aims of strengthening this fund will be achieved."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is a tangible expression of solidarity with workers who have lost their jobs due to major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"As Members of this Parliament, it can give us some satisfaction that we can make a contribution to alleviating some of the more immediate effects of redundancy for these workers, indeed giving them some hope for the future."
"However, our role should not just be to approve this Fund."
"We have a responsibility to do our best to ensure, first of all, that all criteria are met, but also to do what is in our power to ensure that the Globalisation Fund ensures added value."
"One of the relevant issues raised by the Committee on Employment is that the measures proposed by Member States complement other actions cofinanced by the Structural Funds, and really we need more than a simple confirmation that this is the case."
"It needs to be demonstrated that this is the case, because this will help to ensure the added value I spoke of."
"Also, the added value will come from the fact that the EGF will not replace actions that are the responsibility of companies, but are a valuable addition to measures taken at national level."
"While we are evaluating the added value of the Fund within the process of the 2007-2013 multiannual framework budget review, this should, in my opinion, be an ongoing process, and we need to be vigilant in the area."
"Another matter which is of some concern to me is the implementation of equality between men and women and non-discrimination within the framework of the Fund."
"I have taken a quick look at the gender breakdown of the three programmes targeted for assistance and they run 91%, 72% and 79% male."
"I have looked at some of the other programmes that we have funded before this, and there seems to be an indication that there is a much greater percentage of the funding going towards male workers that have been made redundant."
"This may be a statistical aberration or it may be a situation where, for one reason or another, a greater number of the applications are for male workers."
"Finally, we need to carefully evaluate all applications because it is crucial that assistance is made available as quickly and efficiently as possible."
"Mr President, I should like to make clear from the outset that we can endorse the use of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for these three applications."
"The applications meet the criteria, and therefore the workers made redundant are entitled to support from this fund."
"Yet I should like to seize this opportunity to draw attention to a major shortcoming of the EGF."
"We are currently developing a shared vision of the future of the economy and the labour market in Europe."
"The various political groupings in this House may not fully agree on how exactly to do this or how far to go in this regard, but we are in reasonable agreement on the broad lines."
"More sustainability and more inclusiveness are required."
"If we wish to achieve these objectives, we must seize the opportunities now."
"At this very time, when tackling the crisis, we must take action that brings us closer to this sustainable economy."
"In my opinion, we are letting some opportunities go to waste with the present mobilisation of the EGF."
"It is a crying shame that the fund, one of our instruments to confront the crisis, is not pointing the way forward."
"We must dare to make real choices."
"If we ensure that people who are now losing their jobs in polluting industries such as the car industry are retrained for work in sustainable sectors with a view to the future rather than remaining stuck in the past, this will make clear what direction we want to move in, and will also bring the innovative, inclusive and sustainable economy that bit closer."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing further cases involving the release of funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"It is a question of whether money is available to meet requests from the governments of Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands in connection with layoffs in firms operating in the automobile and construction industries."
"We have approved a number of similar contributions in the past."
"In my opinion, however, this is an incorrect measure and the European Union should not continue with it. I would like to present two arguments in support of this position."
"Firstly, this is an unjust measure."
"Globalisation, or rather competitive pressure, applies to almost all employees and employers in small businesses in the EU."
"As a result of this, many jobs are both lost and created every day in Europe."
"Support relating to job losses, however, is provided in the EU at a European level only in the case of large companies where the job losses are sufficiently high."
"People made redundant from small firms cannot access this form of support and it is therefore a selective and ultimately unjust measure."
"Secondly, this is an issue which, in my opinion, ought to be resolved at a national level as there are sufficient resources, information and policies at that level."
"Mr President, we shall vote in favour of support for the workers made redundant in Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands."
"Every request to mobilise this fund, however, leaves me even more baffled as to its fairness and effectiveness."
"Firstly, as regards effectiveness, the fund supported 16 000 workers in 2009, a mere drop in the ocean of redundancies, and expended EUR 53 million out of a possible EUR 500 million."
"Secondly, as regards fairness, why is a Swedish car worker supported to the tune of EUR 6 500, while an Austrian car worker gets EUR 14 300?"
"How can I explain this to a Portuguese textile worker, whose support was a mere EUR 524, when her Catalan counterpart can receive EUR 2 000?"
"Worse still, why is it that in the Dutch request fixed-term contract workers were left out of any support, when they are the hardest hit?"
"This fund cannot continue to be used to widen differences in unemployment or to accentuate inequalities between rich countries and countries on the margins."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the European Union has set up budgetary instruments to provide support to workers who are being made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns, many of which have been influenced directly or indirectly by the European Union."
"However, this represents a piecemeal approach."
"Subsidising the training of those who have lost their jobs in certain industries will not resolve the situation of the said industries, nor will it help to create an alternative industry that will absorb this workforce."
"This is just a waste of taxpayers' money."
"If the European Union was really looking to help Europe out of the crisis, it should be investigating and working on the causes of the crisis, but it prefers to be seen as the charity that will come to rescue the poor."
"Of course, this action will initially return support for the European Union from those affected."
"Moreover, the report and the motion for a resolution being proposed for vote do not indicate what the scope of this subsidy will be - i.e. how many industries it will cover and how many companies within a certain industry."
"What is most worrying is that the report emphasises the need to speed up the payments of the subsidies, without ever mentioning the need to provide evidence that the funds are reaching the right people for the right purpose."
"Worse still, the report does not call for regular monitoring of the effects of the subsidy, leaving this evaluation to the general assessment of the programmes within the process of the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework."
"Colleagues, we are talking about taxpayers' money, many of whom have also lost their jobs and are getting no subsidies, many of whom are going through severe financial problems."
"How can we treat their money with such contempt?"
"I will reject this resolution, and urge you to do the same."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the European Union has a budgetary instrument that provides financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns."
"Now, the Globalisation Adjustment Fund is also providing direct assistance to people affected in my home country."
"I have pointed out on many occasions that the Globalisation Adjustment Fund must not be wrongly seen as a backup solution for multinational companies, but must go directly to help the citizens affected."
"For that reason, I am in favour of control mechanisms and would like to see regular progress reports from Steiermark."
"This fund is utilised precisely where society needs it most, namely to help the affected people themselves."
"That is something positive that the European Union does for its citizens."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, I am pleased that we are today debating how we can tackle the global crisis and unemployment in particular."
"Of course, it is affecting very many innocent enterprises that quite simply have too few orders coming in and thus have no turnover."
"They therefore also suffer from a lack of liquidity and with that, lose their creditworthiness."
"I am grateful that the focus here is on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular."
"I believe that transitional assistance is particularly important to allow them to continue working and to be able to take advantage of any appropriate new opportunities on the markets."
"We should carefully analyse the results of this funding to see where we have used best practice and where we were actually able to help secure jobs and, above all, where we have succeeded in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market as quickly and as efficiently as possible."
"Now it is a question of providing help quickly and therefore I also support the mobilisation of the Fund as quickly as possible, particularly in Steiermark in Austria, where a whole region involved in car manufacture is affected and where there are many suppliers involved which, of course, are particularly important for the infrastructure."
"I think it is good that this EUR 5.7 million is being made available."
"However, in this regard I would like to ask that, for all cases that we take a positive decision on here today, an analysis be carried out and that the money does not merely flow out, but that proof is also provided that it is resulting in restoration or that new enterprises are being set up and that active economic activity will, in future, enable this region to regain the vigour that it has had up to now. Thank you, Commissioner."
"(DE) Mr President, the Austrian application for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) concerns the former employees of a total of nine automotive suppliers in Steiermark."
"If we look closer at this case, we can immediately see that it is a classic case for the EGF, namely the provision of remedial assistance."
"The EGF can provide exactly that, and that is why it was set up, in other words to provide assistance to those directly affected by the negative effects of globalisation and who, through the abrupt loss of their jobs, have to suffer the consequences of the irresponsibility of financial market speculators."
"Steiermark, unfortunately, is characterised by its large dependency on demand in the automotive industry."
"That means that the whole region has been badly affected by the current slump in the market and, in particular, in the demand for cars."
"Car sales have fallen by 59.4%."
"In this context, the EUR 5.7 million represents an excellent investment for the reintegration of redundant workers into the labour market."
"In other words, this investment will enable workers to attend local employment foundations, specifically for the automotive sector, while also facilitating the implementation of measures aimed at worker preparation and qualifications."
"(CS) Ladies and gentlemen, this week, we must express our opinion on a European Commission proposal to release financial resources from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in three cases: Sweden, the Netherlands and Austria."
"Again we have to decide, unfortunately, over three unconnected and very different cases."
"I would like to point out that the European Parliament has already asked the Commission on one occasion for individual requests for the release of resources to be presented and discussed separately."
"The requests are again accompanied by a whole series of ambiguities."
"In the case of the Swedish request, for example, it is not clear what volume of resources will be used and, in the case of the Austrian request, the volume of resources requested for each person losing a job is startling."
"While in previous projects, sums of several hundred euros were requested per person, Austria is asking for EUR 14 300 for each unemployed person."
"We remain unconvinced that the proposals correspond to the aims for which the globalisation fund was created and we do not support the release of these resources."
"(DE) Madam President, I would like to use the blue card simply to rectify one point."
"The support in Austria is not being granted to just one person."
"(DE) Madam President, as you can see, this is clearly an Austrian issue, and Steiermark, one of our provinces that has been hard hit, is of great concern to us, with its above-average proportion of the population involved in the automotive industry on the one hand and, of course, a disproportionately high percentage of these products being exported on the other."
"The global fall in demand has resulted in a total of 744 redundancies, as has already been mentioned, and we are very pleased that 400 of the people affected will receive support through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"That is very much to be welcomed."
"In this case - and this needs to be clarified with regard to what the previous speaker said, too - it is not about subsidies for simple restructuring, it is about supporting individual workers by providing assistance with living costs and measures for further training."
"In this regard, I agree with Mrs Cornelissen, who said that this further training must be particularly geared to the future."
"We need to have better trained workers for the future and retraining in the areas of technology and renewable energy is certainly a worthwhile step."
"Steiermark will surely be in favour of that."
"(SV) Madam President, in a debate such as this, it is worth remembering that it is globalisation that has made Europe rich, that has created jobs and generated investments."
"Exports have paved the way for new businesses and large enterprises to emerge."
"Imports have provided opportunities for citizens to live a good life with cheap products and services which, taken together, has resulted in regeneration."
"Change on a broad scale is a constant presence, allowing new enterprises, new jobs and new opportunities to emerge."
"These wide-ranging changes leave their mark right through society and we should never try to prevent them from happening."
"However, we need to make the transition easier for those who are affected."
"Every Member State should have a duty to ensure that the transition takes place safely and in a way that provides plenty of opportunities."
"The European Union cannot provide such opportunities from a single fund."
"The changes are too great and too significant."
"If we think this can be resolved by means of a globalisation fund, then we are not presenting an accurate picture of the situation."
"We were against the creation of such a fund."
"However, when it comes to the car industry, we realise that Europe is in a special situation at the moment, with a multitude of different kinds of support at European and national level, and we are at risk not only of the distortion that comes from giving public subsidies to individual players, but also of this distortion being increased if enterprises and industry in different regions are not able to obtain equivalent support."
"In view of this, we will be voting in favour of this proposal, because we have already come so far in the subsidy process that if support is not provided, then competition would be distorted."
"However, we would like to emphasise that we cannot carry on like this in the future."
"(FR) Madam President, I would like to stress the fact that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund that we have set up is addressed to workers, to improve their employability."
"Therefore, it is on this point that we must truly take fundamental action."
"This is the approach that we adopt in examining the cases within the group on the Globalisation Adjustment Fund to ensure that workers can be included in the world of work, and stay in employment, because there is no social integration without professional integration."
"The second point I would like to stress is that the automotive sector has been very seriously affected, and I call upon car manufacturers, which are being hit hard by the crisis, to adapt their products both to the new environmental objectives and to consumers' new needs."
"The future of the sector is at stake."
"Finally, I call upon everyone to back the Committee on Budgets in its proposal - and I also thank Mr Böge for his proposal - and ask, as Mr Rübig did, for the effects of our policies to be monitored."
"(RO) Last year, we approved a number of similar allocations of sums from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to provide additional support to workers who are suffering the consequences of major structural changes in global trade patterns."
"The economic crisis has had a drastic impact on global trade."
"In the region I come from, I can tell you that during the last year, roughly 2 500 redundancies have been made in the iron and steel industry, approximately 700 in shipbuilding, and an announcement has been made about around 6 000 redundancies to follow in the rail transport sector."
"This is why I believe that it is important for us to be prepared in 2010 for many similar applications which will come about due to the economic crisis."
"The existing procedure must be simple so that states and beneficiaries can gain easy access to it."
"Sweden applied in June, Austria in July and the Netherlands in August, which shows that several months have passed since their applications."
"This is why I believe that the procedure must be simple."
"Madam President, having sat here a few weeks ago when Parliament voted in favour of globalisation funding for my own constituents in Limerick, who were made redundant due to Dell relocating to Poland - and also in the springtime, the Waterford Crystal workers will be looking for a similar assistance - obviously I support what has been proposed here tonight for Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands."
"A number of anomalies have been mentioned and I am going to repeat them very briefly."
"Firstly, I think the start date needs to be looked at."
"Secondly, the time span needs to reflect the length of the course, not just the particular two years, as it is at the moment."
"Thirdly, concerning administration, it is very important that it is not gobbled up, particularly by government agencies."
"Fourthly - and more importantly - as much help as possible should be given to entrepreneurs."
"Thirty-five per cent of start-up companies in the EU have been started by people who have been unemployed."
"If they are helped, they will deliver."
"Necessity is the mother of invention, and I think it is very important that we give them every assistance we can."
"(DE) Madam President, if we assume that most jobs across Europe - not just in my country, Austria - are at risk due to the effects of globalisation, then we must consider, in particular, that younger workers - some of whom have not yet been registered as unemployed because they have just come from a training course or from school - are at risk as a result."
"We need to take particular care - and this applies to Austria, primarily - to ensure that we use these sorts of measures to support those workers who need to be integrated into the labour market for the first time, and give them the opportunity, including with assistance from the European Union, to enter the European labour market."
"Ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the debate has shown clearly that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is functioning and we are able to state that it has now been used several dozen times and it has always brought considerable benefit to the people making use of the fund."
"As a Commissioner, I have always tried to familiarise myself with results in the field, which is not proper analysis of course but merely direct experience, and I was delighted to see how positively the fund is rated in those areas where it has operated."
"The debate has thrown up many questions of a serious nature which demand a response and which call for a clear and realistic opinion."
"First is the idea that the fund can be used only for big companies."
"Experience fortunately shows that the fund can be used by anyone, regardless of whether a large or small country or a large or small firm is involved and this was our original intention."
"The newly adjusted rules clearly provide the possibility for using this fund also in the case of employees of small and medium-sized enterprises which are in areas or fields affected by the crisis."
"The fund thus operates without discrimination and does not disadvantage anyone."
"I would also like to emphasise a fundamental characteristic of the fund, which is to help people rather than companies and, from this perspective, we cannot therefore see it as a life support machine for companies that have no realistic hope of functioning in economic terms, but rather the contrary."
"The fund helps people who have been made redundant to find work quickly in those areas where it exists."
"It is therefore a fund which, in principle, implements and facilitates restructuring."
"Concerns over gender inequality were expressed in one speech and I think it was the speech of Mrs Harkin."
"This inequality, which really does exist at the level of reports, merely proves that the crisis, especially in its first phase, has markedly affected the male-dominated industries."
"Today also, we are talking about the automobile industry and the construction industry, in other words, two male-dominated industries."
"In overall figures, therefore, the fund has provided more assistance to men."
"The crisis has changed the structure of the labour market in a specific way and I noted the statement of President Obama, who declared that at the end of this year, the majority of workers actively engaged on the labour market in the United States would be women."
"Also in the United States, therefore, the crisis has produced a very striking result in industries dominated by men."
"As far as the question is concerned, there is no gender inequality at all in the concept or the structure of the fund."
"The debate also threw up a number of ideas, of course, on how it might be possible to amend and improve the fund."
"I have to say that the Commission does not of course regard the fund as something immutable which has emerged like Pallas Athena from the head of Zeus."
"It is a human institution, which can always be made better on the basis of experience and debate."
"Thus, in my opinion, there are no fundamental obstacles here."
"Another question was raised on the issue of the specific method of financing, in other words, the integration of the fund within the budget as independent budget items."
"This is surely a question that will be discussed at a political level but from a financial perspective, it was not possible to achieve a result in this way and, in my opinion, the fact that we mobilised resources by a different but effective method is, in itself, valuable."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that it is undoubtedly true that the amended rules and the pressure of the crisis have led to a situation where there will be more individual cases but, as I have already stated, the Commission accepts the weight of the arguments on the side of adopting a case-by-case approach and we will therefore proceed under this method."
"In conclusion, I would like to thank the MEPs from the Committee on Budgets and all of the MEPs involved in this issue because it has emerged clearly from the debate that consideration has been given to all of the contentious matters that are present in every decision of such complexity."
"In my opinion, it also emerged clearly from the debate and from the proposal of the Commission that all of these cases fall within the scope of the globalisation adjustment fund."
"I am delighted therefore that your debate has confirmed the view of the Commission and I expect that the vote will go in the same direction, or at least I hope it will."
"Madam President, I do not need to add anything to what the Commissioner said."
"I support what he said, especially his concluding remarks about the question of the future development of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in relation to the other programmes - in particular the European Social Fund - about which we will, of course, have another intensive joint debate."
"It is absolutely clear that this Globalisation Adjustment Fund cannot neutralise the consequences of structural change, nor can it accept and overcome the challenges of globalisation, and that, of course, is not its intended purpose."
"However, it can certainly help the individuals affected, who find themselves in a difficult situation in terms of employment after being made redundant and it can give them the opportunity, through gaining qualifications, to have prospects once more and to find work."
"That is something that, in spite of the debate about subsidiarity, which of course also plays a part in this connection, we should support and welcome as a supplementary fund to all the measures under the European Social Fund, which we also have."
"At this point, I would just like to say one more thing and that is that there are certainly programmes in the national, as well as the European, budgets where there are more grounds for calling into question the meaningfulness of the expenditure than there are for a fund that provides assistance directly to people who are in a difficult initial situation."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Wednesday."
"European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress) (debate)"
"The next item is the report by Mrs Göncz, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on establishing a European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion (Progress Microfinance Facility) - C7-0053/2009 -."
"(FR) Madam President, I note that, throughout the previous debate, you referred to the debate that is now to take place as a debate on Progress."
"However, the decision of this Parliament, confirmed by the Conference of Presidents, is that we will only vote on the 'microfinance' facility."
"I therefore think that this clarification is an important one."
"This is a debate on microfinance and not on the Progress programme."
"Thank you very much, Madam President, and I am also very grateful for this clarification, as it is vitally important that we are now going to talk about the microfinance facility."
"I would also like to welcome Commissioner Špidla to the following debate."
"Let me begin by saying that when I became rapporteur for this programme, I thought that I would have a very easy job, given the wide-ranging consensus and support on this issue, something which was also in evidence during the debate."
"This support was wide-ranging in many respects."
"On the one hand, as a crisis management facility, it will also help precisely those who are in the most desperate situation, who have lost their job and who cannot access credit or assistance either due to the financial crisis."
"On the other hand, this is typically a facility which does not provide people with fish, but teaches them how to fish."
"It triggers precisely the type of creativity which we need most from the point of view of ensuring a positive outcome to the crisis."
"The third aspect which received, and still receives, wide-ranging support is the fact that the European Union's resources are growing, which I think is the finance ministers' dream."
"Some of the resources are being contributed by the European Investment Bank, while others are coming from other commercial banks as the European Union will be primarily covering the risk, thereby making it easier for the other participants to assume the risk."
"As I have mentioned, there is wide support for the programme's content."
"I think that, thanks to these aspects, the issue which provoked debate during the discussions with the Council and Commission was to do with which resources the European Union will use to finance this particular primary risk that has been assumed."
"The second point of contention was the extent of the resources which could help launch the facility and can be expected to actually attract other significant resources."
"The Council and Commission originally proposed that EUR 100 million should come from the Progress programme, which is primarily used to draw up policies for combating social exclusion and supporting equal opportunities."
"We, for our part, said right from the start that the Progress programme cannot be jeopardised in any way since, during the current crisis, it is needed even more than before."
"It is also not acceptable for us to tinker with the Progress programme to such an extent that could really jeopardise it."
"Parliament was extremely willing to compromise during the debate."
"We also held three informal trialogues, one of which went on until the early hours, where we proposed that we could tinker with the Progress programme in any way that would not jeopardise its function."
"We suggested that, considering the original proposal, we could envisage launching the programme even with EUR 100 million rather than EUR 150 million."
"Parliament's 2010 draft budget found resources of EUR 25 million, which will enable it to launch the programme at the very start of 2010, and it was able to find these resources without touching the Progress programme in 2010."
"We also requested this item be removed from today's agenda because we failed to reach agreement on it."
"Another matter we felt was an issue was that the Presidency arrived during the trialogue on all three occasions without any mandate, making it very difficult for it to consider our proposals properly."
"I believe it is important for Parliament to vote as soon as possible on this matter, this very week even, so that this project can therefore be launched at the start of 2010 with a fund of EUR 100 million, because this conveys the message that this is a crisis management facility where speed is a particularly important consideration."
"I sincerely hope that Commissioner Špidla can help us get the Commission to withdraw its original proposal on diverting the EUR 100 million from the Progress programme so that this programme can be launched as soon as possible."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my speech my emphasising the importance of this initiative in the area of micro-financing."
"The current crisis is bringing about a significant rise in unemployment in all of the Member States, the effects of which will unfortunately fall hardest on the most vulnerable members of our society."
"The micro-financing instrument is specifically aimed at assisting these groups of citizens to find alternative employment and to become micro-entrepreneurs themselves."
"I would like to congratulate the Committee on Employment for the outstanding work they have carried out in this area and, in particular, to applaud the contribution made by Mrs Göncz to this initiative."
"I am aware of the efforts that were made in the negotiations between Parliament and the Council aimed at achieving agreement at the first reading."
"In view of the fact that both bodies support the micro-financing instrument, it was possible to make considerable progress over the essential wording of the proposal."
"This progress is reflected to a considerable extent in the amendments proposed today."
"Of course, the most difficult question is the budget."
"Although both bodies will probably approve an overall budget of EUR 100 million for this instrument, identifying the sources of the finance continues to be the main obstacle."
"As you know, the micro-financing proposal forms part of a package which includes a proposal to transfer EUR 100 million from the Progress programme."
"You have decided not to vote on this second proposal this week."
"The transfer of funds from the Progress programme is support by the Council and, for many of the Member States, it constitutes a fundamental element of the whole package."
"Without an agreement over the source of finance in this area, we will not achieve our objective of implementing the new instrument rapidly."
"Today, however, we are debating the wording of the decision through which the instrument is to be set up."
"In conclusion, I would like once more to applaud the rapporteur for the work she has carried out in submitting a report and amendments that will enable both of the lawmaking bodies to concentrate on the main problem that remains to be resolved, namely the funding."
"rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). - (SV) Madam President, if we are to reduce unemployment, then both the EU and the Member States must shoulder greater responsibility."
"The proposal for microfinancing is an initiative that Parliament has been pushing for."
"It is about giving the unemployed a new start and opening the door to enterprise for some of the most vulnerable groups in the EU, including young people."
"The proposal is intended to facilitate small-scale investments and provide microenterprises with the opportunity to grow."
"Following some minor amendments and clarifications the proposal received broad support from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs."
"The issue on which there has been debate is its financing, as has also been mentioned here."
"The Commission proposed that no extra funds would be made available, with funding instead being taken from the Progress programme."
"It has been incorrectly asserted that this opinion is shared by the lead committee, but that is not so."
"That is the current situation."
"I must say that I find it strange that the Council is so stubbornly rejecting our proposal for EUR 150 million during the period - a mean and miserly approach in these difficult times!"
"Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we could sense during the previous debates as well that the economic crisis and how to emerge from it are a preoccupation for every one of us and are being given ample attention."
"As the coordinator from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would simply like to confirm that we support in every single dossier tabled before us one of the most important items for us, namely, the protection of jobs and the creation of new jobs."
"Let me remind you that the PPE Group has been supporting the issue of micro-credit for a long time."
"In fact, it was my former colleague, Zsolt Becsey, who first tabled this topic before the House in his own-initiative report in 2009."
"This was based on earlier and current experiences in Hungary with this facility, which was called the Széchenyi card, and had the same purpose as in the current case: providing micro-enterprises with small, short-term credits."
"Let us think of butchers, bakers, greengrocers or perhaps even chemists."
"They are also being affected by the crisis."
"They employ a huge number of people."
"In some countries, this sector even accounts for more than 90% of employees."
"This is the case, for example, in Hungary for more than 90% of firms and enterprises."
"They do not need a large amount of money and they do not want to pay a great deal of interest either."
"In certain cases, they need temporary working credit and temporary assistance."
"The Commission's proposal addresses this very problem and, as the rapporteur said, this proposal really has wide-ranging support and consensus."
"Therefore, I think that it is important for us to agree on the issue of funding as soon as possible as well."
"We also support the 35 proposals jointly submitted by the PPE Group, along with the Socialists, Liberals and Conservatives, because we feel that this provides the guarantee that we can approve this facility at first reading and launch it as soon as possible."
"Madam President, I am rather surprised."
"We are going to adopt an instrument that creates an innovative tool, a vital tool, to allow those most vulnerable to this crisis to face it and to come up with their own jobs in the future."
"This is an instrument to be adopted using the codecision procedure, but the Council is not here."
"This must be because the Council has nothing to say to us on this issue and does not consider itself bound by the European Parliament's position."
"In any case, that is the impression that we have had at times throughout the negotiations."
"The European Parliament is going to assume its responsibilities."
"Thanks to the cooperation and constructive understanding between all the groups, it is going to adopt the microfinance instrument, which is consistent with its actions over many years, as Mr Őry reminded us."
"However, I would also like to point to the pilot projects that we initiated."
"We know that in this crisis situation, the most vulnerable people - those who do not have access to the large banks to release loans to fund their initiatives - are able, through this tool, to launch their own strategies and, in a way, to create their own jobs."
"I will not go back over the content, development and scope of the negotiations that have taken place."
"The negotiations were held in appropriate conditions."
"The issue of funding is more serious."
"When you look at the initiative launched by Mr Barroso in autumn 2008 to organise the European recovery, this tool was defined as an important one to be used in achieving the European Union's strategy."
"However, the Commission has proposed to us that we should simply finance a new project by robbing a useful project that was already on the table."
"We had a project to benefit support networks for the most vulnerable - the Progress project - to which the European Parliament was highly committed, and, in order to fund microfinance, the Commission is proposing to us that we should simply tap into the funds allocated to the Progress programme."
"It is this sleight of hand that this Parliament does not accept, and that is why we have not concluded the negotiations."
"That is why, taking a responsible attitude, we say that we are prepared to examine our proposal with the Spanish Presidency at the very beginning of January: EUR 40 million taken from the budgetary margins, EUR 60 million taken from the Progress programme, with EUR 20 million redeployed, enabling the burden to be distributed fairly."
"We will then assume our responsibilities as the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to look at how such a programme is implemented in each of the Member States, to bring about a synergy between the various experiments to be conducted in the Member States - we are sure of this - when the package as a whole is adopted in January."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the proposed microfinance facility."
"Earlier, we spoke about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and how it can assist redundant workers in certain sectors."
"The microfinance facility is another piece in the jigsaw where the EU, in this case, is trying to ensure access to micro-credit for those who would not be able to access that credit from what we might define as the normal or usual financial institutions."
"This would enable them to set up their own business and promote entrepreneurship."
"In this context, I am pleased to see that credit unions, cooperative banks and other mutual financial institutions can operate the fund, because they are often closer to those who may wish to access this particular facility."
"Indeed, I do not know about elsewhere, but in Ireland, the only financial institution left standing that did not require taxpayers' money to sustain it was the credit union movement, which is a not-for-profit institution run by its members."
"When we speak of social inclusion as part of EU social policy, we need to ensure that, by our actions, social inclusion is integral to the decisions we take, and this programme has social inclusion written all over it."
"In this context, I want to express my extreme disappointment that after three trialogues, we were unable to reach agreement on the source of funding for this facility."
"In my opinion, the Swedish Presidency did not seem to have the facility to have any meaningful negotiations on the matter."
"I do not know about you but, as I said, I was very disappointed that a figure of at most EUR 40 million over three years for 27 Member States was all that divided us."
"Obviously, many finance ministers did not support real negotiation."
"I could not help but think that many of those same ministers allocated billions to support banks, but were unable to support other financial institutions that would provide micro-credit to those who have lost their jobs and who would have difficulty in accessing credit from the same banks that have been saved."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, micro-credits and small loans can help people who are not able to get credit through normal market mechanisms."
"As has already been said, they can also help these people to set up businesses and create jobs with their ideas."
"Such credits can help people to get out of a crisis if they are capable of doing so."
"Micro-credits are also an important instrument for supporting the social economy."
"With its diverse aspects and traditions, it has also been a recognised local employment policy instrument within the EU since 2000."
"On account of this, in 2006, this Parliament, in its wisdom, established that resources from the European Social Fund could also be paid out as micro-credits or subsidised loans, as laid down in Article 11 of the European Social Fund Regulation."
"However, EUR 76 billion is available for the European Social Fund, and with cofinancing that becomes EUR 118 billion!"
"Even a tenth of that would still be EUR 11 billion that the Member States could use."
"However, they do not use it for micro-credits."
"For that reason, the Commission created a test phase for micro-credits with an instrument called JASMINE - also financed from European structural funds, and because this was so successful, a new instrument is intended to follow in its wake."
"However, this will no longer come from the structural funds, where we have billions available to us, but from the smallest of all of the European Union's programmes, the poverty programme Progress, for which a total of only EUR 743 million is available over seven years."
"It is intended for NGOs which are establishing networks in the Member States in order to provide a pressure group for the poorest of the poor."
"The European Roma Information Office alone gets 50% of its funding from Progress."
"It establishes national and regional information and advisory offices and gives the Roma minority a voice, particularly in the Eastern European States."
"If this House follows the Council and names this instrument Progress, as proposed in the compromises put forward by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, then the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not give its approval to this instrument."
"We cannot allow such conjuring tricks - on one side, taking away money from the poor and, on the other, paying out ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Ladies and gentlemen, in a time of continuing financial and economic crisis it is necessary to support not only banks and big companies but also small firms and self-employed people."
"We all know that it is these small firms, including family-owned firms, which create and sustain large numbers of jobs."
"We support the creation of the new financial instrument of the micro-finance programme for employment and social inclusion which, in cooperation with the European Investment Bank, will improve the availability of loans precisely for self-employed people and small start-ups and family firms."
"We agree to the release of resources amounting to EUR 100 million for securing these small loans for a fixed period."
"We regard this programme as a good and effective instrument for an active policy on employment and as a good way of spending so-called European money, in other words, our money."
"We fully endorse the proposal to release the necessary resources for this financial instrument from the resources originally intended for the Progress programme."
"We do not agree to funding for the micro-financing instrument being obtained from reserves or from other budget chapters."
"The resources of the Progress programme, which amount to EUR 700 million if I am correctly informed, are used for building up study and analysis networks."
"None of the resources of the Progress programme have been earmarked for directly supporting people who are seeking work or creating jobs."
"I do not doubt that it is necessary to build up networks and produce analyses and studies."
"In the current period, however, which is not easy for entrepreneurs and employees, I give precedence to using these resources from the EU budget for programmes directly targeted at employers and employees."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a microfinance instrument for the unemployed, those at risk of becoming unemployed and, above all, for people who do not have access to normal credit markets, is evidence of good intentions and is, in principle, something that our group supports."
"However, what the Commission and the Council have so far achieved in this process is quite simply inadequate and, in some respects, wrong, and our group is not able to support it."
"Our first criticism relates to the question of total appropriation."
"What is on the table in terms of total appropriation is not appropriate for a programme for combating unemployment and can hardly be termed a microfinance programme - at best, it is a nanofinance programme!"
"Secondly, we are, as a matter of principle, opposed to these types of conjuring tricks which do not have the slightest effect and which are financed at the expense of other programmes and therefore simply fizzle out."
"Thirdly, we are of the opinion that mentoring and coaching are absolutely essential in order for such a programme to succeed and be sustainable."
"Many new business start-ups fail, in particular, in the microfinance sector, and so this must be accounted for within the programme."
"Fourthly, it must be ensured that social security payments in the Member States are not cancelled if someone takes advantage of this programme, otherwise it will have no effect."
"Unemployment cannot be lastingly combated in this way."
"In this form, we will reject this programme."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the draft decision passed by the European Parliament and the Council establishing a European micro-financing instrument in the area of employment and social inclusion is, in essence, a draft which adapts the original Progress programme to the current economic reality of a Europe marked by the financial and economic crisis."
"The Commission is proposing support in the form of micro-credits for small enterprises, creating a stimulus for maintaining and developing employment in crisis-hit regions."
"If we wish to achieve this objective, however, we must ensure that the financial resources provided are not spent on social benefits or consumption."
"They must go only to sensible, sustainable business activities through the use of objectively measurable criteria and transparent procedures."
"It is therefore very important to require of the ultimate providers of the loans that they thoroughly assess the business plans of the applicants, the risks of the business projects submitted and also the return on the resources invested."
"I therefore consider it highly necessary to support and complete the amendments of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which provide a sensible framework for the Commission's proposal."
"(FI) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it seems strange that there should be opposition to this excellent and important programme in this House, given the worsening employment situation."
"The prediction is that there will be another 10 million unemployed people in Europe next year and that those with poorer labour status will face tougher times ahead."
"This data underlines the importance of investing in entrepreneurship."
"It is always companies just starting up that have the biggest problems getting bank loans."
"For example, over 93% of companies in Finland are micro-enterprises with fewer than 10 staff, and yet these small companies employ 46% of the working population."
"It is only right, therefore, that the EU should establish a microfinance facility in response to this employment crisis and, in that way, also lend support to those programmes in the individual Member States which pursue the same objective."
"I wish like to stress, however, that this programme will require a comprehensive approach."
"The social benefit, holiday and pension systems in small companies also need to be developed in line with other sectors."
"Europe is especially lacking in high-risk funding and those individuals, the business angels, who are prepared to invest in a company in its early stages."
"Entrepreneurship education and connections to work and employment should also be supported at all levels of education, and there should be more young people's workshops and business incubators and more funds available for them."
"Microfinance can only work as a component of this sort of comprehensive approach, in which the situation of new small entrepreneurs and the whole environment in which they operate is one that provides real opportunities to continue in business successfully and profitably."
"Madam President, I very much welcome this initiative."
"Unemployment is the biggest social problem we face right now, and anything we can do to mitigate its impact is important for the well-being of our societies."
"However, a proposal for EUR 100 million over a three-year period lacks ambition, in my view, given the growth in unemployment."
"I am likewise surprised that the money proposed is not new money, and that we will in effect be robbing Peter to pay Paul, as has already been said, at a time when all the money we can find should be used in the Progress programme, on existing schemes."
"We must do all we can to reach agreement quickly with the Spanish Presidency so that the programme can get under way at the earliest possible date."
"It is equally incumbent on the Council to get its act together and to meet Parliament with regard to our concerns."
"This is no time for the Council to haggle over what is a tiny amount of money."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"Mr De Rossa, has it occurred to you that unemployment in Ireland has a tremendous amount to do with Ireland's continuing membership of the euro, which means that Ireland cannot devalue, cannot reduce interest rates and cannot do any quantitative easing?"
"Has it ever occurred to you that it might be better if Ireland left the euro, rather than stretching out its begging hand to the contributing countries of the European Union?"
"Madam President, I have no problem at all in seeking to answer that usual nonsense from the far right of this Parliament."
"Without the euro, the Irish economy would be in hell at the moment."
"As I was saying, this is no time for the Council to haggle over what is a tiny amount of money given the scale of the jobs crisis, the size of the overall budget and certainly in the context of the support that Member States, and indeed the European Central Bank, have given to the banking sector - a banking sector, incidentally, which will not lend to the people that we are seeking to facilitate."
"I have every confidence that if there is goodwill on the part of the Council, we can reach agreement based on the pragmatic approach of our rapporteur."
"I sincerely hope they will do so quickly."
"(PL) Madam President, Commissioner, in light of this debate, attention should be drawn to the fact that the strategy being employed by the European Commission completely ignores employment in the maritime economy."
"The lack of an integrated maritime policy has, for many years, been the cause of the systematic decay of this sector in the European Union, while we should be aware that it is an enormous labour market."
"In addition, the marginalised shipbuilding industry, which has been efficiently eliminated in Europe by the dumping policy of states in the Far East, has also not gained the support of the European Commission."
"In my country, Poland, alone, the actions of the European Commission have led to the collapse of the shipbuilding industry and, as a result, many thousands of people have lost their jobs directly, while it is estimated that indirect job losses have been suffered by nearly 80 000 people."
"However, this sector will not disappear from the world economy."
"Following the pattern of recent years, it will move to countries in the Far East, at the expense of the labour market in Europe."
"The lack of a strategy to return ships to national colours is extremely dangerous."
"As a result of this policy, Europe is irretrievably losing huge incomes, which will flow instead to tax havens."
"Another extremely important element of European Commission policy is fishing which, not uncommonly, is the only sector that stimulates non-industrialised areas of the European Union."
"The Commission is concentrating mainly on reducing the size of fleets while, at the same time, failing to curb mass imports to the European market from the Far East, such as of the highly damaging panga."
"At a time of crisis, European Commission policy must create the basis for development of the economy, and not hastily treat the effects of erroneous strategy."
"(PT) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I congratulate the rapporteur on the work that has been done in this report and on her speech just now."
"This new microfinance facility will make it possible to grant micro-credit to small enterprises and people who have lost their jobs and who want to start up their own business and create their own jobs."
"That is very important at a time when the economic crisis is expected to result in the loss of 3.5 million jobs in the European Union alone."
"With the economic downturn, the banks have stopped giving out loans for start-ups and job creation, and access to credit is more difficult at a time when it ought to be more accessible."
"This new microfinance scheme, however, will counter this current trend of restricting access to credit, by making it easier to obtain the funds needed to set up new businesses and create new jobs."
"The Commission proposal is to reallocate EUR 100 million for this finance facility out of the Progress budget."
"We cannot agree with this proposal."
"The financial and economic crisis is also a social crisis."
"Diverting resources from Progress, which targets the most vulnerable groups, is certainly not the most appropriate solution."
"We are therefore in favour of creating a separate budget line to finance this facility, as well as increasing its appropriation to EUR 150 million."
"We also agree with the need to make it clearer in the legislation itself that the target group is all vulnerable groups who are finding it difficult to enter or re-enter the labour market and who are facing the threat of social exclusion."
"The reference to specific groups should therefore be deleted."
"To conclude, I would stress that it is essential that the people who receive financial support should also be given appropriate training."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, against a backdrop of serious economic crisis, characterised by very severe effects on employment, with many workers standing to lose their jobs and, at the same time, countless young people not able to enter the labour market for the first time, it is essential that the European Union and the Member States take action, both with global strategies and with targeted instruments."
"The microfinance facility is precisely an instrument targeted at people, the aim of which is to provide a response to all those individuals who, excluded from the bank credit market and having difficulty entering the labour market, intend to start a project, an economic activity, which, nonetheless, can generate individual income and thus contribute to overall growth."
"In particular, if we want the micro-credit instrument to be effective and to yield lasting results, the Member States must prepare themselves sufficiently, including by establishing links at local administrative level, which is in more direct contact with situations of social crisis, and by taking an active role in making this new facility easily accessible."
"It is important to stress that the long-term effectiveness of activities financed by micro-credit instruments and the possibility of fully achieving social integration largely depend on simultaneous guidance, mentoring and training programmes, which must accompany microfinance."
"At the same time, given the objectives to be achieved with the micro-credit instrument, it is necessary to emphasise one crucial action, namely actively promoting equal opportunities for men and women in access to microfinance programmes."
"In fact, it is women who are particularly discriminated against and disadvantaged, in terms of access to both the labour market and the conventional credit market."
"Generally speaking, it is reassuring to note that the European Parliament is united and agrees on the issue of micro-credit and against such a socio-economic backdrop as this."
"It is up to the Council and the Member States to show that they are serious and committed, and pave the way so that the financial situation can be set right."
"(ET) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has made a proposal to create a new means of financing - micro-credit financing."
"The initiative is a good and important one, but the fact that it has been suggested that the resources needed for this should be taken from the already running Progress programme is not acceptable."
"I would like to remind the Council and the Commission that the people did not elect us in this chamber in order to be a rubber stamp."
"At the end of 2006, when we adopted the Progress programme here in this chamber, the Member States set their respective aims and began work."
"The results from the programme were well executed, and there is no reason to think that the programme will not therefore continue running until it ends in 2013."
"The programme was and is aimed at all those groups of people finding themselves in an unfavourable position, and there has been help available for them from this programme."
"Today the economic crisis is growing into a social crisis."
"Unemployment is increasing month after month, and today the Progress measures remain necessary."
"At the same time, however, the Commission is going forward with its desire to reduce funding for the measures, which are still being implemented."
"Such an approach is not responsible, and it is unacceptable."
"I am sure that we in this chamber cannot approve micro-credit financing until it is clear where the money for these measures will come from - until it is clear that the funds will be found somewhere other than from plans targeted at all those people who are suffering."
"(LV) Madam President, the economies of the EU States are still experiencing the effects of the global economic crisis, but the crisis is having the hardest impact on young entrepreneurs and managers of small enterprises, whose entrepreneurial ideas are, at the moment, not receiving support from lenders."
"Economic growth takes place when new jobs are created."
"New jobs are created when businesses have access to finance in order to make their ideas into a reality."
"Unfortunately, in the current crisis situation, the banks do not want to lend money to enterprises because they are frightened of risk."
"Private capital has also dried up."
"In these circumstances, it is usually micro-enterprises and young entrepreneurs that suffer the most."
"They have ideas for development, but no finance, and it is clear that if these enterprises cannot develop, then new jobs will not be created; the creation of jobs is, however, a prerequisite for emerging from the economic crisis."
"One solution to this problem is the European microfinance instrument, which plans to allocate EUR 100 million to the development of micro-enterprises and new enterprises, reallocating resources from existing sources of money."
"In contrast to the large stimulus packages which, over the last year, have been set up predominantly to rescue the financial system as such, this programme is aimed directly at entrepreneurs, not banks."
"That means that this money will help in the most direct way to create new jobs and will stimulate the real economy."
"I call upon my fellow Members not to hesitate in taking the decision to establish this microfinance programme."
"The countries of the European Union are experiencing the crisis now; Europe needs new jobs now; support for new entrepreneurship initiatives is needed right away."
"(EL) Madam President, the mere fact that the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Integration won the consent and agreement of all the political groups proves how necessary this mechanism is."
"It is very important that a person who has lost his job or is in danger of losing it and cannot find a solution to his problem on the conventional banking markets is able to obtain a micro-loan or micro-credit."
"However, in order for the idea of microfinance to work in practice, it needs to operate properly and it needs to operate soon, meaning that on Thursday, when we vote on the 2010 budget, we need to say 'yes' to the first EUR 25 million which will come out of the budget."
"However, that is not enough."
"There is another EUR 75 million which I think needs to be found from the budget because, if we take the money from the Progress programme, then it is very simply as if we were taking from the less poor and vulnerable in order to give it to the more poor and vulnerable."
"If this were to happen, it would mean that the mechanism of micro funding had essentially been abolished as a concept."
"If we bear in mind that 'Progress' fundamentally means progress in taking the social face of Europe forward, and if this does not happen and the money is taken out of 'Progress', then we have regressed."
"That is precisely why I believe that the Council should approve the European Parliament's position."
"(BG) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has been adopting a variety of measures to combat the economic crisis for more than a year."
"Unlike the other measures, the microfinance facility is actually intended to assist the most vulnerable groups in society who find it difficult to enter and return to the labour market."
"Solidarity, which is one of the European Union's fundamental principles, dictates that they should receive special attention."
"There is now a great deal of interest in this instrument, especially in Bulgaria, and I assume that this is the case in other countries too."
"I have kept myself informed on this issue, right from the very start of the debates, through the media, many representatives of which are following its development."
"It is in the European institutions' interest to demonstrate to the EU's citizens that our immediate task is to look after those affected by the crisis and the poorest members of society."
"This will convince people that the institutions are effective and close to them."
"There is some doubt about whether the facility will be able to reach and serve all its potential customers."
"The lack of credit is huge and has contributed to the rise in unemployment."
"EUR 100 million will not be sufficient to help all the unemployed facing the threat of social exclusion."
"After all, not everyone has the skills to expand a business; not everyone could be successfully trained."
"What is important is for a decision to be made more quickly and for the microfinance facility to start operating on as large a scale as possible, so that those with ideas and a flair for enterprise can get started now when the crisis is still severe."
"Next year has been declared the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, so let us adopt proper measures and not delay the start of the recovery process."
"(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we can undoubtedly see promising signs of the stabilisation of the economy and the financial markets in 2010, and I would also like to remind you that this was only possible because it was coordinated at a European level."
"However, we are, of course, seeing a rise in the unemployment figures and we have to assume that they will rise still further over the next year."
"I therefore welcome this new financing instrument for people who want to go self-employed."
"It is, of course, common knowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises create jobs."
"For many years, we have been discussing financial support for these enterprises."
"However, every year, we discover that the funds have not gone where they were supposed to go."
"I was able to follow the end of a pilot project last week, but as a result, there was not time to put the experiences gained from it in this report."
"I would therefore like to mention it here."
"The pilot project used participants who are self-employed or who want to go self-employed, and they were supported for a year along the path to self-employment."
"It was so successful that I would like to call for it to be included in this project, in other words, that the project not only provide finance for people who are going self-employed, but also for those who support these people."
"That is necessary because the banks, which will not, of course, give them credit, perceive a certain amount of risk in this regard."
"I think we can neutralise this risk with this financing."
"The second point that came up again and again in discussions in this regard was that we must not put a lower limit on the credits."
"Up to now, someone could only receive credits of EUR 5 000 or more."
"Sometimes, people do not need that amount."
"In these cases, much smaller amounts are sufficient, and that is something that we should take into account in this programme."
"(LT) I would like to underline that currently, one of the most important tasks for the European Union is to curb the mass unemployment caused by prolonged inactivity and the social crisis."
"It is unfortunate that it was not possible to reach agreement on a microfinance source of funding during the trialogue."
"During this difficult social and economic period, the Commission's proposal to reallocate EUR 100 million from the Progress budget would be an unsatisfactory solution, as it would not reduce the social isolation of the most vulnerable groups."
"I am convinced that the microfinance facility will be more effective and will achieve its goal if it is coordinated by taking national, regional and local programmes into account and receives sufficient funding."
"It is also important to take into consideration the fact that European social well-being is directly linked to employment and opportunities provided to find employment."
"Therefore, I suggest that the Commission consider not only those people at risk of losing their jobs, but also those who are finding it difficult to enter or return to the labour market."
"Even before the onset of the economic recession, many educated and hard-working citizens had no real opportunities to find employment and therefore, a large number of them emigrated beyond the European Union."
"As for socially disadvantaged people, I urge the Commission and the Council to bear in mind that apart from young people, there are other socially disadvantaged groups, including women, the disabled and the elderly, who need additional guarantees of employment."
"Thus, there is no other way but to find additional funds for microfinance facilities."
"(The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8))"
"(DE) Madam President, we have now listened to three or four speakers from the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament who have said that they do not want to take any money from Progress."
"However, the amendments state that the instrument is to be called Progress, and Mrs Berès has also said that EUR 60 million will come from Progress."
"That is two thirds!"
"I would be interested to know what the Socialists' position actually is."
"Should the instrument be financed from Progress - yes or no?"
"(LT) I would like to answer that the best solution would be for us to find additional funds, because the Progress programme is essentially targeted at the same groups and this would mean that, if there is no additional funding, the effect will certainly not be achieved."
"Therefore, let us sit down together and find a solution, because unemployment is growing at a painful rate and this is really affecting many people who are already struggling."
"Madam President, three and a half million people lost their jobs in the European Union in the past year."
"EUR 100 million is not going to turn that situation around."
"In fact, when you consider that one hundred million people are employed by SMEs, it only comes to one euro per employee."
"Nevertheless, it is a start, and it is to be welcomed because, as Commissioner Špidla pointed out, financing is the biggest issue at hand."
"To illustrate that: I became aware at the weekend of a situation where a company, which had a significant order delayed for three months, went to its bank - the bank it had been dealing with for 15 years - for bridging finance."
"It was refused."
"The company director was told that if he took out a mortgage on his own dwelling house, then they would allow him."
"He did this, and a week later he got a letter withdrawing the overdraft facility on the grounds that they were now in a high-risk situation."
"The result was that the company closed down and 10 more people were made redundant."
"That brings me to a point which my colleague, Marian Harkin, mentioned, that, as far as possible, this funding should go to non-commercial banks like credit unions which, in my country anyway, are in every town and do tremendous work, whereas all the anecdotal evidence would suggest that the commercial banks, even with the finance they were getting from the European Investment Bank, are not giving it out but rather keeping it to shore up their own financial situation."
"For those two reasons, I think we should be very careful of not so much where the money comes from, but where it goes to."
"If it goes to the right people, then it would be the best money we will spend perhaps for a long time here at European level."
"Finally, I would like to respond to the rather ill-advised comments by the Earl when he spoke about the begging hand."
"This is not about a begging hand."
"This is about helping those to help others to create employment and to stay in employment."
"We are very proud and glad that we joined the euro, and we will be staying."
"(FR) Madam President, the clause in the Treaty of Lisbon on social policies requires the European Union to take into account employment, social protection and the fight against social exclusion."
"The economic and financial crisis which has overrun Europe has led to a very serious human and social crisis, and this will have consequences that are impossible to assess at the moment."
"Until now, the majority of efforts have been devoted to stabilising the banks and preventing bankruptcies."
"In addition to measures to prevent unemployment, we must create a mechanism to give renewed impetus to the European Union's economic growth."
"The mechanism used by the Commission is designed to create an infrastructure which, in turn, will enable citizens to work."
"At the practical level, it is possible to move from a temporary strategy to a long-term strategy."
"This mechanism must be put in place quickly, in January 2010."
"Our debate today and our decisions are heard by many people who are suffering from inequality and by many young people who want to enter the working world and to whom we should just give a helping hand."
"I would mention again the proposal already made to create a separate budget heading of EUR 50 million for this mechanism."
"That will enable approximately 6 000 European entrepreneurs to start their own businesses, to develop them and thus to create new jobs."
"In addition, and this is the most important thing, it is vital to improve access to resources and, above all, to provide better information to citizens about all the projects to which they can apply."
"(PL) Madam President, hundreds of thousands of Europeans have felt the effects of the economic crisis in a way which has hit them hardest, for they have lost their jobs."
"In every country of the European Union, the rate of unemployment has risen, and this is the feature of the crisis which most disturbs our citizens."
"Essential help is reaching financial institutions."
"Unfortunately, help is not reaching people at risk of losing their job in time, and it is they who will feel the effects of the present crisis the longest."
"Therefore, I, too, am pleased about the establishment of the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion."
"Especially worthy of note is the combining of this facility with the general objective of support for entrepreneurship."
"Funds supplied with the help of this facility will stimulate the establishment of new businesses."
"This is good news for our economy, because it is small and medium-sized enterprises which are its foundation, and it is SMEs which create jobs."
"The facility fits in perfectly with the concept of support for entrepreneurship presented in the Charter for Small Enterprises."
"It is important that businesses also receive that help at a later stage, and not only at the setting up stage, because financial resources from this facility will bring benefits to the people who use them and to economies only when the businesses which are set up are able to survive in the market."
"I also hope that entrepreneurship, particularly as it concerns SMEs, will not just be the subject of our debates during the crisis."
"We should adopt a comprehensive approach to entrepreneurship, because these businesses provide jobs for our citizens not just during a crisis."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it would be very important for 2010, the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion, to mark the birth of a new Community financial instrument, dedicated to microfinance, aimed at those who are disadvantaged in accessing the banking system but who have micro-enterprise plans."
"As we are aware, micro-credit has proved to be an extraordinary tool for creating self-entrepreneurship opportunities and widespread social value in developing countries, particularly for women."
"It has become a new strategy of the United Nations and of the World Bank, but it has also been trialled with positive results in many countries, in many European Member States, including Italy, particularly for immigrants, women and young people."
"By adopting this report, Parliament is providing, in the midst of a serious economic and financial crisis, not only a strategic opportunity for social inclusion but also a positive challenge to the banking system, since it is developing a new approach and new powers, in collaboration with non-profit bodies and local and national institutions."
"I welcome the adoption of many amendments, which I will not go over again, but I would like to say that today we are asking not just for micro-credit resources, but we are also asking that micro-credit ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the last month, the Commission has presented its new EU Strategy 2020 as a continuation of the Lisbon goals and, among other things, has called for a more social Europe."
"If we are striving to ensure lasting employment for Europe's citizens, then, particularly now in this difficult economic situation, we need to ensure that people can implement their own good ideas themselves in order to generate their own income."
"The EU microfinance facility for employment is intended to provide the opportunity for a new start and to smooth the path to entrepreneurship."
"The path to self-employment often goes in stages."
"Initial small investments are easier to cope with than to pile up large mountains of debt."
"A more manageable risk for starting out in self-employment is something that women, in particular, seek and they often ask for start-up capital in order to secure the start of the business and then, when the business is going well, to expand."
"Women want to grow with their businesses."
"Therefore, citizens need to be offered credit amounts that are as small as possible."
"By that I mean amounts significantly lower than EUR 25 000, which is the amount generally provided for micro-credits."
"Particularly during the economic crisis, the necessary liquidity needs to be provided to the population at large."
"If this provides a way to help to keep the often high rates of interest and administrative fees for micro-credits low, then it would give us an opportunity to give new impetus to the economy."
"I welcome the idea presented in the Commission proposal."
"The European Parliament committees disagree about the financing."
"Questioning the jurisdiction of European policy is certainly permissible in this area."
"The Member States have the prime responsibility."
"As I see it, however, funds from the Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity (Progress), particularly as proposed here, will enable people to go self-employed."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are discussing issues that are truly at the social heart of our society today - discussing mobilisation of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund earlier, and, let us hope, of Progress in the coming days - and this European fund for microfinance is the ideal and essential instrument."
"I believe that it is pointless to keep reiterating that this is what solves or attempts to solve the problems of the most needy citizens, which makes them more confident and more hopeful with regard to entrepreneurship and with regard to the future, so I believe that here we are not thinking of the damage caused by this perfect storm of crises and we are hearing much talk of the exit strategy, of how to get out of this crisis."
"We will only get out of it if we solve the problem of employment, which is our tragedy, so we should seek to ensure that things move as quickly as possible and ensure that firm guarantees are in place regarding the resources for this facility since we should mobilise much larger resources than those we have heard discussed this evening and certainly should not divert money from one instrument to another, since all three need this money."
"I believe that this EUR 100 million absolutely should not be taken from Progress since it also has the same objectives, but it should be a completely distinct and different budget line and must guarantee the mobilisation of much larger resources."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has done, and our fellow Members for their hard work in creating this new microfinance instrument."
"This European instrument will make it possible to grant micro-credits to small enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs and want to set up their own small businesses."
"In this time of financial crisis, the most vulnerable people, especially the unemployed and young people, have been the worst affected."
"In fact, over 3.5 million job losses have been recorded this year in the European Union."
"The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true."
"We should not forget that over a third of micro-enterprises are created by unemployed people."
"In my region, I am often approached by citizens wishing to obtain aid to set up their own business."
"I am convinced that this new initiative will bear fruit in preserving jobs and that it will create new jobs too."
"The proposal will facilitate investments of low sums and will give micro-enterprises an opportunity to grow."
"Madam President, I would like to welcome the real added value of micro-credits, which will go hand in hand with new support measures, such as training and mentoring, which will enable the youngest people and the unemployed to obtain guarantees and assistance for their investment plans."
"I hope that this new instrument to promote employment will be adopted as soon as possible and that an agreement will be reached between Parliament and the Council on making this tool, which is vital for our fellow citizens, and particularly so during this crisis period, a permanent one."
"Ladies and gentlemen, let us not forget that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the microfinance facility for employment is part of a set of initiatives that have been adopted at European level, and it gives the unemployed an opportunity for a new start and opens the door to entrepreneurship for some of Europe's most disadvantaged groups, including, of course, the young."
"The new facility should extend the range of targeted financial support to new entrepreneurs in the current context of a reduced credit supply."
"Individual entrepreneurs and founders of micro-enterprises will also be assisted by way of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building, in addition to interest-rate support from the European Social Fund."
"It is clear that, given the currently reduced level of bank lending and given the difficulties that now exist in accessing credit, if the weakest sectors of our society, the unemployed and disadvantaged groups, want to undertake an action, an entrepreneurial activity, all this must be supported robustly, because it is one of the instruments that can help us combat what is the natural epilogue to the financial crisis, namely an endless employment crisis."
"Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the signs are still negative with regard to employment."
"It is, however, necessary that the transfer of Progress funds remains unchanged, in the sense that we cannot give the signal to divert resources from the Progress programme."
"These resources need to be found from other sources and, above all, need to be associated with other European initiatives, so that we project a strong image and make a strong effort in favour of the unemployed in Europe."
"(FR) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to draw your attention to the fundamental importance of micro-credit in these times of crisis for jobs."
"Micro-credit allows the unemployed to make a new start, thanks to risk-sharing and financing instruments, making entrepreneurship accessible."
"Given the financial crisis and the significant drop in the number of loans being granted, I support the proposal by the European Commission to establish a microfinance instrument targeting the most vulnerable groups, and particularly women, young people and the unemployed."
"I would like to give my backing to my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party which, together with the other groups - socialists, liberals and conservatives - have tabled compromise amendments in order to set up this microfinance instrument as quickly as possible, starting in 2010."
"I also call upon the Council of Ministers to take responsibility for finding, in the current crisis situation, a swift solution to combat unemployment and provide a lasting solution to the funding of this micro-credit."
"(PL) Madam President, the Progress programme is an important initiative intended to help Member States effectively implement objectives in the areas of employment and social affairs."
"Last week, I had a meeting with the members of the programme committee concerning implementation of the Progress programme."
"My conclusions are as follows."
"Firstly, the advertising campaign, which should introduce potential beneficiaries of the programme to the scope of its operation, is not being conducted in a sufficiently visible way."
"Secondly, most of the information about tenders and competitions is available in only three languages: English, German and French."
"This constitutes a functional barrier for people who do not speak any of these languages."
"I think a review of the principles of the promotional campaign is called for."
"We should, as quickly as possible, increase recognition of the Progress programme and disseminate knowledge about it throughout the entire Union."
"(RO) The Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion supports and must support the application of simple procedures so that those affected can benefit from this in an effective manner."
"However, I believe that the microfinance facility should be focused more on people who have lost their jobs and are at a disadvantage in terms of access to the traditional credit market, and who want to set up or continue to develop their own micro-enterprise, including as a self-employed activity."
"I think that special attention must be focused on young people who, unfortunately, going by the recent European statistics, are facing ever-longer periods of unemployment or are hired on a temporary basis."
"In addition, an annual report on the use of the budget allocated will enable a serious analysis to be carried out in the near future and, if necessary, a top-up to be provided for this budget."
"If we transfer sums from one programme to another, we run the risk of undermining both."
"(DE) Madam President, today we have discussed the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and now we are talking about micro-credits."
"Both instruments are absolutely essential to combat the effects of the financial and economic crisis in the EU and to stimulate the European labour market."
"We need both instruments, as not everyone is destined to be an entrepreneur."
"Neither should it be the goal of our employment policy to make new self-employed entrepreneurs out of former employees and the non-self-employed workforce purely for business reasons."
"For such people, the term 'putative self-employed' would be more appropriate."
"The Member States must also take appropriate precautionary steps in this regard."
"However, for all of those who want to accept the challenge of self-employment, the resources must be made available to allow them to start or expand their business."
"Along with this, however, it must be ensured - and this is the duty of the European Parliament and the Member States - that normal social security continues to be provided."
"We need new money for new ideas."
"(LT) I believe that today, MEPs are completely unanimous in their opinion that this microfinance support facility is now very necessary."
"Living and working conditions have changed fundamentally and the scourge of unemployment that has affected almost every state is forcing us to put forward certain proposals that certain support facilities should be amended."
"Until now, most financial support was earmarked for large companies and organisations and on many occasions, it has been underscored that until now, ordinary European Union citizens have had little or no hope of financial support."
"I believe that the Commission's future solution to seek agreement together with the European Parliament is absolutely essential."
"100 million is the very beginning."
"It is a first attempt, but I am convinced that this attempt may be successful."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the discussion has clearly shown Parliament's support for the micro-financing instrument and I believe there are no fundamental disputes as far as the substance of the issue is concerned."
"I also believe that there is considerable proximity to the position of the Council as far as the substance of the issue is concerned."
"It is the issue of financing that remains open."
"Of course, the issue of finance is also part of the codecision process, which means that it will be highly necessary and desirable to look for a compromise and I am delighted that the debate has signalled a great willingness to resume negotiations with the Council without delay."
"At the same time, the debate has indicated the possibility of compromise in some areas."
"The debate saw frequent mention and frequent criticism of the Commission over the issue of the Progress programme and its use within the framework of this new instrument."
"I have to say that the Commission was not faced with a simple issue because it had to move within the framework of the existing budget or within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement."
"It was only able to use money which was available."
"When weighing up our decision concerning the use of Progress programme resources, we very carefully considered the consequences and came to the conclusion that although it was not an ideal solution, it was probably one of the possible solutions."
"It was repeatedly asserted in the debate that this involved some sleight of hand or shifting of money from one pot to another."
"That is not the case, since all of the analyses show clearly that resources used within the framework of the micro-credit principle are subject to an estimated five-fold multiplier effect."
"In the other programme, these resources would achieve an index of 1 while in the micro-credit programme, they can theoretically achieve an index of up to 5."
"From this perspective, it is not a matter simply of transferring from one pot to another but of a new use for the resources."
"I would like to reiterate that it was no easy decision, and I do not even think that it was the only decision and, in the debate over a compromise, a decent basis will surely be found, or at least I hope so."
"The idea of micro-credit is based on a clear statement that the current financial system does not provide sufficient sources for small and very small enterprises in particular, in other words, that the system does not make use of the human capital that is present in people who belong to so-called vulnerable groups."
"I consider this to be a great waste of an opportunity and I am therefore delighted that the Commission has proposed this instrument and I am also delighted that Parliament rates it so highly."
"As I have already said, the idea is to make use of the human capital that is in people who would normally not be able to make use of their capital in this entrepreneurial way."
"However, it is also very important to make use of time."
"In my opinion, holding an unduly long debate would be against the very sense of this instrument which is particularly needed in a time of crisis."
"I also believe that it will be needed in times when there is no crisis and that it will become a permanent component of European labour market and economic policy."
"Thank you for the supportive remarks and comments."
"Allow me to share the view of those who expressed their disappointment due to the Commission's lack of willingness to compromise."
"I must also say to the Commissioner that if we reallocate what are exclusively Progress resources, this conveys the message that, when it comes to resources for social inclusion, we can only envisage support for the most vulnerable if we take the resources from places serving the same purpose."
"We are unable to find any other kind of resources."
"I think that this is unacceptable."
"The codecision procedure also means that everyone, each party, must take steps."
"Parliament came up with a number of suggestions and proposals on this matter, whereas there was no such proposal forthcoming from the Council and Commission which would have helped reach agreement."
"I must say to Elisabeth Schroeder that the fact that we are defending the Progress programme here conveys our conviction - which is a shared conviction that we are still willing to come to a compromise on this - that this programme must be implemented as soon as possible."
"The assistance provided will only be effective if the facility can be launched at the start of 2010."
"If Parliament actually votes on this matter this week, then it will have done, for its part, what it can to ensure that this programme is launched at the start of 2010."
"As Parliament will presumably vote for the EUR 25 million from its own resources for next year, and if Parliament votes for the entire amount, this will be sufficient for the Commission to sign the agreements which can facilitate the programme's launch."
"I believe that this reflects Parliament's constructive approach."
"At any rate, I consider that this programme is extremely important from a social inclusion perspective."
"I would also like to ask those of my fellow Members who supported this to agree for us not to take the entire resources from the Progress programme and to lobby their own governments as well for resources, given that these countries' governments are the members of the Commission."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place tomorrow."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"The economic crisis has become an acutely felt social crisis for which we have not yet found a solution."
"Unfortunately, one of the indicators which could help launch a recovery, the level of lending, has reached a record low in the euro area since 1991 and is experiencing an unprecedented collapse in the new Member States, as is the case for Romania."
"This is one of the elements which cast doubt on the prospects for beating the recession."
"Against this background, I appreciate the welcome proposal from the European Commission on setting up the microfinance facility."
"However, in order to ensure that social inclusion measures are effective, the facility needs to be entered in a separate budget line."
"The reallocation of the funds from the Progress programme would affect its specific guidelines for community action and send out an alarm signal concerning the social openness of a European executive, which has been extremely reluctant until now, unfortunately, in terms of displaying sufficient social involvement."
"The crisis is affecting every category of vulnerable people, but we cannot ignore the severity of youth unemployment."
"The fact that one young person in five in Europe does not have a job may have numerous repercussions at an economic and social level, as well as from a demographic and crime perspective."
"This is why I think that it is appropriate to have a greater focus on boosting young people's chances of entering the job market."
"Since autumn last year, more than 5 million European citizens have lost their jobs, giving a total of 22.5 million unemployed in Europe."
"In this context, we cannot ignore the serious level of unemployment among young people."
"It is deeply concerning that one young person in five in Europe does not have a job, which has repercussions at an economic and social level, as well as from a demographic and crime perspective."
"In some countries, the percentage of young people out of work is even higher in proportion to the national unemployment rate as well."
"For instance, one young Latvian in three is unemployed, while approximately 43% of Spanish citizens under the age of 25 are affected by this problem."
"I think that more attention needs to be focused on young people."
"In this respect, the initiative put forward by the European Commission on microfinance programmes which are entered in a separate budget line will help encourage and motivate young people to enter the labour market, thereby reducing the unemployment rate which has risen among this group."
"The current efforts being made at both EU and national level must be stepped up in order to boost the offer of micro-credits."
"The European Microfinance Facility must provide useful assistance to the unemployed and vulnerable people who would like to set up or run micro-enterprises."
"I believe that the European Microfinance Facility must have a separate credit line as the beneficiaries of this scheme are different to those for the Progress programme."
"Progress programme funds must not, under any circumstances, be reduced during this crisis period as they are targeted at the most vulnerable groups."
"I also believe that the European Microfinance Facility should have a sufficiently large budget to make it really effective in achieving its objectives in terms of employment and social inclusion."
"Member States and the EU as a whole must continue to implement the Progress programme effectively at a time of global economic crisis"
"Toy safety (debate)"
"The next item is the statement from the Commission on toy safety."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - (DE) Madam President, honourable Members, we always discuss toys just before Christmas, and quite rightly so, as this is the time when people are most interested in toys."
"I am grateful that we are doing so once again this year, as the safety of toys is a matter that is of interest to Parliament, the Council and the Commission and for which we all set the highest requirements."
"The debate this evening has been triggered by media reports in one particular Member State - Germany."
"They originate from the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment and from the Technical Supervisory Association (Technischer Überwachungsverein)."
"Neither institution has approached the Commission directly."
"The German Government has not, as yet, come to the Commission with regard to this matter either."
"Thus, we do not know any more than what was stated by these two institutions in their press releases and what could be read in the German media."
"Nevertheless, it is a subject that needs to be taken so seriously that, even if all we have to go on is reports in the press, we still need to address the matter."
"The analysis in the reports we have before us indicates that we need to deal with four different issues."
"The first is a question that is very easy to answer."
"According to the statement by the German Technical Supervisory Association, a considerable proportion of the toys on the German market that were tested did not comply with the European Union's current legal provisions."
"In this case, ladies and gentlemen, the rules are perfectly clear."
"If a Member State makes such a discovery, it is obliged to inform all the other Member States and the European Commission of this immediately and put the necessary measures in place."
"They can go as far as taking these products off the market immediately, and indeed this means throughout Europe, and also imposing an import ban if these products are manufactured outside the European Union."
"I hope that the German authorities will very quickly notify the other Member States and the Commission accordingly via RAPEX."
"Should import bans be necessary, then I assure you here and now that the Commission will approve such bans directly and without delay."
"However, as I said, as yet, no such information has been submitted to us by the German authorities."
"Market surveillance - and I have to say this very clearly at this point - is the sole responsibility of the Member States."
"Neither the European Commission, Parliament nor the Council have any market surveillance instruments at their disposal."
"These are the sole preserve of the Member States."
"However, they are obliged under law, including under the current Toys Directive, to carry out this market surveillance."
"When I read news from Germany that it is doubtful that the country's market surveillance is in a position to meet the requirements of the new Toys Directive, then there is only one thing I can say, and that is that the German Government is under obligation to ensure that the German market surveillance authorities can meet these requirements."
"Thus, I think the answer to this question is fairly clear."
"The second question is simple, too."
"It is an old topic on which Parliament has had intensive debates in connection with the adoption of the Toys Directive and where the crucial vote in this Parliament resulted in a clear and unambiguous majority decision in a roll-call vote."
"It related to the question of mandatory certification of toys by a third body."
"This proposal was put forward by Germany."
"The German Technical Supervisory Association was behind the proposal, which was quite rightly rejected because certification by a third body would not provide any additional safety at all in the case of toys, which are normally not technically complicated, as it would be the prototype that would be certified in this case."
"When it comes to toys, however, the problem is not the prototype, but, as we know from experience, the problem is whether the high requirements that we set are actually complied with during the entire manufacturing process by all suppliers and all of those involved in the supply chain."
"As in all other areas, when it comes to toys, we abide by the principle that the manufacturer must take full responsibility for a product being in compliance with the law in force."
"Regardless of where in the world they are, we must not release manufacturers from this responsibility."
"If there is a problem with reliability in a particular country, we need to talk to this country about improving its production conditions, and that is exactly what the European Commission is doing."
"I am talking about China."
"We are in close and intensive contact with China with regard to the question of how we can actually ensure that the production conditions in this country, which is by far the largest toy manufacturer in the world, meet our requirements."
"Progress has indeed been made here, but there is certainly still more that needs to be done."
"The third complex of issues relates to chemical substances and heavy metals in toys."
"This is an extremely difficult and thorny issue."
"The political guideline that I gave to my colleagues when work was being carried out on the Toys Directive was to lay down the most stringent rules possible - the most stringent possible!"
"This view was also shared by the Council and by Parliament."
"As a result, the limit values that we included in the new Toys Directive, which will be introduced in stages from 2011 onwards, represented the state of the art in terms of scientific knowledge at the time the directive was adopted."
"However, we were aware that this is an evolving process - science is, of course, always progressing and there are always new research results and new findings - and, together, we deliberately framed the directive in such a way that new scientific findings that there are risks that we had not previously observed and that limit values have been set too high can very quickly be incorporated into the directive in a comitology procedure involving Parliament."
"According to the current legal situation, adopted by the European Parliament, the involvement of the competent scientific committee is needed for the assessment of the risks posed by products."
"There have been indications twice this year that new findings may be available."
"The first was via a letter sent to me by Germany's Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection in the spring of this year."
"The letter concerned cadmium."
"I immediately arranged for this issue to be submitted to the scientific committee, not only with regard to cadmium, but with regard to other heavy metals, too."
"We are expecting the results of their examination during the first half of 2010 - by the end of June at the latest."
"If their examination does indeed reveal new findings, we will immediately bring forward a proposal to tighten up the directive, which has not yet entered into force, so that it enters into force in 2011 with the more stringent limit values in place."
"The second case is rather complicated and difficult to explain."
"It relates to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, known as PAHs, which surround us all in our daily lives - we are not even aware of what we are coming into contact with."
"In this case, too, we received information that the limit values for these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may possibly be set too high."
"The scientific committee is looking into this."
"The results will also arrive in good time to allow us to make corrections."
"At this point, let me point out that we are dealing with a problem here that, as politicians, we are not really able to solve."
"These are technical issues that are extremely complex."
"I will quite openly admit to you that I do not always understand the extremely complicated scientific analyses that are presented to me."
"I do not imagine that there are many Members of this Parliament, even if everyone were here this evening, who could claim to understand them."
"We cannot understand them because we have not received the relevant education."
"To a certain degree, therefore, we have to trust our experts."
"This is where the problem lies."
"We all know, of course, that the history of science is full of examples of cases where the generally accepted teaching has turned out to be wrong."
"It is also full of examples of so-called minority opinions ultimately proving to be correct."
"As politicians, how can we decide when scientists disagree with each other?"
"We cannot, and this is a risk that comes with our jobs as politicians and it is one that we cannot avoid."
"The rule that we have in this regard in the European institutions is that we follow the recommendations of the competent scientific committees, and that is what we have done in this case, too."
"However, I would like to say quite openly that I take this issue so seriously that any indication, however small, that there may be new findings available - and even if we only find out about them in a newspaper report - is taken so seriously by the Commission that the issue is put to the scientists."
"The last point is quite an annoying one."
"In this regard, I have to say that I really would have expected an institute belonging to the government of a Member State to observe the minimum requirements of good scientific conduct."
"The claim by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, which has been widely taken up by the German media, that, when it comes to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, we have a limit value for tyres that is a hundred times more stringent than the limit value for children's toys is simply scandal mongering."
"It is pure scandal mongering and the scientists there know that."
"The truth is that the rules applying to the manufacture of tyres, in particular, to the oils used in this process, originate from the time before REACH and before the Directive on the safety of toys and that, in this case, one of these substances is taken as a reference value."
"However, this substance represents a group of around a hundred others."
"Thus, you need to multiply the reference value by one hundred."
"You then come to exactly the threshold value that also applies to other products within the European Union."
"In other words, since the threshold value applying to the use of certain oils in the manufacture of tyres is based on the smallest content of these substances that is still measurable in the product, it is exactly the same for toys, too."
"The content is defined in terms of the smallest measurable content."
"I can only urge the Federal Institute to withdraw this misleading and indefensible claim."
"It really is intolerable that we have to deal with such things."
"In summary, as regards the Toys Directive, we have produced a document which, to the best of our knowledge and belief, corresponds to what was possible at the time it was adopted."
"We have also framed it in such a way that new findings can be incorporated at any time so that our safety requirements for toys will always reflect the state of the art in science and research."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for the clarity and credibility of your statement with regard to the limit values under discussion here."
"On behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) - we also provided the rapporteur for the Toys Directive at that time in Marianne Thyssen - I would therefore like to make it clear that we, too, want to achieve and maintain complete protection in respect of all hazardous substances."
"We know that, in this regard, we have a particular responsibility for the health of our children and therefore our future."
"Particularly before Christmas - you mentioned this, Commissioner - it needs to be possible for parents and grandparents to be certain which toys are safe for their children or grandchildren and which toys they can buy for them."
"Like you, I, too, call on the market surveillance authorities in the Member States, in particular, in Germany, to fulfil their obligations and remove dangerous toys from the market."
"I believe that we made the right decision at the time not to implement certification by third bodies as a general evaluation criterion for toys."
"As regards the limit values, a similar appeal was made a year ago - as you mentioned."
"At that time, I wrote a letter to you asking you to refer the matter to the Commission's scientific committee, and that is something for which I am very grateful to you."
"I tried, back then, to obtain more scientific opinions from Germany and I have since received these."
"I would like to quote from one study by the Chemisches und Veterinäruntersuchungsamt Stuttgart (the Stuttgart Chemical and Veterinary Testing Office): 'Comparisons of the higher migration limit values in the new directive with the fifteen year old values in DIN EN 713 are ultimately difficult to evaluate from a technical point of view.'"
"With this, I believe I can explain that it is not a cheap way of palming the issue off on to science and saying 'we do not want to examine this any closer because we do not want to understand it', but it is a genuine and difficult dispute among experts and one institute in Germany is clearly putting its point of view across particularly strongly."
"However, I urge you, Commissioner, to do everything possible to bring together the scientific institutes involved to enable them finally to agree on a scientifically objective opinion."
"Madam President, at this time every year, parents intervene to ensure that letters are received by Father Christmas."
"Children ask for toys in these letters."
"One of these toys might be this one here, just as this one here might be one of the 104 toys controlled by the Federal German institute responsible for identifying dangers in consumer goods."
"I have just listened to the Commissioner basically blame the institute for doing its work."
"I have listened to him heaping blame on scientists."
"I have listened to him heaping blame on the Member States, who are responsible for supervision."
"I have listened to all this with a great deal of interest, just as I have listened to him constantly telling us, with a great deal of honesty and solid data, that every previous directive is improved every now and then with new data."
"That fact alone confirms that the Federal German institute has done its job properly."
"So we need to bear that in mind."
"As far as the directive is concerned, it is due to be applied in 2011 and, for chemical substances, in 2014, as you know."
"And another thing: on 17 December, in other words, the day after tomorrow, each Member State will go to the Commission in order to present its draft in connection with the market supervision regulation."
"These relate directly to the Christmas market."
"These relate directly to the health of our children, who play with the toys that we buy them."
"Finally, it is very important that the debate on toys should not be held at this time every year."
"The debate on toys and safety should really be held throughout the year."
"That is the Commission's responsibility."
"Madam President, Commissioner, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the views expressed in the opinion of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to the effect that the ALARA principle, in other words, the principle of 'as low as reasonably achievable', should apply in the assessment of carcinogenic substances."
"Secondly, there is consequently a need for the Commission to examine whether this principle is also satisfied by the limit values laid down in the Toys Directive."
"Thirdly, if this does not happen, we call on the Commission to ensure that, until the Toys Directive has been transposed by all the Member States in 2011, the limit values are laid down in the Toys Directive in such a way as to rule out any risk to the health of children from softening agents in toys."
"Fourthly, the principle enshrined in the Toys Directive, whereby chemicals that are potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction are impermissible, must be implemented with regard to accessible parts of toys."
"This must actually be achieved by the limit values set, as otherwise such a directive is worthless."
"Fifthly, this calls, in particular, for better and more efficient market surveillance, because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union."
"However, efficient market surveillance would also enable toys manufactured within the EU to be tested to see whether they, too, comply with the limit values."
"Sixthly, it is totally unacceptable, should this be the case, that lower standards should apply to imports into the EU than, for example, into the US."
"However, the threat by the German Federal Minister for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, Ilse Aigner, to go it alone and prohibit so-called 'toxic toys' herself is, in my view, completely the wrong way to go about it and totally counterproductive when it comes to creating confidence in the European internal market."
"Merely cultivating national popular opinion not only destroys confidence in the European Institutions; it also damages the German Federal Government, because it approved the Toys Directive."
"Madam President, Commissioner, we requested this debate in order to correct and clarify exactly what in these claims is true and what is merely cheap populism."
"That was the background to this."
"We would have expected the Commission to go to the press sooner, but if the matter can be cleared up through this debate, we will be very happy with that."
"I welcome the announcement that you are going to carry out tests with regard to heavy metals and softening agents."
"I believe that is urgently needed."
"I would like to point out that the number of new cases of cancer in children under 15 years of age rose by more than 50% between 1980 - when data began to be collected - and 2006."
"Malignant tumours are the second most common cause of death in children."
"We therefore need to act, we need to check whether these figures are correct and we need to respond accordingly."
"If this latest study by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment shows that the revised Toys Directive does not provide sufficient protection from carcinogenic softening agents, we will have to take action."
"It cannot be the case that children can take up many times the quantity of carcinogenic substances in just one hour of skin contact than are contained in the smoke from 40 cigarettes."
"These substances can be avoided."
"The study shows that this is technically possible."
"Seventy percent of toys sold are below these thresholds."
"Therefore, it is possible at any time to require the other toys to meet these limit values, too."
"It is presumably a question of price, but that cannot be regulated by the market alone when the safety of children is at risk."
"Political action needs to be taken to adjust and raise the threshold values accordingly."
"Of course, Member States are responsible for market surveillance, not Europe, Parliament or the Commission."
"We have also called on Germany many times to take its duties in the area of market surveillance seriously and to take the relevant action."
"However, that does not, by any means, mean that we do not need to take action where there is doubt as to whether our threshold values reflect the latest scientific findings, and therefore it is my hope and request that the new Commission will present proposals to Parliament as soon as possible so that we can then adjust the relevant limit values in the comitology procedure."
"(NL) Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the safety of children - our smallest and most vulnerable consumers - has always been a priority for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and indeed for everyone in this House, and it was for this very reason that, one year ago, we adopted a new, strict, Directive on the safety of toys."
"Thanks to the excellent cooperation with the Commissioner and his services, with the Council Presidency and with my fellow MEPs across all the political groups, we were able to complete that mammoth task; and quickly, namely in a single reading."
"All our institutions were convinced that we had drawn up legislation that was the strictest in the world and was being followed attentively as far a field as China and the United States."
"Parliament acted sensibly as far as third-party certification was concerned, and took a particularly strict line concerning the standards on chemical substances such as allergens and heavy metals."
"With regard to the substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR), we opted for a total ban, with a few exceptions under very strict conditions."
"This legislation provides for a transitional period, but that goes without saying - it is inherent in the system - and, in any case, this transitional period is shorter than the industry had said it could cope with."
"Ladies and gentlemen, either we got it completely wrong and failed with regard to this act, or science and technology have evolved to such an extent that the act already needs amending, which can be done very quickly through the comitology procedure, or there is nothing wrong, in which case we cannot play unnecessarily on people's fears and on their justified concern for their children's safety."
"I have listened to and believed the Commissioner, and I see that the European Commission is doing what it has to do."
"If further infringements should come to light in this field, I believe this shows we can rest assured that market surveillance is in place and that it is working."
"We have two questions, then: is the legislation still up to the minute, and is the market surveillance adequate?"
"If the answer to both questions is 'yes', we must absolutely avoid giving way to populism and must make clear to people that there is no need to worry."
"(DA) Madam President, thank you, Commissioner, for your introduction."
"If I have understood you correctly, you wanted to ensure that a study was started into whether there are, in fact, too many toxic substances in children's toys in Germany, as the study indicates."
"If I have it right, then I would say that your idea is a good one."
"It is extremely important for us to act quickly."
"If we have any reason to suspect that our children's safety is at risk, then we must act."
"Furthermore, we would, of course, appreciate it if the Commission could get back to us here in Parliament very quickly to let us know whether or not there is anything in these claims."
"However, I would like to point out that, when it comes to softening agents in toys, there are, in fact, a number of researchers who are saying that there is no safe limit."
"The only safe thing to do is to leave the softening agents out of our children's toys completely."
"I really think that we should take a stand on this and consider whether we should not have tightened up the rules."
"I am not sure that the rules are good enough, even those in the new Toys Directive."
"However, there is another matter that I would also like to raise in this regard, and that is that, a month and a half ago, we received a Commission study into how the new market surveillance legislation had been implemented in each Member State."
"It is indeed right that it is the task of the Member States to ensure that market surveillance functions properly. However, this study showed that, despite the fact that we have tightened up the rules, only two Member States chose to put more money into market surveillance."
"We ought to be able to do better than this."
"It is precisely to prevent terrible stories of unsafe toys on the market that we need significantly better market surveillance."
"I therefore also hope that the Commission will ensure that the Member States achieve this."
"(SV) Madam President, I would like to thank Commissioner Verheugen for coming here to tell us about this important matter."
"We have a huge responsibility to ensure that our children are not made unwell or put at risk."
"I would like to take this opportunity to put a couple of questions that I have concerning the commitments made by the Commission in connection with the negotiations ahead of the first reading vote on the Toys Directive, as well as ahead of our plenary vote."
"The party groups that were involved in the negotiations agreed to remove certain limits on noise levels because the wording approved by the Committee contained specific decibel levels."
"The Commission said that these levels might be too high and promised instead to produce a standard based on maximum levels for sustained noise and short noises."
"How far has the Commission got with its work on ensuring that toys do not cause hearing impairment?"
"When can we expect a standard stating maximum noise levels for toys?"
"I would also like to highlight the issue of the font size used for warning texts."
"Once again, we were told that this would be resolved via standardisation."
"What is the Commission's view on the rules that should be applied here?"
"When can we expect a standard that includes minimum font sizes for warning texts?"
"(PL) The subject of toy safety arouses very great interest, especially during the pre-Christmas period, when we are thinking about which toys to buy for the youngest among us."
"In the previous parliamentary term, we prepared what is, in my opinion, a very good solution for increasing the safety of the toys our children play with. Unfortunately, we have to wait for the effects of these provisions."
"I do, however, believe they will bring tangible results."
"I would like to thank, here, the Commission services for organising the Toys Road Show, because it is a very important initiative which is helping businesses to prepare for the changes which result from the directive."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am, however, disturbed by another piece of information."
"At the end of November, in the United States, the Consumer Product Safety Commission decided to recall over a million children's cots from the market."
"Another million will be recalled from the Canadian market."
"A cot is an item of everyday use, and children come into contact with cots more often, perhaps, than with toys."
"In view of the scale of the operation, I would be grateful if the Commissioner could comment on this matter."
"Can we be sure that the children's cots available on the European market are safe?"
"(DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I, too, would like to thank you most sincerely for the clarity of your words."
"Essentially, it should be said that, overall, the Toys Directive has brought a considerable improvement in the protection of our children."
"We all approached it with the intention of producing the most stringent legislation anywhere in the world."
"However, many parents and grandparents are now concerned - as you said - because of the studies by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment."
"We now need to ask ourselves whether or not the Institute's statements and opinion are right."
"In any case, we need to examine the facts of the matter very closely."
"It is a question of the protection of our children."
"At this point, I would like to thank you most sincerely for having stated that you are willing to do that."
"However, I think that things need to move more quickly."
"Not until next year, you say, during the first half of the year, will the findings of the scientific committee be available."
"It must be done quicker than that."
"It is a question of the protection of our children."
"I really cannot understand why the Federal Institute left it so long to come out with these statements."
"I want to make that point here, too."
"(EL) Madam President, dozens of instances have been recorded over recent years - 36 in 2000 alone - in which children needed immediate surgical intervention due to harmful substances in toys."
"I would also remind the House that just last week, a report was published in America which says that one third of toys in circulation contain dangerous chemical substances."
"We should therefore understand that the European mark of conformity (CEE) is not enough to guarantee toy safety."
"It is awarded following submission of a file by the company in question and not following preventive and spot checking of the product and, as a result, we cannot assume that toys are safe."
"In order, therefore, to ensure that our children - I do not have any, but I hope that one day I shall - receive gifts from Father Christmas, as mentioned earlier, which are completely safe and need not cause parents to worry, we must put pressure on the Member States to carry out more thorough checks and, of course, to strengthen current legislation."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted at the broad consensus that this debate has shown."
"Allow me to make a preliminary comment."
"We are dealing with a scientific institute, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, which I have been aware of for some time as a result of its tendency to make alarmist announcements to the public without informing the Commission or any other European institutions of its findings."
"You can judge that for yourselves."
"The only thing that I know about this is that the continued funding of this institute from Germany's Federal budget is under discussion."
"Perhaps that is one explanation for the institute's intensive public relations activities, while it clearly sets no great store by allowing us to examine its findings in any appropriate way."
"Nevertheless - and it seems I have been misunderstood on this point - even if we only read something in the media, we still regard it as an indication of possible new scientific findings and I have already passed this on to the scientific committee."
"The call for me to do this that has been expressed here is not needed."
"The moment that I receive an indication that there may be new scientific findings available concerning the safety of toys and the limit values that we have set, this information is sent to the scientific committee."
"However, I must reiterate that you cannot expect me, and likewise I cannot expect you, to make a decision in respect of the disagreements among scientists regarding methods."
"You cannot do that."
"I cannot do that and neither can you."
"I can do nothing more than say that the question of methodology in the measurement of possible limit values has been rigorously debated here in Parliament, in the Council and the Commission."
"Furthermore, the opinion of this German institute is not shared by any other scientific institute in Europe - not one!"
"If you believe that I am obliged to follow the opinion of a single institute and ignore that of all the others, then please tell me so and you can reprimand me for this."
"I cannot assume this responsibility."
"Not one of you can do that either."
"However, I will say it once again: if any new findings come to light, the process will be set in motion."
"Mrs Weisgerber, you said that the process should go quicker - unfortunately, it cannot go any quicker."
"These are very complicated scientific issues."
"Tests are needed."
"You are perhaps not aware of this, but extensive animal tests are needed, for example, in order to be able to verify this sort of claim."
"You cannot force scientists to produce findings within a particular timeframe."
"I am sorry, but that is not possible."
"I must therefore simply ask you to be satisfied with me telling you that the scientific committee has told us that it will be able to provide substantiated results by the middle of next year, and it will indeed do so."
"On the basis of these results, the Commission will immediately prepare new proposals if it should emerge that there are indeed new findings."
"I hope that makes it clear."
"Mr Creutzmann, the principle of using the lowest possible risk is valid."
"I do not need the help of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment to find that out."
"The requirements that you derived from this are therefore also met."
"Mrs Rühle, you say that I should have gone to the press sooner."
"It will surprise you when I say that I did exactly that."
"Just as I do not think that what I have said here this evening in Parliament will make it into the European media, and particularly not the German media, so my factual and, I thought, calm statement of the facts was not taken up by the German media."
"However, I issued the necessary statement and explained the facts of the matter."
"I would be happy to provide you with the text."
"Mrs Davidson, we have the most stringent legislation in the world."
"That is something we can take pride in."
"This Commission will not allow itself to be outdone by anyone in the world when it comes to providing the highest possible level of safety for toys."
"Mrs Schaldemose, I can only agree with you, and say that the responsibility of the Member States for market surveillance must not be called into question."
"I agree with you entirely that the question of implementation is crucial here."
"In this regard, too, we have made appropriate preparations."
"The last question from Mrs Hedh is a very important one."
"With regard to the standards for different areas, you mentioned two examples, one of them being sources of noise."
"The relevant instructions have been sent to the European standardisation organisations."
"However, for standards, it is no different than for other scientific work."
"You cannot expect them to be available in a week or in one, or indeed several, months."
"It takes time."
"However, all of the standards that we have talked about are in progress and will be available in good time, and they will also allow us to develop an exact comparability of the products and to strengthen market surveillance."
"There is one last point I would like to address."
"Baby seats, which have been mentioned here and with regard to which there have been some safety problems in the US, are not toys."
"They do not, therefore, fall within the scope of the Toys Directive, but rather within that of the General Product Safety Directive."
"We need not hide from the Americans in this regard."
"The system that we have in Europe with regard to the general safety of products has continued to prove its worth over the last few years."
"If unsafe products appear on the European market, we can now assume with a degree of certainty that all the other Member States and the Commission will, in fact, be informed about them and that the appropriate steps will also then be taken."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - I welcome the fact that the new Directive 2009/48/EC on toy safety will come into force in 2011, although it is regrettable that the directive will not be in force for the Christmas 2010 period next year, when the majority of toys made or imported into the EU, are sold."
"I hope that Member States will see fit to transpose all elements of this important directive before the final deadline for implementation in order to give parents, as consumers, greater peace of mind."
"Taking the opportunity of this debate, I would like to draw attention to the need to improve the functioning of the European Union's register of consumer accidents, which anticipates, among other things, collection of information about fatalities and bodily injuries resulting from the use of various products intended for children."
"The register should be an important element of the mechanism of the system for protecting consumers, including the youngest and most helpless."
"Unfortunately, according to an expert from the Technical Committee on products for small children and toy safety of the Polish Committee for Standardisation, rapid exchange of information between Member States and the European Commission on products which pose a hazard, and steps taken in particular countries to prevent or restrict their coming onto the market, is still not functioning satisfactorily."
"I would like to ask that this matter be thoroughly investigated."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"(The sitting was suspended at 22.50)"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Announcement by the President"
"First of all, I would like to read out an important piece of information."
"On 2 December, I received a Communication from the Commission, addressed to the European Parliament and the Council, concerning the consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision-making procedures."
"By virtue of this communication, Parliament as an institution deems that all the proposals listed in the communication for which the Treaty of Lisbon granted it competence have been resubmitted to Parliament."
"Parliament has also taken note of the fact that, by virtue of the communication, the European Commission has withdrawn certain proposals."
"In the case of legislative proposals pending as at 1 December 2009, the date on which the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the President of the Commission has invited the parliamentary committees to which proposals have already been submitted in the current legislative term, as recorded in the minutes of the part-sessions, to verify the legal bases and procedural modifications proposed by the Commission, along with any other amendments to be made in the light of the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and to decide whether they intend to adjudge positions already adopted under the consultation procedure to be ordinary legislative procedure first readings or to constitute approvals."
"It is understood that Parliament reserves the right, in all cases, to request that the Commission submit a new proposal."
"In the case of proposals on which Parliament had not been consulted prior to entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, it falls to the Commission to forward new proposals under the ordinary legislative procedure or other appropriate procedure."
"It is a communication about our legislative activities in the near future - a communication concerning mutual relations between the European Commission and the European Parliament in the legislative process."
"As you know, we are in a transition period - we are moving from the Treaty of Nice to the Treaty of Lisbon and, at the same time, we are beginning a new Parliamentary term."
"The new Commission still has not been approved."
"This all requires rather arduous work, which must be carried out in accordance with the law, between the Commission and Parliament, and this is the subject of the communication."
"Action taken on Parliament's positions and resolutions: see Minutes"
"Oral questions (tabling): see Minutes"
"Documents received: see Minutes"
"Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (announcement of motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes"
"Draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (all sections) - Draft amending budget No 10/2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009, Section III - Commission - Mobilisation of the Flexibility Instrument - Amendment to the multiannual financial framework 2007-2013: financing energy projects under the European Economic Recovery Plan (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on the following:"
"the report by Mr Surján and Mr Maňka, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010 as modified by the Council (all sections) (11902/2009 - C7-0127/2009 -, and Letters of amendment Nos 1/2010 (SEC(2009)1133 - 14272/2009 - C7 - 0215/2009), 2/2010 (SEC(2009)1462 - 16328/2009 - C7-0292/2009) and 3/2010 (SEC(2009)1635 - 16731/2009 - C7-0304/2009) to the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2010,"
"the report by Mrs Haug, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the draft amending budget No 10/2009 of the European Union for the financial year 2009, Section III - Commission (16327/2009 - C7-0288/2009 -,"
"the report by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on mobilisation of the Flexibility instrument: in accordance with point 27 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management,"
"the report by Mr Böge, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, on the financial framework 2007-2013: the European Economic Recovery Plan, second revision (amendment of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management) - C7-0305/2009 -."
"Thank you for the floor, Mr President."
"Minister, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, right at the start of this budget debate, I must say that I would like not so much to cause an argument as to express my thanks."
"I wish to thank the Council and Commission for the fruitful cooperation which has enabled us finally to reach an agreement and now table, in a sense, a joint proposal before this House."
"However, I must also extend this expression of thanks to the various groups in the House, because had these groups not been able to cooperate and jointly represent the values which are important to Parliament and Europe's citizens, it would not have been possible at all to prepare the budget."
"I was entrusted a year ago with the task of being the rapporteur for the 2010 budget."
"We got started immediately on formulating Parliament's political expectations and directives."
"These matters were discussed by Parliament in the spring of this year."
"It was extremely important, looking ahead to the future as well, that a decision was made from which lessons could be drawn, because we preceded the preliminary draft budget by several months."
"In other words, the EU Commission was aware of Parliament's opinion and more or less took this into consideration as well when preparing the preliminary budget."
"I think that we should also adopt the same timing in subsequent years."
"What did we want to achieve?"
"We knew that Europe's economy was in crisis."
"We felt and still do now that this budget must play an instrumental role in the management of the crisis."
"We discussed this point with the Council because another obvious solution to the crisis is for us to spend less on Europe."
"It is not a solution, but it may help the situation."
"If we spend the money wisely here and place huge emphasis on the good use of resources, the EU budget may then appear not as a burden but as part of the solution to the crisis."
"In light of this, we wanted to boost competitiveness, using research and development programmes as one means of doing this."
"We also wanted to lay the foundations for and contribute to a common energy policy."
"More than EUR 11 billion are being allocated for these purposes."
"We wanted to boost the economy, mainly via the cohesion policy."
"This facility is worth EUR 36 billion."
"It became clear over the course of the year that there were serious problems in the dairy sector, for instance, which were not a consequence of the general economic crisis."
"However, Parliament felt it necessary to stand up for the farmers, which resulted in the creation of a EUR 300 million dairy fund which, although not a permanent fund, still represents a EUR 300 million increase."
"With total funds of some EUR 750 million available, more assistance can be given to the dairy sector."
"However, Parliament would also now like to stress that this must be accompanied by a complete review of the dairy sector's problems and its restructuring."
"At the same time, we also had to face the fact that we had insufficient room for manoeuvre."
"Some headings have no margin, which makes a mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework inevitable."
"There is a huge need for this, but there is also a huge need for Member States to use the funds which they have available in a much more targeted and prudent way in order to encourage growth."
"Only then will we be able to look Europe's citizens and taxpayers straight in the eye, as it is their money we are spending in an attempt to make the EU operate more efficiently and successfully."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, today I do not have to worry about failing to mention something important from my report."
"Everything that has been drafted over a whole year with colleagues and fellow workers has already been sufficiently discussed in the budget committee, the plenary sessions and the conciliation proceedings or in trialogues."
"Most importantly, there is sufficient support for everything in this chamber."
"When we began work on drafting the budget at the start of the year, I was curious as to how far my advisors, coordinators and political group would allow me to go, since I had been told that I had already gone too far."
"I saw many unused opportunities and shortcomings that I wanted to sort out."
"Further opportunities and suggestions for improvement emerged from dozens of discussions with senior representatives of the institutions, departmental directors and other staff."
"Staff at the institutions have themselves begun to come forward with information and suggestions."
"I have the feeling that they hope and believe that we can sort things out together."
"On the one hand, I was pleased that they showed me such trust and came forward but, on the other, I would be even more pleased if their direct superiors could listen to their opinions and resolve the problems."
"I believe, of course, that most of the units carry out high-quality and professional work, but at this point, and in this place, I would like to emphasise the importance of personnel work."
"On the basis of the documented shortcomings, we managed to implement more systemic measures."
"However, it is not the rapporteur but the Secretary General of the European Parliament or the senior representative of the European institution involved who can uncover and resolve everything."
"I therefore warmly welcome the agreement from the arbitration proceedings with the management of the European Parliament concerning implementation of an organisational audit."
"For the first time in the history of the European Parliament, there will be a functional audit next year in two of its important units, the INLO Directorate-General and the security service."
"The aim is to bring about a more efficient use of resources."
"In the past, the Court of Auditors was the only institution to agree to external inspections of its work. The outcome has been beneficial."
"The Court of Auditors has managed to reduce its administrative costs and has achieved higher productivity levels."
"I would like to applaud the great professionalism of the Swedish Presidency."
"In April already, before our mandate actually came into effect, we met with government minister Hans Lindblad and his colleagues."
"We agreed on the priorities very quickly and together managed to introduce rational elements and points of departure."
"We are submitting a joint declaration in the plenary session today on the policy on buildings, which form a significant item in the administrative costs of the institutions. I believe that together, we have managed to initiate a process that will bring cost savings in this area."
"Ladies and gentlemen, it is only through joint efforts at a European level that we will manage to meet the greatest challenges of the 21st century: climate change, the risks and cost of raw materials and energy, economic globalisation and threats to our security."
"If Europe is to overcome these problems, it must have effective and complex instruments at its disposal."
"The Lisbon Treaty will bring us these instruments."
"In the initial phase of the treaty coming into effect, the EU will need to have adequate financial resources at its disposal in order to implement new policies."
"Even if today's discussion on the EU budget for 2010 really proves to be the last one this year, the work of both rapporteurs on the 2010 budget will not end but will continue for at least another three months for reasons connected with the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty."
"I believe that this work will produce successful results."
"Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, when we debated this year's budget in December of last year, we were already aware and, as general rapporteur for the 2009 budget, I mentioned in the discussion that the impact of the financial market crisis and its repercussions on the real economy would be felt in all the Member States."
"This is exactly what has happened."
"In April 2009, Parliament and the Council agreed on the funding for the first part of the economic stimulus proposed by the Commission."
"In order to make the EUR 2.6 billion available, we needed what was referred to as a minor revision of the financial perspective."
"How would we have been able to find the funds otherwise, given our tight budgetary constraints?"
"The remaining EUR 2.4 billion, which was missing from the total of EUR 5 billion, was to be found this autumn."
"This is where we are now."
"Autumn is here and, because Parliament and the Council have come to a sensible arrangement on the 2010 budget, we have a solution."
"The 2009 budget is also making a significant contribution to this solution."
"The 2010 supplementary and amending budget cuts the payment appropriations by more than EUR 3.4 billion."
"In line with this, the margins of the unused areas under the different headings will be reduced by almost EUR 1.5 billion."
"All of this applies to the 2009 budget, which consists of EUR 133.8 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 116.1 billion in payment appropriations, and is therefore not exactly on a lavish scale."
"If we take a look at the budget lines where the Commission found the necessary money, it becomes abundantly clear that the Commission simply does not take the budgetary authority's resolutions seriously."
"I would like to remind Parliament that in 2008, when we adopted the 2009 budget, our priorities were also the competitiveness of the European Union, growth and employment."
"This is why we allocated more money than proposed by the Commission to budget lines which promoted the social dimension by creating more and better jobs and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises."
"However, it is precisely these budget lines which are being plundered for transfers or amending budgets. Would it be asking too much to call on the Commission to implement the resolutions of Parliament and the Council and to make an effort to ensure that the money reaches its intended destinations where it will have a positive impact?"
"The draft budget submitted to us by the Commission has not been accurately calculated or carefully estimated."
"In 2009, we had more than 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets."
"It is not possible to talk about budgetary accuracy and clarity in this context and this situation must improve."
"Our fellow Members in the specialist committees must pay greater attention to the implementation reports in the course of the financial year and the Commission must finally live up to the good reputation that it still has of being an effective European administrative body."
"I hope that we will all work towards this."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, following the agreement on the 2010 budget, we are talking in terms of EUR 141.4 billion in commitments and EUR 122.9 billion in payments."
"First of all, I would like to thank both rapporteurs very warmly for their dedication and I would also like to say at this point that everything that Mrs Haug has just said about the 2009 budget is absolutely right."
"If we take a look at these figures, we can see that EUR 11.2 billion remains below the payment ceiling for the multiannual financial framework."
"This means that, if required, and if there is the political will, the multiannual financial framework leaves us some leeway within the agreed limits."
"In recent years, we have, on several occasions, found the solution to necessary changes in the economic and political environment by using reallocation, repeated squeezing of margins and multiple revisions."
"These instruments are in place, but with what we have done in 2010, they are definitely reaching the limits of their possibilities."
"This also applies to heading 2, where, after 2010 and given the possible margins, the air will be much thinner and actually should not be available at all."
"Now we have integrated the second tranche of funds of EUR 2.4 billion for the so-called economic recovery package into these agreements."
"It was the right thing to fund the second half, consisting of EUR 2.4 billion, in 2010 and not to postpone part of it until 2011."
"Of course, it was not an economic recovery package."
"In fact, it involved correct supplementary political priorities with regard to energy and the provision of broadband in rural areas."
"The use of the flexibility instrument has enabled us to find an additional EUR 120 million for energy projects and EUR 75 million for the nuclear power plant in Kozloduy."
"I would like to point out to the Commission that the way this was handled was very strange and I must also say clearly at this point that this is not the end of the matter."
"We are expecting a total of EUR 300 million."
"In that context, we are also expecting you to include the funds which have yet to be found for the development of the nuclear power plant in the mid-term review of the budget and not to finance this by means of more cuts in category 1 B. It is important that this is stated very clearly."
"In addition, we have carried out a revision for unused funds from 2009 so that a total of EUR 1.9 billion for energy and an additional EUR 420 million for broadband Internet in category II could be put in place."
"At this point, I would like to say that this decision on the total amount was the right one, but, of course, we must also make it clear today that our next task is the budgetary implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We surely cannot wait until 2014, as then we will be faced with further political priorities, which the European Union has to resolve as part of the globalisation process, and with other new tasks."
"The resolution to be submitted on Thursday states clearly that we are calling on the new Commission to publish a report on the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement as soon as possible, as provided for in the agreements."
"At the same time, and I would like to put particular emphasis on this, the Commission must commit to adapting, reviewing and modifying the current multiannual financial plan for 2007-2013 and to extending it until 2015-2016."
"In addition, it must set in motion the process for the next multiannual financial framework in order to be able to hold a proper open and public debate about the subsequent financial framework."
"This is the job of the new Commission and we will, of course, use both the hearings and the debates during the next quarter to call forcefully on the Commission and the Council to take on board these political priorities."
"We have an exciting time ahead of us."
"Mr President, it is an immense honour for me to be here today for your debate."
"The budgetary procedure for 2010 has been demanding and I am pleased with the agreement that was reached between our institutions during the conciliation meeting in mid-November."
"This agreement serves two different, but equally important, purposes."
"On the one hand, it creates the framework for establishing the 2010 budget with the goal of enabling the European Union to function as smoothly as possible and to implement policy in the way that we want it to be implemented, while guaranteeing a controlled increase in payments, particularly in the times that our Member States are currently facing."
"On the other hand, it provides, among other things, for the complete financing of the second part of the recovery plan."
"It is a significant contribution from the European Union to dealing with the current economic and financial situation."
"I would also like to express the Council's satisfaction at the agreement we reached with regard to the common foreign and security policy."
"I believe that the 2010 budget as a whole represents a balanced compromise between, on the one hand, the requisite budgetary discipline and sound financial management and, on the other, our duty to meet the expectations of our citizens."
"The budget also represents a compromise between the different political groups, the different Member States and the different interests of the Council and Parliament."
"It is not entirely the budget that the Council would have wished for at the start, nor is it entirely the budget that Parliament would have wished for at the start."
"However, I think that it is a good compromise that balances our goals and priorities in the best way possible."
"In this connection, I would like to say how proud I am that we, in other words Parliament and the Council as the budgetary authority, with a great deal of help from the Commission, were able to demonstrate the required leadership and sense of responsibility and reach the general agreement that we came to in November."
"I think this sends out the right signal in connection with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It would not have been possible without our joint efforts, as everyone involved played their part."
"Nor would it have been possible without the excellent and constructive atmosphere that, in our opinion, characterised the whole process."
"I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, for his strength, openness and skills as a negotiator."
"I would also like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Surján and Mr Maňka, for their constructive cooperation and express my gratitude to my colleagues in the Ecofin Council."
"In particular, I would like to thank Commissioner Šemeta, who fulfilled his role as an honest broker to the full."
"Last, but not least, I would like to thank all of the staff in the three institutions who, in a very professional manner, helped to make this possible."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak to Parliament before it finalises its second reading with Thursday's vote on the 2010 budget and on amending budget No 10/2009, which has, in part, contributed to the successful outcome of the annual budgetary procedure."
"The negotiations on the 2010 budget have required compromises and - may I dare to say - even sacrifices on all sides to achieve our common goal."
"This would not have been possible without the constructive and responsible role played by the European Parliament and the Council throughout the negotiations."
"I would like to highlight four main points."
"Firstly, let me point out some key elements of the conciliation outcome."
"Since the joint declaration agreed last April, we knew that we had to strike a delicate balance to find a source of financing for the EUR 2.4 billion of the European Economic Recovery Plan still outstanding."
"That could only be achieved through a compensation mechanism and by using all budgetary means existing in the multiannual financial framework."
"This was indeed a difficult constraint."
"Despite such a difficult constraint, we succeeded in financing completely the Recovery Plan in 2010 and, as the general rapporteur points out, in agreeing on an EU budget that can be a tool to help overcome the economic crisis."
"In times of difficulties, I believe the message to citizens is even stronger as we have also been able to respond at the same time to the unforeseen specific needs of milk producers, with the substantial support of Parliament."
"Last but not least, the two arms of the Budgetary Authority have acknowledged the need for further assistance in 2010 to Bulgaria's efforts relating to the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant, through the use of the flexibility instrument."
"Secondly, as regards the reserves, let me thank Parliament and particularly the general rapporteur, Mr Surján, for taking into account the responses given by the Commission in reaction to Parliament's first reading, in the so-called 'letter of executability'."
"That has led to an important reduction in the reserves entered in the 2010 draft budget at the time of Parliament's first reading."
"Thirdly, I wish to stress the importance of a smooth transition to the Lisbon Treaty."
"We are now definitively rooted in the Lisbon Treaty as regards the budgetary procedure."
"Despite the uncertainties relating to the entry into force of the new treaty, we have been able to secure a smooth transition into the new legal framework."
"The period ahead of us will be a challenge for all the institutions, as it will imply a modification of their approach and behaviour, with the need for reinforced dialogue from the very start of the budgetary procedure."
"The Commission is ready to play its part and to reconcile positions in the new conciliation committee, while respecting the rights of the two arms of the Budgetary Authority, on an equal footing."
"Today, we know that efforts are still to be made to put in place all the new legal instruments stemming from the entry into force of the treaty."
"Nonetheless, by building on the loyal interinstitutional collaboration developed over the last two decades, we have been able to agree on a set of transitional measures that will allow the 2010 budget to work effectively."
"Finally, there is amending budget No 10/2009, revision of the financial framework and mobilisation of the flexibility instrument. I take note that Parliament has also agreed to adopt the proposals on the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework and, as already mentioned, on the flexibility instrument and amending budget No 10."
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Böge, for endorsing the results of the conciliation."
"This shows that, to achieve our goal, we have been able to make the best use of the tools provided by the current interinstitutional agreement."
"I would like also to express my thanks to the rapporteur for the 2009 budget, Mrs Haug, for her work throughout the year on the implementation of the 2009 budget and her support for amending budget No 10/2009, which is part of the 'package' linked with the revision of the Multiannual Financial framework and the financing of the Recovery Plan."
"I have also noted your critical remarks towards the Commission about the need to improve its performance in terms of budget implementation."
"This year's amending budget foresees a reduction of EUR 3.2 billion in payment appropriations, which is significantly lower than the EUR 4.9 billion reduction of last year, and points to an improvement in the execution of a budget which, after the proposed reduction, is set at EUR 113 billion for 2009."
"However, there is still room for further improvement, and I can assure you that the Commission will continue to do its utmost to make best use of the authorised budget appropriations in 2010."
"As to the issue of the simplification of procedures in order to accelerate the implementation of expenses, while this avenue can be explored, I believe a careful balance needs to be struck between real simplification and the need to abide by the rules in order to safeguard the EU's financial interests."
"Once again, I would like to express my thanks to Parliament's negotiating team and, in particular, to the Chair of the Budget Committee, Mr Lamassoure, and to the rapporteurs for the 2010 budget, Mr Surján and Mr Maňka."
"I would also like to thank the Council's negotiating team and, in particular, the State Secretary, Mr Lindblad, for the constructive work done during the budgetary process."
"I hope that today's debate will be constructive and productive and will lead to a positive vote on the 2010 budget this Thursday."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this budget represents a response to the economic crisis, with its focus firmly on Europe's citizens."
"It is a budget designed to fight unemployment and kick-start the economy."
"We are therefore prioritising the European Economic Recovery Plan, with financing of EUR 2.4 billion for the coming year."
"It should also be noted that we are promoting economic recovery when we increase the payment appropriations for the main budget headings."
"With regard to unemployment and youth unemployment, I would like to highlight the proposal to review the Erasmus programme."
"We welcome the granting of EUR 300 million of additional support to the dairy sector but I would stress that a budget heading should be created to establish a permanent fund for this sector."
"We also consider it very important that the current multiannual financial framework for 2007-2013 be revised and extended to the 2015-2016 financial years, as we proposed."
"I must point out that tackling climate change, together with energy security, are EU priorities that do not feature prominently enough in this budget."
"As for the budgets for Parliament and the other institutions, which have now been tabled for second reading, they are the same as we approved at first reading."
"The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) repeats that rigour and transparency are paramount, and therefore it supports a long-term buildings policy, the implementation of a zero-based budget at the beginning of each parliamentary term, and a cost/benefit analysis of policies such as Parliament's communications policy."
"As for the new demands that have arisen with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, we support excellence in lawmaking and the demand for adequate resources to achieve this objective."
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Surján for the positive outcome of the negotiations."
"As others have done, I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that we, in Parliament, have been able to retain our important priorities in the second reading, too, even if we have had to make some cuts in connection with the agreement that we had with the Council."
"In addition to the energy investments in the recovery plan, we have also succeeded in allocating extra money to budget headings that are aimed at research and innovation in the field of energy."
"We have succeeded in safeguarding our pilot projects and preparatory actions, which are new initiatives that are being instigated by Parliament and, on a personal note, I would like to say that we in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are pleased that we have succeeded in securing funds for the Baltic Sea Strategy."
"As others have done, I would like to highlight two things. Firstly, the lack of flexibility, with regard to which I would like Mr Šemeta, who is, of course, continuing in another post within the Commission, to take note of the fact that we do indeed need this mid-term review of the budget and I would like the Commission - the new Commission - to take this seriously."
"Secondly, we need to look at things closely and ask ourselves whether there are any new priorities that we need to set within this framework."
"Are there any programmes that are not working very well?"
"Can the priorities be changed within the existing framework, or do we need to revise the framework itself?"
"We are, of course, in the position of having had resources as a result of the fact that plenty of money was allocated to agriculture to start with within the multiannual financial framework."
"However, this is no longer available, so now things will get difficult, as Mr Böge pointed out."
"Now comes the moment of truth."
"The next few years, when we will need to be flexible, will be very, very difficult if we cannot get the finance ministers to provide more money, and I think this will be more difficult than usual in the current economic climate."
"There is another issue that I would also like to raise, and that I would also like you to take into account in your future work, Mr Šemeta."
"Mr Maňka has done some very fine work with regard to administrative expenditure and we are now seeing very populist politicians saying that we must not give the EU's staff the pay rises that they are actually entitled to."
"In my group, we do not advocate the contravention of existing agreements."
"If people are dissatisfied with the system, they must change the system."
"It is no good simply to be dissatisfied with the result of the established system."
"I think there are good grounds for examining the conditions of EU employees and, first and foremost, examining whether the rules that we have in place for staff in the EU system also provide the leadership opportunities we need in order to attain the effective implementation of the EU's policies."
"It is several years now since the Kinnock reform."
"It is five years since enlargement."
"It is now time to review things once again."
"This is just something for you to think about, Mr Šemeta."
"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lindblad, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also believes that the budget for 2010 which we have negotiated and agreed on is a reasonable compromise."
"At the beginning of the budget discussions, there were still several open issues and gaps which had not been funded."
"We have now more or less resolved these problems."
"Parliament will pay one third and the Council two thirds to fill the gaps, so from our perspective, this is a reasonable compromise and we are in a position to start the new year."
"Nevertheless, I would like to begin by looking at the problems relating to the structure and inflexibility of the European budget."
"We have already heard about the political symptoms."
"The fact that we had 50 transfers and 10 supplementary and amending budgets in 2009 must make it obvious to everyone that the objectives of this budget, with its tight constraints and rigid structure, are clearly no longer up to date."
"We must all work together to change this if we want to do things better in future."
"Therefore, I will now move on to the questions concerning the forthcoming review."
"The budget which we are now adopting is a budget for times of crisis."
"This was a motto coined by Mr Surján."
"In this context, crisis refers to both the financial crisis and the economic crisis."
"However, while the conference in Copenhagen is still underway, I would like to add the following point."
"We are, of course, faced with a crisis which threatens our very existence, in other words, the question of whether we, by which I mean people all over the world, will be able to save our planet and limit global warming to 2 °C. To achieve this, we must all act together with regard to our budgets, our management of resources and the way in which we live and manage our finances."
"We must move over to renewable energy sources."
"We must reduce our CO2 emissions dramatically."
"We must become a low-carbon economy."
"Of course, we must also spend much more on research into sustainability, new materials and new products."
"This is the only way to create new jobs."
"We must do this in such a way that the European internal market benefits from it and that we open up new opportunities for the European Union on the world market with green technologies and environmentally friendly products."
"This is our only hope of convincing the citizens of Europe that the European project has a future."
"This also means that we - the Member States and the European Union - must jointly invest more in education."
"This is the main resource that we have in the European Union."
"We must provide support for it in quite a different way so that our young people have opportunities in Europe and also throughout the world."
"There is one thing that I would like to add."
"We must also change our agricultural policy and our agricultural export subsidies dramatically and focus on the Structural Funds."
"These must also undergo significant change with regard to the restoration of old buildings and sustainable transport policy."
"What is it that I want to say? The 2010 budget represents a step in the right direction, but it is by no means enough."
"We in the Verts/ALE Group have coined the term 'the green new deal', because we are convinced that only a joint effort by the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament in the spirit of Europe will generate the political strength and conviction to bring about major changes, to transform our economy and to create new jobs."
"Only when we can generate the political strength to make real changes will we be able to modify the European budget and the national budgets in the same way."
"With regard to Copenhagen, in the next few years, we will hopefully also be able to make funding available to enable the poor countries and, in particular, those in sub-Saharan Africa, to put in place new growth models."
"It is important that they do not copy our mistakes, but instead that we all cooperate - the industrial nations, the emerging economies and the developing countries - on moving towards a new way of living together and a new type of economy."
"This is the only way in which we can be successful throughout Europe and on a global scale."
"on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the EU budget has been suffering from a number of structural problems."
"It is too big and it keeps growing."
"There are built-in automatic increases for many items, especially for the operating costs of bureaucracy without any apparent improvement in output performance."
"All budgets are supposed to be mirror images of some economic policy considerations."
"The EU budget is an exception."
"It does not reflect any consistent set of common values."
"Instead, it tries to justify an EU-wide policy of neo-Keynesian demand management by spending more on a great majority of items without any underlying structural reforms."
"Take the example of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Half a billion euros is supposed to be spent on mitigating the negative impact of globalisation."
"Instead, Member States are having a hard time putting together rational proposals for a couple of tens of millions."
"On the one hand, it is a tremendous waste of scarce resources; on the other hand, it is a prime example of distorting the rules of creative destruction in capitalism."
"The Committee on Budgets was unhappy to see a new item - the cost of decommissioning the Kozloduy nuclear power plant - coming up at the last minute."
"It was a sign of bad planning."
"Nevertheless, not only the decommissioning of Kozloduy, but even support for the construction of a new power plant, would be more important than spending in the milk fund with this untimely and inefficient increase."
"As if it were part of a beneficial demand boost, the EU bureaucracy gets undeserved and unnecessary wage increases."
"When the EU is struggling with a once in a lifetime deep recession, it is just not appropriate to shield ourselves and our own administration from the negative consequences."
"Would it not be more appropriate to accept even a nominal wage decline and hence boost employment in the name of European solidarity?"
"It is also a worrying sign of inadequate planning that the disparity between commitment and payment appropriations is growing in the case of a large number of items."
"Since we cannot incur a deficit, we push more and more commitments to the future."
"It is tantamount to mortgaging the future of the EU and undermining prospective discretionary spending beyond repair."
"Many MEPs are concentrating on pet projects and pork-barrel spending."
"The budget should not be used as a backward-looking tool preserving the status quo, but as a forward-looking instrument to sharpen the institutional regulatory framework of the EU which, in turn, should aim at strengthening the single market."
"Less protection for vested interests is the key for the EU to avoid sinking into irrelevance on the world stage."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think we are in danger of not seeing the wood for the trees with this budget."
"The question I put to you, quite frankly, is this: if there were no crisis, would this budget be very different from what it is?"
"We all know it would not."
"That is the crucial issue."
"That, in fact, is why the report on which we are going to vote on Thursday recognises that the Council is not prepared to increase the funds available to tackle the crisis, is reducing the appropriations for the Structural and Cohesion Funds precisely when the crisis is happening and is severe, and, I repeat, does not give climate change the prominence it deserves."
"The report itself adds further criticisms, like those made by Mrs Haug."
"For example, there is an enormous disparity between the level of spending authorised and the payments made; spending remains below the planned limits; and we basically do not even know whether what is spent is spent well."
"In view of such a damning assessment, how can this House approve such a budget?"
"There is only one explanation: Parliament is the weak link in the budgetary authority."
"Even children know that he who pays the piper calls the tune, and it is the Member States who pay."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today we are also talking about the future, because within a year, Europeans will be confronting the greatest budgetary adjustment programme in living memory in each of our Member States."
"It is quite simple for the ordinary citizen: when one crisis ends, another begins, this time ostensibly to restructure public accounts."
"This policy is irresponsible and, in the meantime, it keeps the zero deficit in the European budget."
"The difficulties cannot continue to be borne by the same people as ever: the unemployed, casual workers and pensioners, through cuts in their pensions."
"The Union will only stop being part of the problem when it starts sending the bills to the right addresses."
"Without closing offshore tax havens, without taxing financial transactions and without issuing bonds, we will never be able to attack the crisis with the only response that can really put an end to it: social justice."
"You can therefore count on the left for a robust, radical and redistributive revision of the financial perspective until 2016, but do not count on the left to tart up a mediocre budget that neither addresses the social crisis nor shows the ambition needed to fight climate change."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the proposal for the second reading of the 2010 budget still represents a 6% increase in respect of 2009."
"That proposal appears to come from another planet - a planet where there is no financial crisis."
"Following the conciliation meeting in November, Parliament still deplores the Council's refusal to increase the financing of programmes under the grand heading of 'Competitiveness for Growth and Employment'."
"The Council must know all too well how such funds are used."
"Parliament also criticises the Council over the reduction in payments, alleging that this does not contribute to reducing the disparity between commitments and payments."
"The Council must know all too well that this disparity is due to the lack of intelligence and of consultation that characterises the budgeting process."
"The Court of Auditors recently brought to our attention that the amount of unpaid commitments presently stands at EUR 155 billion - or 126% of the current annual budget."
"Does this say something to you?"
"Parliament welcomes the increase in administrative expenditure - an increase which also includes Members' salaries."
"It is obscene for us to vote for an increase in our own salaries, all of which are to be paid by taxpayers who are losing their jobs and social securities owing to the reduction in national budgets."
"In the current circumstances, we should renounce any increases."
"The European Parliament rejects the budgetary cuts introduced by the Council in the structural and cohesion funds."
"Colleagues, are you aware that these are the areas where the Court of Auditors has found the highest levels of errors?"
"Does the European Parliament think we should be injecting more money into programmes where we are certain abuses are taking place?"
"In addition, the public should know that this budget does not cover the costs of implementing the Lisbon Treaty, which will be added through amending budgets - i.e. through the back door."
"One might ask how much this will amount to."
"'Who cares?' comes the answer, 'It is taxpayers' money'."
"As I advised back in October, British citizens will see their contribution to the European Union raised from GBP 45 million a day to GBP 50 million a day, while the British Government will be reducing public services so as to allow a cut of GBP 12 billion in the national budget."
"That is almost the same amount that the United Kingdom contributes to the European Union."
"There is no question that this budget is a burden and not a way out of the crisis."
"Colleagues, listen to your conscience and vote against this budget."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, regardless of whether we live in urban areas or in the countryside, we all form part of an information and knowledge society."
"Those people, businesses and organisations which are able to use modern information technologies most effectively have a significant competitive advantage."
"However, this also requires the necessary funding to be made available for developing and extending the technological infrastructure in the form of broadband Internet in rural areas in particular."
"This is where the second part of the European Economic Recovery Programme comes in and logically, this also supports the Lisbon strategy."
"Energy security, both now and in future, is an important issue at a European level."
"Bulgaria has decided to close the Kozloduy nuclear power plant immediately."
"This will cost hundreds of millions of euros, but the radioactive waste will remain a permanent risk factor which will endanger the health and safety of future generations."
"I am interested in the real, external costs of using nuclear power and how they should be calculated."
"It is high time for us not only to research and promote alternative renewable energy technologies, but also to implement them more widely."
"The joint declaration on building policy emphasises the importance of a medium- to long-term approach to building."
"For me, three things are important in this area."
"Firstly, energy-efficient buildings can result in a reduction of up to one third in CO2 emissions."
"Secondly, the use of building materials which are harmful to health, such as asbestos, must be avoided at all costs."
"Thirdly, I am, as always, in favour of policy being transparent and manageable, and this applies also to building design and planning."
"(FR) Mr President, I, in turn, would like to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached in conciliation."
"It required the intelligence of the Swedish Presidency, the effective contribution of the Commission, the competence of our rapporteurs and the sense of compromise of the political groups' representatives."
"May we thank them all."
"In my view, however, the big news of the day is not this agreement."
"When it comes to the future of the European budget, the week's major event is not taking place here in Strasbourg, but in Copenhagen."
"There, our great national leaders have taken two days to agree to find EUR 2 400 000 000 to finance so-called EU aid for disadvantaged countries affected by climate change, and this is just for 2010."
"We MEPs would have been considered irresponsible had we failed to make EUR 81 million in EU budget cuts, and here we see EUR 2 400 000 000 being plucked out of thin air."
"I welcome this outcome, but no democrat can accept a procedure that is so obscure, so devoid of all democratic control - all the parliaments, the European Parliament and the national parliaments, are going to be presented with a fait accompli - and which has such unfair consequences for certain Member States, since some will pay two or three times as much as other, equally wealthy, States."
"Nevertheless, let us welcome this first: our Heads of State or Government are recognising that common EU policies can no longer make do with a budget that is limited to 1% of gross domestic product."
"They are reinventing the European budget, but in a kind of parallel form."
"I am counting on the new European Commission and on the Spanish Presidency to help us lay the foundations of the new budgetary Europe, which no one now disputes is necessary."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we reach the end of a budgetary procedure and it is possible to assess the work carried out as a whole, I think that we need to ask a very frank, straightforward question: is this a useful budget?"
"This budget is a transitional budget, one marking a shift towards the Europe of Lisbon, a shift within the major economic and financial crisis which has affected the entire world."
"This budget is therefore awkward in two respects."
"It needs to respond to the crisis, but reflect awareness that during a crisis, the resources available are scanty."
"It needs to make a positive contribution to economic recovery, but also cut, reduce and contain spending where possible."
"This budget will make EUR 141 billion available for next year."
"That is not much more than was available in 2009, but huge efforts have been made, a great deal of work has been done on the priorities and on channelling the available resources to the current priorities."
"The focus is on two budget lines: competitiveness and the environment."
"Competitiveness, because it contains social policies, employment policies and the delicate challenge represented by the Structural Funds, which still constitute the cornerstone of redistributive policies within Europe."
"This budget line will be allocated about EUR 65 billion for next year."
"The environment too, which encompasses agricultural policy, will be allocated approximately EUR 60 billion."
"This 2010 budget, however, relates, above all, to the economic recovery plan."
"This plan attracted strong support last year, but it was not fully financed in 2009."
"Today, thanks to significant efforts to redeploy resources, EUR 2.5 billion can at last be invested in energy infrastructure and broadband."
"Substantial efforts have also been made, however, to shape this budget in accordance with the Lisbon strategy, to provide even more resources than those provided by the Commission in the draft budget for the Erasmus programme, for lifelong learning, because there is a question which we must ask ourselves honestly, namely, whether this is a useful budget, but, first and foremost we have a fundamental yardstick: the usefulness of the budget must be tailored to Europe's citizens."
"It must be a useful budget for every constituent citizen of Europe, and it is on the basis of this usefulness, tailored to the people, that I believe we must initiate and continue a sensitive debate on the review of the margins of availability and the resources that we wish to give to Europe for its policies."
"(LV) Mr President, I would like to speak about Europe's Structural Funds."
"These account for approximately 35.5% of Europe's total budget."
"Specifically, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Cohesion Fund from 2007 to 2013 total EUR 308 billion."
"In 2010, they account for EUR 39 billion in commitments, and approximately EUR 31 billion in payments."
"What risks and problems can be seen?"
"The most recent information is as at 1 October 2009: we are at the end of the second year, linear implementation might be 28.5%, the payments rate is 24.35%, and here are the first problems."
"55% of Member States are under this average."
"The indicator in the worst state is 40% less than the average, and the difference between the best and the worst states in the uptake of funds is 370%, i.e. a factor of 3.7."
"If we look at the individual funds, then in the reconstruction and regional development fund, 22% of the Member States are below the average, with the worst figure being 50% below the average, and a difference of 500% between best and worst."
"There are countries where the uptake of resources is five times worse than those that have the best uptakes!"
"In the European Social Fund, 22% of countries are below the average figure, with the worst being 43% below the average, and differences of a factor of 3.7."
"For the European Cohesion Fund, the worst country is 68% below the average and the difference between the best and the worst is 300%."
"Where is the risk?"
"If we look at this in comparison with the 2000-2006 period, when there was no crisis, then we can see that the states that are now lagging behind in the uptake of resources are among those countries that did not take up funds previously."
"Specifically, we have unpaid money of EUR 16 billion for the old fund for the 2000-2006 period."
"In the reconstruction and development fund, EUR 2.4 billion overall has been lost."
"That means that 20% of the Member States have not taken up this money and will not now receive it."
"In the European Social Fund, this figure is EUR 1.9 billion, since 16% of the Member States have not fully implemented the amounts."
"Altogether, that means that EUR 4.3 billion was planned for..."
"Mr President, we are all aware of the remaining EUR 2.4 billion for the European Economic Recovery Plan that has been committed in the 2010 budget, and I welcome the attempt to get Europe through this difficult economic climate in this regard."
"I feel the focus of this plan should be on innovation and employment and essentially limiting job losses."
"I hope that this will be money well spent and not wasted."
"These resources must be properly allocated and used in an effective and efficient way by Member States."
"I am glad that the promised EUR 420 million for broadband in rural areas has been secured."
"This will be a very important initiative in many rural areas and, if properly implemented, should encourage the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in those areas."
"I welcome the fact that the milk fund has been established."
"I think this was very much needed and it is a good example of this Parliament's achievement in the formation of the budget, with funds being used, let us put it this way, that were not being used in other areas."
"I want to speak a little bit on what I would like to see in the budget for the future."
"I want to see that the people it has helped are the victims of violence, the victims of terrorism, because I think we can do more in this area."
"These are people who have not been helped."
"They are not getting enough nor receiving enough help from their national governments."
"Where I come from, there are many areas whereby they are being helped at the moment through existing funds, but there are other areas where we could do more."
"After 2014, there will be no funds available to them and I appeal to this House to begin now to look at how we can actually help the victims of the violence of terrorism."
"I hope the incoming Spanish Presidency will be able to help me in this area."
"Can I take this opportunity to briefly express my concerns about the administration of EUR 60 million of funds in Northern Ireland."
"I hope the Commissioner for budgets here will take on board this particular point."
"The Northern Ireland Assembly has the responsibility of administering the funds."
"They are about 18 months behind in distribution of these funds."
"I would ask them if they are going to administer these funds that they do it efficiently, that they do it effectively and that they do it wisely at a time when people need to go to work."
"(FR) Mr President, in our Union access to a reliable and low-carbon electricity supply should be recognised as a fundamental right for every European citizen."
"To this end, our Union must conduct a genuine European public energy policy, and not finance, by way of a budgetary procedure, the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant in Bulgaria."
"Building a Europe of energy for all means recognising that energy is a public right of mankind, not a commodity."
"It means repealing all the directives on deregulation and liberalisation of competition in the energy sector, guaranteeing the public regulation and ownership of the entire nuclear sector, including on issues relating to decommissioning and subcontracting."
"It means creating a European energy agency that would coordinate and pool all the Member States' research and security efforts in the energy sector and guarantee equal access to energy for all EU citizens, and setting up an economic interest group bringing together all European businesses, public and private alike, that operate in the energy sector."
"This EIG would enable major projects - projects relating to distribution networks, to low-carbon energy production, to research and security - to be undertaken within a context of cooperation."
"Therefore, Europeans' money would be put to good use; it would promote development, and not just increase the return on capital invested."
"(NL) Mr President, the 2010 budget is being adopted against the background of the economic crisis, and additional care must be taken when budgeting EU funds."
"In this context, the Council has forced the European Parliament to set priorities."
"The ailing economy and investment in sustainability have been placed high on the agenda, and rightly so."
"In his report, Mr Surján consistently gives expression to the priorities of economic growth and employment."
"These priorities are reflected in the shifts between the various headings of the Multiannual Financial Framework, and can also be seen in the financing of the European Economic Recovery Plan, which rightly puts a heavy emphasis on new technology."
"Particularly relevant here is support for projects involving sustainable energy sources and the improvement of energy-network links with third countries."
"To this end, we are to help bring about the badly needed diversification of energy suppliers."
"This is a successful set of priorities."
"I should like to make one observation in this connection, however."
"We should have been rather stricter."
"If the European Union wants its work to be credible, it should be confining itself to its core tasks rather than inflating its own role in combating the crisis."
"Matters not falling within the European domain include education, culture and citizenship."
"Yet the request for more disposable funds, which recurs every year, is at odds with this."
"It should not be necessary to mobilise the flexibility instrument to make up for the shortfall in funds."
"A stronger set of priorities, on the other hand, would make us a constructive partner for the Council, particularly at a time of economic crisis, when Member States are experiencing shortfalls and are having to make drastic cutbacks."
"In short, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Surján, for taking this step in the right direction and putting the emphasis on economic recovery, yet without losing sight of the social aspects of EU policy such as care for children in homes, particularly in Bulgaria."
"(NL) Mr President, with one minute to speak about a budget of EUR 141 billion, one must of course confine oneself to the essentials, namely that, at all levels - Community, national, regional and even lower - so-called 'European' money is really spent less efficiently and less carefully than money from closer to taxpayers."
"To give an example, the European Court of Auditors itself reported that, until recently, some 11% of the huge Cohesion Fund was disbursed completely erroneously."
"For 2010, the figure concerned would be some EUR 4 billion; no negligible amount."
"This is objectionable and unacceptable."
"Now we are allocating an additional EUR 2.4 billion in the 2010 budget for the economic recovery plan."
"I do not oppose this, but I continue to wonder whether the European level is really appropriate, and whether Europe would perhaps do better to confine itself to the efficient coordination of tangible, determined action at national level."
"Finally, I continue to oppose the colossal waste that is commonplace in all the European institutions."
"(ES) Mr President, I would, of course, like to congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mr Lindblad, for the Council, and particularly the Commissioner, Mr Šemeta, who has only been responsible for the budget for a few months."
"I sincerely believe that he has done an excellent job and he has succeeded in finding a significant consensus solution for the conciliation in November."
"For this, I would particularly like to congratulate the Commissioner."
"It is the last year that we will be drawing up budgets in this way."
"I think the system has reached the end of its life and I think the political groups need to think very seriously over the coming months about how we are going to arrive at a new budget procedure that is in line with the realities of Lisbon."
"I will give you an example."
"This year we have had discussions in the area of agriculture, which have been virtual discussions, but which have had a real result."
"Next year, the discussions will be real from the start in that we have the ordinary legislative procedure, and therefore it will be an exercise in responsibility for all MEPs."
"Finally, it will be a real budget and, as Mr Lamassoure said a moment ago, it will be a budget in which it will not be possible for the Council to brilliantly decide on new budget lines in a few summits outside of Parliament, after which the European Commission and the European Parliament will have to do some financial magic tricks in order to be able to introduce these new and brilliant promises made by the Council into the budget."
"That has come to an end, and what we hope from 1 January of next year is that everyone in the institutions will exercise their responsibilities in order to genuinely draw up budgets that reflect the political reality and the economic and financial situation of Europe."
"(ES) Mr President, I believe we should be pleased with the result of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council for the final adoption of the Union's budget for 2010."
"We should also be pleased because we have managed to maintain the funding for the dairy sector that we adopted in Parliament at first reading, which could help our farmers to ride out this crisis period."
"I hope that we will manage to find a permanent solution and that they will soon be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
"We can also be pleased that an agreement has been reached to fund a microfinance mechanism for the European Union with fresh money."
"We can also be pleased because of something that seems obvious but is scarcely talked about: agricultural expenditure and expenditure on cohesion, which are the two most important European Union policies, have not been questioned."
"The truth is that today we can consider this to be a success."
"We can be especially pleased because we have found EUR 2.4 billion of fresh money to fund the second part of the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"Hidden underneath all this celebration, however, is a much less pleasant reality."
"There is no money to fund the policies that we have all allocated to the Union, or rather there is money, but there appears to be an unshakeable dogma in the Council: not a single euro more than what was approved in 2006 for the current financial framework."
"President-in-Office of the Council, this is not budgetary austerity, it is economic and political short-sightedness."
"Just over a year ago now, the European Commission proposed an Economic Recovery Plan for the European Union."
"It was a relatively modest plan compared with what there was in the Member States, but it was focused on boosting the future sectors of our economies."
"The Council was opposed at first because it was proposed that the financial framework be increased by EUR 5 billion."
"Following long negotiations and discussions, you accepted the plan, but we have had to do it in two years."
"You have forced the European Commission to do some clever creative accounting so that this money can be used without it hardly being noticed in the financial framework."
"All we can talk about is transparency and simplification, but the Commission had to draw us a wonderful diagram in order for those of us who work on the budget to be able to understand its proposal."
"I challenge you, President-in-Office of the Council, to explain this agreement to a citizen who is still interested in what we do in the European Parliament."
"This means that we are not creating the Europe that is close to the citizens that we all want."
"I am not saying this to be critical, but because until the Council changes its policy, European integration will be weak."
"We have just signed a treaty, but we need a new spirit."
"Either we stop thinking that every euro spent in Europe is a waste or we join the eurosceptics."
"On Thursday, we are going to adopt a resolution asking for a review of the financial framework in order to serve the new needs of the Union."
"I completely agree with this point of view, but I warn you that a review of the financial framework must be an increase."
"The new needs cannot be funded by cutting back on the current priorities."
"To make myself clearer - and I will finish now - we are not going to accept cuts in the cohesion policies or in the agricultural policy."
"(NL) Mr President, we are discussing the last budget under the Treaty of Nice."
"Next year, things will be very different: for the first time, Parliament will be able to get its teeth into agricultural policy and fisheries expenditure, for example."
"This part of the budget will finally come within the reach of Parliament, and I am looking forward to that, I can tell you."
"Anyway, we are now talking about the 2010 budget."
"I should like to make a couple of brief remarks."
"The additional money for energy and research and also for decommissioning the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria are positive aspects, but what I take issue with are the broad lines of the EU budget."
"Will the European contributions really make our economy fit for the future?"
"The answer is 'no'."
"Let us not fool ourselves."
"Let us use the forthcoming review of the financial perspective to set our sights on the future."
"I call on the Council and the Commission to really take this review seriously, then, rather than regarding it as a bit of a joke."
"The current budget is still investing too much in yesterday's economy: there is too much of the old support for agriculture and the regions and far too little investment in what is really important, namely sustainability and innovation."
"We are at a turning point."
"Do we want to turn Europe into an open-air museum where Americans, Chinese and Indians can experience fine culture and good food, or do we want to make it into a dynamic, progressive region, one that the rest of the world regards with envy?"
"In other words, do we choose stagnation or progress?"
"My answer goes without saying."
"Let us also take a close look at the financing of the European Union."
"We are going to have to move over to a system of own resources no matter what."
"In response to a request by our group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the Commission will be presenting a proposal on this."
"I am looking forward to this."
"The current system gives the Union too little elbow room and has the perverse effect of making Member States more interested in how much they can get back than in whether the European contribution is really effective."
"I also take the view that we need to do much more to halt the decline in world biodiversity."
"(EL) Mr President, we do not agree with the political approach of this budget, because it increases military spending and because it slowly but surely merges its policy with NATO policy."
"Essentially, this permanently excludes the potential for an independent EU foreign policy."
"The five-year financial framework cuts agricultural spending and fails to support the household economy, cohesion and the fight to maintain the climate."
"We want a European Union which passes legislation to protect consumers from speculation and citizens from the indiscriminate eye of authority."
"We have all been turned into prima facie suspects."
"I want to make one thing clear: we are against the budget, but our arguments are completely contrary to those we heard earlier from the non-attached members from the United Kingdom."
"We believe in linking national interests and we do not accept that it is right for each nation to retreat into its shell."
"That just leads to hostility and ultimately to conflict."
"(HU) The European Commission is planning to divert considerable resources to two areas in the modification of the 2009 budget."
"One area is competitiveness, which includes the research and development framework programmes, even though this was regarded as a priority until now."
"If we blame the candidates in this sector, this makes reducing red tape an even more emphatic requirement."
"The other area is the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, which has suffered a EUR 1.6 billion reduction."
"This fund is intended to be used for rural areas to retain or restore their population."
"Hungary is hit particularly hard by this problem."
"Hungarian agriculture is dominated by large holdings. They are the ones which receive the area payments, while their use of labour is fairly small."
"The rapporteur had some harsh words for the modification."
"He said that the Commission was raiding the main areas."
"My question is the following: why does he still support the approval of this modification?"
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lindblad, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to pick up on the call made by Mr Garriga for realistic budgets."
"What are the costs of the Treaty of Lisbon?"
"This has become a very urgent problem."
"Why can we not be more realistic with regard to the Structural Funds?"
"They have become our sacred cow."
"We already have outstanding appropriations from a period of two and half years which have not been discharged and we are piling up at least a further EUR 30 billion on top of these appropriations."
"We have a problem in the Balkans, where countries are preparing for accession to the European Union."
"As a result of negative resolutions from the socialists and liberals, we have little interest in finding out what is really happening in the Balkans."
"How are the different EU institutions in Kosovo, for example, of which there are now large numbers, working together?"
"These were all important amendments which this House has rejected and which I believe we should all follow up on, because we have a job to do there."
"Where is the progress in the progress reports?"
"We have voted in favour of the report of the Court of Auditors in which we called for a traffic light system, but the Committee on Budgets later refused to lend its authority to this system with corresponding reserves."
"All of these things are contradictions and, in my opinion, the House is not yet prepared to be realistic or to lend its authority to its own resolutions."
"I would like to call for a realistic approach to Kozloduy."
"The special report from the Commission on the use of EU funds in Bulgaria until this summer did not mention Kozloduy, although it has received money from PHARE."
"Up to the end of 2009, at least EUR 602 million was spent on Kozloduy."
"I have tried to find out what happened to the money and I have discovered that nothing has yet been closed down."
"Plans have simply been made for managing the decommissioning process."
"Kozloduy has demonstrated to me how little the Commission knows about what is happening with our money."
"It also demonstrated that the numerous subsidiary budgets which have come into existence make it more difficult to control the situation and also result in the Commission losing its overview."
"Therefore, we should at least stop pressing for the subsidiary budgets, because the result is that we ourselves no longer have any idea what is happening."
"(HU) Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, during the current financial and economic crisis, particular attention must be focused on growth, competitiveness, jobs and a more efficient and simpler implementation of the Cohesion and Structural Funds."
"Other priority objectives, apart from these, include increasing the security of the energy supply and its transportation, internal security, demographic challenges and the issue of climate change."
"This is precisely why we welcome the major parliamentary successes achieved in the draft budget tabled before us, connected with the economic recovery plan and support for energy investments."
"We also welcome the minor successes, such as the support granted to dairy producers or the microfinance facility for SMEs, achieved after lengthy debate."
"I would also like to mention the intelligent energy projects and support for lifelong learning."
"We must emphasise that it is a real result that we have managed to raise the EUR 2.4 billion for economic recovery."
"I am also delighted that we have managed to guarantee confirmation of the Galileo budget."
"Almost EUR 2 billion has been allocated to energy projects, which is perhaps the most significant result that the European Parliament can credit itself with."
"We have also managed to provide support for the safe closure of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria, and I would particularly like to emphasise the safe aspect in this matter."
"We have managed to get support for dairy producers included in the budget at the European Parliament's request."
"We must also stress that Parliament has made responsible decisions and acknowledge that we have allocated the budget margins sensibly."
"However, our margins are dwindling."
"Parliament can be proud of the 2010 budget."
"I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for this, Mr Surján and Mr Maňka."
"Our task for the future is to ensure that the Treaty of Lisbon not only strengthens Parliament's remit, but also that the EU budget, thanks to its reform, will also make life easier for Europe's entrepreneurs and citizens."
"In order to achieve this, I wish us great strength and perseverance in the coming years. Thank you for your attention."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my turn to pay tribute to the imagination shown and the efforts made by our institutions in order to release - via some budgetary techniques, as Mr Lamassoure mentioned, by some miracle - the very substantial sums of money that correspond to the second phase of the economic recovery plan, that is, EUR 2 400 000 000."
"I should also like to say how pleased I am with the EUR 300 million that we have managed to find in order to respond, in the short term, to the very serious crisis affecting farmers today."
"I hope that this sum of money and these difficulties will mean that we take a pragmatic approach with regard to their future."
"We should also pay tribute to the pilot projects and the preparatory actions which, as Mrs Jensen stressed, breathe new life into our budget."
"Beyond these remarks, which have been made very effectively, I should like to stress two points."
"I should like, firstly, to ask a question and, secondly, to adopt a political position."
"The question is this: I should like an official explanation as to how our Union is going to stand with regard to cohesion policy and the Structural Funds, elements which seem to have been caught up in the eye of the storm affecting certain EU partners."
"I believe that this is evidence of what is happening in Europe."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has come out well in these negotiations."
"I would like to thank all my fellow Members who took part in the negotiations and who clearly stated their opinion to the Commission and the Council."
"Now it is important for us to do full justice to all the issues relating to the Treaty of Lisbon, including the entire budget area."
"We have shown that Parliament must be taken seriously and that it makes sense to take Parliament seriously."
"These budget negotiations have made that very clear."
"Many of my fellow Members have already mentioned the fact that we have achieved our most important objectives."
"As rapporteur for the agriculture budget in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I can say that although our budget - the agricultural part - has been squeezed very tightly, we are still within our margins."
"We have pulled in our horns."
"We have achieved this ourselves in our committee and I attach great importance to this."
"It is a success for Parliament to secure EUR 300 million for the milk fund in the face of all the arguments against this made by the Commission over the years and by the Council, especially given the difficult situation which dairy farmers find themselves in."
"Other sectors of agricultural production are also having problems at the moment."
"This affects not only agriculture and farmers but also many jobs in downstream areas."
"Given the current situation, this creates even more difficulties."
"We need a permanent budget line for the milk fund and we aim to achieve this in future."
"We have allocated more money to the 2010 budget than we did in 2009."
"That is the result of the current situation and we are aware of this."
"We will act accordingly and do everything in our power to ensure that our agriculture policy is sustainable and innovative."
"(FR) Mr President, in essence, the vote on the budget is a profoundly political act, and we must learn a political lesson - a major, fundamental political lesson - from the budget being proposed to us."
"The European Union budget, and particularly this one, reflects the lack of a European political project even though, against a backdrop of crisis and at the start of our new mandates, European citizens need it more than ever."
"This budget marks the absence of a global vision for Europe."
"The Council and the Commission have chosen to let the Member States develop their own, often rival, recovery plans, and have abandoned efforts to coordinate an economic, social and environmental recovery at EU level."
"There has been no leverage attempt, no encouraging of European solidarity."
"The Council and the Commission are easing their consciences by applying a recovery plan bit by bit."
"Indeed, the 2010 budget provides funding for the second part of the recovery plan totalling EUR 5 billion, a derisory amount."
"Admittedly, it will allocate EUR 300 million to the milk fund, but this is insufficient when we know that in France, for example, the net income of farmers fell by 34% in 2009."
"The 2010 budget earmarks EUR 25 million for microfinance and, against the advice of the Council, allows the draft budget relating to Cohesion Fund interventions to be kept."
"It is therefore somewhat through the lack of an alternative and by default that we shall vote for this budget, because Europe - the citizens - cannot do without its interventions, however inadequate."
"Nevertheless, together, we must question - and this is urgent - the methods of financing the ambitious policies with which Europe must equip itself and of extracting the EU budget from its current restricted and unsuitable framework."
"Above and beyond major political declarations, the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, must tell us how he intends to finance the future European policies about which he talks so much, particularly those relating to the new strategy on growth and to climate change."
"From now on they will be unable to make do with such a feeble budget as the one we are being offered."
"(GA) Mr President, I completely support the European Parliament's decision to prioritise funding for the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"A recovery plan of this kind is necessary to increase economic demand and to re-establish the competitive capability of the region."
"As a result of the economic crisis, unemployment levels are rising in Europe and this is seriously affecting the European economy."
"Unfortunately, young people who are looking for jobs for the first time in their lives are the worst affected."
"It is essential that measures be taken to protect those who are under the greatest disadvantage."
"We must establish retraining plans so that those who lose their jobs today can quickly find another job in the future."
"The plan is designed to work with the European Social Fund and with the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund"
"Since 1973, when Ireland agreed to take part in the European Economic Community, the European Union has repeatedly taken a central role - when necessary - in tackling the country's unemployment problem by means of the European Social Fund."
"The Union has again taken on this positive role in Ireland and the recovery plan is vitally important in relation to this."
"Thank you Mr Gallagher."
"As the Vice-President responsible for multilingualism, I would like to say how glad we are to hear you speaking Gaelic in Parliament."
"Mr President, I should like to make four points."
"Firstly let me emphasise the need to use our 2010 budget and, in particular, the European cohesion policy financial instruments, with the utmost expediency in order to stimulate economic activity in all of the Union's regions and cities and create the leverage necessary to revitalise Member States' economies."
"Cohesion policy is providing a strong and necessary bridge between recovery from the crisis and long-term structural transformation of the European economy."
"Secondly, it is for this reason that the Committee for Regional Development has encouraged the Commission and Member States not only to use the financial resources available to invest in what are Cohesion Policy 2007-2013 priorities - climate change, knowledge and innovation, energy efficiency, renewable energy, broadband, sustainable urban transport and renewal of skills - but also to promote the leverage function of the cohesion policy; which is to efficiently use all the financial engineering tools which the cohesion policy has created in collaboration with the European Investment Bank in order to assist small and medium-sized companies not only to survive this difficult period but first of all to go the distance, to adapt to the changing face of the global economy, which is transforming itself, and to rise up to the challenge - and the opportunity - of climate change."
"Thirdly, let me inform Members that all payment applications for the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund from the 2009 budget, totalling EUR 25.5 billion, have been fully used, thus contributing to recovery, structural change, growth, employment and to climate-change energy efficiency."
"Lastly, in this context, I regret the cuts in support for candidate countries, the IPA regional development and human resources instrument, which addresses areas such as unemployment, social exclusion and education investment - a cut of EUR 7 million, which is 0.5% of the available operational credits that go to administration - without regard to the need of ensuring good local administration and without regard to the basic principles of good financial management which is so dear to this House."
"(RO) I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs for the results they achieved in negotiating the 2010 budget."
"Europe's citizens need now more than ever a substantial European budget to tackle the economic crisis and their problems."
"Member States' budgets are currently experiencing major difficulties in tackling the economic crisis, especially when many of the problems they are contending with extend beyond a national scope."
"These are global difficulties and require coordinated responses at the highest level."
"For this reason, I am delighted that we can present in this House today a budget which will finance entirely the second phase of the European Economic Recovery Plan, to the tune of EUR 1 980 million."
"We are likely to see the first shoots of economic recovery in 2010, however, national budgets will be hit extremely hard by the efforts that were made during the last year."
"In addition, unemployment is set to reach a record high in Member States."
"The future Commission will have a huge responsibility in helping Member States and the European Union's citizens overcome these hardships."
"However, I wish to draw Member States' attention to their responsibility in accessing European funds."
"It is pointless us making all the effort to negotiate to obtain money for the cohesion policies if these funds are not used."
"I join my fellow Members in calling for the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework to be reviewed as urgently as possible, failing which we will not manage to return here with a budget for 2011."
"I would like to emphasise one further last point."
"The 2010 budget will still introduce an innovative feature, which may seem of minor importance to many, but this is not the case."
"I am referring here to the launch of the preparations for creating a common European framework for the Black Sea."
"This action represents recognition of the Black Sea as an important European issue and lessens the discrepancy between how the Black Sea and Baltic Sea are treated as part of the European Union's policies."
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs and our Chair of the Committee on Budgets, my friend, Mr Lamassoure."
"I have five observations to make."
"The first concerns research, in particular, the sixth and seventh framework programmes."
"For the sake of legal certainty, we in the Committee on Budgetary Control repeat that we want the European Commission to refrain from recalculating, via new interpretations of the eligibility criteria, financial statements for completed projects that it has already approved and paid for."
"We repeat our request for the Commission not to deviate from international accounting and auditing standards."
"The second point is the inclusion of EU staff pensions in the budget."
"We propose that the claims against Member States in respect of staff pensions - EUR 37 billion as at 31 December 2008, an increase of EUR 4 billion since 2007 - be entered in the accounts as an asset, and we propose a study on the creation of an EU pension fund."
"The third point is that the Anti-Fraud Office should be supported."
"It should be strengthened so that it can do its job better, particularly where interventions outside the EU are concerned."
"The fourth point is that we would like the Commission to provide the resources to enable us to hold an interinstitutional conference with the aim of obtaining a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors. This conference would bring together the national courts of auditors, the European Court of Auditors, the national parliaments and the administrations concerned."
"The final point is that the European Union does not invest enough, and this is a personal proposal: is it not time that we included a section on investments in our budget and that, in association with the European Investment Bank - of which I propose that, henceforth, since we have legal personality, the European Union becomes a partner, alongside the Member States - we had an investment plan, notably on trans-European networks?"
"This covers energy, motorways, high-speed rail links, waterways, universities, education, broadband, health, space, and so on."
"Mr President, this is my first budget in this Parliament, and I have been very impressed by the consensus on what Parliament's priorities are and by the consensus that we should protect those priorities."
"I wish to thank everybody involved in this process."
"We have achieved a lot."
"We have not achieved everything, but I am pleased we have achieved so much."
"In particular, I am pleased with the declarations on the structural funds and cohesion policy."
"I hope those declarations are remembered when we decide on policy post-2013."
"However, difficult decisions remain for Parliament, such as that on funding for the Microfinance Facility - I hope Members will still regard that as a priority - on ensuring that we find the funding for Kozloduy in the next three years, and on finding funding for new priorities: priorities coming out of Copenhagen, priorities coming out of the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty and priorities coming out of the new 2020 strategy we will be discussing next year."
"We have to solve all these problems in the knowledge that margins are tight and that the Council will be reluctant to provide extra funding."
"That is why a fundamental review of the budget in the future is absolutely essential."
"We should make sure that the budget in the future meets our priorities."
"We also need to look at a new budget line for the Globalisation Fund, rather than to keep taking money from other lines."
"We also need to make sure there is enough money under the flexibility instrument so that we can respond and change our priorities."
"At the moment, that amount is not enough."
"If we can do all these things, then we will meet our priorities and, more importantly, we can show the citizens of Europe that this Parliament is relevant."
"Our budget should follow our priorities, but it should also follow the priorities of our citizens."
"That is the key message for us as a parliament, but also a key message for the Commission and for the Council."
"(HU) It is perhaps no coincidence that the preparation of the 2010 budget is attracting this much attention."
"All this attention is fully justified in view of the worsening unemployment and the difficulties caused by the economic crisis."
"As the rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to express my thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Surján, for the professional way in which he has handled the relevant dossiers."
"We specified earlier the following priorities in the opinion recorded by me in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs."
"We obviously gave number one priority to instruments aimed at alleviating the effects of the financial and economic crisis on Europe's citizens."
"We supported every proposal, including the 8.4% increase intended to boost competitiveness, that we hope will retain jobs or create new ones and contribute to the economic recovery plan, the renewed Lisbon strategy, as well as the lifelong learning programme."
"We also highlighted the tasks associated with the Social Fund, vocational training, obtaining technical qualifications and lifelong learning."
"I feel that it is particularly important that we managed to earmark EUR 25 million in funding for the future microfinance facility in 2010."
"Yesterday, we debated this new facility."
"Hopefully, we will be able to agree quickly on the other funding details as well."
"I believe that it is important for the budget to emphasise the significance of the funding for the activities and policies under budget line 1a."
"They will contribute to sustainable development and job creation."
"I would especially welcome the items intended to improve the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as the support given to the Progress programme, the EURES consultancy and information network and pilot projects such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"Taking all these together, I feel that the objectives defined by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs can play a major role in the budget, for which we owe a debt of gratitude to the rapporteurs."
"Mr President, in the last Parliament, much attention was paid to the Members' and assistants' statutes, and I think that was quite appropriate."
"Now, at the beginning of this Parliament and new Commission, it is time we turned our attention to other members of staff of the three institutions and examined the role of those staff."
"We are very privileged to have very professional and committed people working for Parliament, the Council and the Commission, but the reality of it is that within this Parliament, we do not have a grasp of exactly what a lot of these staff do."
"They have done what they have done for years."
"When there are 27 Member States represented in this Parliament, 27 Commissioners coming together from those Member States into the Commission, and Council Ministers going back to their Parliaments and coming here, it is very easy for the staff elected to serve us to actually take over the agenda."
"What I am asking from the very beginning of this Parliament is that the incoming Commission - I do not know, incidentally, what proportion of the budget is on staffing, but I know it is substantial - require a study on what it is that the staff of the three institutions do, to ensure that they are being efficient and effective and, above all, that they are transparent and accountable in what they do."
"I think that this would be an important public service."
"There is a sort of growing belief that there is a faceless bureaucracy."
"I do not share that view, and I do not mean that as a backhanded compliment as we have some very good staff, but that is not the measure of efficiency and effectiveness."
"We have to know what the staff are doing and, if we are serious about having a Lisbon agenda with an efficient and effective economy, then we have to be sure that the staff who work for our three institutions are being applied effectively, efficiently and accountably."
"I believe that in each of the institutions, there should be a deputy secretary-general who reports to those institutions on the efficiency and effectiveness of staff from time to time."
"I would ask the Commission to have this examined independently and fairly in the early stages of the new Commission."
"(PL) Mr President, it appears worth pointing out during the budget debate, too, that the law is a fundamental element in the life of society, and its cohesion unites our continent."
"The Court of Justice of the European Union plays an essential role in this area, and this is why the Committee on Legal Affairs has proposed a series of amendments intended to restore means provided in the initial draft budget, which will barely allow the Court to meet just its most fundamental needs."
"One of the most pressing problems is the matter of increasing budgetary means for 2010 for the translation of questions referred for preliminary rulings, which are a basic instrument used by national courts to allow them to adapt national jurisdiction to European jurisdiction."
"The ECJ has insufficient means to increase its resources of personnel working in its translation service, and this is causing delays to court proceedings."
"Granting additional means to the Court will contribute to an increase in efficiency of operation in this area, and also to a reduction of delays to court proceedings in Member States."
"The reduction of means by the Council affects what are already highly curtailed strategic IT projects proposed by the Court for 2010 to improve its quality of service with a simultaneous reduction in the number of staff employed."
"It is imperative that the means provided in the joint draft budget be restored."
"Information technology is a fundamental area which enables the new challenges of our times to be met, brings long-term savings, and offers the citizens better service."
"I would also like to stress the need to support the draft Reference Frameworks."
"In February 2009, a group of academics presented the final version of a summary of the draft Reference Frameworks which European institutions will be able to use as a basis for the creation of European contract law."
"At this stage, it is extremely important to make the Frameworks available in as many of the official languages as possible, to enable political and legal groups and other interested parties to have a thorough discussion on the subject of the future of European contract law."
"I am glad that the European Parliament will make good these mistakes of the Council and allow the Court to function in a better way."
"Mr President, like everybody else, I find this an extremely good budget."
"A great deal of work has gone into it, and congratulations to all those who were involved in it."
"What I would like to do at this stage of the debate is to try and look at the big picture."
"Extremely important contributions have been made about particular issues, but we have to look at the broad European context in order to understand the significance of what we are talking about."
"It seems to me that, in a democracy, every institution has to have a budget, and the institution must account for what it is spending to those who are actually making the contributions and who are providing the resources."
"This particular budget is, in consequence, loaded with responsibility."
"In fact, it is loaded with the responsibility of being the budget of an institution which is particularly committed to transparency and accountability."
"Not least, given our commitment to transparency and accountability, this will enhance good governance and, in an ideal world, it will increase trust between those who spend and those who provide."
"Perhaps I should stress that is in an ideal world - reality is often different."
"The particular significance of this transparency is that it can help to overcome the remoteness that exists between individuals and those who exercise power."
"This remoteness - I think we can all agree on this - is an unavoidable feature of modern life, so every institution should do what it can to bridge the gap."
"On top of that, there are difficult times ahead for Europe, and I think that enhances insecurity among citizens."
"What we can do in this context is to illuminate the issues by promoting debate and discussion which should, incidentally, include disagreement."
"From this perspective, I think the budget is an excellent step in the right direction, and I would like to give my strong support to it."
"Mr President, the 2010 budget is far from being generous - just like any other budget."
"Under the circumstances, we need to work with what we have, and what we have is the impact of a major global crisis as a priority."
"Everything else becomes secondary."
"As the rapporteur for the Committee on International Trade (INTA), I would hope the increased amounts under Heading 4 (The EU as a global player) will be well invested and well monitored so that they stimulate increased flows in trade and, together with the elimination of barriers, we should achieve stronger GDP and employment growth."
"The WTO Doha Development Agenda is the best multilateral platform to accomplish this task, particularly in developing countries."
"Therefore, there is a strong incentive to bring this long-lasting saga to a successful resolution as we will then be in a position to fight the nasty impact of globalisation with a truly powerful tool."
"(PL) Ladies and gentlemen, the budget for 2010 is a difficult compromise."
"On the one hand, it is supposed to act to limit the economic crisis and, at the same time, we are financing efforts to combat climate change, mainly by limiting CO2 emissions."
"This is good, but surely in the short term, this hinders development, which is an area where we continue to spend too little."
"The increase in spending on research and innovation is justified."
"This will improve our competitiveness."
"It seems we still spend too little on education, including the Erasmus exchange programme."
"It is good that money - although not enough - has been found for the milk fund, because the past year has been a difficult one for European farmers."
"If we want to stimulate economic conditions and reduce unemployment and social exclusion, we should increase funding for the Microfinance Facility."
"Financing broadband Internet in rural areas is important for development, but of course, as I said, this budget is a compromise."
"(FR) Mr President, I should like to take the floor under the catch-the-eye procedure since, earlier, I had only one minute of speaking time when the agenda said I had two."
"I would just like to add something: although I will join the rest of my group in voting in favour, on Thursday, of the budget we are debating, I nevertheless wish to stress that we are experiencing not only an economic, financial and environmental crisis - as was pointed out earlier - but also a very profound social crisis linked to the rise in unemployment."
"Although the budget strikes a delicate balance, I, for my part, regret the Member States' failure to take account of strong political signals sent out precisely to those people experiencing difficulties."
"The wish was expressed that additional funding be provided as part of the plan to help the poorest citizens, but unfortunately, it has not been acted upon."
"I regret that, because it would have sent out a strong signal that we are moving in the direction of a more social Europe."
"(LT) Thank you, Mr President, Council, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the 2010 budget really is an example of a good compromise."
"I definitely do not agree with those colleagues who have said that the 2010 budget is a crisis budget."
"We, the representatives of some states, know very well what a crisis budget is, when budget revenues have decreased by 30% and more in two years."
"We must congratulate the Commission for certain priorities; together with the Council and Parliament, it mobilised additional funds, in particular, to finance the Economic Recovery Plan, for example, to increase broadband Internet access, and also to fund the SET-Plan."
"I would also like to mention that there are some problematic areas."
"Nevertheless I would like to draw attention to the speech made by my fellow Member, Mr Godmanis, in which he mentioned that for more than a year, individual states have failed to manage financial support."
"Therefore, I really think that this is a good budget, it should be supported and I congratulate the Commission."
"Mr President, briefly, I want to stress one thing as the Commissioner is here."
"We have a problem: in the Committee on Regional Development, we are still working on the proposals for changes whereby, for 2009-2010, the European Commission (EC) will not ask the Member States for cofinancing."
"The entire funds amount to more than EUR 6.6 billion."
"We have adopted the 2010 budget, but there is no money in this budget to provide for those needs; the 2009 budget is finished."
"The Committee on Regional Development is still waiting for the new EC proposal because the previous proposal was rejected by the Council."
"We have to be very clear on what we have to do next."
"My understanding is that there is no room for this proposal, but the situation has to be qualified."
"Otherwise, the Committee on Regional Development will be working in one direction, and we in the Committee on Budgets will have no idea what we can do because we have no more money for these proposals in the upcoming 2010 budget."
"(PT) Mr President, in the midst of the economic and social crisis, which is having terrible effects on employment and people's living conditions, I am sorry to say that this draft Community budget for 2010 does not go nearly far enough."
"It does not even take account of either the financial perspectives, which suggested 1.1% of the Community's Gross National Income, or the draft submitted and approved at first reading in this budget, which was for 1.08% of Community GNI."
"The draft which is now here for approval perpetuates a budget that prioritises and finances the European Union's neoliberal and militaristic tendencies."
"It should be noted that this first budget under the Treaty of Lisbon is to the detriment of the much-vaunted policy of economic and social cohesion, which now receives a much smaller share."
"In total payments, the cuts in cohesion spending amount to roughly EUR 2.5 billion compared with what was approved at first reading."
"For all these reasons, we cannot agree with this draft budget, which is over EUR 11 billion smaller than was planned in the multiannual financial framework for 2010."
"Mr President, I think this has been an exciting debate."
"We have had differing views and that is how it should be."
"Some people want to slim down the budget."
"However, it seems that many people will not be completely satisfied until all of the national budgets are transferred to the EU."
"Fortunately, transferring all power to the European Parliament is probably not what our voters want."
"I received a direct question from Mr Färm."
"To listen to Mr Färm, it would seem as though we would have no employment policy in Europe if we did not have micro-credits."
"That is not the case, of course."
"The various Member States are investing enormous amounts of money in supporting the economy and employment."
"In addition, Europe is making substantial general increases in the budget, including the provision of EUR 5 billion through the recovery plan."
"Finally, we also have the European Central Bank's very expansive policy."
"Thus, we no doubt have a very powerful policy for employment and growth."
"If Mr Färm believes that micro-credits are something that should be prioritised, something else will, of course, need to be given a lower priority."
"It is all about choices."
"However, simply wanting to have more and to send the bill to the various Member States is not, of course, an acceptable solution."
"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your inspiring speeches."
"I would like to thank the representatives of the European institutions, the Presidency of the European Parliament, the shadow rapporteurs, coordinators and all of you."
"Everything has taken place this year under the leadership of two Budget Committee chairs."
"In the first half of the year, it was Mr Böge, and in the second, Mr Lamassoure."
"Mr Böge, Mr Lamassoure, I am sure I am not the first to tell you that you have both made a great contribution to the work of the committee and the entire budget process."
"I appreciate the cooperation of the Swedish Presidency and the Commissioner."
"The women and men who do not appear officially are our advisors, assistants and administrative staff."
"However, they are key people."
"Without them we would not have achieved today's result."
"I would like to thank them all."
"Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Treaty will have an impact on the entire range of services of the European Parliament and the other institutions."
"For the European Parliament, codecision making will increase dramatically, covering up to 95% of the legislation in areas such as freedom, security and justice, agriculture, fisheries, research and structural funds."
"There will be greater use of qualified majority voting in the Council and the creation of a number of new legal foundations in areas such as tourism, sport, energy, civil defence and administrative cooperation."
"This will increase the legislative activities of the EU generally with a significant overall impact on the powers of the European Parliament and its activities and therefore also on the need to boost the administration."
"In the coming months, we will examine and quantify the financial resources necessary for implementing the new policies of the EU connected with the Lisbon Treaty."
"I believe that together, we will succeed in setting out the next budget process."
"Mr President, I would like to thank all my fellow Members."
"We have managed to find a common position with regard to the Council."
"However, I would also like to thank the Council and the Presidency of the Council very warmly at this point."
"Anyone who knows me will be aware that I am normally very sparing with praise and thanks."
"Nevertheless, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Swedish Presidency and, in particular, Mr Lindblad, for its work and its constant presence during the discussions on budget issues."
"This made a pleasant contrast to the other Council presidencies that I have experienced during the course of my long career as a Member of Parliament."
"Thank you very much."
"This morning, many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion, there were many more Members involved than usual."
"The majority of them referred to the limitations of the budget and its structure."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we can confidently assume that the 2010 budget will be the last of its kind, the last with this structure, which leads us to believe that we can finance the necessary policies of the European Union and its new challenges and tasks in this way."
"We expect the new Commission to carry out the mid-term review quickly, as, under the terms of the agreements made in 2006, this should have been submitted by 2009 at the latest, in other words, by the end of this year."
"To spell it out, we also expect a revision proposal for the current financial perspective."
"We cannot wait until 2014 for reform."
"We need sustainable instruments now, so that the European Union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy, as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Lamassoure, has just called for on behalf of all of us."
"Mr President, now that we have all agreed on the 2010 budget, in line with political realities, today we must, of course, focus our attention on what lies before us in the next few months."
"As the European Council has granted itself EUR 23.5 million using a very one-sided process, we will also have to put in place the necessary supplements to the parliamentary budget very rapidly, in order to maintain the balance between the institutions and to ensure the ability of Parliament to respond to the challenges posed by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"We will also have to pay sufficient attention to the ability of the groups, the committees and, in particular, the individual Members, to act with regard to the tasks that face us."
"In addition, we will have to hold general discussions over the next few months on adjustments, reviews and revisions."
"This concerns adjusting, renewing and enhancing the interinstitutional agreement."
"It is about linking up parts of the interinstitutional agreement into a multiannual financial framework, which has a different decision-making process on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is about the codecision procedure in the Financial Regulation."
"In addition, it relates, for example, to the large package to develop the European External Action Service, with regard both to guaranteeing Parliament's budgetary rights and to the possible adjustments to the legal bases that may be necessary for the multiannual programmes of the External Action Service."
"For this reason, I would like at this point to say once again that without adjustments, reviews and revisions, nothing can be done."
"We cannot put off indefinitely the necessary process of phasing in the budgetary challenges of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"I expect the new Commission to begin work very quickly and to make proposals which guarantee the rights of Parliament in every area and which do not attempt to modify individual rights through the back door, as this could be to the disadvantage of Parliament."
"We know how to stop this happening."
"If we want to increase Europeans' sense of security in 2010, we need to implement this budget in an effective and practical manner."
"This is exactly why we have increased energy security, are supporting the creation of jobs and introducing a microfinance facility."
"We also support research and development, as well as lifelong learning."
"We want to help the dairy sector and alleviate, as far as possible, the harmful effects of climate change."
"We have all achieved this by spending every last penny of the resources received through the multiannual financial framework."
"However, this means that the budget has become completely inflexible, failing to provide sufficient margin."
"This is another reason for the great urgency of the mid-term review, which I am also reiterating."
"The Commission and Member States share particular responsibility for future success."
"We can only look taxpayers straight in the eye if we use the framework available to us not only lawfully, but purposefully as well."
"If there are resources available for creating new jobs, the number of jobs will actually increase."
"If there are other resources available allowing underdeveloped regions to catch up, the volume of the GDP produced locally in these regions will actually grow."
"Only when we are in control of these conditions can we say that we have received value for our money and that it was worthwhile Europe's citizens making the sacrifice, because the current contribution to the EU budget of EUR 123 billion is certainly a sacrifice."
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, I hope that this Parliament will give its firm support to the current report which has been tabled, and that on Thursday, we will give Europe's citizens a good budget which is not only legally sound, but morally sound as well."
"The joint debate is closed."
"The vote on Jutta Haug's report will take place tomorrow."
"The vote on the Surján, Maňka and Böge reports will take place on Thursday."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"My colleague from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), Mr Surján, and Mr Maňka have completed an important task."
"Just as with a budget debate in any national parliament, we also need to make it quite clear in this House what a draft budget specifically contains and the message which this conveys to society."
"In spite of the fact that there was no mention of accessibility in the report, I would like to draw your attention to the following: based on the decision made by the General Affairs Council on 26 November, the EU has joined the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as a regional organisation."
"In light of this and in accordance with paragraph 43 and the provisions contained in Appendix 2 of the report, we should welcome the joint declaration made on the policy on buildings."
"However, it is very important that accessibility is included in the case of construction and other infrastructure investments as well, in addition to complying with the other important requirements (e.g. energy savings)."
"The additional costs for accessibility are always much higher."
"As part of this, it is of paramount importance that the European Parliament also considers the visually impaired with regard to safety requirements."
"For instance, when designing buildings and getting them ready for use, clearly visible signs should be used, along with tactile floor markings to help the visually impaired find their way."
"In addition, in connection with language rights, I would consider it important that along with making buildings accessible, documents (including electronic versions) should also contain appropriate information about how the visually impaired can gain access (what the recommended software packages are)."
"During an economic crisis, when the citizens of Europe are being subjected to waves of redundancies and cuts in social services, the European Union must also make savings."
"Next year, the EU plans to spend about EUR 123 billion, which is seven billion more than this year."
"In difficult economic times, measures are, of course, needed to stimulate the economy, but it is doubtful whether instruments such as the European Economic Recovery Programme can achieve this."
"In the past, much-vaunted EU programmes have turned out to be paper tigers."
"In addition, various EU subsidies have proved to be an invitation to commit abuses of many different kinds."
"For years, the European Court of Auditors has been identifying in its annual reports blatant faults in the agricultural and structural funds."
"This means that hard-earned taxpayers' money has, for years, been trickling away into mysterious channels."
"The complicated regulations which even Brussels eurocrats often find confusing are a major contributor to the defective nature of the system."
"The EU does not even have control over the recovery of funds which have been paid out mistakenly."
"Therefore, continuing to inflate the EU budget is the wrong route to take."
"Instead, the errors should be eliminated from the system by means of far-reaching renationalisation measures, for example, in the agricultural sector."
"This would allow the Member States to decide for themselves which areas they want to subsidise."
"As far as the measures to stimulate the economy are concerned, these should form part of a coordinated approach by the Member States."
"In March 2009, with the economic recovery plan that has been approved by the European Council, it is intended that in 2009 and 2010, EUR 5 billion of unused EU budgetary funds will be allocated for investment in projects concerning the connection of energy networks and the development of broadband networks."
"I am very pleased to note that, in relation to the second year (2010) of funding of the recovery plan for the European economy, a result was achieved in the Conciliation Committee, through the investigation of the 2007-2013 financial framework and a transfer of funds, which guarantees funding amounting to EUR 2.4 billion for next year, and also makes it possible to implement the objectives specified in the economic recovery plan."
"If the changes made to the financial framework in connection with the recovery plan for the European economy leave very little funding in 2010 to cover the expected financial needs, then I agree with the rapporteur's position that the multiannual financial framework currently in effect does not meet the European Union's financial needs, and also that the European Commission should immediately put forward a proposal concerning an interim summary of the multiannual financial framework currently in effect."
"I would like to begin by stating my admiration for everyone who worked on the budget."
"Preparing an EU budget in conditions of economic crisis and the transitional period from Nice to Lisbon was a very difficult task."
"The budget for 2010 is the last one in this structure."
"The Lisbon Treaty is nevertheless in force and it will be difficult to work within the framework of a budget whose structure does not reflect the new conditions."
"However complicated the Lisbon Treaty ratification might have been in the end, it cannot be an excuse for the Commission, which failed to submit the draft of the new budget structure on time."
"The Commission must complete this task without delay."
"The 2010 budget is very carefully balanced as it makes full use of all the opportunities for allocating expenditure."
"As a result of this and as a result of economic fluctuations caused by the turbulent period of economic crisis, the budget may become very fragile."
"This budget must be supported in the knowledge that it is perhaps too finely crafted for the current period of insecurity and working with it in 2010 will require a certain measure of flexibility."
"in writing. - (EL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I, too, should like to express my satisfaction at the agreement reached on the budget for 2010."
"At the same time, however, note should be made of the fact that the margins available are extremely limited for coming years."
"That leaves little room for response in the event that the EU has to respond to unforeseen requirements or wants to react to new political challenges, such as the EU strategy for 2020, or to new measures to combat climate change."
"I am especially pleased that we managed, thanks to the persistence of the European Parliament, to safeguard financing for energy networks and infrastructures within the framework of the Economic Recovery Plan, placing emphasis on 'green technologies', innovation, research and the creation of broadband networks in the countryside."
"It is also extremely important that we succeed in safeguarding the viability of existing Community infrastructures and tools in the civil protection sector, especially by further strengthening the rapid response capacity of the European Union in the event of natural disasters, thereby paving the way for the future creation of a European civil protection force."
"Finally, I think that we all agree that we cannot talk of a better Europe, of a Europe which is closer to the citizens, without commensurate financing."
"The 2010 EU budget is the last budget to be approved in accordance with the Treaty of Nice."
"The new treaty grants the European Parliament greater power and the last word when it comes to the adoption of the budget."
"Parliament and the Council will have equal powers as legislators in areas such as agriculture, energy, immigration, justice and internal affairs, health and the Structural Funds, which obviously includes their relevant budgets as well."
"The 2010 budget allocates significant proportions of its funds for the conservation and management of natural resources, social and economic cohesion, growth and employment, competitiveness and innovation, regional development, agriculture and rural development."
"The European Economic Recovery Plan features in the 2010 EU budget with EUR 2.4 billion available for funding strategic projects relating to energy, transport, the development of broadband networks in rural areas and for supporting rural communities."
"I welcome that the European Parliament has managed to allocate a sum of EUR 300 million in support of dairy producers."
"The economic crisis has affected the GDP of Member States and will influence Member States' contributions to the EU budget."
"I hope that the mid-term review in 2010 for the 2007-2013 financial framework will enable Member States to absorb the Structural Funds better, particularly in the area of transport and energy efficiency in residential buildings."

"The next item is the vote."
"(For details of the outcome of the vote: see Minutes)"
"Explanations of vote"
"Oral explanations of vote"
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the excellent work carried out by the rapporteur and by all the Members who have worked towards the creation of this new instrument which will allow micro-credits to be granted to small and medium-sized enterprises and to people who have lost their jobs in recent years."
"In view of the loss of 3 million jobs in the EU alone and the banks' difficulties in extending credit, this instrument will provide easier access to the necessary resources for those who wish to start up a new business."
"I am certain that this new initiative will help create new jobs, especially if we introduce new accompanying measures such as funding for training, which will help young people set up investment projects."
"This instrument, Mr President, must be adopted as quickly as possible in order to revitalise small and medium-sized enterprises which represent the life-blood of Europe's economy."
"(BG) Thank you, Mr President, I voted in favour of the financial measures report."
"I think that this facility is very appropriate at this precise moment in time and that it will have a very positive impact if it is applied properly, as it was in my country, Bulgaria."
"At the moment, the climate is extremely unfavourable for small entrepreneurs who, with few opportunities available, have no chance of obtaining credit from banks."
"All the banks are pursuing a policy which is basically incompatible with the concept behind banking institutions."
"I get the feeling that the banks are deliberately inventing an ever-increasing number of additional terms for no other reason than to prevent them from issuing credit."
"However, without credit, a business cannot operate."
"Nevertheless, when credit is issued, these companies are obliged to provide guarantees of 100-150%, making them liable to go bankrupt."
"This is why I believe that the European Union and Parliament have, in this case, taken very appropriate action with this report, which will really contribute to the development of the European and Bulgarian economies."
"Mr President, I want to make it clear that while I feel that helping small business is a very good idea and one that should be pursued, it should be pursued at national government level."
"I have huge concerns over this proposal, about the accountability of the money that will be lent, and the payback in relation it."
"I would encourage national governments to do all they can to help small business, which is the backbone of our economy."
"The EU can help by decreasing regulation and making funds available at a national level."
"Mr President, we were in favour of this proposal."
"I think it is very important that we help entrepreneurs right across the EU and in Member States to create wealth and jobs and take people out of poverty."
"I am also grateful that we were looking at taking the money from the existing budget, rather than new spending, and using that to leverage even more spending from the private sector."
"However, I must point out that we have to be very careful here when using state financing and taxpayers' money."
"In my own constituency, I am aware of some microfinance facilities, such as the excellent Croydon Caribbean Credit Union, which helps underprivileged communities come out of poverty."
"These facilities have been squeezed out by local government and other state microfinanced facilities."
"It is important, in pursuing increased accessibility to microfinance, that we do not squeeze out the many excellent private providers that are already there."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think that we all agree on the issue of micro-credit, but we should also discuss financial resources."
"I believe that it should be our duty to increase this financial resource."
"We must also be careful not to extend micro-credit to further stakeholders in small and medium-sized enterprises, since micro-credit came into being to help less fortunate social partners."
"Along with this, we also need to discuss a cultural question: in many countries, and I believe especially in countries where there is the greatest need, the right cultural approach required to obtain these sums is lacking."
"I strongly believe that these instruments should be adopted first by the governments concerned."
"There are two speeds in Europe: the speed of countries which have already applied this approach, such as France and Germany, and there are other countries which instead need to take a cultural approach to this question."
"In short, I strongly feel that the true problem, what is really at stake in Europe, is that it is not just a question of procuring funding as an end in itself; we must seek to bring about the conditions whereby the least fortunate workers can create employment for themselves."
"Written explanations of vote"
"I voted in favour of the creation of this microfinance facility for employment, since it aims at providing opportunities for the unemployed and encouraging entrepreneurship."
"This facility, which is aimed at people who want to start or develop a micro-enterprise (less than 10 employees and a turnover of less than EUR 2 million), will open up new horizons for many unemployed people."
"Given the current state of the economy, it would have been useful if this important programme had been launched sooner, because people have been finding it difficult to access credit for a long time now."
"As this facility is aimed at public and private organisations that provide private individuals and micro-enterprises with micro-credit at national, regional and local levels in EU Member States, it needs to be carefully monitored by the relevant bodies to ensure that the credit is actually reaching the places where it is most needed and that we do not see a repeat of the situations that occurred during the last financial crisis."
"in writing. - I am in favour of the state providing microfinance to individuals to help them to establish small businesses."
"However, I am opposed to the European Union carrying out this function."
"Nevertheless, I did vote in favour of some amendments because it was always likely that the resolution would be carried and I wished to improve the resolution as much as possible."
"The 'blocking' of the votes on several amendments prevented me from voting separately on some amendments."
"in writing. - One of the most detrimental consequences of the global economic crisis is the lack of credit being supplied by banks, which is preventing individuals as well as large companies from conducting their economic activities."
"The proposal being made by the European Commission provides for the establishment of a microfinance facility that seeks to aid in alleviating the current hesitation in funding by banks and other financial institutions."
"It is for this reason that I have decided to support the rapporteur on this issue and vote in favour of the report."
"I voted against the report because unemployment, which is constantly increasing in the European Union, cannot be combated with a microfinance programme."
"Integrated programmes with adequate funding under a separate budget line are needed, programmes which focus on combating youth unemployment, which is extremely high in Greece in particular, with one in four young people under the age of 25 out of work."
"Generally speaking, what we need are policies which call for an increase in the Community budget and which overturn the neoliberal framework of the Stability Pact and low deficits."
"I also believe that funding within the framework of this mechanism should be purely voluntary and should not in any way force anyone to use the mechanism under the threat that their social security benefits will be cut or reduced."
"Unfortunately, amendments to this effect tabled by me and my fellow members in the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left were rejected."
"As Europe is going through a deep economic and financial crisis, which has led to serious social problems with unemployment growing in all the Member States, it is essential for the European Union to create effective mechanisms for tackling the crisis and also supporting those worst affected, including the unemployed and businesses in difficulty."
"That is why I welcome the creation of a microfinance facility for employment, focusing on entrepreneurship and giving everyone the opportunity to start their own business."
"European microfinance will be available for cases where access to banking credit is denied or made difficult, through support for the growth of micro-enterprises, together with mentoring, coaching and interest-rate support from the European Social Fund."
"It is also important to point out that this facility should serve the sole purpose of supporting entrepreneurship as a means of creating new jobs, by helping to realise solid business ideas, and it should not be used for social support or to boost consumption."
"In the current context of economic crisis and rising unemployment it is important to foster the growth of self-employment, as well as the creation and development of micro-enterprises."
"Micro-credit will help achieve this objective."
"I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal and Parliament's work on this subject."
"This is a way to encourage entrepreneurship and raise the levels of employment and social inclusion."
"This microfinance facility is complementary to other programmes that support employment and inclusion."
"I therefore think it is important that this facility should not be financed at the expense of existing programmes or jeopardise them."
"I had already voted in favour of this facility in the Committee on Budgets in the context of the budgetary procedure for 2010, through which two new budget lines were created, one for operational expenses in the sum of EUR 37.5 million and the other for administrative expenses in the sum of EUR 0.25 million."
"I hope this programme will soon become operational and the process of approving applications will be swift and not tied up in red tape."
"We regret that a majority in this Parliament has yet again gone back on its word and approved a proposal that takes money out of the Progress programme, which was already clearly underfunded for its areas of action in the social field."
"Irrespective of any considerations regarding the objectives of the new European microfinance facility, it is unacceptable that it should be financed by reducing the funds available to existing programmes, in this case Progress, a Community programme in the area of employment, social inclusion and equal rights."
"The text approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs clearly rejected the idea of financing this facility from Progress and proposed creating a new budget line with its own resources: in other words, 'new' money."
"The amendments tabled by our political group were along the same lines, but were rejected today."
"Since social conditions in the various Member States are deteriorating, it is unacceptable for funds to be channelled away from the employment and social inclusion area towards other priorities that have been defined in the meantime, even if it is to the area of microfinance."
"Thanks to the Göncz report on micro-credit and the controversy that surrounded the financing of this project, I went to see what this famous Progress programme - which the left is so adamant should not be deprived of a single cent for the financing of micro-enterprises and individual initiatives - is all about."
"Because, for the moment, what purpose does Progress, defined as the 'Community programme for employment and social solidarity', really serve?"
"That of creating paperwork, and of financing studies and reports."
"Because, for the moment, Progress's 'target' audience is neither the unemployed nor the excluded, but political decision makers and opinion formers."
"Some people are refusing to deduct EUR 100 million for micro-credit from the paltry sum of EUR 700 million allocated over seven years."
"A little less money for those who profit from the system, a little more money for Europeans, with a constant budget: one cannot argue with that!"
"The time has come to stop observing the poverty and the difficulties of our fellow citizens and to take concrete action instead."
"I have one reservation, however: micro-credit is necessary only because the 'banksters', who are so quick to pocket State aid, are not doing what they are supposed to be doing: pumping money into the economy."
"I voted in favour of the Göncz report on the European Microfinance Facility."
"Micro-financing concerns micro-credits (loans of less than EUR 25 000) and micro-enterprises (enterprises that employ fewer than 10 people)."
"In this period of economic crisis and due to the considerable fall in the number of loans granted, it is vitally important for the European Union to create a facility aimed at the most vulnerable, such as the unemployed, young people and small businesses."
"When an economy or jobs are at stake, it is crucial to stimulate growth with substantial investment."
"The facility will see its funding increased to EUR 100 million, the money being taken from the budget for the Progress programme (Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity), and will come into force on 1 January 2010 (for a four-year period)."
"The Council must hear this message so that an agreement can be reached in the next few days."
"I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, Mrs Göncz, because I feel it is crucial, especially in the context of an employment crisis and of a social crisis, to support micro-finance by providing it with a specific budget line."
"This is a special instrument in the fight against banking exclusion and poverty."
"Contrary to what the European Commission is asking, we oppose the idea of reallocating appropriations from the Progress programme to the European Microfinance Facility, because that would send out a negative message to economic operators."
"We must maintain the Progress programme, which targets the most vulnerable groups, and it is the joint responsibility of the Member States and the European Union to implement it effectively in the current circumstances."
"I am absolutely delighted that the vast majority of the European Parliament has today approved the report on the European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion."
"The planned micro-credit system can contribute significantly to the creation of social cohesion and new jobs, not to mention greatly help alleviate the harmful effects of the financial and economic crisis."
"During the global recession, it is particularly important to provide new opportunities for citizens who have been squeezed out of the labour market and the traditional credit market, and pave the way for stable, long-term self-employment."
"Furthermore, it is vital that a simple financial facility exists for those in disadvantaged regions intending to start up their own business and for the most vulnerable groups, which, in spite of the high risk, low margins and risk of default, helps businesses to start up and thrive."
"The overwhelming majority of employees in Europe are employed by micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises."
"This is the reason why, in order to ensure that these companies do not lose, but actually increase their employment potential, suitable support must be provided to them which, in certain cases, is of such a small amount that the traditional banking sector is unable to provide such funds."
"During today's vote, the European Parliament gave the clear message that the codecision procedure should be completed as soon as possible so that the microfinance facility may already be accessible from 2010."
"Mr President, I voted in favour of the report on microfinance facilities."
"There is still a lot we could do to encourage young people in Europe to go into entrepreneurship."
"The financial and economic crisis has brought with it an employment and a social crisis, and it is indeed predicted that there will be another 10 million unemployed people in Europe next year."
"If there was ever a time to take prompt action, it is now."
"With the current credit squeeze aggravating the situation at present, I am very much in favour of the initiative in the report to provide micro-credits for the unemployed or those threatened with unemployment who have difficulties having access to commercial loans for their business ideas."
"Nevertheless, we must also invest, for example, in young people's workshops and business incubators, as well as entrepreneurship education."
"A comprehensive approach to investing in improving the employment figures and entrepreneurship is a prerequisite for a prosperous Europe."
"I am in favour of financing social provisions in order to assist workers who have lost their jobs."
"However, this should not mean that businesses are exempted from their social and territorial obligations."
"It is not up to the public authorities to compensate for this unacceptable failure to fulfil one's obligations."
"That is why I shall abstain."
"I am voting in favour of the report on establishing a new microfinance facility which will help people whose jobs are at risk to set up or develop micro-enterprises."
"These are defined as companies with fewer than ten employees and a turnover of less than EUR 2 million."
"This finance opportunity will be available initially for a period of four years, starting from 1 January 2010."
"This will give people who have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis or who are finding it difficult to gain access to credit for their company the opportunity to undergo training, to retain existing jobs and, in some cases, even to create new ones."
"This will help to stimulate the economy and contribute to bringing the crisis to an end."
"We shall vote against the proposal for a decision establishing a European Microfinance Facility for Employment and Social Inclusion."
"At a time when so many European citizens are being made redundant because of the crisis of capitalism and the complete lack of solidarity shown by those who continue to make profits at their expense, it is time for the European Union to change its liberal approach to solving the problems encountered."
"Faced with the insatiable commercial appetites that the European Union's liberal dogmatism has created, we need a policy that protects European workers, the creators of the wealth of which they are being deprived in the name of profit."
"Again, this is a case of the Europe of big profits and of small, arbitrary handouts."
"The paltry sums pledged, the lack of clarity concerning their allocation and the individualistic logic behind the vehicle promoted testify to this."
"This bears no relation to the Europe of the general interest and of social equality that our peoples need."
"At a time of crisis, when credit is scarce and access to it difficult, this kind of facility is essential to help provide micro-credit for small enterprises and people who have lost their jobs and want to start up new businesses on their own."
"It is difficult to achieve such goals without this kind of support facility."
"Furthermore, in the current crisis situation, banks are not sensitive to the credit needs of start-up enterprises which, in most cases, makes it impossible for them to get off the ground."
"With the prospect of several million more jobs being lost in the EU, it is important to have incentives that people who are made redundant can access in an attempt to make a new life for themselves, thereby avoiding social crises and reducing Member States' spending on social support measures."
"The financial and economic crisis caused primarily by British and American speculators is now leading to growing unemployment in Europe as a result of the economic downturn."
"It is mainly young people, who were already at serious risk of unemployment, who have been particularly hard hit by the changing situation."
"Therefore, it is especially important to give them an opportunity to start or restart their careers and to pave the way for some of them to start their own companies."
"I hope that the new European microfinance facility for employment and social inclusion - Progress - will give them significant support in this respect."
"This new instrument also allows us to respond to the continuing credit crunch."
"As well as interest rate support, people who set up micro-enterprises will also receive support in the form of mentoring, training, coaching and capacity building."
"I support the committee's initiative to increase the funding for the microfinance facility by 50%, compared with the Commission's proposal, to EUR 150 million."
"Looking at the huge sums that have been spent on rescuing the banks, it is important to be generous to those people who have been hardest hit by the situation."
"For all of these reasons, I have voted in favour of this report."
"On 10 November 2009, the European Commission published a Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Microfinance Facility."
"It is related to the Commission document entitled 'Realisation of the European Recovery Plan' and the priorities of the Council, which are: maintaining employment, creating jobs and promoting mobility, improving skills and adapting to the needs of the labour market, and increasing access to employment."
"The microfinance facility is supposed to give easier access to financial services to the unemployed and groups of businesspeople who have found themselves in a difficult situation."
"It is concerned with people from certain social groups who do not have the creditworthiness required by commercial banks but would like to start up in business."
"Introduction of this type of support facility, which comes from EU funds, has particularly significant meaning in a situation in which lending levels are currently reduced and the value of loans which have been made has fallen."
"The situation in the lending sector shows that the financial and economic crisis is changing into an employment and social crisis."
"The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs contains significant amendments to the Commission Proposal, including opposition to transfer of the necessary funds from the Progress programme to the European Microfinance Facility."
"The rapporteur proposes putting the facility under a separate budget line, and also proposes increasing the facility's budget for the next four years by EUR 50 million."
"In view of these aspects, I endorse the report."
"I have voted in favour of the resolution to introduce the microfinance facility, because for me, the top priority is to adopt this resolution quickly."
"This will give disadvantaged sections of the population the opportunity to take out loans and to help themselves."
"However, I am calling on the Council not to take the funding from Progress."
"It is important that this programme retains its funding in full."
"In particular in this crisis, EU money must not be redeployed at the expense of the weakest members of society."
"in writing. - I am delighted that the European Parliament has today approved a scheme for ensuring that additional loans will be made available to small businesses."
"This decision will allow EUR 100 million to be made available at regional and national level over the next four years."
"This is a valuable and timely development which will provide many of those people suffering the effects of the global recession with new opportunities."
"The measures announced today will support those wanting to start new businesses, as well as providing professional training - thereby increasing the range of skills upon which citizens can draw to set up the enterprises which are vital to Europe's economy."
"More and more, we are seeing greater consideration of small and medium-sized enterprises in European Union policy and legislation."
"I welcome this new development and, in particular, the European Parliament's contribution to stimulating the development of small businesses in difficult economic times."
"The Progress programme was started to assist in realisation of European Union objectives in the fields of employment, social affairs and equal opportunities, which are laid out in the Social Agenda."
"The budgetary means available under this programme are supposed to be a stimulus for the process of transformation and modernisation in the five areas of employment, social integration and social protection, conditions of work, combating discrimination and equal opportunities for women and men."
"Currently, the financial and economic crisis is changing into a social crisis and an employment crisis."
"The unemployed and people from social groups which are in an unfavourable situation need active support and advice if they want to become independent."
"The Progress programme is aimed at the most exposed groups, and in relation to this, I think Member States and the European Union are responsible for effective implementation of the programme."
"The Union should also make every effort to increase the range of directed financial support for new sole traders and the founders of micro-enterprises in the form of monitoring, training - including practical training - and skills development."
"Progress is supposed to serve the development of micro-enterprises and the social economy."
"In the present economic and financial situation, which is characterised by a reduced supply of loans, the Progress programme extends the range of directed financial aid for new businesspeople."
"The main responsibility for employment and social policy rests with the Member States, but the European Union should be the initiator of these changes."
"It is necessary to create real possibilities of employment for all, and to raise the quality and productivity of work."
"Microfinance is an interesting instrument to provide people who are unemployed or in danger of losing their jobs, and also enterprises in the social economy, with financial support in times of crisis."
"I voted against this report, as it is not certain that this instrument is to be financed with fresh money."
"It is possible that resources from the existing Progress programme will be used, a programme that was launched in 2007 and comprises actions concerning poverty reduction, anti-discrimination, social inclusion, gender and employment."
"Taking money from programmes that fight poverty in order to fight poverty is not a good strategy."
"The Council, in particular, rejects a separate budget."
"The Member States clearly lack political courage."
"To enable this to start at the beginning of 2010, EUR 25 million is being released from the 2010 EU budget."
"There is no agreement between Parliament and the Council at present on the financing for the following three years (2011-2013)."
"What Europe needs is a sustainable strategy and not a one-off injection such as this initiative."
"The microfinance instrument has no coherence and no long-term vision."
"In addition, micro-credits can already be granted under the European Social Fund, and also under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund."
"I say an emphatic 'no', then, to this report."
"in writing. - This is a great initiative that will make it easier for people who have lost, or risk losing, their jobs to get credit to start up their own businesses."
"The European Progress Microfinance Facility will make available up to EUR 25,000 to people who want loans to start or grow very small firms, and who have been unable to obtain credit through conventional markets."
"I am pleased that the European Parliament was able to ensure this money did not come from the 'Progress' programme, which is designed to help vulnerable people, but was created using money from the 2010 budget for the first year."
"The EUR 100 million fund, available from early 2010, is exactly the kind of help that small businesses need at this time of financial crisis when banks are still unwilling to release credit."
"This will help businesses across Wales, and I am disappointed that colleagues from UKIP were unable to support this progressive initiative."
"Corrections to votes and voting intentions: see Minutes"
"Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting: see Minutes"
"Question Hour with the President of the Commission"
"The next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission."
"Open questions"
"Mr President, expectations of EU 2020 are running high, not only in our group but also among European citizens."
"They expect prosperity, jobs and a sustainable, innovative social market economy by 2020, as well as specific proposals for strong SMEs and an open European single market, including in the field of capital and knowledge development."
"They expect a 2020 strategy with a solid, transparent European governance structure, with no free-for-all for Member States."
"Mr President, what Parliament wants is not merely to be informed after the event about proposals by the Commission and the Council; it wants to actually participate in developing and implementing the 2020 strategy."
"How are you going to ensure this, and what timetable are you working to?"
"The Council President has announced that the intention is to reach conclusions as early as March."
"Will you take the initiative?"
"Can we expect a specific framework in the near future containing starting points and objectives as a basis for participation by Parliament in this discussion?"
"Can you let us know what timetable you are working to and who is responsible?"
"Are you Mr 2020?"
"President of the Commission. - As President of the Commission, I will be responsible for that, in coordination with my colleagues in the Commission, because this will be the central task for the next Commission, as was presented in my political guidelines."
"Regarding the timing, we hope to have a formal communication ready in time for the Spring Council, but I feel it would be better only to have the formal conclusions at the June Council."
"That will be my proposal to the European Council, so that we can have - and I very much wish for this - full participation and ownership for Parliament of the strategy."
"At European Council level, there has also been a very interesting pre-discussion about the economy and, in fact, I have encouraged the European Council to take full ownership on the Council side as well, and to reinforce the mechanisms of governance."
"As you know, five years ago, when we re-launched the Lisbon strategy, there was resistance from some Member States to follow certain recommendations of the Kok report."
"This time, the conditions exist for having a reinforced system of governance in this strategy."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, 2009 is drawing to an end in a difficult situation, with major unemployment and economic and budgetary problems."
"At the same time, the five-year period of the Barroso Commission is coming to a close."
"What conclusions do you draw from the first five years about the second five years, providing that the Commission is confirmed in office, in particular, with regard to these economic and social issues?"
"What will you be saying to our citizens and also to your commissioners about the things that should be different in this new period?"
"We should work together to set new priorities with respect to our economic and socio-political objectives and to avoid recreating the situation that we currently find ourselves in."
"Therefore, I would like to ask you again what conclusions you draw from the first five years and what you want to do differently, better and more clearly in the next five years in order to fulfil the wishes of the citizens of Europe."
"President of the Commission. - First of all, I think that the fact that this Parliament voted again for a mandate for myself is a signal that there is support for the action we have been taking."
"Having said that, there are issues that we have to change and to improve."
"The situation today is different."
"There is a much greater sense of social urgency than before."
"As I have said very often, the most important problem we face in Europe today - which most likely we are going to face for some time yet - is unemployment."
"We have to find not only new sources of growth, but also to look at what was wrong with the previous model of growth."
"It was obvious that the previous model of growth was dilapidated."
"Although it created some artificial bubbles - not only in the financial sector but also in other sectors - it was not sustainable, including from an energy and climate point of view."
"That is the focus of my strategy - the strategy I have put forward to this Parliament and which I hope to develop with the next Commission in, of course, very close association with this Parliament."
"I would like to ask a brief additional question, Mr Barroso."
"If, during the hearings in Parliament, we are of the opinion that the allocation of the portfolios does not fully meet these objectives and we make proposals for changing the portfolios, are you prepared in principle to address our objections and to make changes?"
"Would you, in principle, reject any objections or are you prepared to accept them?"
"President of the Commission. - It is clearly stated in the Lisbon Treaty that the internal organisation of the College and the Commission services is a responsibility of the Commission."
"I am always ready to listen to your suggestions and to your comments."
"In fact, some of the innovations were as a result of some debates with your group and other groups."
"I count on your support for the full respect of the competences of the Commission, as I will always respect the competences of Parliament."
"I am always open to listening to your suggestions but I think we should concentrate more on matters of policy, of substance."
"Regarding the organisation of the Commission, I believe that after five years of everyday work in the Commission, I am pretty well informed about the best ways of allocating resources inside the Commission."
"Mr President, my question concerns the situation in Greece."
"This situation is very alarming, of course, with a government deficit of 12.7% and government debt poised to exceed 130%."
"This is exactly the situation I found in Belgium when, at a young age, I became Minister for the Budget in 1985."
"The figures were exactly the same - I shall never forget them - 12.7% government deficit."
"Clearly, then, Greece will have to work hard and implement reforms it has not implemented to date."
"Yet we, too, can do something, President Barroso."
"We can enable the costs associated with the government debt of the various Member States to fall by installing, at long last, a European bond market that would cover a large proportion of this government debt."
"We are currently paying several hundred billion euro too much in interest on our government debt owing to the fact that there is no European bond market and all the bond markets are still segmented, with an enormous shortage of liquidity."
"My question is whether you will take the initiative in this matter and launch such a European bond market at long last."
"This would not obviate the need for Greece to make an effort itself, but it could help."
"President of the Commission. - I was very reassured by yesterday's commitment by Prime Minister Papandreou to cut public deficits and reduce the Government's debt through permanent expenditure cuts and revenue increases."
"We believe the current budget for 2010 that is now being discussed in the Greek Parliament and Prime Minister Papandreou's statements are steps in the right direction."
"I have been following the situation very closely with this government and with the previous government, namely the question of public finances."
"We were also very impressed by the candid presentation made by the Prime Minister of Greece in the last European Council."
"He is fully aware of the problem and he has shown us his determination to address it."
"Greece will submit to the Commission in the course of January an updated stability programme, as foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact."
"I trust that this programme will include concrete measures to strengthen fiscal adjustment in 2010 and to ensure lasting consolidation of public finances."
"Naturally, the Commission will continue to monitor very closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in Greece."
"Having said this, I do not consider it appropriate at this stage to elaborate on possible scenarios."
"We believe that Greece is now taking appropriate measures and that we should support Greece in the enforcement of those measures."
"Mr President, to come back to what I was saying, a European bond market could help Greece."
"It would by no means obviate the need for that country to carry out reforms, but it would help all the other EU Member States too, as it would mean a much lower interest rate being payable on the debt."
"Let us compare the interest rates payable in Germany and the United States."
"The Americans pay 0.4% less interest on their treasury bonds than the Germans, even though German public finances are in much better shape."
"This is proof that we urgently need to take that course."
"I expect the Commission to do so."
"President of the Commission. - We are not at this stage contemplating the kind of measures suggested."
"I personally believe it is not very appropriate to link this kind of proposal to the specific situation in Greece today; in fact, it could send the wrong signal."
"Let us be honest about it."
"Greece and the countries of the euro area have a specific obligation when it comes to implementing the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact."
"It is very important for them and, above all, for their own economy, but it is also important for others."
"I believe that raising this issue at this moment and suggesting that there could be a solution outside Greece's own efforts is not the best way to help our Greek friends to implement, with determination, the measures announced by Prime Minister Papandreou."
"I would like to ask you today about the structure of the next Commission."
"The portfolio responsibilities that you have presented seem to us to have very presidential overtones."
"In our opinion, you are organising this structure in such a way as to give you personally, as Commission President, a great deal of power."
"We are surprised that you want to abolish the working groups of the members of the Commission."
"In our opinion, these groups have produced good results during the last parliamentary term."
"We are also surprised that the responsibilities in some areas have been fragmented in a way which seems to us incomprehensible."
"It is a mystery to us how you will handle the division of responsibilities between Mrs Reding and Mrs Malmström."
"It seems to us that Mrs Malmström will be creating a sort of homeland security office."
"I definitely have nothing against making the climate into a separate responsibility."
"However, if you appoint a climate commissioner, you must also show that she has real power and will have access to areas such as energy, industry, transport, the environment and agriculture."
"We do not believe that this is the case."
"President of the Commission. - Two different questions: one regarding the portfolios on justice and security, the other on climate."
"Regarding justice and security, I have forwarded the suggestion made by many of you in this Parliament to have a specific portfolio more centred on fundamental rights."
"So, Commissioner Reding, if she meets with your approval, will be Commissioner for justice, fundamental rights and citizenship."
"There will also be a Commissioner for home affairs, which is basically what happens in most, if not all, Member States in Europe - there is a minister for the interior and a minister for justice."
"I believe that it is much more efficient so that they can work with their colleagues in the respective Councils."
"It will also be much better in terms of the amount of work because, as you know, we have just approved the Stockholm Programme."
"This is a very ambitious programme in which this Parliament has a lot of important competences now, so it is fully justified to have two different Commissioners."
"It is not because of the role of the President in this case."
"It has nothing to do with the role of the President of the Commission."
"It has to do with the need to have some kind of division of labour in such an important area."
"I would like the Commissioner for fundamental rights to have security concerns in her hands, and I would like the Commissioner for security to do the job whilst respecting fundamental rights and the spirit of liberties in the European Union."
"I would like to repeat my previous question."
"How can the climate commissioner be a powerful force and how can she assert herself, if this, on the basis of the second option, is not reflected in the structures?"
"Secondly, there is another issue in the detail which seems totally unreasonable to us and that is that green genetic engineering, which you, Mr Barroso, are in favour of, now forms part of the health portfolio and is no longer included in the environment or agriculture portfolio."
"We need you to explain this."
"President of the Commission. - I am happy to see that you are happy with the creation of the Commissioner for climate change."
"She will, in fact, have a lot to do because, as we are now seeing, Copenhagen will not be the end of the road."
"There will be a lot to do after Copenhagen."
"Her main tasks will be to mainstream climate change in all sectors of the Commission - not only the ones you have mentioned, but many others."
"There is almost no policy in the European Union that does not have some impact on climate action: from agriculture to research, from enterprise and industry to maritime affairs."
"That is the task."
"She will have a dedicated DG for climate change."
"I want the Commissioner for climate change to have some instruments to pursue her policy but, of course, she has to do this in cooperation with other Commissioners - namely the Commissioner for the Environment, the Commissioner for Energy and others - because this is such an important policy that also has a very important external dimension."
"Mr President, I would like to ask for your assessment of the EU-Ukraine Summit which took place almost a fortnight ago."
"At the same time, I would like to raise two matters."
"When I was in Kiev, I learned that the European side refused to accept a reference in the final declaration to Ukraine's European identity."
"I will not hide the fact that this surprises me greatly, because it seems to me that the question of Ukraine's European identity should not be a matter of dispute."
"Secondly, I learned in Kiev that our European delegation refused to lay wreaths at the monument to the victims of the Ukrainian famine, something which is customary for all diplomats visiting Ukraine, and I must say that these two facts surprise me greatly."
"President of the Commission. - I think the meeting we had with Ukraine was successful."
"To be frank with you, our Ukrainian friends have to do more if they want us to help them more."
"I have been spending more time working on Ukrainian issues than on most of the Member States of the European Union, which shows the attention we give to Ukrainian concerns."
"This is a country that is very close to us and a country we want to be closer to."
"That is why we have offered them a comprehensive and innovative European Union-Ukraine association agreement."
"This is the most advanced status we can give to a country, barring accession, which is not possible under the current situation."
"There were some discussions, but if you look at the final conclusions, it is clearly reaffirmed that Ukraine is a European country, Ukraine is bound by the same European values and we want to be closer to Ukraine."
"We want to help them to be closer to us."
"I believe that it was a productive meeting, but we cannot honestly expect to create a new status for Ukraine every time there is a summit."
"The last summit before this was in Paris."
"We granted Ukraine this association possibility, but we cannot move to a new status every time there is a summit, and we had a very honest, open and friendly discussion about this with President Yushchenko and the other interlocutors."
"Mr President, I have a question for you about the Tobin tax."
"This tax is a worthwhile proposal, but as yet, no one has introduced it."
"Everyone says that it will never be introduced unless all the Member States do so at the same time."
"I am now afraid, after the decision at the European summit, which I welcome, that this will once again be postponed, because we are not all starting at the same time."
"I would like to know what your opinion on this is and what you think are the chances of the Tobin tax being introduced."
"President of the Commission. - If there is an overall global tax for financial transactions, we should support it."
"In fact, I have personally supported this in discussions in the European Council."
"The European Council has asked the Commission to put forward some ideas on that, and we are preparing it."
"Also linked to the issue of innovative financing, I personally believe that, if we want to meet our obligations regarding the fight against climate change, it cannot be only with the money from our budgets."
"It is obvious that our budgets are under such pressure that our national budgets alone over the next few years cannot provide the resources for fighting climate change."
"We have to think of innovative ways of financing."
"A global financial transaction tax seems to me a very good idea, and we are working on that area in order to put forward proposals at an appropriate time."
"I hope the new Commission will put forward some proposals in this area."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr Barroso, we have recently heard that there is to be a closure of the Corus steel works on Teesside in northern England."
"This is due to an EU target reduction of 20% of carbon emissions."
"Thanks to the carbon credit, Corus can no longer afford to employ over 5 000 steel workers, including suppliers."
"We also have the spectacle of the British Government admitting that its hands are tied on this issue because of punitive EU competition law."
"The real gain to Corus from stopping production on Teesside is the saving it will make in its carbon allowances allocated by the EU under its emissions trading system scheme, which will be worth up to GBP 600 million over the next three years."
"But surprise, surprise - guess what: the head of the IPCC, Rajendra Pachauri, is also the head of the Tata Foundation, so, one must ask, cui bono?"
"Because Tata owns Corus."
"(Protests from the floor)"
"The question I would like to ask is: is it now official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside so that they can outsource their business to countries such as India, or is there a more personal interest at stake here?"
"President of the Commission. - Regarding the insinuation you are making, I really cannot comment."
"If I were the person involved, I would take the matter to the courts."
"Concerning the issue at stake, you said that the British Government said this was the position of the European Union."
"I do not know anything about that statement, but let me tell you that, if there is one government that has been pushing the European Union for ambitious targets in the fight against climate change, it is precisely the government of your country, whether you like it or not."
"In fact, the common agenda today in the European Union is to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases."
"This does have some consequences in terms of the adaptation of our industry."
"We want industry to be kept in Europe, but we want another kind of industry, which is less energy consuming and friendlier to the environment."
"You did not answer my question, because the question was: is it official EU policy to offer incentives to companies to close plants such as Teesside and outsource the business to countries such as India?"
"You did not answer the question."
"Would you please answer it?"
"President of the Commission. - I will answer by saying 'no'."
"Colleagues, the blue card procedure is not applicable now because these are discussions between two people."
"It is very difficult for the blue card to be used for an additional question now as I do not know which of the two people it is intended for."
"I am sorry about that."
"It will, of course, be applicable during other debates."
"(FR) Mr President, the European Commission, in response to the referendum in Switzerland on minarets, has gone to the lengths of making a statement that is disturbing and ambiguous, to say the least."
"It felt it necessary to reaffirm, for the benefit of those Member States that might be tempted to take similar decisions, the need to 'respect fundamental rights such as freedom of religion'."
"This thinly veiled threat requires some explaining on your part, when opinion polls show that the vast majority of Europeans would have voted in such a referendum had it been an option in their respective countries."
"Mr Barroso, do the EU Member States have the right or not to hold a referendum for their people that is identical in every way to the one held on 29 November in Switzerland?"
"Would the Commission oppose or not the sovereign decision of these peoples if they were to vote as the people of Switzerland did?"
"If, as we believe, the European Union is today more totalitarian than democratic, it is high time it was acknowledged."
"It is the sovereign right of Member States to decide, in accordance with their constitutional rules, how they wish to consult their people directly."
"I am not going to make hypothetical statements about hypothetical referendums."
"What I can tell you is that the Member States take their own decisions on this matter."
"Therefore, I will not prejudge a referendum in a country or the reaction to a referendum organised by the Commission."
"The Commission has powers to verify the measures and the decisions taken by the Member States in relation to the application of European law."
"In this case, the Commission has not only the right, but also the duty, to voice its opinion."
"(FR) Mr Barroso, all the same, the question was clear."
"I was not asking you a question about a hypothetical referendum, but about a referendum that is identical in every way to the one that was held for the people of Switzerland."
"If one of the EU Member States, in a completely identical referendum, asked the question that was asked of the Swiss people, how would the Commission react?"
"Do they have the right to do so?"
"And would the Commission oppose the decision of the sovereign people if it decided to vote as the Swiss did?"
"The question is clear."
"Mrs Le Pen, you are asking a hypothetical question."
"My French is not as good as yours, but, when you say 'if', that is a hypothetical question."
"'If there were a referendum', that is a hypothetical question."
"(Applause)"
"I am not in the habit of answering hypothetical questions."
"The reality is already complex enough."
"Therefore, what I can tell you is that the Commission is against all forms of discrimination, including all forms of religious discrimination."
"That is our position and it is clear."
"It is not only the Commission's position; it is the position of all the democratic Member States of the European Union."
"That being said, I am not going to express an opinion on a hypothetical referendum."
"(MT) I had intended to address a question to the President of the Commission concerning the Commission."
"However, an intervention was made today by the Socialist Party concerning the hearing we have with the Commissioners."
"I hope that the Socialist Party will not start playing around with the portfolios assigned to the nominated Commissioners."
"We do not have the competence to change the Commissioners' portfolios, since this falls under the exclusive competence of the President of the Commission."
"The selected individuals, from our Party, the Liberals and the Socialist Party, are all very valid persons, and we should not have the competence to start debating as from now, prior to the hearing, whether we can change the portfolios of the Commissioners."
"I am aware that this was not the subject, but following the Socialist Party's intervention, I felt that I had to make this intervention."
"President of the Commission. - It was not a question so I do not have to answer but, since I have the opportunity, I will just say the following."
"The principle of loyalty between the different institutions is very important."
"Also, now that we have a new treaty, we need to respect the competences of each institution."
"I told you how important it is to have a special relationship between the Commission and Parliament, and I will work for that."
"This, of course, means respecting the competences of each institution in its own field according to the treaties."
"(FI) Mr President, at the start of his speech, the Commission President referred to what had been wrong in earlier models."
"What is wrong, surely, is that the Commission has had some good programmes, but the Member States just do what they like."
"In other words, the stick and carrot approach is not enough to guide the Member States."
"I also noticed that the 2020 document contained no innovative ideas regarding how the Member States might be guided."
"I would like to ask whether the Commission intends to use the warnings under Article 121 of the Treaty of Lisbon if a Member State does not comply or even want to comply with the ideas of the 2020 Strategy."
"President of the Commission. - Thank you for your question and for the intention behind your question."
"My intention is to propose to the Member States to reinforce economic governance in Europe."
"I think now we have an opportunity to do it."
"Frankly, it has been refused several times before."
"You have probably read a recent interview given by one of my predecessors, Mr Delors, who said that his proposal of reinforced coordination on social matters failed in 1993."
"It was refused by the Member States."
"It was interesting and I looked up what I said then as Foreign Minister of my country."
"I was one of those supporting a reinforced cooperation of the Member States in that area."
"Unfortunately, it was not possible."
"When the Lisbon Strategy was being revised, we put forward a proposal based on the Wim Kok report, and it was refused by Member States."
"After this crisis, I think there is now much more awareness of the need to have real coordination in the response to the crisis."
"I am going to fight for that but, of course, we need the support of the Member States to achieve this."
"We need them, because some of those policies are made at national level and some are at Community level."
"I am encouraged by the first exchange of views with the European Council."
"In fact, the new President of the Council, President Van Rompuy, has already announced that he wants an informal exchange of views at the beginning of February."
"I hope that will be a way of having more commitment from the European Council for a strengthened mechanism of governance of the European Union 2020 Strategy."
"(FR) Mr Barroso, the Lisbon Strategy has had its day."
"The European Union will therefore not be the most competitive economy from 1 January."
"Please excuse my harsh words, but one can almost talk in terms of a mirage."
"What we need to do now is ensure that, for the years ahead, for 2010, the EU is more like an oasis of calm for Europe's entrepreneurs and citizens."
"In this connection, I read in the memo with which you have presented us that you are talking about internationalising SMEs, the main creators of jobs in the EU."
"Do you not think, Mr Barroso, that the urgent requirement today is to stabilise the situation, to reassure people?"
"Moreover, can you guarantee today that the Commission will oppose any regulatory hysteria and will apply, on a daily basis and in all its policies, the principle, the strategy, 'Think small first'?"
"Thank you, Mrs Ries."
"This was one of the priorities of my Commission, but it is also a priority for the current Commission and will certainly be a priority for the next Commission too."
"Small and medium-sized enterprises are the ones that create jobs."
"We created the Small Business Act on the basis of the very principle - 'Think small first' - that you are talking about, and we are embarking on a programme to reduce administrative burdens, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises."
"That is why we have placed the completion of the internal market at the heart of our priorities, as there is potential and also an international dimension to exploit, because the truth is that our small and medium-sized enterprises are still coming up against a number of obstacles when trying to work with other markets."
"I therefore believe that this is one of the priorities of the new strategy, of the 2020 strategy."
"It is precisely a strategy that is linked more closely to the international dimension, because, today, the effects of globalisation are being felt, and it is only by adopting an aggressive, proactive stance that we can win this battle of competitiveness."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to provide an explanation in response to a very important question by Mrs Ries."
"We started to prepare the list of speakers at 15.00, when we started this item."
"I have about 30 people on the list, in the order you took your blue cards."
"Of course, we can add other speakers to the list, but it will be impossible for them to speak during this item."
"If you wish, you can keep your cards for now, and Ms Durant will be the next speaker for one minute."
"We can try to add to the list the remaining Members wishing to speak, but I can tell you very honestly that it is impossible to have so many speakers;"
"I have about 30."
"We started to deal with the list at 15.00."
"If any other Members would like to add their names, please keep to one minute."
"(FR) Mr President, President of the Commission, I would like to ask you, in the context of this 2020 strategy and, in particular, of the system of enhanced governance, how you wish to deal with the issue of lobbies."
"You know, as I do, that if a 2020 strategy is drafted, there will inevitably be lobbying across the board."
"Lobbying takes place just about everywhere; there is lobbying of the Commission, of Parliament, of the Council."
"As you are also aware, an interinstitutional debate is being held today on the issue of lobbies."
"Mr Kallas was in charge of this issue in the previous Commission."
"I should like you to tell me who in the Commission will be in charge of this issue of lobbies, and what his or her mandate will be."
"Do you wish to make progress - as I and other members of this interinstitutional group hope - towards a mandatory registration system for lobbies?"
"That is the condition governing transparency and it is also, in my view, the condition governing the citizens' support."
"They must be able to understand how decisions are taken at European level by the Commission, the Council and Parliament."
"Mr President, this is a well-known problem, a very important problem, and I am in fact proud that we have made progress during this Commission's term of office."
"As you mentioned, Commissioner and Vice-President Kallas has done a great deal of work in this area, and we have made progress with the lobby registration system."
"In my view, however, it should be acknowledged that the best way to deal with this problem is to be transparent, not to hide information."
"It is only natural!"
"It is only natural in an open society and in an open economy for different, sometimes conflicting, interests to be expressed."
"It is along these lines that the Commission will carry out its work: its relations with representatives of the various interests - the interests of businesses, of trade unions, of specific causes sometimes - will become more transparent."
"The person responsible for this matter within the Commission, if you will kindly offer him your support, will be Commissioner and Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič."
"It is he who the administration will appoint to carry out this task within the new Commission."
"President Barroso, I welcome your vision for 2020."
"You show that even in the dark days of recession, one can dream of Utopia."
"I welcome your comments on European research areas."
"I represent Cambridge, which is home to the leading research cluster that has already seen great successes in high-tech, green-tech and bio-tech."
"If we are to turn your dreams into anything like reality, then we could do with listening to, and learning from, the Cambridge experience."
"Research needs funding; innovative businesses need funding; world class-innovation needs world-class funding."
"Last week, I met representatives of the Wellcome Trust, which is the UK's largest charity and last year gave EUR 750 million to medical research."
"They came to Brussels to tell this Parliament that, if we pass the legislation, as drafted, on alternative investments, then we would cut their organisation's funding by two thirds."
"Please do not say one thing and do another."
"President of the Commission. - Congratulations to Cambridge."
"I think Cambridge is one of the greatest universities in Europe and in the world."
"It is precisely because we do not have so many Cambridges in Europe that we have been working to have a real European research area, because Cambridge and other very important universities in Europe are quite international."
"They are able to attract very important funding, but in other countries, especially small countries and some of the poorest countries, they do not have those kinds of resources."
"That is why we not only need private funding like the ones you mentioned, and I certainly welcome all the work of foundations such as the ones you mentioned, but we also need public funding from the states and from the European Union budget."
"That will be one of the points I intend to put into the next European Union budget."
"Regarding the link with alternative investment managers, I really do not see this link."
"I think we should not use one thing or the other."
"We believe it is important to have sensible regulations for products on the financial markets considering what happened, including in your country."
"It was in your country that we had the highest ever case of State aid in the history of the European Union, precisely because of problems in the financial markets."
"(EL) Mr President, Mr Barroso, may I say that, while the ambitious objectives of the strategy for 2020 are being debated, there are certain countries, such as Greece, which will join this strategy on unfavourable terms, with huge economic problems and high unemployment."
"Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced measures which he hopes will reduce the deficit."
"Athens is waiting with bated breath for reaction from the markets and an evaluation by various firms."
"I listened to your reply to an earlier question and I have read today's statements by Mr Almunia and I should like to ask you Mr Barroso: apart from the Commission monitoring the public deficit in Greece, how else can it help to address this problem?"
"And secondly, within the framework of the strategy for 2020, how are such national peculiarities addressed, so that such problems do not arise?"
"President of the Commission. - First of all, in the 2020 Strategy, our idea is precisely to have national programmes, but also horizontal European Community-wide programmes."
"We are going to ask every Member State to put forward specific, simplified objectives for each country, taking into consideration their different circumstances."
"As you have mentioned, Greece is in a specific situation today, and we are being very attentive to it."
"Greece will, of course, go on benefiting from cohesion funds as it is one of the countries benefiting from those cohesion funds, and this is separate from the European Union 2020 Strategy."
"However, it is important to understand why countries like Greece have to correct their deficits and their excessive debts."
"The interest countries pay for debt is money they cannot put into their hospitals or schools for the future."
"It is not because that we are attached to an idea of rigid macro-economic discipline that we recommend Member States not to maintain very high debt and deficit levels, but because we are thinking about social expenditure and addressing people's concerns."
"(NL) Mr President."
"President Barroso, I should like to ask you a question regarding the future of the automobile sector which, indeed, will remain one of the most important industrial sectors even after 2020."
"Some of our crown jewels are about to be sold off to China, which is an unwelcome development."
"In my opinion, it is by no means too late to avert this, but to do so we - you, Mr President, and the new European Commission - must move up a gear as a matter of urgency."
"We must mobilise more resources for research and development, with greater focus on the automobile sector, and we must also, of course, mobilise more financial resources from the European Investment Bank."
"As I see it, this is the only way to ensure that our current dependence on oil is not replaced with a future dependence on Chinese electric batteries, for example."
"Hence my question: are you and the European Commission prepared to assume a coordinating role in the short term, including with regard to the Opel dossier, so that we can join together resolutely to focus on the new, environmentally friendly technologies in the automobile sector?"
"President of the Commission. - In the case of Opel, as you know, the Commission has maintained an important position, promoting the necessary meetings between the different countries involved and the companies concerned."
"Regarding the issue of the automobile industry, there is a problem of over-capacity in Europe and in the world."
"So the future is precisely as your question suggests, finding new ways and new technologies, namely the development of cleaner cars."
"We have been supporting this idea, not only in terms of ideas but in terms of funding."
"In fact the European Investment Bank, with our full support, has, as you know, created a special facility for this."
"This is one of the priorities for the next mandate: to develop a greener automobile industry in Europe which is technologically more advanced."
"This is the way in which we can maintain a leading position in the automobile industry in the world."
"President Barroso, the European Anti-Poverty Network has described your consultation document on the 2020 Strategy as a step backwards from commitments by successive European Councils to strengthen the social dimension."
"Your document only mentions flexicurity and training."
"You should know that on this side of the House, we cannot accept a strategy that is devoid of social content."
"2010 will be the European Year against Poverty and Social Exclusion."
"Should you not make the fight against the scourge of poverty and exclusion the centrepiece of the 2020 Strategy?"
"Finally, recognising that a third of all jobs created since the year 2000 in the European Union are in the health, social and employment services, making a double contribution to reducing poverty, providing services and creating employment, should the 2020 Strategy not set targets for the provision of high-quality social services?"
"Thank you, colleague, but please do not put two questions during your one minute, because it is very difficult for President Barroso to answer two questions in one minute."
"Which question do you prefer - the first or the second?"
"Colleagues, this is very important."
"Mr President, in fact I put three points, and three 'yeses' would do!"
"(Laughter)"
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you very much for your understanding."
"I will try to choose the best question!"
"The honest answer is the following: this is a consultation document; it is not yet a strategy, and I very much welcome your input."
"Let me tell you my personal opinion."
"Yes, we have to do more to fight poverty and social exclusion but for that, we need the support of our Member States."
"I can tell you that I have proposed concrete measures several times and have received a very loud 'no', with the argument that some Member States view social matters as something for them, and not for Europe."
"That is an interesting debate."
"Let us see if we agree on this matter."
"I very much expect to have your support on this because, as you know, to fight social exclusion and poverty, we also need some instruments at European level that complement the instruments at national level."
"I am telling you the position that I will be defending."
"I hope all the Member States will be ready to support this view."
"(PL) Commissioner, implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is not going very well."
"How do you intend to change the document on the Europe 2020 Strategy in order to achieve its objectives?"
"Do you foresee preparation of something in the way of a programme for realisation of the strategy, a separate document for the Commission's five-year term of office, which would set out the actions to be implemented?"
"I think it would be a good idea."
"We could monitor realisation of the strategy and, at the same time, appraise the Commission on what has been implemented."
"Finally, I will permit myself to make a comment: I think the time allowed for social consultations, and I mean the deadline set for 15 January, is too short."
"We should treat our social partners a little more seriously."
"It is they who are going to realise the strategy, and they should have more time to take part in these consultations."
"President of the Commission. - The deadline is the deadline for the consultation based on this document, but there will also be other opportunities to consult."
"In fact, there have been consultations on the future of the Lisbon strategy at least since 2008."
"The Committee of the Regions has prepared a very interesting report, as has the Economic and Social Committee, and I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am prepared, if the European Parliament so wishes, to hold a debate on this matter - not just this question hour with one-minute replies, but a special debate on this matter alone - whenever you want, because I really believe it is extremely important."
"(Applause)"
"It is extremely important for this Parliament to have ownership, and also to associate national parliaments in this process, because this is to be the centrepiece of the strategy for the future."
"I would like to underline that point."
"Regarding the issue of the mechanisms of governance, that is exactly what we are now preparing."
"There are several ideas."
"One current idea is precisely to have ways of measuring progress and to monitor progress in certain areas on the basis of indicators."
"This is what we are preparing, and for this we need the support of Parliament and, hopefully, also the agreement of our Member States."
"(DE) Following up on the question which has already been asked, I would like to return to the 2020 climate strategy."
"Mr President, is it right that the provisional emissions trading system gives the largest steel company in Europe 90 million tonnes of CO2, despite the fact that it had 68 million last year and will have 43 million this year?"
"Can it be that the largest steel company in Europe will have earned GBP 1 billion by 2012 from emissions, having been allocated too large an amount as a result of its lobbying activities with, among others, the Commission?"
"President of the Commission. - Mr Langen, I do not know exactly to what you are referring, but, if you are talking about emissions in Europe, let us be honest about it: our emissions are roughly speaking 14% of global emissions and that trend is a downwards one, because there are big economies on the rise in terms of emissions."
"However, on an emissions per capita basis, we are still far above those economies and let us be fair about it: we also have some historical responsibility."
"The Americans produce more greenhouse gas emissions per capita than we do, but we produce much more than China and much more than India, for instance, if you are referring to the Indian case."
"This is indeed a problem that we have to address in a spirit of global fairness."
"If we want to solve the problem and if we believe there is a threat to our planet - that of climate change - we need cooperative efforts on all sides."
"So, yes, we do have more stringent conditions than in some other parts of the world, but we are also viewing this as an opportunity to develop new technologies so that we can meet our targets without putting at risk our companies, because we do not want to export our companies and our jobs."
"Colleagues, during Question Hour with President Barroso, please do not ask additional questions, because a lot of people are waiting for their first question."
"I am very sorry, but I would prefer to move on to a fresh question."
"President Barroso, as you mentioned, interest rates are indeed affected by the state of the economy."
"They reflect the confidence in a particular economy and the international economic community is affected by them."
"Interest rates are affected by the confidence the Community has in a particular economy and that confidence is, in turn, affected many times by statements on the confidence that the European Commission shows in measures taken by Member States."
"In that sense, speculators also try to speculate on a bad economic situation and sometimes make it worse."
"President Barroso, are you prepared today, in this Chamber, to state your support for the measures announced yesterday by the Greek Government to reverse the economic situation in Greece?"
"Does the Commission believe that they are moving in the right direction and, if applied, that they could change the financial situation, which you have indicated has been problematic in the past?"
"President of the Commission. - I have already said that I was happy to hear yesterday Prime Minister Papandreou's commitment to cut the public deficit and reduce government debt through permanent expenditure cuts and revenue increases."
"I even added that the 2010 budget currently being discussed in the Greek Parliament and the Prime Minister's statement are steps in the right direction."
"Naturally, the Commission will continue to monitor closely the macroeconomic and fiscal situation and the implementation of the measures in Greece."
"This is very clear in my statement of support for the measures announced."
"I believe that this is the best way we can help Greece in the very difficult situation they are now facing in terms of budget and debt."
"I trust those measures will have some important results."
"Mr President, I warmly welcome the chance to put a question to President Barroso because the Conference of Committee Chairs has, for the first time, been moved backward by an hour so we committee chairmen are able to be here for the first time."
"I want to ask him about a policy to help framework conditions for research and innovation - which I was rather disappointed to see did not make it into this first draft of 2020, but I hope will be there in future - and that is to harness the huge potential of public procurement, throughout the European Union, to stimulate innovative products and services."
"I want to ask him today if he would take up the recommendations endorsed almost unanimously by this Parliament in my report last November, which showed how this could be done."
"Just to give him an idea and to share it with colleagues, if 1% of European public procurement was secured for innovative products and services, it would raise the investment in innovation across the European Union by no less than EUR 15 billion."
"President of the Commission. - Thank you all for your comments, but let me tell you that there is no first draft of the new strategy."
"There is a Commission working document for consultation but we are not yet at the point of presenting a draft."
"Therefore, all your comments are very welcome."
"Do not expect from me in a reply of one minute to give a decisive answer to such an important issue as the one you have put forward."
"I am aware of your report. I am aware of some of the interesting proposals you have made in terms of public procurement and, yes, it is also my intention, it is in the broad guidelines."
"I presented this to Parliament, as you will remember, in a reference to the need to deepen those commitments in terms of more market friendly, more innovative public procurement rules in Europe."
"This is certainly going to be part of our future strategy but I cannot, at this stage, commit to exactly how it will be incorporated."
"(SV) Mr President, one of the biggest failings of the Lisbon strategy which, in other respects, is a good document, is that we have, to a certain extent, failed to get the Member States to actually achieve the goals set out in the strategy."
"My fellow Member from Finland asked Mr Barroso earlier how he thought we could get the Member States to follow the strategy better."
"One of the targets that was included was how much the Member States should invest in research and development in terms of a percentage of GDP."
"I would like to know whether the Commission intends to set similar targets for the Member States, in other words, how much of its gross national product each Member State should invest in research and development."
"President of the Commission. - We are now assessing the reasons why all the goals and targets were not attained."
"With the new proposal, we will make an assessment - I believe a very honest and objective assessment - of what went right and what went wrong with the Lisbon strategy."
"I cannot commit at this stage to what we are going to propose; we are precisely at this moment thinking about the way forward."
"That is why, when I mention the discussions I would like to have with you, I talk about real discussions, because your input is very important."
"I personally think that to have an overall target for all Member States is probably not very realistic."
"I think the next phase of the European Union 2020 Strategy will have to be more refined and more sophisticated, having specific targets - agreed, of course, with the Member States - but for different situations."
"This is my personal thinking."
"We have not yet come to the stage of presenting a proposal to you."
"I would also like the new Commission to have full ownership of the proposal, and we will present a bilan of the last Lisbon strategy."
"Mr President, by next year, Britain's net contribution will have doubled from what it was in 2008."
"In 2020 there will be four to seven new Member States at least."
"On their current economic performance, each one of the new Member States will be receiving cohesion funds - which are subsidies by another name - from the date they become members right the way through until 2020."
"Can, therefore, the British taxpayer anticipate a further doubling in Britain's net contribution to the European Union by 2020, and, if not, why not?"
"President of the Commission. - I am not yet at the stage of discussing the financial perspectives and I cannot anticipate what Britain's contribution will be."
"I understand the concern that you are expressing, because at the present time, British taxpayers are paying the biggest contributions because of what happened in the financial sector in Britain."
"There has been no other case of such large State aid as that which we have seen in your country."
"The point we are at today is the following: we believe it is important to set priorities for the future, to see what we have to spend at national level and what we have to spend at European level, and then to have a discussion about the fair way of sharing that investment."
"However, we believe that in some cases, it makes more sense to spend a euro at European level than at national level because of the potential benefits of exploring the European dimension and the European internal market."
"We will come to that discussion and, I hope, at the end, we will come to an agreement."
"This was our third Question Hour with the President of the European Commission."
"Thank you very much, colleagues, for putting forward questions for discussion."
"As regards presence, there were slightly more people in the Chamber at the end of Question Hour than there were at the start, at 15.00."
"I am very sorry about that: we would have preferred to have had a lot of you here."
"Thank you once again, President Barroso."
"Mr President, the point I would like to make is that there are many people here today who have not had a chance to ask Mr Barroso questions."
"Given the huge salary that Mr Barroso is on, can he not spend another 30 minutes with us on a regular basis, to make this an hour and a half?"
"The first 30 minutes were with the other group leaders."
"There are 750 Members in this place."
"I think 30 minutes is ridiculous."
"Can we not have an hour and a half?"
"Mr Barroso, you are on a good enough salary, sir."
"Come here for 90 minutes, not 60."
"President Barroso is smiling very politely, but we will see."
"We must decide about that."
"Thank you for your proposal."
"Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council on the Middle East peace process, including the situation in eastern Jerusalem (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council on the Middle East peace process, including the situation in eastern Jerusalem."
"Mr President, the conflict in the Middle East was one of the issues we discussed here in Parliament right at the beginning of the Swedish Presidency."
"It feels good to be able to come back and report to you like this at the end of our term of office."
"Sweden's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Carl Bildt, was also in the Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, where he presented a report and held long discussions, including on the Middle East."
"Last week, the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation in the Middle East and adopted conclusions."
"We are pleased that all 27 Member States support these conclusions, which clearly indicate the EU's views on the peace process in the Middle East."
"With these conclusions, the Council and the Presidency want to send a very clear and strong message from Europe that we hope may result in the negotiations between the parties being resumed soon."
"We are concerned about the lack of progress in the peace process in the Middle East."
"We have therefore made clear our support for the efforts by the United States to achieve peace."
"The EU is calling on the parties to accept responsibility and begin negotiations on all final status issues, including Jerusalem, borders, refugees and security."
"Our conclusions also reflect the EU's position on the Middle East, based on international law, that we have held for a long time and that we have expressed on many occasions."
"The EU's position is, among other things, that an agreed two-state solution must be based on the 1967 borders and that the settlements are illegal."
"Jerusalem is a final status issue and we have made it clear that, if genuine peace is to be achieved, Jerusalem's status as the future capital of two states must be settled through negotiations."
"Resumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations was linked to the settlement issue for a large part of the year."
"Recently, the Israeli Government announced a partial and temporary settlement freeze."
"The Foreign Affairs Council welcomes this decision and we hope that it will contribute to a resumption of meaningful negotiations."
"However, we note with concern the surprising decision by the Israeli Government on 13 December to make the settlements part of the National Priority Areas programme for the first time."
"This goes against the spirit of the settlement freeze and damages the efforts to create an atmosphere that can help to bring about a long-term resolution of the conflict."
"My colleague, the Swedish Minister for International Development Cooperation, Gunilla Carlsson, visited the Committee on Development in the European Parliament at the beginning of September."
"She promised to follow developments locally, to provide assistance and to intervene in the areas that we are all aware of - the situation in and around East Jerusalem, the settlements and issues such as access and movement, particularly with regard to Gaza."
"We have fulfilled this promise."
"Over recent months, under the leadership of the Presidency, the EU has adopted a clear position with regard to the settlements and the continued closure of Gaza."
"The policy of closure is unacceptable and counterproductive."
"The EU is continuing to demand that the border crossings be opened immediately and unconditionally for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons."
"The Council has also called for the full implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1860 and for international humanitarian law to be respected."
"Those holding the abducted Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, must release him immediately."
"I would like to say a few more words about Gaza."
"Of course, we hope that the mediation efforts by Egypt and the Arab League can continue."
"It is important to prevent a permanent division between the West Bank and East Jerusalem, on the one hand, and Gaza, on the other."
"We look forward to free and fair elections when conditions permit."
"One thing is clear - peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be achieved if the Palestinians are united."
"Our diplomats in the region have followed the situation in East Jerusalem closely."
"In their view, Israel is weakening the Palestinian community in the city."
"This causes us concern."
"The EU will increase its assistance to East Jerusalem to ease the living conditions of the Palestinians."
"The strong message concerning East Jerusalem in the Council's conclusions is clear evidence of our concern for the situation."
"It is important to remember that settlements between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon are prerequisites for there to be peace in the Middle East."
"The EU welcomes the recent statements by Israel and Syria confirming their willingness to advance the peace process."
"It goes without saying that this would have extremely positive repercussions in the whole region."
"Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, the Council adopted very substantive conclusions on the Middle East peace process last week."
"These set out a principled position on a number of crucial issues in a clear and determined manner."
"I will not dwell on the conclusions or repeat what the Presidency has said."
"Suffice to say that in reaffirming our principles, I hope we may have helped restore some Palestinian confidence and willingness to enter into the peace process."
"The conclusions, of course, will also be of great help to me, in providing me with a clear steer for the months to come."
"You have invited me here today to talk about our political work, but also about the situation in East Jerusalem."
"This is an area of deep concern."
"East Jerusalem is occupied territory, together with the rest of the West Bank."
"The EU is opposed to the demolition of Palestinian homes, the eviction of Palestinian families, the construction of Israeli settlements and the route of the 'separation barrier'."
"The EU is addressing these issues at political level, through diplomatic channels and in our public statements."
"We are also addressing the situation through practical assistance, aimed at supporting the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem."
"For example, there is a lack of 1 200 classrooms for Palestinian children in the city, so we are helping to reinforce education facilities."
"In addition, we enable Palestinian hospitals in East Jerusalem to remain viable and we do a lot of work with Palestinian young people in the city who suffer from high rates of unemployment and psychological problems."
"To date, in East Jerusalem, the EU is implementing activities costing EUR 4.6 million."
"Another aspect of concern, of course, is the situation in Gaza."
"We have consistently called for the flow of aid, trade and persons."
"We are deeply concerned about the daily living conditions of the Gazan people: since the January conflict, donors have not been able to do reconstruction work and serious issues persist like the lack of clean drinking water."
"Israel should reopen the crossings without delay, which would allow a revival of the private sector and a reduction of Gaza's aid dependency."
"It is now time to move to action and put the Council conclusions into practice."
"We now need to think about how we can re-engage a political process."
"The two sides appear to have strayed further apart, in terms of engaging on an end game."
"I will be travelling to the region shortly and my main objective will be to meet the main actors and see first hand how the EU can be a force for change."
"I believe we all agree with the overall and overriding priority of a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations - not negotiations for negotiations' sake, but negotiations to achieve a peace deal and turn the page."
"We cannot - nor, I doubt, can the region - tolerate another round of fruitless negotiations."
"Negotiations have taken place on and off for several years starting with the Oslo Declaration of Principles signed in September 1993."
"That was 16 years ago."
"Negotiations should be based on international law and respect previous agreements."
"All issues should be on the table including the status of Jerusalem as the future shared capital."
"They should also take place within an agreed timeframe with effective mediation."
"We need to see a serious commitment and the political will from both Israel and Palestine to engage in serious and genuine negotiations."
"The European Union is there to help both parties take that engagement and offer them support on the difficult road of negotiations."
"I am here to make sure Europe works effectively and harmoniously."
"The EU has consistently supported both Israel and the Palestinians by giving them the time and space to negotiate bilaterally."
"Our assistance has enabled the Palestinian Authority to build the institutions of the future state of Palestine, so that it can deliver services to its people and be a reliable neighbour in the region."
"Today, however, the Palestinians are divided both politically and physically."
"Credible negotiations require a strong and united Palestinian partner."
"Israel stands to gain, not lose, from a strong Palestinian partner."
"Israel has taken a first step with its temporary and partial settlement freeze."
"We hope this will contribute towards a resumption of meaningful negotiations."
"The US remains an indispensable and crucial actor in the Middle East."
"Conditions for an effective EU-US partnership on the Middle East have rarely been as good."
"It is time to turn this into a reality by closely coordinating our positions and strategy."
"The EU will continue to support and work closely with the US via the Quartet."
"The Quartet needs reinvigoration - the current stalemate in the peace process demands it."
"The Quartet can provide the careful, yet dynamic, mediation that is required."
"Peace in the Middle East requires a comprehensive solution."
"Both Syria and Lebanon have an important role to play."
"We look forward to the implementation of the Arab Peace Initiative."
"They should be part of the solution."
"Our approach should be regional and inclusive."
"A multilateral framework should complement the Israeli-Palestinian bilateral framework."
"In the coming months, I intend to remain in close contact with Parliament on all these issues."
"I am aware of the active role Parliament plays, not least in its capacity as budgetary authority."
"At political level, the EP delegations work directly with the Israeli Knesset and the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)."
"Last week, the Delegation to the PLC visited the occupied Palestinian territories and reported with great concern on the situation on the ground."
"Finally, I welcome the continuation of Parliament's working group on the peace process, which will meet again this week."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, during a visit of young Israeli and Palestinian leaders to the European Parliament, a thorough discussion was held which outlined a peace settlement for their future - a secure and recognised two-state solution, on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as the capital for both; demilitarisation of the Palestinian state; the reiteration of the 2007 Arab peace initiative;"
"NATO guarantees; and the refugee issue to be arranged in a way that does not alter the demographic character of the Hebrew state."
"While the young have a vision of a common future, their seniors still argue about whether they should begin negotiations."
"The Egyptian initiative for inter-Palestinian reconciliation - so that there is one interlocutor - is still pondering and the security arrangement in Gaza, with the liberation of prisoners, such as Gilad Shalit, is still awaited."
"In the meantime, the faits accomplis on the ground, according to the report by the EU Head of Mission in East Jerusalem, renders the Palestinian state less and less viable."
"I regret the fact that Israel, a democratic country, pays little attention to the damage some of its actions create through the eyes of international public opinion and limits itself to damage limitation only afterwards."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, firstly I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Swedish Presidency for this initiative."
"It was a good initiative and I would like to congratulate you on it."
"I would also like to thank Baroness Ashton for sitting on the Commission's side on her first appearance here, even though she has spoken primarily in her role as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"This is all about a common foreign and security policy."
"In some ways, it may not be important where you sit."
"What is important is that you are here and that you are representing a common foreign policy."
"My second point is that the statement adopted by the Council is a good one and it is by no means anti-Israeli."
"On the contrary, it is in the interests of Israel and its security and stability."
"It is very important to emphasise this."
"If we, as Europeans, are to play an active role in this respect, it is essential that we continue to do so."
"I would ask you, Baroness Ashton, to take this to heart."
"A few days ago, we were in the US having discussions with our colleagues from Congress."
"When faced with one-sided approach of Congress and its lack of understanding of the situation of the Palestinians, President Obama has very few options open to him."
"We have great sympathy for the situation in Israel."
"We are also opposed to any form of terrorism and we want the captured soldier to be returned to his family at last."
"However, we are equally concerned about and sympathetic towards the unfortunate position which the Palestinians find themselves in with regard to everything referred to in this statement and, in particular, the 1967 borders, the difficult situation in Jerusalem and the settlement activities."
"It is completely incomprehensible, although it is a continuation of the policy of the last few years, that a highly conflicting approach is being taken to settlement growth."
"First it was stopped and then it was included in the national priority programme."
"After this, only natural development continued and then roads were built which cut through Palestinian settlements."
"The way in which land is being taken away from the Palestinians on a day-to-day basis is totally unacceptable."
"What happened to a delegation from Parliament is also completely unacceptable."
"Mr de Rossa will also give his view on this."
"The Members of this Parliament must join together with the Council and the Commission to state clearly that Members of Parliament have the right to travel to Gaza and to see the situation there for themselves."
"What does Israel have to hide?"
"Why is it preventing Members of Parliament from going to Gaza?"
"We must not accept this and I hope that we will oppose it jointly."
"Transparency and openness, among other things, are the prerequisites for a reasonable Middle East policy."
"We must give this our clear support."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - (NL) Mr President, Mrs Ashton, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, firstly, Mrs Malmström, I should like to congratulate the entire Swedish Presidency on the Council's conclusions on the Middle East conflict in general and East Jerusalem in particular."
"I believe everyone will see it as an important omen that a joint report by the EU Heads of Delegation on East Jerusalem has been approved and adopted unanimously for the very first time, and at this time in particular, following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Another omen is that the conclusions proposed by the Swedish Presidency have also been adopted unanimously, including those on East Jerusalem."
"I hope that the Israeli authorities realise the importance of this development."
"Ladies and gentlemen, we debate the Middle East every few months, and sometimes it seems like the Echternach procession: one small step forward, then signs of a backwards step, then more cause for hope."
"Unfortunately, there is also cause for despondency, but we continue to hope, of course."
"It is of the utmost importance, of course - including to my group - that both Israelis and Palestinians be able to live side by side in peace in two separate states, to benefit from all the available development opportunities and to guarantee each other's security."
"I believe we all agree on this."
"We also agree on what steps would ideally lead to this and, of course, we are prepared to make our contribution."
"Jerusalem is one of the most beautiful cities in the world - it is really an extraordinary place - and so it is terribly tragic that the peoples living there side by side cannot manage to do so peacefully."
"For the sake of the wellbeing and preservation of Jerusalem, I hope that, in the few days remaining before Christmas, this can still be achieved."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I would like to welcome the statements from both the Council and the Commission, but my question to them both is when are we are going to go beyond the fine words - which I very much agree with - when are we going to have real action?"
"We have heard the same words over and again that we need to ensure that Israel does this or does that, but we need the real leverage to make that happen, otherwise Israel will simply ignore us, as it continues to do."
"My question is what practically can you do to make sure that we see real movement and progress here?"
"To my mind that has to involve issues like the suspension of the EU-Israel Association Agreement."
"Focusing on the situation in East Jerusalem, I welcome very much the Swedish Presidency's initiative and its clarity over the role of Jerusalem as a capital of two states and your firmness about the importance of Israel freezing its settlement activity in East Jerusalem."
"I also pay tribute to the authors of the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem itself."
"That report speaks with a clarity and vision which is all too often absent in these debates."
"It sets out how Israel's policy of illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is deliberately designed to weaken the Palestinian community in the city and prevent Palestinian development."
"But the Heads of Mission called on the Council to adopt a whole range of recommendations as a result of that report, and I believe that we need to see urgent action from the Council to do exactly that."
"If the EU is serious about its commitment to a two-state solution, it needs to be doing everything possible to preserve and strengthen the Palestinian character and identity of East Jerusalem."
"The Heads of Mission statement and report show practical ways of doing so."
"Mr President, particularly at this time of Advent, many are praying for peace in the Middle East, but sometimes one loses heart and thinks this peace will never come."
"It is, nevertheless, important that all parties continue to work for peace, yet therein may lie the main problem."
"Are all parties able and willing to work for peace?"
"Israel has already taken action to exchange land for peace in the past - I am thinking of its withdrawal from parts of the Gaza Strip - but, unfortunately, this did not lead to peace."
"Indeed, the rocket fire increased and, in 2009, Israel invaded the Gaza Strip."
"Now, Israel has announced a temporary halt to construction on the West Bank. A series of roadblocks has also been removed."
"This was a gesture to help bring about peace talks."
"This action by the Netanyahu Government is already fairly far-reaching by Israeli standards, yet I still see little movement on the Palestinian side."
"People keep saying that what Israel does is of no account, but I fail to see a Palestinian gesture to enable talks."
"Is the Palestinian side willing and able to bring about further talks?"
"Hamas seems to be embroiled in its struggle with Fatah and to be kept on a tight leash by Iran."
"Mahmoud Abbas seems to be a paper tiger, no longer wielding much influence to speak of."
"I think it is time the Palestinian side, too, made clear that it wants peace."
"Mr President, Lady Ashton, we welcome the decision taken on 8 December by the Council of the European Union."
"This confirms the European Union's support for the creation of two states on the basis of the 1967 borders."
"Nonetheless, based on experience from our recent visit to the area, the situation which prevails in the territories in question makes the creation of a Palestinian State almost impossible."
"I refer specifically to the erection of the wall, to the demolition of Palestinian houses and, most importantly, to the creation of settlements in the area of the West Bank as a whole, especially around East Jerusalem."
"Around 500 000 settlers are living in these settlements today."
"More importantly, in East Jerusalem, efforts are being made to create a palisade by erecting settlements around the city, so as to force the Palestinians to abandon their homes."
"It is now obvious that the Israeli Government is using talks to gain time."
"Slowly but surely, it is trying to impose its sovereignty on all the Palestinian territories."
"In addition to advocating the solution of two states, the European Union should take specific measures against Israel."
"The continuing violation of human rights is sufficient cause for the European Union to impose sanctions on the basis of Article 2 of the treaty, because if, on the one hand, it chooses to support the peace process but, on the other hand, continues to upgrade economic relations with Israel without limitation, the only thing it will achieve is to serve Israel's policy, which consists of forcing the Palestinians to abandon their land and expanding Israeli sovereignty to the whole of Palestine."
"Mr President, has Europe taken leave of its senses?"
"This rhetorical question was put by the United States at the start of December."
"The subject of this fierce criticism from Congress was the unilateral designation of East Jerusalem as the capital of the envisaged Palestinian State in a draft Council Resolution in circulation."
"As Chair of the EP Delegation for relations with Israel, I had imagined and hoped for a more constructive start to our transatlantic dialogue."
"Also, I hasten to add, careful examination of both the draft and the final Council statement left me, like our counterparts in Congress, extremely dismayed."
"I distance myself emphatically from the proposal to divide Jerusalem, in particular."
"I consider the Council statement on the Middle East to be a serious diplomatic and political setback for the peace process, and hence am very disappointed in the Foreign Ministers for being led by the Swedish Presidency, of all presidencies, with its strained relations with the Jewish State."
"I have several fundamental objections to the said Council statement."
"This is hardly the way to encourage the Palestinian Authority to resume talks with Israel."
"In addition, the statement goes against the Quartet's principle, laid down on 9 November 2008, that 'third parties should not intervene in the bilateral negotiations'."
"The official reaction of the United States to the Council statement of 8 December underlined this principle once more."
"Is there nothing for it, then, but to resign ourselves to the impasse in the peace process?"
"Absolutely not!"
"Following recent delegation visits to Israel, I firmly believe that a gradual, solid process of rapprochement between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority is both necessary and possible."
"Gradually transferring administration on the West Bank, for example in Area C, and strengthening economic cooperation, whilst strengthening and establishing reliable Palestinian institutions, will really move the peace process forward."
"I call on the Council and the Commission, therefore, to stop making counterproductive declarations on the peace process and instead to invest in specific projects involving cooperation between the Israelis and Palestinians."
"This is an established European formula, is it not?"
"Mr President, as a member of the parliamentary delegation to Israel, I listened with interest to the Foreign Affairs Council's comments on the Middle East peace process and the Commission's statement."
"However, I, like my previous colleague, are left with an overriding sense of concern in relation to these."
"Israel is the only functioning democracy in the region."
"The favourite tactics of its opponents have been terrorism against the state."
"I believe that the Council and the Commission statements fail to give proper weight to Israel's security concerns."
"In fact, I did not hear the High Representative mention those concerns in her statement to this House."
"Furthermore, I believe that the statement places too strong a burden upon Israel, both in terms of the failure of the process to progress and on the resolution of the outstanding issues - in particular, Jerusalem."
"(ES) Mr President, the truth is that this is a very unusual debate, because we have Mrs Malmström sitting on the Council benches - soon we hope to see her sitting on the Commission benches."
"We will see where she sits!"
"In any case, Mr President, the Council's conclusions do not exactly incite optimism."
"The Council has expressed its deep concern regarding the lack of progress in the Middle East peace process, and is asking for it to be resumed on the basis of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, the conclusions of the Madrid Conference and the road map."
"Nothing is new under the sun."
"It also says that the European Union is prepared to make its essential contribution to resolving the problems that the two speakers have presented here: the problem of eastern Jerusalem, the water problem, the security problem and the border problem."
"There are, however, a series of new elements that I would like our guests to give their opinion about."
"Firstly I would like to know whether, in their opinion, the eight-month moratorium and the settlements decided upon by the Israeli Government are linked to the new United States Government."
"I would also like to know what they think about the statements made yesterday in Gaza by the representative of Hamas, on the twenty-second anniversary, saying that they are not intending to make any concessions to Israel and that they are not intending to recognise it."
"What do they think of the continuity law that is going to give a voice to the Israeli people through a referendum on the occupation of the occupied territories?"
"Finally, what do they think of the Goldstone report and its adoption by the United Nations Human Rights Council?"
"Do they think that this is something that will help the peace process or, on the contrary, as Israel maintains, do you think that it is something that will obstruct or hinder it?"
"Mr President, there are two commitments which I specifically want to welcome in the Council statement and which have the potential to create a new dynamic: support for the Palestinian Authority's two-year programme for ending the Israeli occupation and establishing the Palestinian state, and the Union's readiness, when appropriate, to recognise a Palestinian state."
"Last week, I led an official European Parliament delegation to the occupied Palestinian territories where, once again, I saw with my own eyes the apartheid system being implemented by Israel against Palestinians, along with the dispossession and destruction of their homes, their lands, their water and their places of worship."
"Within hours of the publication of the Council statement, the permission my delegation had for going to Gaza was rescinded."
"That is not the act of a friendly state."
"It is certainly an interference in the democratic right of this Parliament to have decent and democratic relations with our opposite numbers, elected by the Palestinian people."
"We found widespread despondency and hopelessness amongst the people we met and in the areas we visited in Hebron, East Jerusalem and Ramallah."
"Where there is hopelessness, there will be violence."
"We can make progress now or we can let the situation slide into more bitter violence, which will drive moderate Palestinian politicians out of leadership."
"That is the choice we have to make."
"I would appeal to both the Council and to Baroness Ashton, whom I wish well, to reinvigorate the Union's engagement with this process - not just looking towards the Quartet to reinvigorate its engagement with the process - and to put in place a timetable coinciding with the Palestinian authority's two-year timetable for the implementation of the principles we outlined, so bravely in my view, last week."
"We must vigorously defend human rights."
"We must act."
"We must use access to our markets to incentivise Israel."
"I am not talking about sanctions."
"I am talking about ensuring that access to our market is used as an incentive to ensure that Israel acts in relation to its international responsibilities."
"We must also, finally, persuade the United States to urgently re-engage on the same basis we outlined last week."
"Mr President, the EU Heads of Mission report on East Jerusalem makes pretty devastating reading."
"Let us not beat about the bush."
"This report makes clear that what is going on in East Jerusalem amounts to a form of ethnic cleansing."
"Palestinian homes are being stolen, people are being forced out and hopes of peace are being destroyed."
"So the question is: what are we going to do about it?"
"The Council's conclusions are very welcome."
"We know they are strong, because the Israeli Government immediately dismissed them."
"Nothing new, they said."
"They are used to dismissing our words because we never back them up with deeds."
"They treat us with contempt."
"Why shouldn't they - we are so gullible we actually pay the bills for the occupying power!"
"We keep the Palestinians going when it should be Israel footing the bill, not our taxpayers."
"If our words are to have meaning, then we should suspend or threaten to suspend the association agreement, but not one of our foreign ministers has ever even raised that possibility, we are told."
"So the question remains: where is the policy?"
"Well, we have the policy."
"It is in the conclusions."
"Now what about the action?"
"Israel will not move unless it is pushed."
"(DE) Mr President, I would like to welcome Baroness Ashton to her new position."
"I would also like to thank the Swedish Presidency for the resolution and for acknowledging that it will not be possible to implement the two-state solution in the long term unless we can solve the settlement problem."
"The Heads of Mission report has been mentioned several times and we also believe that it is very good."
"On this basis, I have two questions."
"What is the current status of this report and where will it be published?"
"Secondly, what will you, the Commission and the Council, do to implement the recommendations in the report?"
"I would now like to quote three of the recommendations from the report."
"The first is:"
"'prevent, discourage financial transactions from EU Member States' actors supporting settlement activity in East Jerusalem by adopting appropriate EU legislation'; second, 'ensure that products manufactured in settlements in East Jerusalem are not exported to the EU under the EU-Israel Association Agreement'; and, third, 'provide guidance on origin labelling for settlement products to major EU retailers.'"
"(DE) The proposals made in this report are very specific and precise."
"What steps do you plan to take now to implement them?"
"(FR) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I thank you and I welcome your comments."
"Europe now has two essential documents with which to push for new peace initiatives."
"Firstly, the courageous report by the Swedish Presidency, which you just mentioned, Mrs Malmström."
"This report calls for progress along the lines of having two States, one of which would be Palestine, within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital."
"Secondly, the text by the ambassadors, the Heads of Mission, which shows that the Israeli authorities are pursuing a strategy whereby they demolish houses and colonise land in violation of human rights."
"This strategy is aimed at cutting Jerusalem off from the West Bank so that the very idea of creating a Palestinian state is shelved."
"However, our words in this House will clearly have no effect if we do not follow them up with concrete acts."
"We must act and, to do so, we can suspend the European Union-Israel association agreement until such time as the Israeli Government complies with international law."
"We therefore need to act to ensure an end to the colonisation, the lifting of the blockade of Gaza, the destruction of the wall of shame, the return of the refugees, and the release of all the political prisoners."
"May I say one more thing."
"The release of the soldier, Gilad Shalit, has been discussed in this House."
"I agree with what has been said."
"However, at the same time, our Parliament must gives its support to the release of another European citizen, the young Franco-Palestinian, Salah Hamouri."
"Yes, freedom for Gilad Shalit, but also for Salah Hamouri!"
"(MT) Please allow me to start by congratulating the Council for the courageous conclusions it reached last week."
"In my opinion, we have never had such clear, concrete and courageous conclusions on such a sensitive issue from the Council as the one we had last week."
"Therefore, I congratulate the Council."
"I would, however, like to add that we must now proceed to take action, since the situation in Jerusalem is deteriorating on a daily basis and cannot be tolerated any further."
"There are problems of blatant violations of international law, there are difficulties which are causing great suffering to many persons, including expulsion from their homes, destruction of their residences, and the construction of illegal residences."
"We cannot remain silent in the face of such injustices, because by doing so, we would be conveying the message that law, diplomacy, and the much cherished principle of peaceful solution of conflicts are worthless."
"I do not think that we would have allowed this to happen in our country."
"We must therefore act by creating the right environment conducive to confidence building between the two parties, and to have two distinct and viable states which can cohabit peacefully."
"Kindly allow me to give credit to the instrumental role Jordan is playing in this regard."
"A final word to Baroness Ashton - you have been assigned a new role by the Lisbon Treaty, an important role which provides us with an opportunity."
"Let us please not miss this opportunity."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we were in Ramallah when we heard the news that Europe had adopted a new decision on the Middle East peace process."
"We saw the hopeful smiles on the faces of the Palestinian representatives."
"They were days filled with emotion and suffering, etched on the faces of the children gripping the window bars of their homes on the Hebron road, the deserted road that no Palestinian is allowed to cross."
"We saw the suffering of an 85-year-old woman, driven out of her occupied home, forced to sleep in the cold in a tent set up in the garden of what used to be her own house, and the suffering on the faces of the Palestinians who had built a farm using European funds, subsequently destroyed by Israeli soldiers."
"Israel has the right to be an independent state, but the Palestinians also have the right to a homeland, a state and a passport."
"The decision of the Council of Europe represents a considerable step forward, but we need to act immediately."
"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is just the tip of the iceberg in a larger conflict."
"On the final day of our visit, the Israeli authorities prevented us, the European Parliament delegation, from visiting the Gaza Strip."
"I believe that in this regard, the High Representative, Baroness Ashton, should step in to protest on behalf of democratic Europe."
"I should like to thank Mr De Rossa who led the delegation and all the other members of the delegation, because during the days we spent in Palestine, the vulnerable were able to see and hear the face and the words of a Europe which upholds rights and wishes to, and must, do more."
"(FI) Mr President, Commissioner, Mrs Ashton, I believe that the new High Representative must be amazed at how the European Parliament has done its homework."
"What sort of history books must it have read if it did not know how the state of Israel came about in 1947?"
"This interpretation that the Council adopted under the Swedish leadership therefore seems a bit odd."
"We have to remember that the European Union must stand by its values."
"We have democracy, human rights and freedom of opinion, which is important."
"Furthermore, Israel is the only democratic country in the Middle East."
"We should not be creating anti-democracies there, non-democracies, because they do not respect our values."
"It is also very important to remember that the idea that Jerusalem should be divided, making it a city in two countries, is quite inconceivable."
"The European Union would not propose such a thing for any other democratic country."
"Of course, we need to ensure that Israel can preserve its democratic system and its rights in its own capital, and the European Union can be involved in the peace process, and it should be, but in a diplomatic role and not as a doctor or judge."
"It is regrettable that Gilad Shalit, who is a French national - a citizen of the European Union - and an Israeli soldier, has not been released."
"This shows what the Palestinian administration and Hamas think about the European Union."
"They have no respect whatsoever for our principles or our values."
"We need to move on, and these sorts of daydreams, which the Council resolution largely consists of, should be abandoned."
"Israel is a democracy; its values are the same as our own."
"We must defend democracy and people's right there to a complete and secure existence, and to peace, and that peace can be achieved when the terrorist organisations, Hamas and their cohorts, stop the attacks against Israel and Israeli citizens."
"Here we have the scope to fight terrorism together and make it possible for Israel to exist as a nation."
"(NL) Mr President, in their report of 23 November, the EU Heads of Delegation in Jerusalem and Ramallah made very clear that Israel is actively engaged in illegally annexing East Jerusalem and completely isolating it from the rest of the West Bank."
"I ask myself, therefore, why the Foreign Affairs Council is not drawing the right conclusions from this."
"Why is it simply disregarding the specific recommendations, in particular, of such an important factual report - its own report, at that - knowing that the current developments are irreversible and, in so doing, even casting serious doubt on the chances of establishing an independent, viable Palestinian State alongside the State of Israel?"
"The Middle East peace process has no need for woolly pronouncements."
"It is high time and the right moment for the European Union to assume an active, visible role in the region, and this is only possible, of course, if we also show the courage to take a clear and unequivocal position, particularly on East Jerusalem."
"(EL) Mr President, the EU policy is to support the Israeli Government, together with the United States and NATO, in its criminal policy of genocide of the Palestinian people."
"This is the conclusion reached by members of the European Parliament delegation which the Israeli authorities prohibited from entering the occupied Gaza Strip."
"EU policy and the recent decision essentially give extra time to Israeli governments, which burden themselves with war crimes, as we know from the UN report on the war in Gaza, so that they can continue with their occupation plans."
"The mealy-mouthed talk by the European Union is out of keeping with the righteous global call for a viable and independent Palestinian state on the 1967 territories with its capital in East Jerusalem."
"The European Union is not taking any practical steps in this direction."
"On the contrary, it is upgrading relations with Israel, which continues with the settlements, especially in East Jerusalem, with the construction of the dividing wall and with the shameful and criminal isolation of the Gaza Strip."
"We reject imperialist plans for the Middle East and stand side by side with the Palestinian people and all the peoples in their struggle."
"(SK) I have to say that the results of last week's meeting of the Council of Ministers were not entirely balanced and, moreover, I have the feeling, as I have been dealing with this issue for a long time, that they have not really advanced matters in terms of our efforts for the peaceful coexistence of these two nations."
"I would therefore like to say that I know that we have more to do."
"We have to be not only mediators but also active mediators in this peace process, and we must insist that the solution to this catastrophic situation appears equal and is equal and acceptable to both states, so that both states, both Palestine and the State of Israel, have an equal stake in it."
"The Council has tried to bring the Palestinians back to the negotiating table, despite their opposition to some Israeli measures, and we, too, are insisting that needless obstacles to the peace process are removed as soon as possible."
"The demolition of Palestinians' homes in East Jerusalem and the building of settlements and separation barriers on occupied territory are not acceptable."
"It is also unacceptable, however, for us to expose Israel and not to manage to defend it actively against all attacks and terrorist activities aimed against citizens of the State of Israel."
"I would like to emphasise, of course, that it is also necessary to respect the international legal framework, without which there can be no hope of stable development for the region."
"In my opinion, we Europeans, the EU and the citizens of our states, are prepared to hold out a helping hand and I hope that Baroness Ashton achieves success with her mission to the region and returns from the region with good reports."
"(DE) Mr President, Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I am a member of the delegation for relations with the Palestinian Legislative Council, in other words, the Palestinian parliament."
"Last week, our delegation was refused entry to Gaza by Israel."
"The situation in Gaza is very disturbing, particularly now that winter has come."
"Only 10% of the population can obtain the supplies they need by smuggling goods through the tunnels and this is exactly why the tunnels are tolerated by everyone."
"Before operation 'Cast Lead' the situation was exactly the reverse and 90% of the population of Gaza could take care of themselves."
"As an occupying power, Israel should be responsible for providing for the population in all the occupied areas."
"Israel is shirking its responsibility under international law, which means that the international community and, above all, the EU have to step in."
"If we are supplying food to 90% of the population of Gaza, we have a right to see where European taxpayers' money is being spent, whether it is being used appropriately and whether it is reaching the people who need it."
"(FR) Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Mrs Malmström and the Swedish Presidency on their excellent conclusions."
"They revive the expectation that we all had, namely that it would be confirmed that the EU is indeed responsible for peace in the region under international law, and that, I believe, is crucial."
"Nevertheless, I am surprised that, one year after the military invasion of Gaza, no reference has been made, in these conclusions, to the follow-up to the Goldstone report sought by the Council."
"What stage are we at in the follow-up to this Goldstone report, to which the Council committed itself, notably with regard to the internal investigations involving the various parties concerned?"
"Next, I am delighted that East Jerusalem is being considered as the capital of the future Palestinian State, or the Jerusalem of the two States."
"Nevertheless, these conclusions lack specific operational options."
"On the other hand, there are very many such options in the mission report by the Heads of State or Government who visited East Jerusalem."
"I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to kindly clarify for us the specific methods by which, in fact, the European Union will neither recognise nor legitimise the annexation of East Jerusalem that Israel is currently seeking to achieve by, among other things, introducing economic measures, but also by orchestrating the mass displacement of Palestinian communities."
"Mr President, may I welcome the presence of the new High Representative in the Chamber and also the strong Council conclusions on the Middle East steered by the Swedish Presidency."
"On the Goldstone report, I would like to congratulate Mr Bildt, on behalf of the Presidency, for praising the - and I quote - 'credibility and high integrity' of the Goldstone report."
"I do think it would be useful if Mrs Malmström could repeat today in the European Parliament what her Ambassador said in the United Nations - that the EU urges Israel and the Palestinians to launch appropriate, credible and independent domestic investigations of human rights violations in relation to the Gaza conflict."
"Finally, can I ask the Presidency and the High Representative if they are aware of the British Government guidance adopted last week for food labelling to distinguish between imports originating from the Palestinian territories and those from illegal Israeli settlements, and tell us what plans they have for extending this advice to the European level."
"As electors, we can choose to pay the costs of peace."
"As consumers, we do not want to subsidise the price of conflict."
"Mr President, I think that the recent European Union position led by the Swedish Presidency on the Middle East that would recognise East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent Palestinian state may harm European efforts to play a significant part in mediating between Israel and the Palestinians."
"It might be counterproductive with our common objective to bring peace to this already turbulent region."
"I personally believe that rather than unilaterally and unexpectedly announcing an independent capital for the Palestinian territories, it would be preferable and more useful if the European Union would concentrate all its efforts on encouraging and pushing for the creation of a real democracy in the Palestinian territories, for example, supporting non-violent opposition."
"This would help the Israeli state and democracy, as well as the international community, to find a credible and legitimate interlocutor."
"As Cecilia Malmström has said today, the status of Jerusalem should be negotiated bilaterally by Israelis and Palestinians."
"I therefore believe that rather than a 'two states for two peoples' solution, a 'two democracies for two peoples' vision would be more desirable."
"Democracy, dear colleagues, is a precondition for peace."
"(DE) Mr President, firstly I would like to say how pleased I am that Baroness Ashton is sitting on the Commission side."
"I hope that she will continue to do so."
"I have two questions for the Presidency."
"In the conclusions from the Council of Foreign Ministers there is no reference to the Middle East Quartet."
"Is the Council not in agreement about the role of the Middle East Quartet in the peace process or what is the reason for this?"
"Secondly, the same thing applies to Hamas."
"No reference is made in the conclusions to this group which, unfortunately, is politically important."
"What lies behind this?"
"(FR) Mr President, since Mr Le Hyaric practically doubled his speaking time, I feel entitled to go at my own pace, but I shall nevertheless get straight to the point."
"Under the Swedish Presidency, we had become used to better, much better."
"Mrs Malmström, please forgive my frankness."
"Designating, decreeing, as she has done, East Jerusalem as the capital of the future Palestinian State - just to begin with, I know - is, in my view, a rare diplomatic error - I am speaking euphemistically here."
"The error is not one of substance - let no one be mistaken about what I am saying here - but the way in which this declaration, which prejudges the final outcome of the negotiations, patronises, indeed scorns, the parties concerned."
"Moreover, there are many Member States that have taken a stand and kept their distance from this first draft of the text."
"So yes, of course, a thousand times yes to an open capital, a shared capital, this form of sharing that, since the 2000s now, has been part of the Clinton Parameters for a negotiated peace, a principle that has been accepted by Ehud Barak in Taba, and by others too."
"Furthermore, we also remember, in this very Chamber, the powerful way in which it was defended by Avraham Burg and Ahmed Qurei."
"Jerusalem: a sacred city for three religions, the capital city of books, an open capital."
"The only thing is, our role is not to impose sharing, a timetable or methods, but - as was said earlier - to encourage dialogue so as to enable the parties concerned, Palestinians and Israelis, to come to a conclusion."
"Mr President, the Council conclusion is indeed a welcome vigorous statement of the EU position and its intention to play a much stronger role in a reinvigorated Quartet engagement."
"Do the Council and Commission therefore agree that the approach urged on it by some, which is to boycott Israel, is completely the wrong route to that engagement?"
"You cannot boycott and engage at the same time."
"Indeed, the right approach is the one also stressed by the Council conclusions, which is to reaffirm the further development of bilateral relations with Israel."
"However tempting it is, the Council can only be an influential player politically, as well as with economic support, if it resists the temptations - motivated sometimes by frustration at one or other of the parties - to have some sort of sanctions or punish one or the other."
"It is too complex a situation and it simply undermines a consistent, coherent EU pressure on both parties to get back to the table and have a peace agreement."
"(SL) I, too, am against the language of sanctions and threats and I, too, am in favour of a constructive policy and dialogue."
"However, I regret that we have heard far too often today the message that Israel is a democratic state."
"Israel is a state which is not behaving democratically when it comes to the Palestinians and when it comes to our common objective, which is the establishment of two independent, self-confident and secure states which will co-exist alongside each other."
"This is why, Baroness Ashton, I think that today you have been given many incentives for the development of a more constructive and a more effective European Union policy."
"I regret to say that Israel continues to see us as a paper tiger, not as a real entity with which it ought to establish a dialogue and which could be useful in resolving the problem."
"Mr President, as a member of the delegation that went to Palestine last week, it became clear to me that there are a number of sensible people who believe that the two-state option is dead in the water, largely because of Israeli actions, not least the proposals to extend the wall even further into and beyond East Jerusalem, thereby dividing the West Bank into the north and the south."
"What interests and what actions are we likely to take if the single-state option becomes a reality?"
"Secondly, are the Presidency and Lady Ashton aware of how much the views of, again, sensible people about the charade that passes off as the Quartet is prevalent amongst a number of people?"
"What actions are we going to take to ensure that the cost of this operation is matched by its effectiveness, which presently is nil?"
"Mr President, I agree with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Lieberman, that the final Council statement is a lot better perhaps than the earlier Swedish draft which I saw a couple of weeks ago, but it makes no mention of the accepted Quartet principles which Hamas repudiates as it carries on terrorising Palestinian Authority officials and civilians alike in Gaza."
"Also, why did Foreign Minister Bildt not visit the region to show solidarity with democratic Israel and moderate Palestinians?"
"Also, why was the annexation of East Jerusalem singled out for mention at this critical time?"
"The EU needs to be more balanced and formally recognise our common democratic values with the state of Israel and actually enhance Israel's participation in EU programmes - unusually, I agree with Baroness Ludford on this - under the Association Agreement, in order to build confidence by Israel in the EU's goodwill towards the Jewish state."
"Mr President, thank you for a very constructive debate."
"I would like to start by answering some specific questions and then I will say a few words to conclude."
"The Goldstone report is a very important one."
"It is a serious report."
"It is important to study the conclusions carefully and the EU has called on both parties, Israel and the Palestinians, to launch appropriate investigations in the spirit recommended in the report."
"As regards the Quartet, there is also a reference to the Quartet itself and to the need for the Quartet to step up its efforts in the conclusions adopted by the Council."
"With regard to the talks with Hamas, the Council is maintaining contact with the Palestinian leadership under President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad."
"The conditions for talks with Hamas are well-known and they have not been met."
"Finally, I would like to say that it is extremely gratifying to see the high level of support in this House for the conclusions."
"Everyone, with some slightly differing opinions of course, appreciates how important it is to try in every way possible to support the peace process in the Middle East and we all feel an enormous amount of frustration about the fact that it is progressing so desperately slowly."
"The peace of Christmas that will soon settle over this Chamber and many places in the world will once again not be experienced in the way we would like it to be in the region this year."
"At the beginning of the Swedish Presidency, we had hoped that the efforts of US President Obama would bear fruit in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations."
"It is important for the EU and the US to work closely together."
"This has not happened yet, but - as always with regard to this issue - we must be patient and persistent."
"The EU must be consistent and stand firm in its message with regard to East Jerusalem, borders, settlements and security."
"I am very pleased at the high level of consensus here in Parliament, including with regard to our conclusions, which are clear and consistent."
"They will form the basis for the EU's work for a long time to come."
"In this regard, it will be important for all institutions to work closely together."
"The EU is continuing its European security and defence policy mission in the region, and the European Union Police Co-ordinating Office for Palestinian Police Support (Eupol Copps), in particular, has made a significant contribution over the last year to improving the social and economic conditions for Palestinians in the West Bank."
"The EU also supports the preparations for the formation of an independent Palestinian state."
"A lot of work is needed here, and we, of course, support the programme drawn up by the Palestinian authorities: Palestine: Ending the Occupation, Establishing a State."
"In order to put an end to this conflict, a negotiated settlement must be reached between the parties."
"This must include all of the issues."
"We cannot accept a solution that is determined through unilateral measures, which then becomes a fait accompli."
"The solution must be comprehensive."
"It must include the Lebanese and Syrian track and it must be part of a regional strategy that settles the Arab-Israeli conflict."
"We are not there yet, but the EU has nevertheless taken a huge step forward."
"All of the institutions are very much in agreement about the need for this and I look forward to continued cooperation on this matter."
"Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, can I just say that the issue of where I sit, I suspect, will keep coming back."
"I am sitting here because the Council is over there."
"I may have to go and sit over there or you may have to build me a seat equidistant, because I assure you I will be in trouble somewhere for wherever I sit."
"It is a great delight, though, to be here with Cecilia and I look forward very much to working with her."
"What strikes me about the debate that we have just had is that pretty much - and I think, Mr Atkins, you may be the exception in what you said, though I listened with great care - there is a shared conviction that what we are looking for is a two-state solution."
"There is an enormous amount of passion from all parliamentarians, especially, if I may say, Mr De Rossa and those Members who have recently come back, and who have clearly seen for themselves the dreadful situation that exists on the ground."
"I believe what is significant about the Council conclusions is that they are very clear."
"They give me a real sense of the direction that we need to move in."
"What is also very clear - and I pay tribute to the Presidency for the work that they have done on this - is the frustration in this House that things are not moving, frustration borne of views that are sometimes quite different, but nonetheless converge on a desire to see a solution."
"The nuances are important."
"The views that you hold on the differences, as well as the similarities, matter to me as I navigate our future in these discussions and negotiations."
"There is no doubt to me that we have got to do two things."
"One is the rather political issues that you quite rightly raise."
"What is our relationship to be?"
"I am at the beginning of that journey, and this debate is extremely important to me in listening to the views that have been put forward."
"What I take away from it is, first of all, that the Quartet must demonstrate that it is worth the money, that it is actually able to be reinvigorated."
"I have already talked with the staff by video link in Jerusalem, I have already talked to Mr Blair about his work and I have already talked to Secretary of State Clinton about the same things."
"It is very important, if it is going to work, that the word 'reinvigorate' is absolutely right."
"Secondly, there are the issues in the region which the Presidency has raised about the broader questions of those other countries that we need to engage with. I think most significant from today is: what is the EU itself going to be able to do?"
"That brings me, in a sense, to what I call the practical."
"A number of colleagues have raised particular issues, whether it is a question of what the UK is doing on labelling, whether it is issues about the association agreement, whether this report - the Heads of Mission report - and the recommendations that I have not yet considered within it are there."
"We need to consider all of these issues carefully, but what we have got to do is demonstrate the practical support that we put on the ground."
"I described 1 200 classrooms that were needed and I described our work in health."
"We are very committed to Prime Minister Fayyad's state-building plan and to enhancing the institutions, particularly in terms of the rule of law."
"We must be seen to be practically engaged on the ground and practically working to find ways in which we can make the situation better for the people who have to live there every day and who look to us for the help that they need."
"That is the most significant and practical thing I need to do first of all."
"I would describe the work that I want to do as this: we have the potential to do the political and the economic."
"What I want to do is draw those two things together, to find a way in which we can enhance what we do, to support the work that is going on, to make the Quartet more effective, to bring together what has been, in a sense, the Council and Commission operating side by side, and to meld it into one so that what we do on the ground really makes a difference."
"In the end, it is the two sides who come together to make the decision and to find the peace."
"But, on the way to the end, we have a significant role to play, and I am determined, on your behalf as well as on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we play our full part in that."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"During the last Foreign Affairs Council, the Council of the European Union made it known that it wanted a Palestinian state to be created in the near future, within the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital."
"Europe is thus outlining the conditions of a viable solution to the Middle East conflict that is acceptable to both parties."
"The solution proposed by the Council is fair."
"Israel and Palestine can use it as a basis on which to exchange land for peace."
"The European Union has a major role to play."
"It can support inter-Palestinian reconciliation, without which there will be no Palestinian interlocutor in the negotiations with Israel."
"It can encourage the resumption of an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue within the context of the Union for the Mediterranean."
"in writing. - I welcome the recent Council conclusions on this matter, particularly regarding the issue of East Jerusalem."
"The Council has set out a clear position on several key issues, including the 1967 borders, Israeli settlements, access to Gaza, and support for a two-state solution in which Jerusalem would be a shared capital."
"These remain some of the crucial sticking points and the Council has succeeded in addressing them in its conclusions."
"The Council has provided the EU's High Representative with a list of concrete objectives and a clear direction in which the EU wants to see the negotiations moving."
"I am hopeful that this clarity and unity from the Member States will lead to more effective EU involvement in the negotiations, and an increased capacity to engage with other key actors in the peace process."
"Restrictive measures affecting the rights of individuals following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (debate)"
"The next item is:"
"the oral question to the Council (B7-0233/2009) by Emine Bozkurt, Louis Michel and Michèle Striffler, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on restrictive measures affecting the rights of individuals following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty;"
"the oral question to the Commission (B7-0234/2009) by Emine Bozkurt, Louis Michel and Michèle Striffler, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on restrictive measures affecting the rights of individuals following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"Mr President, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms are what the EU stands for."
"In the fight against terrorism, however, the EU is less principled."
"Take the UN blacklist, for example."
"People or entities suspected of having links with Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda network or the Taliban can be placed on this list, which results in a travel ban and the freezing of their financial assets."
"This measure is all well and good as far as terrorism is concerned, as this terrorism must be fought - that is beyond dispute - but the lawlessness with which terrorists operate must not be allowed to creep into the way we fight terrorism."
"Unfortunately, the current system is characterised by abuses of fundamental rights."
"People are placed on the list, often without being fully informed of the fact, without intervention by any judicial power."
"The information that leads to them being placed on the blacklist regularly originates from secret services."
"This information is not transparent to suspects and, as a result, they do not know why they have been placed on the list."
"This deprives them of not only their right to information but also their right of defence."
"Once a person's name is on the list, it is very difficult to have it removed."
"There have already been enough cases of people listed wrongfully for many years who had to fight for due legal process."
"They are condemned to poverty, cannot key in their PIN to pay for shopping and are not allowed to leave their countries."
"I am arguing today not for more rights for terror suspects but only for them to be able to rely on their rights like anyone else."
"I advocate transparent procedures and due legal process for everyone."
"The list also has far-reaching side effects."
"Since authorities can decide to place people or organisations on the list, this can also be used as a political tool."
"Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) fighting for human rights, for example, who are a thorn in the government's side, can be designated as terrorist organisations to paralyse their activities."
"The Commission was forced to revise the current procedures by a judgment of the European Court."
"The Commission gave this a decent impetus, but it failed at Council level."
"A new situation has now arisen as a result of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Is it to be Article 215 or Article 75 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union?"
"In other words, is the European Parliament to take no part in examining the proposals, or is it to be involved via the normal procedure, namely codecision?"
"The Committee on Legal Affairs has indicated that Article 75 is the correct legal basis, as has Parliament's Legal Service."
"I should like both the Council and the Commission to tell us today how they see the way ahead for these proposals for restrictive measures."
"What role is envisaged here for Parliament?"
"It is time we had transparent, democratic procedures."
"The question is whether we can count on your cooperation."
"Mr President, I am afraid the Portuguese interpretation is not working."
"I have not heard one single word from the previous speaker."
"Something must be done; otherwise, I cannot follow the debate."
"We will have to ask what is happening, and we will let you know, Mr Coelho."
"Mr President, Mrs Malmström, first of all, I would like to thank and congratulate my fellow rapporteurs, Mrs Bozkurt and Mrs Striffler."
"I fully endorse the conclusions of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as those of Parliament's legal service."
"Since respect for human rights is one of the fundamental values of the Union, it is crucial that these rights are fully respected."
"The measures taken as part of the fight against terrorism must be proportionate, appropriate and effective."
"Still in the context of respect for fundamental rights and the rights of defence, access to personal data by the persons concerned, as well as communication of the grounds on which the measure is based, are essential stages in the process of combating terrorism."
"Since sanctions and blacklists are only temporary, I believe that close and serious monitoring must be carried out and that a regular evaluation is required, with mandatory consultation of Parliament."
"While we can welcome the measures taken, particularly those relating to Zimbabwe and Somalia, we must bear in mind that these sanctions cannot, under any circumstances, serve as an obstacle to the development, democracy-building and human rights missions carried out by humanitarian organisations, or have harmful consequences for the local populations."
"Lastly, with regard to the protection of personal data, I fully endorse the conclusions of the European Data Protection Supervisor concerning the collection, processing and transfer of this data."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the vast majority of European citizens believe that the fight against terrorism must be conducted as a matter of priority at EU level."
"They are fully aware of the impact that Europe, through its global vision and the implementation of consistent policies, can have in this area."
"Thus, I welcome the fact that, thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament can do a thorough job of colegislating in this area and can provide the necessary democratic control where European counterterrorism policies are concerned."
"The first decade of the 21st century is coming to an end."
"We all remember that it began with one of the worst tragedies in the history of mankind."
"We cannot allow terrorism to develop and we must find a firm and appropriate solution to it."
"The Taliban, the al-Qaeda network and Osama bin Laden represent the greatest, most urgent risk for the European Union."
"Islamic extremism - a shameful abuse of the Muslim religion - and hatred of the West and its values sustain this deadly terrorist network."
"We must combat this phenomenon and, I repeat, the European Union must show that it is extremely firm and extremely vigilant in the face of this threat."
"Moreover, in view of the serious and constant violations of human rights and of the freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly committed in Zimbabwe, the European Union must not dare turn a blind eye."
"Natural and legal persons - belonging or not to the government - whose activities undermine democracy, respect for the most fundamental human rights, and the rule of law in Zimbabwe must be severely punished."
"By the same token, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union has a duty to take targeted measures against those who threaten peace, security and stability in Somalia."
"We must enforce the general and complete embargo on the supply of weapons to Somalia and ensure that the delivery of humanitarian aid and access to that aid and its distribution in Somalia are guaranteed."
"I say this because it is, above all, the poorest, most vulnerable populations that are suffering, and we cannot continue to stand by and watch."
"I regret, however, that Parliament's role in this area has been diminished by the Treaty of Lisbon, contrary to the spirit of the treaty and the importance that it confers on Parliament."
"However, the European Union must punish those responsible."
"Does that mean that it has to forget its most fundamental principles?"
"No. The European Union's action on the international stage must centre on the principles that have governed its creation, development and enlargement, and it must promote these values in the rest of the world."
"Mr President, what we refer to as restrictive measures are very important and something that I know many Members have opinions on."
"They are perhaps a little difficult for anyone listening to this debate to understand."
"Let me start by explaining how the Council uses these measures."
"Then I will talk about the Treaty of Lisbon."
"Restrictive measures against third countries, individuals, natural or legal persons or other entities are an important tool for the EU in its foreign and security policy."
"In general, you could say that they are used to bring about a change in a particular policy or activity."
"They should, of course, be used as part of an integrated, comprehensive policy that may include political dialogue, various forms of incentive and conditions that need to be met."
"Restrictive measures alone are not always sufficient to bring about a change, but they can be a way of exerting pressure on repressive regimes or stopping the flow of money and other resources that support such regimes or terrorist networks."
"In some cases, restrictive measures are introduced by the Council when we implement resolutions that have been adopted by the UN Security Council in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter."
"In such cases, the EU's various legal instruments must adhere strictly to these resolutions."
"They relate to situations and acts, including terrorism, that constitute a threat to peace and security."
"They can only form part of the EU's external action and, in that way, they differ from measures to create our own area of freedom, security and justice, which is, of course, our goal within the Union."
"The Council interprets the Treaty of Lisbon in such a way as to apply Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of these and other restrictive measures within the framework of the common foreign and security policy, including with regard to terrorism."
"The EU can also decide to apply further measures alongside those decided by the UN and we can also introduce measures on our own."
"Sanctions that the EU decides on by itself can be introduced to support other foreign and security policy objectives - respect for human rights, democracy, the principles of the rule of law and good governance - all in accordance with the EU's obligations under international law."
"The measures are currently most often levelled directly against those who have been identified as being responsible for the policy or the measures that we are opposed to, or against their interests or their sources of income."
"This is more effective than broader sanctions in the form of general trade embargoes or other more arbitrary measures."
"Targeted sanctions are intended to minimise the negative impact that these measures can have on the population of the country in question."
"This is a very important consideration when the Council is preparing a decision regarding the introduction of new sanctions."
"All sanctions are reviewed regularly to assess their effectiveness."
"They may be adjusted or lifted completely, depending on the developments."
"According to the Treaty of Lisbon, restrictive measures will also continue to be used as a tool within the common foreign and security policy by means of Council Decisions in accordance with Article 29 of the treaty."
"One important change in the new treaty is that decisions on restrictive measures relating to natural or legal persons are now subject to legal review."
"This means that the court can examine whether a decision regarding sanctions is lawful."
"This was not the case previously."
"Now that the Treaty of Lisbon has entered into force, regulations are adopted following a joint proposal from the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the Commission in accordance with Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
"The European Parliament shall be informed of any such decisions. I understand that this change is not appreciated by Parliament, as the Council is no longer obliged to consult Parliament on sanctions that relate to individuals."
"However, that is how we interpret the treaty."
"It is important to point out that any decision on restrictive measures, and implementation of these measures, must always comply with international law."
"Restrictive measures entail the restriction of certain rights for those individuals that they are directed against."
"Therefore, the sanctions clearly must respect human rights and the fundamental freedoms. This relates to procedural rights and the right to legal protection."
"The measures must also always be proportionate to the objective."
"With the experience that we have gained in applying sanctions, we have carried out thorough assessments and have looked at how sanctions can be imposed in a constructive way."
"A number of tangible improvements have been introduced."
"These include a requirement for the criteria for using certain sanctions to be specified, as well as the grounds for including an individual, a natural or legal person or other entities on a sanctions list."
"This must be continually reviewed and adjusted if necessary."
"In this work, the Council has taken account of the European Parliament resolution from last year on the evaluation of EU sanctions as part of the EU's actions and policies in the area of human rights."
"Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, as the Presidency said, the questions you have put forward raise important issues in relation to the future management of restrictive measures or sanctions in the EU."
"Following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty we now have to make a choice as regards the legal base for the proposed Regulation which amends the al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Regulation. Our view is as follows:"
"Firstly, the new treaty has added a specific provision to the article in the former EC Treaty on foreign policy-related restrictive measures or sanctions."
"Article 215(2) provides a new legal base for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons and groups or non-state entities."
"It expands the scope of the former Article 301 and should be applied as the legal base for amendment of the al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Regulation."
"Secondly, Article 215 applies when there is a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) decision."
"The al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Regulation implements a CFSP decision which requires that regulations be made to implement certain UN Security Council resolutions."
"These resolutions are binding for EU Member States under international law."
"Thirdly, we consider that a double legal base - Article 215(2) and Article 75 - is not workable."
"That is because the objectives, scope and procedures of the two articles are different."
"I note that Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee and legal advisers have made the same assessment."
"In conclusion, it is our view that the new treaty has provided specificity and clarity on the legal base for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons and groups or non-state entities."
"Article 215 addresses the role of Parliament and Council and the legislator should not deviate from the treaty."
"We were also asked to provide information on fundamental rights-related improvements in the work of UN Sanctions Committees."
"The proposed amendment of the al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Regulation implements the findings of the European Court of Justice in the Kadi case."
"In that judgment, the Court made a number of comments on ways to improve the listing procedures applied by the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee."
"The points made by the Court are the motivation to amend the listing procedures of the regulation."
"A number of UN Security Council resolutions have set out the procedures for handling the sanctions list at UN level."
"Most recently, UN Security Council Resolution 1822 provided that a summary of reasons should be made available on the UN al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee's website in connection with each listed person, and provided for a review of all names on the list by 30 June 2010, with provision for regular review thereafter."
"The resolution demanded that the relevant state take measures to inform the listed person of their listing, the reasons for it and information about exemptions and delisting requests."
"The approach in Resolution 1822 has since been replicated in Resolution 1844 on sanctions in relation to Somalia and in Resolution 1857 in relation to Democratic Republic of Congo."
"Resolution 1822 provides for a review of the measures contained in it after 18 months."
"That period expires at the end of this year."
"Work is ongoing in connection with the review but the Commission is not in a position to indicate what changes to the procedures the UN Security Council will decide."
"The strengthening of Parliament's powers has been a keynote in a number of politicians' speeches on the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty."
"The President of the Commission, Dr Barroso, for example, said the following here in Strasbourg on 25 November, on the preparation of the European Council: 'Now the Lisbon Treaty gives us a new opportunity to move ahead."
"We all know that freedom, security and justice will see some of the most significant changes from the treaty. [...] And, in particular, it extends the democratic framework for these policies by the full involvement of your Parliament.'"
"I would emphasise 'the full involvement of your Parliament.'"
"In his first official speech, the President of the Council, Mr Van Rompuy, also said that the treaty was a powerful tool with which we can face the challenges of our times."
"If that is the case, then, it would make no sense to highlight the strengthening of our powers and competences in official discourse and then to adopt a restrictive interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon, so as to deprive Parliament of prerogatives that it used to have and which it would make no sense to lose."
"The questions that have been asked are, therefore, based on common sense, but this common sense goes beyond a mere evaluation of doctrine and the consistency between declared intentions and their interpretation."
"There is also a practical consequence, which arises from the old saying that he who can do the greater can certainly do the lesser, and it concerns the following: what sense is there for a body that has competence in criminal matters and in preventing and combating terrorist attacks, through being involved in a codecision process, to be subsequently excluded a priori when other measures are at stake which, by affecting citizens' rights, may even also be important in this context?"
"Therefore - I am finishing, Mr President - it is fundamentally important that the way the Treaty of Lisbon is interpreted in legislation corresponds in reality to the stated strengthening of Parliament's powers and competences."
"At the very least, in some cases, as was raised in the question, it should be possible to have a dual legal basis when the rights of citizens are at stake and anti-terrorism policies are threatened."
"In other cases, such as Zimbabwe and Somalia, for example, optional consultation should be envisaged, as in fact is enshrined in the Stuttgart Declaration on the European Union, which was also mentioned in the question."
"That is the position that I wanted to set out here, Mr President."
"I would like to say that in my opinion, the efforts made by Members of the European Parliament in the ratification process for the Lisbon Treaty were not, from the perspective of the theme currently under discussion, adequately appreciated through involving us more in these processes."
"I consider restrictive measures and sanctions as an important instrument of EU policy in the areas of foreign and security policy as well as, of course, in questions of justice and the defence of fundamental human rights."
"Naturally, we were expecting an opportunity (as the European Parliament) to be much more involved in decision making in this area."
"We also accept that target measures and sanctions have the aim of minimising the impact on the civilian population and I am delighted that you have mentioned precisely this clause, Mrs Malmström."
"However, as the only directly elected representatives of European institutions, we nevertheless feel with some justification that we will simply be a kind of adjunct in the creation process and later excluded from the decision-making and control process."
"I do not consider this to be entirely correct, especially in a case such as this, involving a highly sensitive area relating to the field of justice and protection of fundamental rights, because the fight against terrorism is a highly sensitive theme for the citizens of our countries and for the entire EU."
"I will therefore wait patiently until the whole process is up and running to see what our cooperation will look like."
"Mr President, I am talking here about so-called targeted sanctions, about intelligent sanctions, those that have a direct impact on fundamental rights too - the fundamental rights of individuals, organisations or legal bodies of any kind."
"These fundamental rights are important."
"They can include, for example, freedom of movement, but also protection of property."
"It is for these reasons that these targeted sanctions must comply with a number of minimum rules in terms of procedure and legal certainty."
"I would add, moreover, that respect for these legal and procedural rules is crucial if these targeted sanctions are to be credible and, therefore, effective."
"It was the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe - we in this House remember - that, through one of its then Members, Dick Marty, demanded transparency and the right of defence and which showed the absurdity of this lack of transparency where the effectiveness of listing and delisting was concerned."
"Listing and delisting were liable to affect innocent people too, people who were unaware of what was going on around them and unable to do anything about a situation that they generally stumbled upon by accident."
"That is why access to data, as mentioned by Mr Michel, communication of the grounds for listing, and protection in the transfer of personal data, are crucial elements of this procedure."
"Moving on, it nevertheless took a great deal of perseverance on the part of the victims of the United Nations' and the European Union's system of sanctions and the mobilisation of civil society, human rights organisations and also the European Parliament to have these victims' rights recognised by the European Court of Justice."
"I would add that the Council's amendments concerning blacklists depend on the proposals that have been made, including by the European Parliament."
"That is why the European Parliament absolutely must be involved in taking, implementing and monitoring these decisions, since history shows that it was the European Parliament that made the reform of the Council regulation possible."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, like charity, rights begin at home."
"I ask about the rights of Europeans Sikhs."
"Because they wear the kirpan, a small ceremonial dagger, beneath their clothing, they have been prevented from entering the European Parliament."
"The kirpan is an act of faith which they may not remove, so their exclusion is a matter of religious and racial intolerance."
"In successive years, I have written to each of the two previous Presidents and the Commission who all replied that the exclusion is on security grounds."
"In celebrating her diamond jubilee, Queen Elizabeth came to my region, the East Midlands, where in their place of worship in Leicester, she talked to Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan, standing as close to them as you are to your colleagues."
"I am minded to speak on this today because a month ago, I was at the Palace of Westminster."
"There, in our democratic parliament, very close to both the House of Lords and to the House of Commons, I met several Sikhs, all wearing the kirpan."
"With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know."
"His forebears stood shoulder to shoulder with my forebears, fighting for democracy in those conflicts which have so disfigured this Europe of ours."
"As a result, you and 700 others have the freedom to come from the four corners of Europe to meet in this place."
"So what of the Lisbon Treaty which speaks of a Union founded on respect for freedom, equality, the rights of minorities, values of non-discrimination? Will you live up to your treaty, or is it just empty words?"
"Mr Clark, it is hard to see how exactly this connects with the present debate on the oral question, but thank you."
"Mr President, in the original list, what is the justification for placing the Taliban in the same category as Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda?"
"Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are terrorists who have already committed terrorist acts worldwide and intend to commit more in the future."
"We must pursue those people to the ends of the earth and restrict them as much as possible."
"Whilst the Taliban are an appalling, repressive and anti-democratic organisation, the world is full of unpleasant regimes and the Taliban are not even in government."
"They are also killing and maiming our troops in Afghanistan, for which they are quite rightly hated."
"However, they would not be killing and maiming our troops if our troops were not deployed there."
"The Taliban, as far as I know, have no ambitions beyond their borders."
"Is there not a danger that placing the Taliban in the same category as al-Qaeda provides ammunition for the warmongers in the US and British Governments to pursue a pointless, murderous and unwinnable war in Afghanistan for years ahead?"
"Furthermore, wars against Muslim countries only provoke terrorist outrages."
"Returning to al-Qaeda for a moment, there is considerable doubt about its existence as an organisational entity, as distinct from an ideological one."
"There is no possibility of drawing up a definitive and inclusive list of its operatives."
"The only strategy is to be watchful of those communities from which it recruits, regrettably, including innocent people as well as the guilty."
"(EL) Mr President, the Lisbon Treaty has a specific spirit and lays down new frameworks for cooperation between the institutions of the European Union."
"I agree with this new regime; the role of the European Parliament has become more substantial in terms of the rights of individuals, as decisions will now be taken under the codecision procedure."
"I therefore consider it slightly contradictory today, in the first plenary following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, that we are obliged to discuss and go into legal provisions on the limits on our new role before we have barely started to function and adjust to it."
"All of us, without exception, agree that we need to act decisively against terrorism."
"In this endeavour, it is often necessary to take strict measures, such as, in the present case, freezing bank accounts and movements of funds."
"On the other hand, respect for and protection of the rights of the individual are a fundamental and core value of the European Union and we are not entitled to overlook it when we take measures for citizens' security, without - of course - this meaning that we are not determined to give priority to combating terrorism and other criminal acts."
"Of course, both the opinion of Parliament's Legal Service and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities move in this direction."
"We are directly elected by the citizens of the European Union and that is precisely why we have a particular responsibility to explain to the citizens how, on the one hand, we are safeguarding their security and how, on the other, we are, at the same time, fighting to protect their rights."
"We are the most competent people for the job."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is committed to combating all forms of terrorism."
"When we speak of tackling terrorist offences, we need to ensure that fundamental rights are fully upheld and that the measures adopted to fight terrorism are suitable and effective."
"The rights of defence and fundamental procedural safeguards must therefore be fully complied with by the EU institutions, including when they draw up lists of individuals and bodies, in this case linked to al-Qaeda, that are subject to restrictive measures."
"It is equally essential that these measures are subject to proper democratic and parliamentary scrutiny, as rightly required by the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It is therefore clear, as also affirmed by Parliament's legal service, that each measure of this kind must follow the ordinary legislative procedure, enabling the representatives of Europe's citizens to fully perform their roles as legislators and guarantors."
"(DE) Mr President, Article 75 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union governs the implementation of restrictive measures to combat terrorism and, therefore, any intrusions into citizens' property rights, such as freezing bank accounts."
"While these provisions concern police cooperation in criminal matters, Article 215 refers to the common foreign and security policy."
"However, the Council has sole authority in this area."
"As a result, on one page, in Article 75, Parliament is a colegislator and, on another page, in Article 215, Parliament only has to be informed about events."
"However, both articles concern possible intrusions into the individual rights of citizens or legal persons, which is why the Council and the Commission must explain what the relationship between these two provisions is and why Parliament is not involved in the case of Article 215 in particular."
"Mr President, before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the three proposals in question were based on Articles 60, 301 and 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community."
"This is now only of historical interest, since the legal basis has changed and we have to refer to Articles 215 and 75 of the new treaty."
"Incredible as it might seem, the Lisbon Treaty limited the role of the European Parliament in this particular case."
"Article 215 clearly states that the Council only has to inform the European Parliament on the measures adopted, as opposed to the former procedure that implied the consultation of Parliament on such matters."
"I cannot accept that, and I strongly support my colleagues' initiative to clarify Parliament's involvement in this area."
"Leaving aside the legal aspect that I hope will be solved through good cooperation between the European institutions, I would like to draw your attention to the important problem that we are debating here, which is fighting terrorism and terrorism-related activities, such as the ones carried out by Osama bin Laden and the al-Qaeda network."
"I think that when it comes to such sensitive topics, we cannot afford to classify them into strict categories such as EU-internal and EU-external issues, because terrorist actions might be planned outside the EU but can seriously affect the people living inside the EU."
"We have the responsibility to protect these European citizens against terrorist action, so we have to be given the tools to do that."
"I trust your good judgment in solving this procedural problem, and I am looking forward to hearing the opinion of the representatives of the Council and the Commission."
"(PT) Mrs Malmström, Baroness Ashton, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to return to a subject addressed by a number of my fellow Members, particularly in the last speeches by Mr Papanikolaou and Mr Luhan."
"Let us look at one aspect at a time, starting with the proposals relating to Zimbabwe and Somalia."
"I accept that here we are dealing with the application of sanctions imposed by the United Nations, and as such, they clearly come under the Union's external actions."
"In principle, Article 215 seems to be the most appropriate."
"According to this article, however, any acts adopted in accordance with it should include the necessary provisions on legal safeguards, but this requirement is not met in either of the proposals."
"These initiatives originate exclusively from the Commission and not from a joint proposal of the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy."
"There is no doubt, therefore, that these proposals do not fulfil the necessary requirements for adoption on the basis of Article 215."
"With regard to the third proposal on persons and groups associated with Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda network or the Taliban, the idea that this comes under the Union's external actions is untenable, as Mr Luhan has just stated."
"Since preventing and fighting terrorism are one of the top priorities among the European Union's internal actions, this objective is explicitly included under Article 75 of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"That, then, should be the most appropriate legal basis, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure."
"Mrs Malmström, we are just beginning to implement the Treaty of Lisbon."
"With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, will the Council show its goodwill by starting off our international relations on the right foot, or does it intend to carry out a restrictive analysis?"
"I think we would all like to begin in the best way possible."
"(ES) Mr President, regarding specific restrictive measures, freezing funds belonging to individuals and entities linked to al-Qaeda and measures against members of the Zimbabwean and Somalian Governments, on 5 November, the Commission and the Council said that once the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, the proposals would be based on Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union rather than Article 75."
"Article 215 states that the Council shall inform Parliament of any decisions that provide for the interruption or reduction of economic relations, etc. Article 75, however, makes it clear that when it is necessary in order to achieve the objectives set out in Article 67, Parliament and the Council shall define, in other words, shall jointly decide on regulatory measures for the freezing of funds, financial assets or economic gains belonging to, owned or held by natural or legal persons, groups or entities associated with terrorist activities."
"Article 67 also sets out the objectives of the foundations of the area of freedom, security and justice."
"It therefore appears to be clear that, with regard to people or entities associated with terrorist activities, the legal basis for the Council's proposals for regulations should be Article 75."
"With regard to Zimbabwe and Somalia, the Council and the Commission could also consider the Solemn Declaration of Stuttgart, which provides for optional consultation of Parliament on international affairs, including when the treaties do not establish anything in that respect."
"I am simply clarifying my position, Mr President."
"I want to claim Parliament's role as colegislator, here and now, and ask the Council and the Commission for a more reasonable explanation."
"That is all for now."
"Mr President, first I want to say that this is a topic that is very difficult to get a definitive answer on what is right and what is wrong."
"We all know, ever since 9/11, that we are living in a very dangerous world where there are terrorists at large who have all day, every day, to spend planning their deadly missions, and they have the economic resources, some of it state-sponsored, to carry out their missions."
"For that reason, it is difficult for those who are trying to combat terrorism to prove how effective they are, but I think we could safely say that, if the terrorists had their way, this place would have been blown up long ago."
"While it is important that Parliament would have oversight on restrictions on individuals' rights etc., at the same time, we have to put our faith in those who are in charge of security."
"I think the evidence is there that they have done a good job."
"Sometimes, we may not be able to know all the details of individuals involved, but at the same time, the overall principle is a good one."
"(PL) I would like to thank you very much for allowing me to speak on this subject."
"I think no one in this House is in any doubt that terrorism is the curse of the 21st century and that we have to put a stop to it."
"Therefore, I understand, on the one hand, our concern to uphold fundamental rights, while, on the other, we know we are working here in an area where not everything can be open."
"Therefore, the question I would like to put to Mrs Ashton is as follows: should we, as Parliament, be given information about what I think is a very important matter - about various restrictions on the application of certain laws?"
"So my question is this: what range of information will be communicated to Parliament?"
"In my opinion, this discussion is not about whether Parliament can count on receiving this information, but about what the scope of that information will be."
"(SK) In view of the fact that the functioning of the Union is based on representative democracy and the citizens of the Union are represented at a European level in the European Parliament, I believe that the assessment of restrictive measures affecting the fundamental rights of individuals should, in this case, clearly have involved the participation of the European Parliament."
"It is not, in my opinion, coherent for the European Parliament, on the one hand, to be responsible for criminal matters and especially for prevention and the fight against terrorism and, on the other, to be excluded from the passing of a number of binding anti-terrorism measures that will be applied in the EU."
"Article 215 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, functioning as an exception to the provisions of Article 75, according to which the European Parliament is a joint lawmaking body, should therefore not have been applied or interpreted in such a way as to weaken the protection of fundamental rights and the democratic process of decision making in the EU."
"Before I give the floor to Ms Malmström and Ms Ashton, let me just say that this Parliament has great faith in both of you, and knows you very well, especially because of your personal involvement in these issues in the past."
"We very much look forward to working closely with you, and to your support, as you have given in the past, to the important role Parliament can play in this extremely sensitive field."
"Mr President, the Swedish Presidency has spent a considerable amount of time getting the Treaty of Lisbon in place."
"We are extremely proud of the fact that it has now entered into force."
"It contains significant improvements, which will be good for the European Union and for European citizens."
"One of the most important changes that the Treaty of Lisbon brings is precisely the introduction of the power of codecision for the European Parliament in the area of justice, security and freedom."
"This will give the European Parliament the power of codecision in a lot of areas."
"That is a good thing and it will increase the quality of the legislation that we produce together."
"It will also increase legal certainty and that is very important, as these are sensitive and difficult areas."
"I would also like to thank you for your support with regard to the introduction of sanctions against terrorists, individuals or regimes that oppress people and deny them their human rights."
"Sanctions and respect for human rights and legal certainty are not mutually exclusive - quite the contrary."
"Sanctions can be very effective and legitimate if, at the same time, they have legal certainty."
"I can assure you that the European Parliament will be involved in the formulation of new rules, including those relating to terrorism, with the power of codecision under Article 75 when it comes to sanctions within the European Union."
"However, as regards external action, in other words sanctions against third countries adopted by the UN, the European Parliament will have no power of codecision."
"This is what both we and the Commission clearly understand the treaty to state."
"However, we will give a lot of attention to your resolution on this matter and will always bear in mind the human rights aspect when we resort to the instrument of sanctions, within the EU and in the UN."
"We are continually trying to improve the procedure."
"We note your request for consultation and the exchange of information regarding proposals for sanction systems."
"I believe we can work together effectively and I have no doubt that we will find suitable ways to cooperate within the current institutional framework."
"Vice-President designate of the Commission. - Mr President, I will be brief."
"I think there are three particular points that I would like to refer to."
"Firstly, honourable Members have quite rightly talked about the importance of fundamental rights, and I think we would all agree that there of course is a significant role in this for the European Court of Justice who, amongst other things, will make sure that rights are respected in terms of what the Council or the Commission does."
"But I take the point very well."
"The second point I wanted to make was this issue of good cooperation."
"The previous president called upon both me and Mrs Wallström to be very clear about the importance that they attach to our role and approach in dealing with Parliament."
"I was asked specifically what information."
"At this stage, I do not know."
"I think one of the things that I have to do as I set out in this new role is work with Parliament, which I will do, to look at what it is."
"How we cooperate effectively and what information is included, bearing in mind indeed what was said about what can we put in the public domain or not."
"I will be extremely mindful of that for all the reasons that Members of Parliament would expect me to be."
"The third and final thing I would say is about legal certainty."
"I spent many hours taking the Lisbon Treaty through a parliament so at one time, I knew the treaty extremely well."
"The interpretation of Article 75 of course is how you refer back to Article 67 and the relevance of that within the context, and so the legal advice we have got is to try and seek to clarify where indeed this now fits."
"The advice we have is clear."
"Members of Parliament of course are at liberty to contest that, but I think it is very important that wherever we arrive in this, there is legal certainty."
"It is extremely important as the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect."
"It is extremely important to me as I work out how to do the role that I have been honoured to be given."
"It is extremely important that we reach a conclusion on this."
"For my part, I think we have the answer in terms of certainty."
"I do understand Parliament's concern; I do understand the need to nevertheless cooperate fully."
"I have received one motion for a resolutiontabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote shall take place tomorrow."
"Improvement needed in the legal framework for access to documents following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (debate)"
"The next item is the joint debate on"
"- the oral question to the Council by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on improving the legal framework for access to documents after the Lisbon Treaty enters into effect - B7-0230/2009);"
"the oral question to the Commission by Michael Cashman, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, on improving the legal framework for access to documents after the Lisbon Treaty enters into effect - B7-0231/2009)"
"author. - Mr President, can I start by saying that it is very good to see Commissioner Wallström in the room, as well as Cecilia Malmström, from the Presidency-in-Office, because we were both engaged in this dossier from the outset, in 1999."
"It is interesting to reflect that what we achieved in our agreement in May 2001 was somehow historic, amongst 15 Member States moving from different traditions and cultures, and different approaches, to openness and transparency."
"We managed to reach an agreement and, interestingly, in no small way was that due to the determination of the Swedish Presidency at the time."
"It was also due to the determination of the Commission to recognise that all three institutions needed a cultural change."
"We needed to see that openness and transparency did not prevent democracy from flourishing, but actually improved it."
"It allowed accountability."
"It allowed citizens to see what was being done in their name and, arguably, it helped us to lift the curtain and to prove once and for all that there were no terrible secrets hidden in the safes of the Commission or the Council - I am not so sure about Parliament, but hopefully not in Parliament's safes either!"
"I want to thank in particular the Commissioner and, if I may, my dear former colleague, Cecilia Malmström, for that commitment."
"Now we need another commitment."
"As I said, we have achieved a huge amount."
"We have a register of documents."
"We have the jurisprudence of the ECJ, now defining and redefining what was originally agreed on access to documents."
"We have accepted the principle that all documents should remain accessible and that, where not accessible, access should be reasoned against quite clearly and specifically in reference to either Article 4 - the exemptions - or Article 9 - sensitive documents."
"However, as we have moved on, Parliament has called repeatedly for a revision."
"I believe that the revision the Commission placed before Parliament, on which we subsequently voted in committee and the first reading of which was deferred in March of this year, did not go far enough, and I know we have a difference of opinion on this."
"Equally there were concerns - and those concerns still remain in this House - that there was an attempt to claw back on access to documents, not least in the redefining of documents - the notion that whole files could be exempted - and attempting to redefine the notion of the third-party veto."
"It is interesting that our citizens sitting in the gallery must be thinking that we are talking about something that happens in outer space - articles, third-party vetoes - but actually what we are talking about is a law that allows them to make sure that we are accountable: parliamentarians accountable for what we do in their name, the Commission for what it does in their name, and, equally, the Council."
"How can they do that and the NGOs do that if the way we work and who does what within all of the different units remains a well-kept secret, open only to those lobbyists and those lawyers who know?"
"That is what I believe is at the heart of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"It says that we need to further enhance democracy."
"We need to enhance access to documents."
"That is why Parliament, in this oral question, is calling for a whole range of recommendations to be undertaken."
"Basically, it is about ensuring that the rights that we have are built upon, that they are not diminished, and about recognising that under Lisbon, it is no longer just the three institutions but all of the agencies and the bodies set up by them, including the European Central Bank, in some instances, the European Court of Justice, the European Investment Bank, Europol and Eurojust."
"All of these institutions are now accountable under Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001."
"We believe that the proposals that have been brought forward since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty do not match either the spirit or the letter of that treaty or, indeed, the obligations that we believe are contained within the original Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, which, for the benefit of our listeners, governs public access to all the documents held, received or produced by the three institutions."
"Mr President, as you know, increased transparency is an extremely important issue for the Swedish Presidency."
"We have come quite a long way in our EU institutions when it comes to transparency."
"However, it is not just about laws and regulations."
"Transparency is about attitudes and about how laws and regulations are applied in practice."
"This morning, I had the great pleasure of meeting with Commission Vice-President, Margot Wallström, and Parliament's Vice-President, Diana Wallis, in the Interinstitutional Committee on Public Access to Documents."
"The meeting took place on the initiative of the Swedish Presidency."
"The committee had not met for two years."
"We had some very positive and specific discussions on how we could improve the opportunities for citizens to access the institutions' documents in practice."
"We should have meetings more often, and that was also one of our joint conclusions."
"I am pleased that the Treaty of Lisbon places a great deal of importance on transparency, public scrutiny and democracy."
"We welcome this."
"As regards the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049, which we refer to as the Transparency Regulation, the Presidency wishes, first and foremost, to focus on the new legal basis for the Regulation."
"This is contained in Article 15(3) of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The most important change in the new legal basis is the extension of the institutional scope."
"In plain language, this means that, while the previous article only applied to the documents of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, the new article extends the public's right to access documents to include all of the European Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies."
"There are certain restrictions with regard to the documents of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank, but it is a significantly larger area than it was previously."
"The Commission has announced that it will bring a proposal before Parliament and the Council with a view to adapting the present Transparency Regulation to the new provisions of the treaty."
"In the meantime, the Council's work on the review of the Transparency Regulation will continue to be based on the proposal that the Commission tabled before Parliament in May 2008."
"Since May 2008, the Council's Information Working Group has gone through the proposal twice."
"The second technical run-through was completed during June and July of this year and includes a number of the amendments that Parliament approved at the plenary sitting in March 2009."
"In May, Parliament decided not to conclude its formal reading of the Commission's proposal before the European Parliament."
"I would like to remind Parliament that my colleague, Beatrice Ask, who is the Swedish Minister for Justice, explained to the Committee on Civil liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on 2 September 2009, at the beginning of the Swedish Presidency, that she was prepared to initiate discussions between the institutions."
"She asked specifically whether the newly-elected Parliament intended to continue working on the basis of the 92 amendments that had been adopted by Parliament in March 2009."
"The reason for her question was that, as the Presidency, we need to know Parliament's position, even it if was not necessarily in the form of a completed first reading."
"As I understand it, the new Parliament has not had the opportunity to debate the Commission's proposal yet, but has focussed instead on the possible effects of the Treaty of Lisbon on the ongoing review."
"In the Council, we are awaiting the Commission proposal that has been announced relating to the impact of the Treaty of Lisbon on the Transparency Regulation."
"We will, of course, continue to be available to discuss the present proposal with you and it goes without saying that, in such discussions, it is only natural that we should take account of the effects of the new treaty."
"In my opinion, Article 15(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is an entirely relevant legal basis for the proposal under the new treaty."
"Other articles relating to public scrutiny in general, better communication between the institutions and citizens and good administration are of utmost relevance to the institutions' work in order to reinforce democracy, efficiency and legitimacy."
"We also need to discuss how this type of objective should be realised."
"However, I am not convinced that there is space for them within the framework of the Transparency Regulation."
"For the sake of clarity, the Regulation should contain clear rules relating simply to public access to documents and not a lot else."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, if I may first turn to Mr Cashman."
"I think this is the last possibility or opportunity that I will have to say thank you to you."
"You are indeed the face of the fight for this particular regulation and for openness and transparency in Parliament."
"You have become the face, the symbol and the advocate of it."
"I also think that we have a great deal of credibility, being Swedish, both Cecilia Malmström and myself, and I do not think that people will doubt that we will continue to fight for openness and transparency."
"At the same time, we have had our rows because we also play different roles and sometimes we have to be very realistic about what we can achieve and we have to fight our corners in each institution."
"That is not always easy."
"I think the whole political climate has also changed and the political balance has changed and that has affected our discussions on these issues."
"But our starting point, I would say, is absolutely the same and we also state that this particular regulation on access to documents has served us very well."
"Over the years, this has been an excellent tool that we also want to be used by more than the lobbyists and those who are paid for looking at all the documents."
"We want the general public and journalists to be able to use it and have full access to documents."
"That is my starting point."
"I know that I share this view, as you could hear, with the Minister."
"I think also the Swedish Presidency was a golden opportunity to move this issue forward."
"Now I really want to thank Parliament for the opportunity to have this debate on transparency and the new Lisbon Treaty because it places more emphasis on openness and what is called participatory democracy."
"We all agree that this is a most welcome development."
"The concrete question on the table today is: What measures will the Commission take with regard to the revision of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001?"
"As you know, with the Lisbon Treaty, the public right of access to documents has been extended, as we heard the minister saying, to documents of all institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, although there are some restrictions for the Court of Justice, the European Central Bank and the European Investment Bank for natural reasons."
"Concerning the review of Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, I want to point out that the new legal base, Article 15(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, is very similar to the former Article 255 and the main difference is the extension of the institutional scope."
"This issue was addressed by the Commission in our Communication on 2 December this year."
"This was aimed at aligning pending proposals for secondary legislation to the new treaty."
"(Some of you here may know it under the EU jargon as the 'omnibus act' - let's forget that the minute I have said it!)"
"It means that either of the legislators can now introduce an amendment extending the scope of the Regulation to the other bodies and institutions."
"This is also to let the Council know that this has been presented by the Commission and adopted by the Commission."
"Further progress in the legislative process leading to the adoption of an amended Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 is in the hands of the legislators: Parliament and Council."
"We are still in the stage of the first reading."
"We do not have a legislative resolution and we do not have the position of the new Parliament."
"Of course, the Commission will go on to contribute to reaching an agreement - as in other legislative processes."
"The Lisbon Treaty lays down a legal framework for participatory democracy."
"From the Commission's side, we have already taken a number of initiatives aimed at improving public consultation and participation on proposed new policies."
"For example, we will assess the Commission's consultation guidelines against the new provisions of the treaty and decide whether adjustments are necessary to further improve them, and we have already started the work on the citizens' initiative by launching a public consultation, to listen to the citizens and the stakeholders before presenting a proposal."
"The great importance of the citizens' initiative was also recognised by the European Council last week."
"And the incoming Spanish Presidency, I have understood, has put this very high on the agenda."
"They want rapid delivery."
"This morning, as we have already heard, the Interinstitutional Committee on Public Access to Documents met at the invitation of the Swedish Presidency."
"The task of this group is to examine best practice, address possible conflicts and discuss further developments on public access to documents."
"So we decided together that we will have an 'Openness' web portal; we will have complementarity of our institutions' public registers; we will have our respective IT services sit down and coordinate their access efforts and we will now consider the impact on access to documents when our institutions create or change electronic storage systems."
"I know that this is the time of year when you write wish lists."
"But I think when it comes to openness and transparency, you should not rely on Santa Claus."
"I think it is really up to us to deliver now: Parliament, Council and Commission."
"Real concrete and direct delivery."
"I think we have already started and we have to continue on this track so I am looking forward to our debate."
"Mr President, we had agreed with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups to submit an oral question about the status of the procedure and the next steps."
"On the basis of the response from the Council and the Commission, we planned to discuss how to proceed."
"We have just received this response in principle."
"It is not entirely clear to me why the rapporteur, contrary to the agreement between the groups, suddenly submitted a resolution in which he anticipated his own point of view."
"What answer does he want from the Commission and the Council?"
"Mr Cashman, I hold you in great esteem, but all of this happened quietly and secretly, with a complete lack of transparency."
"So much for your claim to be fighting for transparency."
"You have tried to bypass us."
"In addition, I believe that the legitimacy of this resolution is highly questionable under the terms of the Rules of Procedure."
"In any case, the content of the resolution is a repeat of your existing report from the last parliamentary term and, therefore, is completely superfluous."
"I know that you tried to negotiate with the shadow rapporteurs to introduce a joint resolution, but I am fundamentally opposed to this resolution."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has not, in my opinion, brought about such a change in the legal basis of the dossier that it has resulted in a change in the role of the European Parliament."
"The report was and is a dossier in the codecision procedure."
"This also explains the concerns of my group about the legitimacy of a resolution under the terms of the Rules of Procedure."
"I do not want to discuss the content."
"You bring together a lot of different things, including quotations from the Treaty on European Union, from the Treaty of Lisbon and from the Charter of Fundamental Rights, all taken out of context, in order to legitimise your motion for a resolution."
"It is certainly not legally tenable in the absolute form in which it is presented."
"You have not made a commitment to confidentiality, which is clearly necessary at least to a certain extent."
"This is required, for example, in the context of international agreements by third parties as a conditio sine qua non."
"You only need to think about the agreement with the US on SWIFT."
"There is also no mediation solution, for example, in the form of ex-post transparency."
"You fail to provide this."
"In addition, other legally protected rights, such as data protection or the right to privacy, are disregarded."
"We should not adopt this resolution."
"We have received a good response from the Commission and the Council and we should continue on this basis, in other words, the response to our oral question."
"I would ask you, Mr Cashman, to withdraw your motion for a resolution."
"Thank you Mr President, ladies and gentlemen."
"I definitely agree with our colleague Mr Cashman's opinion that following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the change in the legal situation, now is the most appropriate time to renew discussions on the 2001 regulation on allowing public access to documents, and the fundamental improvement and amendment of that regulation."
"With the Treaty of Lisbon, we are aiming for far greater openness to society, which means that decisions must be taken as openly as possible and be as comprehensible as possible to citizens."
"All the more so, since judgment of all of the European Union's work and confidence in its work are linked to our citizens' understanding of and ability to access the European Union's work and documents adopted."
"Openness here, in particular, is necessary to strengthen the principles of democracy and respect for fundamental rights."
"Thus, the opportunity for society to access documents must become a fundamental principle, and secrecy must only be applied in exceptional circumstances."
"The European Parliament has already done a lot of work in this area."
"In March of this year, it prepared its report on the Commission's proposal to amend the regulation currently in force, and this new proposal by the European Parliament is a suitable basis for new discussions."
"However, we must not forget that here, we are debating the amendment of a regulation and therefore, the continued cooperation of all European Union institutions and common agreement on the revision of transparency rules are imperative."
"An improved regulation would establish a better level of transparency."
"Since the Treaty of Lisbon is strengthening principles that strive for greater openness in the European Union and closer cooperation with citizens, it is important to establish concrete measures and groundwork for administering European Union institutions in order to achieve this goal."
"Therefore, I call on the new Commission to present a proposal as soon as possible and agree on a common position with the Council, in order to fully ensure an open and continuous dialogue with citizens and with the associations that represent them."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I am very pleased with the question and grateful to Mr Cashman for setting out his views."
"Indeed, I had thought that all the political groups in this House were agreed upon the resolution."
"That was what I was told was the outcome of the meeting this afternoon."
"It is clear that with the entry into force of Lisbon, we can go forward with a step change on the whole issue of transparency."
"As the Vice-President of this House responsible for transparency, I have not always found it an easy subject, but I do believe that now we have the chance to do better and to reach out even further to our citizens."
"Within this House, we are looking at our own arrangements for access to documents and access to information."
"For me, it was a real pleasure this morning to meet with Cecilia Malmström and Margot Wallström so that our three institutions for once could sit down together and really make some progress."
"It has already been referred to - and I think this, for us, is the big breakthrough - that, rather than this interinstitutional body that meets as and when, and two to three years apart, we have set ourselves six months to meet again and a much more regular timetable."
"We are serious, and this is a serious signal that we have made together, that we aim for a real transparency portal between all of us, that we aim to ensure that our citizens can see the legislative process as it progresses through all its stages, and that they can have a real input and real insight into what we do."
"So my group - and I believe all the groups - have agreed to amendments that will reflect today's progress."
"It only remains for me to say, thank you, for us as three ladies, that we managed some progress on this issue."
"Mr President, in the opinion of many publicists interested in European affairs, what is known as a democracy deficit has been noticeable in the European institutions for many years."
"This accusation is sometimes made unfairly, but at other times, it does have a basis in fact."
"In the latter case, it is pointed out that when significant decisions are perceived as being made by anonymous European clerks somewhere in far-off Brussels, the democratic mechanism is not working properly."
"This is why it should be stressed that openness is an extremely significant element of the European Union's activity."
"Authority must be answerable to society."
"Otherwise, as history has always shown, power corrupts."
"European society is made up of different nations which live in particular countries."
"Therefore, European Union institutions must answer to the citizens of every Member State, and the way to ensure continuous supervision of all authority entrusted to the European Union is to allow full access to documents."
"I am thinking primarily of working documents, analyses and consultations carried out by the European Commission or the Council."
"It is essential that the influence of interest groups on the development of regulations be recorded and open for everyone."
"It is important that not only Parliament have full access to these documents."
"The citizens of all Member States of the European Union should have the right of democratic supervision, so that it will be enjoyed by every interested organisation in society and every journalist."
"Only transparency can guarantee that the authorities and staff of the European Union will use the powers vested in them for the common good of the citizens of Member States."
"Ladies and gentlemen, this debate hinges on a question of trust."
"The European institutions are always asking the citizens to trust them."
"During the Lisbon Treaty process, for better or for worse, they asked the citizens to trust them."
"The financial crisis started, and they asked the citizens to trust them."
"Well, trust is a two-way street, and you cannot always ask the citizens to trust you if, at the same time, you do not trust the citizens enough to show them all the processes and internal workings that drive the Commission."
"Those in power cannot complain that the citizens do not trust politicians if the politicians themselves do not then trust the citizens."
"That is a problem of democracy; not only that, it is also a problem of waste."
"Society is itself a vast repository of knowledge that we will be wasting if we do not involve the citizens in the process of leadership and governance of the European Union."
"I have absolutely no qualms, then, in saying that I fully endorse the rapporteur's efforts, that he is doing democracy a good service, and that we should move forward not only towards transparency but, above all, towards ensuring that transparency is not just a fine word but means something concrete."
"on behalf of the EFD Group. - Mr President, the European Union has, in my country and elsewhere too, a richly deserved reputation for taking its decisions furtively, secretly and surreptitiously."
"One would suppose, therefore, that the Commission will do its best now to be open and transparent."
"Instead, the Commission has produced this proposal - I think it is 1049 - part of which actually restricts access to documents that are currently public."
"Beyond this, there is an important objective point which I remember from my time at Harvard University, and it is this: decisions that are made without transparency and no proper public scrutiny have a built-in tendency to be bad decisions."
"You should accept that one of the reasons that the Commission puts forward so many ill-considered, ill-thought out, inappropriate and ill-drafted proposals, which we in England and other countries have to put up with, is the lack of transparency."
"So in the matter of this legal framework I would urge the Commission to think again, if thinking again is ever actually a possibility for a flawed institution in a flawed system of governing."
"(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I listened very attentively to the speeches by the Commission, the Presidency and my fellow Members."
"The Stockholm Programme has indeed further clarified the importance of the right of access to the documents produced by the EU institutions."
"The Treaty of Lisbon also reasserts the right of access to documents by natural or legal persons, while nevertheless ensuring that regulations with criteria and limitations in line with the characteristics of each body will be established."
"As already mentioned, this year, Parliament has already had occasion to deal with access to documents and views were somewhat varied at that time."
"Today, we are all agreed on the need for a factual adaptation of the 2001 regulation, yet the solution proposed by Mr Cashman does not seem plausible, insofar as it extends beyond every reasonable limit the possibility to acquire documents which could, in fact, sometimes go against the prevailing public interest."
"I would cite some examples: negotiations with third countries or other sensitive activities require a clear definition, a counterbalance between the legitimate right to transparency, disclosure and knowledge, and the denial of access to documents in accordance with the prevailing and recognised public interest."
"We remain convinced of the need to promote the right of access to documents by natural and legal persons, in the knowledge that we must define a reasonable principle to balance conflicting needs: extending the role of the European Ombudsman, setting out precise and appropriate criteria for access and introducing transitional arrangements which will gradually lead to rules in line with citizens' needs, compatible with the proper functioning of the institutions."
"We are relying on the role of the current Presidency, the Spanish Presidency and the activities of the Commission to achieve this."
"(NL) Mr President, which document are you looking for, exactly?"
"What is the document number?"
"These are just a couple of the responses citizens can expect when they put a question to the European institutions."
"Citizens want information, however, not promotional material or indecipherable policy documents, and so a drastic change of course is needed."
"The focus must be on citizens."
"This forms the basis of the questions by Mr Cashman, whom I should like to thank for his excellent and - I address this to Mrs Sommer, who has unfortunately left the Chamber already - extremely transparent cooperation in the last few months."
"I should like to see part of the European information budget being spent on ensuring, via both digital information media and human contact, that citizens receive genuine, complete information and answers to questions such as 'Can you tell me the exact progress of the decisions taken by Europe on the European effort during the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference?'"
"This is what citizens want to know, and so I call on the Commission, the Council and, in particular, MEPs, to support our initiatives towards greater transparency."
"This strikes me as the only truly clear message."
"(FI) Mr President, public access to documents means the right of citizens to participate in decision making and acquire information in order to do so."
"The Treaty of Lisbon endorses this fundamental right of EU citizens."
"If the European Parliament does not defend this fundamental right, who will?"
"That is why it is very important that we adopt a strong and clear position in favour of transparency in this sitting."
"We should not accept any backward steps, or those the Commission is proposing."
"I can assure you that there are a lot of misconceptions going around concerning what we are deciding on here."
"We do not want to jeopardise international negotiations, but we think that citizens have a right to know what matters are being discussed with foreign powers that affect their rights."
"Neither do we conclude here that every Member of the European Parliament should make the contents of his or her e-mail public."
"If anyone is afraid of that, there is absolutely no need to be."
"(DE) Mr President, the question of transparency and citizens' access to documents in the European Union is undoubtedly of importance to the extent that people throughout Europe are still highly dissatisfied with the European integration policy."
"It is the case in Austria that a large proportion of people are dissatisfied with or sceptical about the European Union, because they have the feeling that there is no transparency and no access to policy."
"The processes for introducing and then pushing through the Treaty of Lisbon together with the election of the President of the European Council and of the High Representative have given citizens the feeling that they cannot see what is going on, that there is no transparency, and that they have no idea why these things have been done."
"I believe that if the Treaty of Lisbon is to be a success for the citizens of Europe, it is important that we should give people the feeling that they can identify who is making decisions within the Union and why and how they are being made."
"author. - Mr President, I felt it necessary to rise on two points."
"Mrs Sommer is still in the Chamber and I thought it appropriate, even though she is not listening, to respond to what she said."
"She made a series of accusations."
"One that I had not been transparent."
"Can I correct the record and say that all political groups and all rapporteurs have been invited to all meetings."
"When they have not been able to be there, their positions have been faithfully represented to those meetings."
"All decisions subsequently taken have been communicated to all shadow rapporteurs and all political groups."
"There has been a suggestion that somehow we should withdraw this motion for resolution that Mrs Sommer says is undemocratic and non-transparent - that her group knew nothing about this."
"Well, I find this interesting, when I have been negotiating this afternoon with her group, the EPP, on their draft motion for a resolution on the oral question."
"So I can only think that she is misinformed and, on that generous basis, I look forward to negotiating sincerely and in good faith with the EPP and with all other groups."
"Finally, it was remiss of me."
"It is the last time, Commissioner Wallström and I will face one another here in the Chamber and I just wanted to put on record, if I may, that I and Parliament have never doubted your commitment to openness and transparency."
"You have been absolutely right: we have always had to fight our own corner for our own institutions and you have fought yours brilliantly but never deflecting from the principle of openness and transparency."
"You have been and will remain, I am sure, a remarkable public servant with an exemplary record."
"You have never flinched from doing that which you believed to be right and just and decent and, on behalf of people who will never have the privilege to meet you, may I say thank you."
"Mr President, the legislation concerning public access to documents, in other words, what we are referring to here as Regulation (EC) No 1049, has served us well."
"I am very proud to have played a part, together with Mr Cashman, and with contributions from the Commission through Mrs Wallström, in its advent."
"The Treaty of Lisbon gives us the opportunity to go one step further, as the scope is being extended."
"This is a very positive thing."
"I regret that it was not possible to initiate an interinstitutional dialogue with the European Parliament during the autumn."
"We were waiting for the European Parliament's opinion before we could continue."
"I believe that the Spanish Presidency will also need some indication of the European Parliament's position on this in order to be able to progress with the interinstitutional talks."
"Pending this, there is much we can do."
"Both Mrs Wallström and Mrs Wallis referred to the meeting we had this morning, which represents a tangible way of promoting transparency and access to documents and of making our institutions more user-friendly."
"One of the things we discussed was how we can use our computer systems in such a way that citizens, journalists, NGOs and others can follow the progress of a piece of legislation from the Commission's proposal right up until it is finally voted through."
"I believe that that could help enormously to increase understanding and knowledge of, and trust in, the EU."
"Just as it has been said here, transparency is a good thing and it is necessary and important."
"It increases the effectiveness of decisions, it increases trust in the decisions and it reduces the risk of irregularities and suspicion."
"If the EU's legitimacy increases with regard to decisions, it will also be good for the quality of our decisions."
"It is therefore excellent that the European Parliament is having this debate and I hope that it will be taken further, even if the Swedish Presidency does not have the opportunity to do this."
"Thank you very much Mr Cashman and Parliament for raising this issue."
"Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, this was a very effective way of softening me up a bit as I now speak for the final time."
"I could not have chosen a better subject on which to make my last intervention in the European Parliament - which it probably is - than on openness and transparency."
"Let me just state some basic facts."
"The European Commission has provided a proposal."
"It is the only proposal on the table."
"We did it in the shape of a recast, which means that we think the basic principles in this regulation are sound; they are OK."
"We can use them but we have to modernise them, upgrade them and make them more effective."
"This was the whole idea behind the recast."
"We have some different views on a few things - how to define documents, etc. - but these are still the kind of negotiations that we should engage in and make sure that we move things forward."
"To do that, we need a first reading from Parliament."
"This is the basic message from our side."
"We also think, on the basis of a new treaty, that we can do it by expanding the scope of this regulation."
"That is the main difference, as we see it in the Commission."
"It will now cover all the bodies, agencies, etc. of the European Union. This is where we are today, so we still hope that Parliament will now provide, as soon as possible, a first reading."
"Then we can also have the views of the Council so that we can enter into proper discussions and negotiations and finally have a decision."
"Regarding a number of very important issues that you have also raised, Mr Cashman, in your report: I think there are other means that we can use as they are a bit outside the scope of this regulation."
"But they are still very important initiatives."
"They have to do with registers, with things we discussed - today, for example - where we can improve openness and transparency through other methods and not only through the Regulation."
"This is where we will continue."
"I know you do not like it very much, but I have taken the initiative to make an openness action plan, parts of which we discussed today, where we can join hands and make efforts to continue on openness and transparency and fight for that."
"On that positive note - I really want it to be a positive note - I would like to thank you all and I also want to use the opportunity to say 'Merry Christmas and Happy New Year' to all of you."
"Let me take this opportunity to thank you once more for all your cooperation over all those years."
"Merry Christmas and all the best to you."
"I have received five motions for resolution tabled under Rule 115(5)."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 December 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"Mr President, the problem of access to the documents of the bodies and institutions of the EU, which we are discussing today, is, in my opinion, extremely important in the European Union legislation process."
"Transparency, here, is essential, thanks to which every EU citizen has a right of access to documents, which, in the understanding of Article 15(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, includes not only parts of the prevailing legal order, but also drafts of legal acts."
"This means that every natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in the EU can have a direct influence on new legislation, and this constitutes a special form of public control."
"The currently prevailing Regulation No 1049/2001 ensures appropriate access to EU documents, but with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, we have been faced with an exceptional challenge, in which the role and real participation of EU citizens has increased."
"Unrestricted access to documents is, therefore, a significant determinant of the future form and function of the EU."
"Situation in Georgia (debate)"
"The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Georgia."
"Mr President, we are touching on many different areas here this afternoon, and that is what is so wonderfully exciting about sitting here in the Council Presidency chair."
"The subject that we are now going to debate is Georgia."
"It is an issue that I know interests the European Parliament and that I personally have very strong feelings about."
"Right at the start, I would like to make it clear that the EU is giving its full support to the stabilisation and normalisation of Georgia and to democratic reforms in the country."
"We are assisting Georgia in several very specific ways: through the EU monitoring mission (EUMM), through our active involvement and our key role in the talks in Geneva, and through increased EU financial aid to ease the humanitarian situation and to support Georgia's economic recovery."
"With the launch of the Eastern Partnership, the EU has strengthened relations with Georgia, as well as with other countries."
"We are offering an opportunity to upgrade relations by means of an association agreement and extensive free-trade areas."
"Georgia's goal is, of course, to achieve stability and prosperity."
"We will help them do this."
"However, in order for genuine progress to be made, Georgia must maintain its focus on democratic reforms."
"We attach a great deal of importance to issues relating to good social management and human rights."
"We appreciate the fact that Georgia is determined to continue with its democratic reforms and is particularly resolute about a second wave of reforms."
"Becoming an established democracy where citizens enjoy fundamental freedoms and human rights will bring major advantages for Georgia."
"It will benefit the country itself and the people who live there, of course, but it will also be beneficial through the creation of better opportunities for those living in the separatist regions."
"The political environment is challenging."
"Talks between the government and the opposition must continue to work towards a consensus on the central elements of institution building and on issues relating to constitutional reforms, election reforms, freedom of the media and human rights."
"Georgia's government must also continue to maintain contact with the opposition and civil society."
"The EU is prepared to provide assistance for this."
"In addition to the cooperation described in the European Neighbourhood Policy action plan, the Eastern Partnership's bilateral track is providing a special opportunity to make progress in this area."
"We are also looking at negotiation directives for an association agreement with Georgia and with Armenia and Azerbaijan."
"The process of upgrading our relations with these countries will be guided by the principles of participation, differentiation and conditionality, as well as that of shared responsibility."
"We welcome Georgia's commitment to working to improve relations with the EU on the basis of the perspective that the Eastern Partnership creates."
"The EU monitoring mission is a very important factor for promoting stability under the present circumstances."
"The mandate has now been extended until September 2010."
"Our focus is on measures to promote trust between the parties."
"Following the Geneva agreement on incident prevention and response mechanisms, the monitoring mission is playing a prominent part in coordinating the mechanisms between the different parties."
"I am referring here to the Georgians, the Russians and the de facto authorities in South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"Despite some difficulties, the parties have reached agreement on a number of points, including the establishment of a 'hotline' to deal with security-related matters at the administrative borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"The monitoring mechanism has used this to reduce tensions between the parties following the incidents in the Black Sea and to resolve an incident at South Ossetia's administrative border in which 21 Georgian citizens were detained and then later released."
"The monitoring mission will continue to work with the parties involved."
"The transition from incident prevention to measures to promote trust will be important in normalising the situation."
"The mission is monitoring newly-built settlements, the resettlement of internal refugees from the war in August last year and the facilitation of contact between internal refugees and the Georgian authorities, NGOs and international organisations."
"In this regard, it is clear that almost all of the internal refugees who were displaced by earlier conflicts are still living in conditions that do not meet international minimum standards, although the situation has improved since 2008."
"The mission will continue to help wherever it can to facilitate contact with the authorities."
"One event that is of key importance for the mission was the implementation of two memorandums of understanding with Georgia's Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Internal Affairs."
"However, we are being vigilant with regard to the risk that the Georgian authorities will cease to apply the memorandums of understanding, as there is a lack of mutual trust between the parties."
"As you as aware, a report was published recently by the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia."
"All of the parties involved, and the international community as a whole, can learn from this report."
"However, it must be seen in its entirety and not viewed selectively."
"The EU has consistently reiterated its unswerving support for Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders."
"It is our firm conviction that an international presence is required in Georgia and we will work to secure that."
"We regret that, despite support from the majority of States, it was not possible to reach an agreement in the case of the OSCE."
"The EU's position has not changed in respect of the agreements of 12 August and 8 September."
"Russia must implement these agreements in full."
"In this regard, there are still some important issues to resolve, for example, the border controls and the EU's general access to the territories of the two breakaway provinces."
"We will raise these issues in our talks with Russia."
"We also need to look forwards."
"In this regard, the talks in Geneva are extremely important, even though they will be difficult."
"It will be the only place where representatives from all parties will be present and it is important for us to actually be able to have pragmatic discussions concerning the non-use of violence and on international security arrangements."
"This is the only practicable way forward and we are looking forward to the consultation that is planned for the end of January 2010."
"That should be of benefit to everyone who is trying to achieve long-term stability and development for Georgia and for the region as a whole."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, dear future colleague, honourable Members, it is a pleasure to be here."
"Let me also say it is a delight to have an opportunity again to share views with you on Georgia."
"As you are aware, over the last two years, Georgia has been through very difficult times, both externally and internally."
"The war with Russia in August last year, which was just mentioned, left wounds across the whole region and Georgia is still struggling with basic issues such as the essential needs for more than 200 000 displaced people, some of them already uprooted since the beginning of the 1990s."
"And internally, last year's conflict has increased tensions within Georgia."
"So disputed elections, for instance, led to months of street protests."
"We are doing our utmost to help the country take the necessary steps to resolve the difficulties."
"First and foremost, the implementation of our pledge of assistance of up to EUR 500 million in support of Georgia's recovery is being honoured by us."
"The implementation of the post-conflict assistance package is proceeding well and the living conditions of many have already been improved."
"We are keeping our promises, and our very substantial assistance is providing assistance for the resettlement of the IDPs, but also for economic stabilisation and support to Georgia's infrastructure."
"In the coming days, the Commission will also release the first tranche of EUR 46 million of macrofinancial assistance in grants to Georgia, another part of this comprehensive package."
"However, if we are to succeed in helping Georgia out of its current difficulties, Georgia must also deliver more, in particular, in three areas."
"First, Georgia should promote further democratic reforms."
"Democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are the backbone of our relations with all our eastern partners, and the Georgian President's statement earlier this year announcing a 'new wave of democratic reforms', and stating that Georgia's response to Russian aggression will be more democracy, more freedom and more progress, was very welcome."
"The local elections in Tbilisi in May will be a test of these commitments, and the local elections will be very important as the Tbilisi mayor will be - for the first time - elected by direct suffrage."
"This presents a major opportunity for Georgia to restore its citizens' trust in the electoral process - and one that must be seized, since the shortcomings of the electoral system remain a significant potential source of political instability in Georgia."
"The second area where we need Georgia to deliver is in demonstrating 'strategic patience' in the aftermath of the conflict."
"This is the wording of President Saakashvili himself."
"As you know, the European Union played a major role in bringing an end to the hostilities, and will continue to work for a durable solution."
"We will not waver in our support, as was said, for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia."
"And we will do all we can through our monitoring mission and mediator role at the Geneva talks to work for a normalisation of the situation."
"At the same time, the isolation of the breakaway regions will not help efforts for conflict resolution."
"On the contrary, a smart policy of engagement with Abkhazia and South Ossetia is needed."
"We therefore appreciate the stated Georgian policy of strategic patience, which increasingly recognises the need to maintain links with the breakaway regions without restrictions, in the interest of citizens, and of re-establishing stability in the region."
"The Government of Georgia's efforts to design a state strategy for the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia deserve our support, particularly any effort for closer work in favour of its population."
"However, we remain concerned that the Law on Occupied Territories - if too strictly implemented - may unnecessarily increase frictions with the entities and thus complicate the delivery of assistance."
"The danger is that it will impede economic relations and ensure that steps to normalise day to day contacts cannot take place."
"In spite of the very good advice from the Council of Europe's Venice Commission, this law has not yet been amended by Georgia, and we will continue to urge Georgia to make the suggested adjustments."
"My third point is that Georgia should actively prepare for negotiations for a new EU-Georgia association agreement in the context of the European and Eastern Partnership."
"We are not sparing any effort to support Georgia."
"Preparations for the establishment of a new legal framework for our bilateral relations are proceeding quite well."
"We have swiftly prepared the negotiation directives for an EU-Georgia association agreement, which are now currently under discussion in the Council."
"The draft negotiation directives include the future establishment of a deep and comprehensive free trade area."
"We have already presented to Georgia key recommendations for steps to be taken before we can judge the country ready to embark on this area of negotiations."
"Georgia's resolve to use the run-up to the negotiations to speed up its own preparations is wise, and I think it is essential that it tackles the key recommendations very actively."
"Meanwhile, negotiations on the EU-Georgia visa facilitation and readmission agreements were completed at working level in November, and we are now awaiting final approval on both sides."
"These agreements are a milestone in our partnership, demonstrating once again the concrete benefits that our closer relationship can bring for the people of Georgia."
"Enhanced mobility will go hand in hand with enhanced security."
"I recently signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership between the European Union and Georgia which now will be completed."
"To conclude, we remain deeply committed to supporting Georgia in these difficult times."
"We are offering new opportunities that can bring tangible benefits to the country and its citizens, but Georgia also has to help itself, and, if it takes good decisions, we will then be there to help every step of the way."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I am very impressed by the very thorough picture that the President-in-Office and the Commissioner have painted of the present state of relations."
"The EU's relationship with Georgia does raise very far-reaching questions about what we are about, what the EU is, and what we aspire to be."
"It could be that this relationship could turn out to be a test case of our commitment to values of solidarity, human rights and democracy - our proclaimed values."
"It is clear enough that Georgia - both the elites and society - see the country as belonging to Europe."
"At the same time that country - let us admit it - is in a precarious situation, as Russia, the former colonial power, has not given up its aspiration to reclaim some kind of overlordship over Georgia or, indeed, over the rest of the Southern Caucasus."
"It is in this sense that there are many people in Russia who do not take Georgia's status as an independent state seriously, and take the view that Georgia's return to Russia is just a question of time."
"This leaves the great majority of people in Georgia feeling decidedly insecure."
"That insecurity has been markedly intensified in the light of last year's conflict with Russia."
"No country likes to be stripped of its sovereign territory, as Georgia was."
"All this affects the EU - hence the significance of the Eastern Partnership."
"Georgia sees itself as having a European future, not least as a guarantee of its security."
"Obviously, there is also the Southern Caucasian energy corridor, which is a future lifeline for Europe's energy supplies."
"These would be compelling enough reasons for the European Union to take Georgia's European aspirations seriously, as we obviously do, but there is also a final argument, which is that, if Europe neglects these aspirations, then our own credibility in the world will come into question and our opponents will be delighted by this demonstration of Europe's weakness."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in my opinion, the difficult situation in Georgia calls for particular care in combining the defence of international law with a pragmatic approach and a sense of responsibility."
"We think that the EU was right to reaffirm its support for Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty and, at the same time, we welcome the prudence shown in taking note of the elections in Abkhazia, which we feel is consistent with a method based on the constant pursuit of dialogue and political debate and on support for democratic processes."
"The internal development of the region and the evolution of the international context underpin this decision to seek dialogue and further increase Europe's responsibility in the various areas in which it has made commitments: the Commission's initiatives in support of the democratic process in Georgia and in support of the refugees, efforts to keep the Geneva talks alive and the activities of the European monitoring mission, this last all the more valuable and vital since it is currently the only international mission in Georgia."
"We welcome the work undertaken by the mission and its contribution to the stabilisation of the region, to the functioning of the incident prevention and response mechanism and to the arduous process of rebuilding of trust between the parties."
"At the same time, we are aware that the development of the democratic process, with regard to which we must be generous and exacting, and the association agreement, could be the key for lasting change in Georgia."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I would like to discuss two subjects in particular."
"The first is the relationship between economic aid and support, on the one hand, and democratic development, on the other, and the second concerns some fundamental questions addressed in the Tagliavini report."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, you have rightly said that financial and economic support for Georgia is needed and that the European Union should continue to provide it."
"You have also placed three conditions on the provision of this support, which are democratic reform, basic freedoms and legal certainty."
"One question is particularly important to me."
"In the past, it was sadly the case that Georgia and its government purchased huge quantities of arms, in particular, in the run-up to last year's conflict."
"How do you intend to ensure that the European funding is not used for this purpose?"
"Secondly, I would like to mention a human rights case which the Council of Europe and Mr Hammerberg have also addressed."
"Two teenagers in South Ossetia are still in custody, although Mr Hammerberg was promised that they would be released."
"Have you taken any measures in this respect?"
"Do you think it is likely that they will be released in the near future?"
"One last point: the Tagliavini report has clearly described for the first time how the conflict came about with the build-up of xenophobia and the language of hate."
"What will the Commission and the Council do in this area in order to defuse the situation and to make it clear that these things are the precursors to armed conflict and that it is important to put an end to them before they even begin?"
"Mr President, I will not conceal the fact that I am disappointed by both the statements we have heard."
"Today, here in the European Parliament, we, the representatives of European Union authority, are quite rightly stressing the role of democracy."
"We are lecturing President Saakashvili on the changes which he has to introduce in his country."
"I would like to say he has already brought in very many changes, and the Georgia of today and the Georgia of a few years ago are completely different countries."
"However, we have not forgotten that today, Russian tanks are to be found on a large part of Georgia's territory."
"Fellow Members, if you think Russian tanks have, at any time in history, brought democracy to anyone, you are profoundly mistaken."
"Russian tanks do not bring democracy, Russian tanks bring subjugation."
"We are talking, today, about the situation in Georgia, but in the Council representative's speech, we heard the word 'Russia' once, while of course, it is Russia which is the key to the situation in Georgia."
"I am not saying that everything in Georgia is ideal."
"There is certainly much which needs to be improved."
"However, the Russians are laughing in our faces by not realising the five-point agreement negotiated on behalf of the European Union by President Sarkozy."
"I have to ask: why are Russian army units still present in the village of Pereva?"
"Has that matter ever even been mentioned to the Russians?"
"If we are talking about the necessity of democracy, human rights, tolerance and freedom of speech, I subscribe to it all."
"However, do we think Russia is promoting these values in Georgia today, or that the Russian aggression against Georgia is part of a fight for democracy?"
"No, it is an act of brutal imperialism."
"We, as the European Union, should oppose that brutal imperialism."
"Only then will what we say be credible to our Georgian friends, when we tell them there is still much they must do - and I agree with this - for their country to meet fully our European standards."
"However, we must not point the finger at Georgia when, on the other hand, we have Russia, where inconvenient journalists are murdered, where the language of hatred towards neighbours and minorities is the official language of the media, and is the language of leading Russian politicians."
"We must say 'no' to this, because then we will be able to be credible in what we say to all other countries, including Georgia, about democracy."
"I want to appeal to the European Union to defend the territorial integrity of Georgia firmly and resolutely in the name of values which we all share, and to defend freedom and democracy in Georgia against Russian aggression."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, in my opinion, the EU's foreign policy in this region is not really coherent."
"The Caucasus is known to be an energy transit region in the same way as Russia, which is an important strategic partner and of major significance to us."
"Given the sensitivity of the situation, the EU has allowed itself to be tricked by President Saakashvili in the Georgian crisis, possibly under the influence of the US-dependent approach of some Member States."
"Political short-sightedness in the Georgian crisis will not only widen the internal divide within the Union, but will also put massive strain on relations with Russia."
"The reckoning will come in the form of the gas dispute."
"It remains to be seen whether the new people at the head of the EU will prove their worth in this case."
"If Brussels genuinely wants to uphold human rights, then it should intervene in Georgia with regard to possible electoral manipulation, working conditions that are the equivalent of slavery and restrictions placed on the right to demonstrate which are in breach of the Charter of Fundamental Rights."
"Brussels should adopt a balanced approach with regard to the Georgia question by taking equal account of the legitimate interests of both Georgia and Russia."
"Mr President, when I was still a young boy, my country was invaded by the Soviets."
"At my primary school, we had to learn several new songs."
"One of them was Georgian in origin, about a girl whose name was Suliko."
"The occupation was bad in every way; only that song was nice."
"Many years have passed, and recently we came across this girl Suliko again, this time with her dark eyes full of tears and showing signs of having been beaten."
"She was abused once more a year ago - robbed, beaten and raped."
"We, the 27 EU gentlemen, are staring at her afterwards and talking in a strange manner: How it could happen?"
"What did she do wrong?"
"Did her behaviour irritate the rapist?"
"That is exactly what he says: 'She was provocative'!"
"Did she oppose his demands?"
"That would be unwise: nobody, especially the robber and rapist, may be antagonised or demonised."
"She could have been more flexible, meeting the assaults softly, but she tried to defend herself for two full days - that was her greatest mistake."
"Nobody can now say who the attacker was: he says she attacked him."
"That is the situation in a distant country court on the outskirts of Europe, where the big landlord esquire cannot be sentenced in any case - but she can."
"Thus, we now have a fresh problem caused by her, as our business with Mr Rapist has been slightly damaged."
"The next time, Mr Rapist is given our special pill 'Mistral' to increase his male capacities."
"Ladies and gentlemen in Europe, do not waver around the next war in this way."
"(HU) I would like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and especially Cecilia Malmström, who is currently among us as a minister but is soon to be a commissioner as well."
"I would also like first to briefly express my sincere thanks for the report, which contained some very important information."
"Please also allow me to say that since the last two enlargement rounds, the European Union's eastern neighbours have, in fact, moved very close to the European Union, which is a valuable development from numerous perspectives, not only because of the geographical proximity, but partly because of a foreign policy based on the idea of spheres of Russian influence, not to mention the increased importance of energy security."
"From this perspective, the Eastern Partnership programme is of paramount importance, as it can also ensure differentiation, yet it still clearly establishes closer ties with these countries."
"Georgia is the country in the Caucasus region which is most committed to the European Union's values."
"I would like to mention and emphasise a couple of matters, starting with the preparations for the visa facilitation process."
"This measure is not only important from a human relations perspective, but it is also important because we know that South Ossetian and Abkhazian citizens who are Russian passport holders are already enjoying the benefits of this, which has created such tension that this is only aggravating the situation further."
"The second matter I would like to stress is that there are unresolved conflicts in four of the countries which come under the Eastern Neighbourhood policy, something we must give our fullest attention to."
"Finally, I would like to thank Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner for all the efforts she has made to bring this region closer to the European Union."
"(CS) The European Parliament is monitoring the situation in Georgia closely and devoting much attention to the country."
"European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek met President Saakashvili at the end of October, while at the beginning of November, at a joint meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the delegation for cooperation with Russia and the delegation for cooperation with the South Caucasus countries, Members of the European Parliament discussed the Tagliavini Report on the situation in Georgia and at its extraordinary meeting in Strasbourg on 26 November, Members of the delegation for the South Caucasus met Georgian Government minister, Giorgi Baramidze."
"We always support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Georgia."
"We support a peaceful solution to the situation in Georgia and to the conflict between Georgia and Russia."
"We are pushing for peace observers to have access not only to areas administered by the Georgian Government but also to occupied areas."
"At the same time, we are pushing for the possibility of delivering humanitarian assistance to these occupied territories as well."
"We are concerned about the situation of the refugees, who have had to leave their homes under pressure and cannot return to them, and we appreciate the efforts made by the Georgian Government towards securing dignified living conditions for all of the refugees."
"We call strongly on both parties to the conflict to abide by the ceasefire agreement and to fulfil the undertakings which they made towards a peaceful resolution."
"(RO) Ladies and gentlemen, several years ago, there were voices which sharply criticised those who supported the strategic importance of the Black Sea region to Europe."
"However, time has shown that Europe is closely linked to these countries in the Black Sea region."
"Georgia is of particular strategic importance in the Black Sea region for energy security, as supply routes such as the Nabucco gas pipeline, the Baku-Tbilisi oil pipeline and the oil terminal at Supsa are closely linked to the stability of this country."
"The conflicts which took place in Georgia in August 2008 highlighted that any unresolved conflict can reignite at any time, with severe repercussions for the entire region's stability and security."
"It is our duty to lead Georgia to the Euro-Atlantic zone of stability and security, even though Russia's influence is still very strong."
"It is just as necessary to recognise the right of refugees, displaced persons and their dependants to return to Abkhazia, irrespective of their ethnic origin."
"At the same time, the fact that Russia has granted citizenship to the inhabitants of Abkhazia and Ossetia puts Georgian citizens at a clear disadvantage as there is no visa agreement yet in place from the EU, although we earlier heard the Commission's representative saying that measures are being taken in this direction."
"Romania has been involved as part of the EU monitoring mission in Georgia, both at operational level and on the ground, also as part of the headquarters in Tbilisi."
"Our country is also maintaining its commitment to making special efforts to bring Georgia closer to the EU and NATO."
"In addition, we are going to send a national expert who will operate from NATO's office in Tbilisi."
"We welcome the stance of the EU Presidency."
"We will not recognise, under any circumstances, the so-called states created illegally and as a result of conflict in separatist regions, nor election proceedings organised illegally, such as those carried out recently in Abkhazia."
"The president of the pro-Russian Georgian separatist republic won the election with 59.4% of the vote."
"I must also mention that none of the five presidential candidates rejected completely the idea of reunification with Georgia."
"(EL) Mr President, the European Union has a responsibility to make a decisive contribution to stability in its immediate neighbourhood, with respect for international law and belief in its principles."
"With Georgia in particular, we must stand by our position on respect for territorial integrity and the country's internationally recognised borders."
"At the same time, however, we must also take account of the reality of unresolved conflicts."
"The European Union must be able to mediate and to make a constructive contribution to both sides, Georgia and Russia, so that a solution can be found."
"At the present juncture, there are three main messages that we need to send:"
"Firstly, that unilateral and violent solutions are not acceptable; secondly, that the debate on whether or not Georgia should join NATO is untimely and that, on the contrary, emphasis should be placed on the continuation and successful outcome of the Geneva talks and, thirdly, that the mission of EU observers in Georgia is a factor for stability and confidence building."
"Its positive contribution should therefore be recognised, its action should be strengthened and it should be encouraged to continue its efforts, especially in the field of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law."
"(PL) Mr President, unfortunately, neither in the speech of Mrs Malmström nor in that of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner did we hear about what we are really facing in Georgia."
"I refer to the dramatic humanitarian and human situation."
"I had the impression that neither we nor the two ladies are responsible for the lack of reaction from the European Union."
"The situation is, indeed, dramatic."
"The six-point agreement is not being implemented."
"Ethnic cleansing is being carried out in Georgian territory."
"The Georgian language is banned in many places."
"Our mission to Georgia is not being permitted to carry out its work in many places, and it is we who are responsible for this."
"Mrs Ferrero-Waldner spoke about the long-term macrofinancial assistance which is foreseen for Georgia, and that we are going to have an association agreement with Georgia."
"This is all very well, but a question we all must answer is: what have we done about this?"
"I feel deeply disappointed, not only by what has been said here today by the people responsible for this policy, but also by EU policy itself."
"(PL) Commissioner, Mrs Malmström, in contradistinction to my Polish fellow Members, I am not going to be so critical in my evaluation of European Union activities in this area, because I want to express satisfaction at the Council statement of 12 December, which comments unequivocally on the recent Presidential elections in Abkhazia."
"I also want to stress support for the European Union's activities, because the EU is unequivocal in its recognition of the independence of both these regions at international level."
"I know what I am talking about from my experience of dealings with Belarus."
"Nonetheless, I agree that the European Union must be resolute in the matter of enforcing the six-point ceasefire plan negotiated by President Sarkozy."
"I say this especially in view of the disturbing declarations of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Mrs Ashton, that she is going to conduct quiet diplomacy."
"I hope quiet diplomacy will not mean consent to the breaking of agreements made on behalf of Russia with representatives of the European Union."
"(LV) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to put a question to those who are defending Mr Saakashvili's position: have you been to South Ossetia?"
"Have you seen what Georgia's army did with Zhinvali?"
"I was there at the time of the war and I saw it all myself."
"What the Georgian state authority did is a crime against the people of Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"In relation to the occupation, I have spoken with many people from Ossetia and Abkhazia."
"The inhabitants of Ossetia and Abkhazia do not want to live in the same country as Mr Saakashvili."
"If anybody still wants to solve this major international problem with weapons, as Mr Saakashvili did, then there is a very fine Russian expression: 'Zamučujutsja pilj glatatj'."
"It means that success will never come. Thank you."
"(PL) Mr President, if the Union does not support Tbilisi politically and economically, we will make it easy for Russia to realise its neo-imperialistic policy towards Georgia, and this will destabilise the situation in the Caucasus still further."
"Therefore, the Union must try harder."
"When we reiterate our support for territorial integrity, do we realise that the six-point plan is, in fact, not being observed at all?"
"On the one hand, we say we want a democratic, free and territorially intact Georgia, while on the other, our monitors are not being admitted to areas along the borders with the separatist republics."
"Another cause for concern is the phenomenon of kidnappings, which have become routine practice for Russia in the occupied zones."
"At the beginning of November, several teenagers became victims of this."
"The youngest is barely 14 years old."
"The Kremlin is evidently trying to discredit the President of Georgia by attempting to show that he is not able to ensure the security of his citizens."
"The destabilising activities of Russia are creating an enormous threat to the security of residents of the border areas and are leading to an escalation of the conflict in the region."
"Mr President, we must act more decisively, because a territorially intact and democratic Georgia means greater security for the European Union and Europe."
"(ET) Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, some time ago, when we were discussing Georgia, I reminded you that, on the eve of the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was the right time to raise the question of when we could mark the day when South Ossetia and Abkhazia would once again be united with their mother country, Georgia."
"Today, we do not have an answer to this question, although in all our documents, whether in this European Parliament or in other institutions, we stress the importance of Georgia's territorial integrity from the point of view of international law, and it is for the sake of this that we are all standing here."
"Last week, a very good discussion took place in Brussels with Carl Bildt, the representative of the country holding the Presidency, who called Georgia a litmus test for the European Union, specifically in connection with the question of whether we will some day be able to stand up for the idea that Georgia's territorial integrity should be restored, and that all human rights and refugees' rights should be handled as envisaged by international law."
"I am in agreement with all my colleagues who have referred to a bad human rights situation here - it cannot be accepted."
"Last but not least, though, I want to make a request."
"Last week, I met with the Georgian deputy prime minister, Giorgi Baramidze, whose big, big request was: please, please, please, European Union, do something in terms of preventative diplomacy in order to prevent a possible escalation of any further conflicts."
"Mr President, I can only agree with the statement that Georgia's best response to Russian aggression must be more democratic reforms."
"At the same time, the EU has its own responsibility because, as has rightly been said, EU-Georgia relations will become a test case for the success of the Eastern Partnership and the EU's role in the region."
"Considering the importance of Georgia, I wonder whether Georgia was discussed during the recent EU-Russia Summit, because Russia is not implementing the six-point agreement and the EU mission is in the embarrassing situation of not being allowed into the separatist territories."
"The EU should take a stronger position on this case."
"Commissioner, you mentioned EUR 46 million in aid."
"I would just like to ask whether that aid will reach Georgia this year."
"What will be the timetable?"
"(PL) I think that in the light of our discussion, we should go back to what Mrs Malmström said at the outset - Georgia needs a new and extensive openness from the European Union."
"This should comprise macrofinancial assistance along with the rapid and immediate commencement of talks, as far as this is possible, on an association agreement."
"It should also comprise the commencement of talks - this is my third point - on visa facilitation, and, finally, we should enable Georgia to guarantee its security by opening up the way for it to join NATO."
"However, I think that, today, not even this matter is the reason why I want to speak in this part of the discussion."
"I would like to put a rhetorical question to Mrs Ferrero-Waldner: do you not wonder why almost all the speakers have drawn attention to the matter of the Sarkozy Plan?"
"Please answer this question."
"Please tell us why, neither in your initial speech nor in your further statements, nor in Mrs Ashton's statements, has no one heard an answer in the form of a simple assessment of whether the Sarkozy Plan has been implemented or not?"
"Is it really the case that the most important institutions of the European Union are not worthy of a clear statement from you on this matter?"
"Mr President, yesterday in Ireland, a conference addressed the topic of aid and Eastern Europe."
"One of the countries we spoke about was Georgia, and it was really refreshing to hear how much progress had been made for a particular group of individuals with no voice - children with disabilities, both intellectual and physical, and young adults - but also deeply depressing to learn that those involved believe that they are now set back by 10 years because of the conflict."
"I would just ask, because I was involved yesterday, that you bear in mind the most vulnerable when we are doing trade agreements and having conversations."
"This was a very important debate here, but the horrific humanitarian situation has been spoken about by other colleagues, and there is a group of people who is always forgotten;"
"I just wanted their voice to be heard here today."
"(PL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to bear in mind that Georgia is a small country, albeit situated in an extremely strategic position in the Southern Caucasus, a fact which causes a situation of conflict with its powerful northern neighbour, Russia."
"So I am grateful to the Commissioner for her declaration that the aid for which Georgia has been waiting for so long will be released tomorrow."
"Please let us remember that when Georgia embarked on the road to democratic reform and decided to be more closely tied with western Europe than with Russia, as it had been for decades and perhaps even centuries, it lost an economic partner which was buying 80% of its production."
"We have done nothing to move into the vacuum and buy goods produced in Georgia to ensure that the country is able to function."
"In relation to this, I very much approve of the declaration, as I do the announcement concerning a macrofinancial plan for Georgia."
"There is one more thing: Commissioner, we must not consider Georgia in the political sphere as an entirely distant partner, because Georgia is trapped in an unbelievably complicated geopolitical situation."
"In relation to this, I do not imagine that, during the talks which the European Union holds with Russia, nothing at all is said about the situation in Georgia."
"I do not want to mention the six-point Sarkozy Plan again, because everyone has done this, but we must remember that our contacts with such a powerful partner as Russia, which are extremely important for us of course, must also have reference to our smaller partners, which are near and dear to us."
"Mr President, politics is merely a job when it is self-serving."
"It becomes a vocation when it helps others - when the Goliaths come to the aid of the Davids."
"In this instance, the European Union is the Goliath coming to the aid of Georgia, the David, and I welcome that."
"It has, however, another Goliath alongside it in the form of Russia, with a different agenda for Georgia."
"It is important that the European Union flex its muscles in resisting that unwarranted intrusion."
"I was in Bonn last week at the EPP Congress, and there the President of Georgia spoke."
"He outlined the efforts the country was making in dealing with corruption, its agenda for reform to ensure economic growth, and also its desire to have a free trade agreement."
"My question is: when does the Commission see that free trade agreement being brought into being, when the conditions for it are met?"
"Mr President, we are discussing the aspirations of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia."
"These are similar aspirations to be closer to the European Union."
"It seems that this is a problem for us."
"I wonder what will happen in 10 years' time, when those aspirations turn to disappointment and there are no more aspirations to join the European Union, with no expectations for anything more."
"This will be a much more difficult situation for us."
"Georgia is the country with the highest support from society for membership of the European Union, and the highest support for NATO, of all the Eastern Partnership countries."
"There is also the greatest progress in market reforms."
"If we do not move more quickly, we will have the same situation as with Turkey, where society is backing away from its European aspirations."
"That will be a really dangerous situation in spite - and maybe because - of other political movements around these countries."
"We see what is going on in Russia, and when the aspirations of Georgia for European Union membership falter, we may face a situation that is quite dangerous for all European Union countries."
"Mr President, I know that there is a great deal of interest in this matter."
"Those of you who have followed this closely will also know that the Swedish Presidency has devoted a lot of time to Georgia."
"The Swedish Foreign Minister, Carl Bildt, had the opportunity last Thursday to discuss Georgia with you in the Committee on Foreign Affairs."
"The EU will continue to provide considerable political, technical and financial support to Georgia."
"This will, in all probability, involve continued appeals for respect for Georgia's territorial sovereignty and integrity and continuation of the EU monitoring mission, as well as our very important role of mediator in the Geneva talks."
"The Geneva talks are the relevant platform."
"These talks are progressing slowly, but they are nevertheless progressing and all of the parties are represented there."
"We will also provide further financial assistance for the aftermath of the conflict."
"As many of you have pointed out, the humanitarian situation is still of great concern."
"Mrs McGuinness is, of course, right to say that it is the most vulnerable who are suffering as a result of this."
"In the meeting with our Russian dialogue partners, the EU will continue to emphasise that it is necessary to implement the six-point cease-fire agreement and the subsequent implementing measures - the withdrawal of forces to the positions held on 7 August 2008."
"Perevi, Akhalgori and Upper Kodori will be mentioned in particular, just as many of you have done."
"The closure of the OSCE mission in Georgia and the UN observer group has resulted in the removal of crucial elements of the important international security structure."
"Now, the only remaining international presence is the EU monitoring mission."
"It is making a significant contribution to security and to normalisation."
"That is why it is so important for the monitoring mission to have access to the breakaway regions."
"It is important for Georgia's security and stability."
"This is an important point that the EU will continue to emphasise to all of the relevant dialogue partners."
"The EU will, of course, continue to support Georgia's territorial integrity, but we also have a strategic interest in maintaining contact with the breakaway regions and in keeping open a window to the outside world for the populations of these separatist areas."
"This may help us gradually to lay the foundations for a solution to the conflict through continued EU involvement and measures to promote trust across the administrative borders and through contact between the different populations."
"The EU will continue to be very active in this matter."
"The Commission and Mrs Ferrero-Waldner are very committed to this, as is the European Parliament, and that is something for which I am very grateful."
"Member of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all, thank you for the frank discussion that we have had today."
"I thought that many of you knew what we have been doing for Georgia."
"Georgia has received a lot of support from us, both political and also economic and humanitarian, but it seems as if we have not done anything."
"This is not true at all."
"First of all, the war was stopped by the European Union and by Mr Sarkozy."
"Second, you are right, there is a six-point plan which, unfortunately, has not yet been fully implemented, but every time we work with the Russians, this is on our agenda."
"This is absolutely clear."
"It is right, as the Council President said, that the only platform where we really start to go on, even slowly, is in Geneva, and so the Geneva talks have to go on."
"We also need support and openness from both sides, because it is a difficult conflict and we are, so to speak, the mediators in this conflict."
"This is the number one political issue."
"We do have to continue and we know very well that Russia is a huge partner on the other side."
"At the same time, we have a common neighbourhood, and therefore we always speak quite clearly about these issues with Russia."
"We do need, as I said here, the attitude on both sides to go forward, which is what I said in my speech if you will recall."
"This is the first point."
"The second concerns the economic and humanitarian front, where we are working very closely indeed."
"The EUR 500 million package was the biggest package I could bring through."
"There is not so much money in the neighbourhood policy that I could have gone for, but this is what we did because we thought Georgia needed that after the war and all the damage that had been done - particularly for the most vulnerable."
"I myself have visited the IDP camps and I have visited the houses that have been restored with our programmes."
"I can tell Mrs Lunacek that I myself signed an agreement with the Georgians where they absolutely commit themselves to not using one cent of the European Union money."
"We always control our money, so normally there should not be a cent of our money going to re-arming on the Georgian side."
"I cannot, of course, control what Georgia is doing on other issues, but on our money I can be clear."
"There are other things that have been mentioned."
"For instance, the two teenagers that are still in detention in South Ossetia."
"These are issues that we do of course mention to the Russians."
"We talk about them, but for the moment, unfortunately, we have no solution to it and we ourselves cannot enter South Ossetia."
"As regards the principle, of course we are clear on the principle."
"There is territorial integrity and there is sovereignty, and this is what we clearly say of Georgia. Absolutely."
"It is, however, one thing to speak about principles and another thing to implement these principles immediately."
"This, unfortunately, is sometimes quite difficult."
"Let me also speak about the Tagliavini report."
"The very fact that this report has been publicised is a very important one."
"You know we supported this independent report."
"I have known Mrs Tagliavini for ages from when I was OSCE chairperson-in-office in the year 2000 as foreign minister of my country."
"She was then my special representative for the Caucasus."
"She is a very courageous, independent lady, and I must say she has made an excellent report."
"This also helps because the report has made the facts clear."
"We draw the lessons from that, but we can only continue helping Georgia by diplomatic means."
"Having said all of that, I can also say that we have been doing an enormous amount of work first on the neighbourhood policy to the east, and now on the Eastern Partnership."
"The other day, we had a very important ministerial meeting under the Swedish Presidency with the six foreign ministers of the Eastern Partnership including the foreign minister from Georgia."
"There, we also discussed all the possibilities, but would you really think that we can give everything to every country without them doing their part?"
"We cannot."
"We have to ask them also to do their part."
"That also means on trade, as a free and deep trade agreement can only be there when the right legislation is there."
"We cannot just ask them to come into the European Union if the Council is not unanimous on it."
"These are things where one has to see one side and the other, but we are supporting Georgia more than anybody else."
"So I would rather hope that this policy, as some have said, is really supported by you."
"This is a policy where we try to help them as much as we can, but we also want to see the right behaviour from Georgia."
"The debate is closed."
"(The sitting was suspended at 19.55 and resumed at 21.00)"
"Responses to relaunch the economy in the Member States of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe"
"The next item is the Commission Statement on responses to relaunch the economy in the Member States of the European Union in Central and Eastern Europe."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic crisis has affected the whole of Europe."
"It could be said that it has affected the whole world, but here in the European Union, it has probably particularly affected the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the new Member States, for a series of reasons."
"Firstly, because they are obviously more fragile economies than the more mature, industrialised and consolidated economies of Western Europe, and also because they are economies which do not have a financial system in which the crisis has been generated, and have therefore been dependent on a high proportion of direct investment from outside in order to finance their growth."
"When the crisis erupted, and particularly when the crisis worsened in 2008, this investment came to a halt, and left these economies in need of funding in order to finance their growth, which they were unable to substitute using their savings and internal resources."
"Having said this, it is also obvious that not all the economies of Central and Eastern European countries have been equally affected."
"Some economies were better prepared to withstand the blows of the crisis."
"Some economies had had the wisdom before the crisis to move forward political reforms that have given their model for growth a more solid foundation."
"In any case, the European Union, and the Commission as part of the European institutions as a whole, reacted to the crisis, in particular, with a series of measures that responded to a specific concern which, in relative terms, were more beneficial to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The European Economic Recovery Plan, which was adopted at the end of 2008, is a plan based on fiscal stimuli which have logically been more powerful in the large economies of the euro area in Western Europe."
"Nevertheless, by encouraging internal supply in Western European countries, these stimuli have enabled the market to continue to be a source of growth through external demand for Central and Eastern European countries."
"In addition to the European Economic Recovery Plan, decisions adopted by the European institutions have increased lending by the European Investment Bank."
"The figures for 2009 have obviously not been closed, but I can forecast that lending by the European Investment Bank at the end of this year will probably be over 50% more than its lending in 2007, the year before the crisis."
"The European Investment Bank has given specific priority to its financing operations in Central and Eastern European countries in a series of lines and activities."
"In order to do so, it has used instruments that the Bank had started before the crisis, like Jeremie, Jessica and Jaspers and other actions."
"Also, as it is not strictly a European Union institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has stepped up its action under the impetus of the European countries and the European Commission, who are shareholders in the bank."
"The Structural Funds have also played a positive role, which they always do for countries that need to benefit from the cohesion policy, but when the crisis began, decisions were made, for example, to increase the resources that could be advanced from the Structural Funds for countries that benefit from them, in particular for Central and European countries."
"Unfortunately, the Council did not support a Commission initiative for the European Social Fund to provide 100% of the funding during the crisis (2009 and 2010) for a series of activities to support workers and active policies in the labour market."
"As you already know, the balance of payments facility was an instrument that had not been used since 1993."
"This instrument is used to provide finance for countries with difficulties securing external finance, due to their balance of payments, or for countries with difficulties financing their budgetary needs."
"Its ceiling has increased from EUR 12 billion to EUR 50 billion, which was at the initiative of the Commission and agreed by the Council, and out of those EUR 50 billion, around EUR 15 billion has been used in financial support operations for three Central and Eastern European countries that are Members of the European Union: Hungary, Latvia and Romania."
"Finally I would like to mention the so-called Vienna Initiative, promoted and encouraged by the European institutions, along with international financial institutions."
"It has coordinated the action of the private financial system which, in many of these countries, is basically organised around Western European banks that have invested in Central and Eastern European countries and have subsidiaries and offices there."
"The Vienna Initiative has meant that action could be coordinated, including maintaining the positions and risks taken by private banks in those countries."
"It has been possible to maintain a financial system at maximum level that helps to finance the consequences of the crisis and the investment needed to come out of the crisis."
"This is in the face of announcements of excessive risks taken by some Western European banks established in those countries."
"The truth is that so far, we have not had to mourn any 'victims' among those banks, but rather they have maintained a reasonable level of capitalisation and financial activity in the context of the difficult conditions that the system is operating under."
"We are already seeing positive signs."
"We are, of course, also seeing significant challenges."
"This means that we have not finished."
"We need to continue paying specific attention to how best to use the instruments available to the European institutions in order to help these countries to set off on the path towards recovery and emerge from the crisis."
"If you will allow me to give you a positive example, I will tell you about Poland, which is the only country in the European Union that is continuing to maintain positive growth and has not had negative growth at any time throughout the crisis."
"The only one in the whole of the European Union is a country of Central and Eastern Europe and one of the new Member States."
"Finally, I would like to mention the importance of the euro as an anchor for the strategies for withstanding the blows of the crisis and emerging from it."
"The euro is a point of reference to guide the appropriate strategies for emerging from the crisis."
"There is a country in this region that joined the euro area in the middle of the crisis, Slovakia, and yesterday, the Slovakian authorities held a conference in Bratislava welcoming the way in which the euro has protected them from the worse consequences of the crisis and is helping them to get through it in much better conditions than they would have had to withstand if they did not belong to the euro area."
"Another country in the region, Estonia, wants to join the euro area and integrate its currency into the euro in 2011."
"So far, the indicators and the degree of compliance with the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty, now the Treaty of Lisbon, indicate that this target is possible."
"We will not be able to guarantee this until the corresponding convergence report is published in the spring, but it is possible that Estonia will be in the euro area in 2011."
"For the countries outside the European Union that are part of the region, candidate countries or potential candidate countries, joining the European Union is also a powerful anchor for ensuring that they have adequate strategies and policies."
"It is therefore true that there are a great many difficulties."
"It is true that these countries have more fragile economies."
"It is true that the consequences of a crisis such as the one that we are going through are, for the citizens of those countries, infinitely more painful than the consequences for citizens of countries with social protection systems and with much more established, stronger and more consolidated welfare systems."
"It must be said, however, that the instruments available to the European institutions and the very fact that they belong to the European Union and have the opportunity to be part of Economic and Monetary Union is a positive factor rather than an obstacle in terms of tackling a crisis such as the one that we are experiencing."
"on behalf of the PPE Group. - (LV) Mr President, Mr Almunia, in order to help the economies of the Member States in Central and Eastern Europe to recover, there are two possible approaches: giving fish or giving a fishing-rod."
"Of course, what is best is to give a fishing-rod."
"The difficulty is to know what kind of fishing-rod it should really be."
"The cornerstone and gauge of recovery is the creation of new jobs."
"In order for this to happen, investment is needed."
"One of the main obstacles to investment in the region is a lack of clarity about the stability of the national exchange rate and the introduction of the euro."
"At the moment, the introduction of the euro in the new Member States is like a horse-race, with each state trying to break away from the pack and reach the euro area."
"It may happen that in this crisis situation, some Member States do themselves harm; for instance, by rapidly reducing budget expenditure, they increase unemployment over the level that their economies can withstand."
"It may also happen that one Member State, in joining the euro area, may damage the economy of a neighbouring state outside the euro area, by attracting investment to itself and increasing the level of unemployment in the neighbouring state."
"The European Union is formed on the basis of the solidarity principle."
"When the EU increased the number of its Member States in 2004, a unified strategy for the reception of these Member States into Europe was developed and adopted."
"I believe that the European Commission should have a rethink on the process of introducing the euro and should prepare a clear strategy for its introduction which does not indirectly induce Member States to cause harm to themselves or their neighbours."
"It is not necessary to change the stability criteria, but a joint plan and timetable should be developed for the whole region, so that we can introduce a single currency in Europe using an established procedure that is clear to all."
"This would be the fishing-rod that would help the economies of that region to recover, by opening the door to investment and the creation of new jobs."
"Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as you rightly pointed out, Commissioner Almunia, the consequences of this serious financial and economic crisis have been felt in countries worldwide and naturally in those in Europe."
"In the EU, it is the weakest countries, the ones we are discussing now, that have been hit the hardest."
"These are countries which joined the Union only recently and which are outside the euro area."
"It is therefore important to remember them and identify the most effective actions so that they can be part of Europe as a whole and subsequently participate in life in Europe on an equal footing with others."
"There accordingly need to be monetary policy interventions, starting with those of the European Central Bank, since unless we help increase their GDP and invest in their production systems, they will not be able to redress the imbalances that are currently weighing them down, satisfy the Maastricht criteria and join the euro area."
"It is also important, as you mentioned, for there to be other actions such as easier access to the resources provided by the European funds and EIB financing."
"I believe, however, that we should never forget that these actions must be carried out within a framework of simultaneous actions for other weak countries in Europe too."
"It is not just a question of the countries that we are discussing today, as we are all unfortunately aware, and for all these reasons, we can no longer delay the creation of a European financing system capable of supporting investment with a comprehensive vision for Europe."
"I am referring to the establishment of a fund financed by Eurobonds, which I believe to be the only practical solution available to Member States and the European Union."
"The time has now come at this stage to show political courage and foresight with regard to the desire to overcome the crisis and create the conditions for the competitive development of Europe, a development that would ensure the well-being of all Europeans."
"Mr President, the reason why we, along with other Members here present, have requested this debate is because a new iron curtain has emerged with the economic crisis, Commissioner."
"This monetary iron curtain separates those outside the euro area from those within it."
"Many problems that today affect the majority of the Baltic States, for example - you mentioned Poland, but I could, of course, mention Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary - are due to the fact that they are not in the euro area."
"Therefore, they must continue to use their local currency, and this is giving rise to harmful, devastating consequences at present."
"We may well talk of an economic recovery, but in those countries, there is no economic recovery for the time being."
"In some of these countries, the unemployment rate is over 20%, and public sector salaries have had to be cut by more than 20%."
"The figures relating to their economic growth are really very negative."
"The important thing is that we allow them to join the euro area as soon as possible."
"However, at present, they are suffering the harmful effects of this situation."
"Clearly, the idea is not to change the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact - no one has asked for that."
"They should not be changed because, as you rightly said, the euro area has acted as a defence against the economic and financial crisis."
"All the same, we must help these countries in a different way, not by changing the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact, but by offsetting the negative effect that they are suffering because they are outside the system."
"If we do not do so, it will be several more years before they join the euro area."
"We have made a number of suggestions, we have drawn up a six-point plan and asked the European Commission to take it into account."
"We therefore need the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the European Investment Bank to cooperate with one another."
"Which measures must be implemented in this context?"
"Firstly, the Central Bank must also provide liquidity to local banks."
"It has granted liquidity to banks in Western Europe; it has also indirectly provided resources to Swedish banks, for example, but some local banks have received nothing from the European Central Bank."
"These six points incorporate other proposals."
"For example, why not increase the proportion of EU funding and reduce the proportion of State funding of social, regional and cohesion funds, and so on?"
"Indeed, the Member States do not currently have the budgetary resources to finance certain projects."
"We could therefore move towards having, for example, 75% of funding by Europe and 25% by the Member States, in particular, the Baltic States."
"I have mentioned just two of the six very practical ideas that we have put forward and on which a decision can be taken by the European Central Bank or by the Commission or the European Investment Bank."
"This is what these countries need."
"Personally speaking, I do not see it as progress that the International Monetary Fund is intervening in these countries and dictating how they should behave."
"In my view, it is up to Europe instead to decide what must be done."
"That is the request we are making."
"In any case, I have been to these countries and I have been shocked by the fact that these people feel abandoned by the European Union in their daily struggle."
"I urge the next European Commission to come back with a credible plan for the states of Central and Eastern Europe and, more specifically, for the Baltic States."
"on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Mr President, I come from Latvia, a country hit heavily by the financial crisis."
"Due to the irresponsible policy of right-wing governments, Latvia risked going bankrupt without financial assistance from outside."
"Now we are speaking about different financial and economic solutions which could change the situation for the better."
"Of course, we must properly discuss all the solutions, including the speedy introduction of the euro."
"In the meantime, I am afraid that the financial and economic perspective is only one side of the coin."
"We have to discuss the social perspective as well."
"Now, the EU institutions are perceived as the 'bad guys' by many residents of Latvia: the bad guys who make our poor government cut pensions and benefits, the bad guys who are to blame for social exclusion and poverty."
"There are many politicians who cultivate this perception, mainly inside the ruling coalition, because, if people believe that the current social crisis is our government's fault, the government will not survive the forthcoming general elections."
"Do I believe that Latvia and other countries of the region urgently need the EU's helping hand?"
"Yes, I do."
"But I strongly believe that we need a strong mechanism for control and we need very strict conditions in the field of social policy."
"EU money should first of all go to save common people, not banks or state bureaucracy."
"Therefore, using this opportunity, I would ask all my colleagues and fellow Members to sign Written Declaration 0056/2009, which was initiated by representatives of three political groups, on social conditionality for European Union help."
"Mr President, Commissioner, thank you, Mr Verhofstadt, for tabling the question."
"However, the posing of the question during this evening's debate may confuse European Union citizens in Western Europe."
"'Look, we have to suffer from the financial crisis too, because Eastern and Central Europe, through its clumsy governance, has created these problems for itself and also for us'."
"Such a view debases the already seriously impaired confidence in the European Union's cohesion policy."
"The example of the Baltic States, however, shows that we are in the same boat."
"The pursuit by the Scandinavian banking sector of market share and high profits in practice squeezed national currencies in the Baltic States out of the loans market, particularly the home mortgage loans market."
"With a fixed national exchange rate, the civil liability of borrowers towards lenders was very high: all the currency risk in the value of an overpriced pledge was borne by borrowers."
"In late 2008, in tense talks between the Latvian Government, the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the Swedish Government, a decision was taken to buy up the second largest commercial bank, using only Latvian taxpayers' money, and to keep the national exchange rate strong."
"Thus, we Latvians, having over many years lost our revenue, competitiveness and, possibly, quality of society, saved the banking sector of the Scandinavians and other investors, at least in the Baltic States, since the domino effect in the event of banks failing would go far beyond Latvia's borders and would reach as far, let us say, as Scandinavian pension funds, as the banks' shareholders."
"Yes, the European Commission helped us, and the International Monetary Fund financed this choice, but the lion's share of the loan goes to stabilise the banking sector."
"By not allowing a default and by retaining a strong exchange rate, we devalued our economy by 20% of GDP, but in reality, we were helping the neighbouring Estonians, whose advantage, of course, was having had a responsible budget balance for many years, to introduce the euro as early as 2011."
"It appears even more odd that for Europe's monetary union, an example like Estonia is even crucially necessary."
"This, as it were, shows that the Maastricht criteria for the introduction of the euro work even in times of crisis."
"It is not that we are not pleased for the Estonians, but our sacrifice, in buying the bank, was a certain measure of solidarity in not foisting off misfortune upon our neighbours and aggressive investors, too."
"We only wanted to see a certain solidarity from European financial policy makers, including on the subject of the barrier to new euro area states."
"Politicians in Latvia had to take extremely harsh decisions, which the majority of my fellow Members in the older European countries would not have to deal with even in their most terrible nightmares."
"However, it is not within our power to take away the currency risk of private debt from our citizens, and we do not want to behave like hooligans by unilaterally introducing the euro or allowing the euro to circulate in tandem with our national currency."
"However, the goal of our demographically ageing society cannot be to spend many years exchanging every second lat earned into euros to pay back the banks, while in the evenings, offering up prayers that the lat will hold fast against the euro."
"Thank you, Mr President, in my view, on the issue of the modernisation of social policy and assistance to the states of Central and Eastern Europe, there is a lot of rhetoric, but not much actually happening."
"A new social policy has not been fully worked into the macro-economics of the European Union."
"The budget is small, and is not keeping pace with the enlargement of the European Union."
"Striving to extend its area of influence, the European Union often helps countries outside the EU more than the new EU states."
"Therefore, it is no accident that in Latvia, for example, the majority of inhabitants are today worse off than before accession to the European Union."
"More than 90% of pensioners are surviving on income which is below subsistence level."
"Unemployment in Latvia has reached the 20% mark, gross domestic product has fallen by 19%, the State debt exceeds the annual budget, and pensions have fallen by 10%."
"The people are protesting, leaving Latvia, announcing indefinite hunger strikes or offering to sell their internal organs in order to get money to keep their families."
"The number of suicides is rising."
"The European Union's neoliberal social security policy must be changed."
"Capitalism caused the crisis, but it is workers and pensioners who are paying to find a way out of it."
"Investment by the major capitalist multinational companies and banks in solving the problems caused by the crisis is minimal."
"The European Union is allowing the upper classes and the banks to be saved with the tax revenue of the state, that is to say, with the people's money."
"The countries of Eastern Europe want an equal allocation of subsidies to agriculture, since at the moment, subsidies are more concentrated towards the older Member States, which, at the same time, distorts the free market in labour."
"There must be an end to the unequal approach in the calculation and payment of direct payments, and to the separation of these payments from the manufacture of specific products."
"The European Commission and Parliament must democratically adopt regulations to protect not only the interests of large producers and bankers but also the needy in the rich, democratic European Union."
"The economic and financial crisis has had a much harsher effect on the transforming countries of Central and Eastern Europe than on the stable democracies of Western Europe."
"It is therefore right to look for ways to counter this unfavourable economic development."
"We must not forget, however that miracles happen only in fairy tales."
"Therefore, the primary and fundamental requirement in terms of changes for the better is a responsible financial and economic policy of the government and a modern, right-wing working legislature in every affected country."
"Only then will it be possible through targeted industrial measures to play a part in gradually assisting economic development."
"If such assistance is to be effective, its financial resources must not be spent on social benefits or consumption, nor must they be spent on artificially-created nonsensical jobs."
"It should not be possible, for example, for a government to use such assistance to resume the operation of an old thermal power station which produces more emissions than electrical energy only because it allegedly creates a few new jobs."
"If we really want to help the affected countries, we must support only financial projects that have a high degree of innovation and which consistently conserve the environment."
"Let us take care that the funds invested in these support programmes contribute to a restructuring of companies and bring a long-term effect to the affected countries, and thereby to the whole of Europe as well."
"(HU) First and foremost, we should find a solution to avoiding a similar crisis in the future."
"The mess caused by the global financial system is sweeping across the world, having a direct impact on the real economy because companies have no access to credit, which is the vital lifeblood of the economy."
"The lesson from this is obvious."
"It is clear that we must get rid of the belief placed in the market's self-regulation and supremacy, and accept and enforce the state's regulatory role."
"We talk about economic recovery, but obviously, the ultimate aim we want to achieve through this is to protect jobs."
"This means that priority is given to support for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe as well, as they actually provide the majority of jobs."
"The terms for gaining access to credit are a fundamental issue."
"Certainly, the banks have operated sensibly, as we heard from Mr Almunia."
"This applies to Hungary as well, for instance, where all the commercial banks are subsidiaries of foreign owned banks."
"Therefore, because of their prudence, they have tried to withhold credit in such a way that it has also paralysed the domestic economy."
"Direct subsidies, which the EU also allows, are also obviously required, but they should not be given to those governments, like the current Hungarian Government, which primarily supports the settlement of multinational firms rather than small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Today, we discussed the matter of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development when dealing with the modification to the European Commission's 2009 Finance Bill."
"In its draft, the Commission has taken the significant and drastic measure of holding back these funds, even though they are precisely earmarked for maintaining the rural population."
"Why are we talking about this region separately?"
"The reason is that it has become much more vulnerable than the western part of Europe."
"We need to go back in time to the 1990s, when it became clear that our hope - that our economy in Hungary would also become independent in this democracy - was in vain."
"This region suffered from the ever-increasing burden of the instalment repayments covering the inherited debts, as well as the using up of its cheap natural and human resources, while all these generated very significant financial revenue in the Western countries."
"This is why I feel obliged to say now, with proper justification, that this region should receive more support, as this is a matter of obtaining partial compensation."
"(HU) Ladies and gentlemen, the crisis has demonstrated that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe outside the euro area are much more vulnerable than those where the single currency is used."
"As a result of their dependence on strong exports and foreign capital, as well as the population's high level of foreign currency debt, the rate of recovery is also slower than in those countries enjoying the security of the euro area."
"If the solidarity between Member States does not work in practice, rather than just as a sound bite in slogans, the European Union's internal cohesion will diminish, thereby hampering the whole EU's performance."
"However, we do not need any new EU instruments to achieve this solidarity, especially not handouts."
"The existing opportunities and resources must be used sensibly."
"In this respect, the European Central Bank can help in constantly maintaining the liquidity of the banks in the region."
"The European Investment Bank can also help by providing targeted credit to the region's small and medium-sized enterprises, while the EU's institutions can help by adapting the rules for using the money from the Cohesion and Structural Funds to suit the extreme situation."
"I would particularly like to draw your attention to the fact that many people like to treat Central and Eastern European countries en masse, even though these countries are very diverse, with different crisis exit strategies as well."
"For instance, after nearly eight years of incompetent socialist administration, Hungary has used up all its reserves."
"At the moment, it is forced to exercise restraint, which is in stark contrast to the practical actions adopted in other European countries for managing the crisis, based on economic recovery."
"While the Western European governments are already thinking about drawing up their exit strategies, some countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have been worst affected by the crisis are still facing major recession in 2010 as well."
"Therefore, when it comes to devising exit strategies, it is vitally important to have some way of differentiating between countries."
"EU leaders should not devise standard rules which would only exacerbate further the situation of some countries and that of their population."
"When drawing up the new financial system regulations, attention must be focused on ensuring that the tightening of capital requirements does not generate unfair competition between banks."
"The banks in Central and Eastern Europe which have turned out to be healthy have not received any injection of capital from anyone."
"This means that they would only find it more difficult to deal with the stricter capital requirement regulations than their rescued counterparts in Western Europe."
"This would result in a decline in their desire for credit, which was not very great anyway, with small and medium-sized enterprises ultimately ending up the victims of this situation."
"We must avoid this scenario at all costs."
"(ET) Mr President, first I would like to congratulate Mr Almunia sincerely for his very effective work up to this point."
"For all the Member States of the European Union, there are many common problems and, at the same time, each country has its own economic policy and its own specific problems, and we must definitely all be self-critical here."
"The argument that only the new Member States of the European Union have been especially severely affected by the crisis is not true."
"Look at the countries where the banks have needed economic support - they are mainly the old Member States, not the new ones."
"Similarly, fiscal problems are bigger in the euro area than outside it."
"At the same time, it is clear that banks operating across borders did not create an additional risk."
"The situation was exactly the opposite."
"The banks which operated in various countries were the most secure, and they were able to stabilise the situation in many recipient partner states."
"The banks which had problems are the banks which simply made bad commercial decisions, as was the case, for example, with the Royal Bank of Scotland."
"Mr President, I would like to join the previous speaker in thanking Commissioner Almunia."
"He has a clear view on the differences in different countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the current state of their economic and financial situation."
"The Commissioner mentioned Estonia."
"I come from Estonia, and it has not been an easy job to fulfil our aspirations of joining the euro area, but the one thing I think we might share with the other countries around is self-responsibility."
"I have not heard the word 'self-responsibility' in this assembly in this debate so far; there is only the word 'solidarity'."
"How can we expect solidarity if we have big world competitors like China and India racing ahead?"
"I think in the European Union we should be much more pragmatic and think what our national governments are responsible for."
"It is difficult in these times to make cuts."
"In Estonia, it has been very difficult to cut expenditure in state government, yet we have been doing this for years."
"In the good years - in the booming years - we were able to make reserves, and nobody else - only the Member States' governments - is responsible for that."
"(PL) Mr President, I represent Poland - a country which perhaps does not have to worry about the crisis in the way that, for example, Hungary or Latvia do, but in my country, in spite of government propaganda, unemployment is also clearly rising, and a demonstration today in Warsaw was attended by protesting shipyard workers who have just received the last part of their redundancy money."
"According to an analysis carried out by the National Bank of Poland, the dynamics of the recession in nine countries of Central and Eastern Europe were definitely stronger than in the countries of Western Europe."
"What is worse, the differences between the individual countries of our region are greater than those in the 'old' EU."
"This is partly a result, not only of the greater stability of the economies of the old 15, but also, and let us say this directly, of their greater ability to use or bend certain financial instruments which theoretically have been banned by the European Union."
"The European Commission and Mrs Kroes turned a blind eye to the help which Berlin gave the German shipyards, but condemned Poland for doing the same and ordered the return of EU aid given to Polish shipyards."
"It turns out in practice that some are more equal than others, and that double standards are being employed."
"The French motor industry can receive more government aid than the motor industry in the countries of the 'new' EU."
"This only increases the disproportions."
"The Commissioner spoke about the salutary role of the euro, but it was surely a joke."
"Poland does not have the euro, and the crisis has affected us to a lesser degree than Slovakia, which has adopted the euro and where the consequences of the crisis are more serious than in Poland."
"I appeal for solidarity, of which the representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) spoke, but I have the impression that he is, on this matter, a hypocrite."
"In this context, hypocrisy is not a tribute to virtue."
"Mr President, I expected Commissioner Almunia and indeed Mr Verhofstadt to perhaps offer us an explanation, and an analysis, for the reasons behind the disaster which has befallen most countries in Central and Eastern Europe in the economic arena."
"Twenty years ago, we had an heroic movement of working people in those countries which brought down the Stalinist monolith."
"Unfortunately, instead of replacing that monolith by going on to genuine democratic socialism, it was the restoration of capitalism which followed."
"But that was what was prescribed by the entire political European capitalist establishment: the EU, the big business media all promised that capitalism would herald a bright new era for the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The market was to be God; competition was to be king."
"So we have the imposition of the neoliberal agenda so beloved of the European Commissioner: the wholesale privatisation of public property - the robbery of public property, in fact - and putting the economies of these countries at the mercy of the sharks on the international financial markets."
"We even set up a special bank to oversee this process, and it has been an unmitigated disaster."
"The Baltic States are in freefall: Latvia 18% down in the third quarter, unemployment at 20%."
"What do the EU Commission and Mr Verhofstadt offer?"
"The prescription of the International Monetary Fund and of the western European banks."
"Slash and burn the living standards of working people; slash and burn public services."
"Therefore, we have in Latvia the threat that half the hospitals will be closed by the end of this year."
"The policies of the EU establishment mean a nightmare for the ordinary people of these countries - the threat of barbaric conditions for the ordinary people."
"So I would commend the people of Central and Eastern Europe to reject this fatal prescription of the European Union establishment, nationalise their banks, put them under democratic control so that they invest for people and for jobs, nationalise or renationalise the major sectors of the economy, but this time under the control of working people so that they can plan their economy for people and not have themselves at the mercy of the sharks, of corporate Europe and financial Europe, which has brought about this dreadful disaster for the peoples of this region."
"You may laugh, Commissioner, but I await your response."
"(EL) Mr President, thank you very much for giving me the floor and my thanks also to Commissioner Almunia for the very detailed report which he submitted to Parliament."
"I was particularly gladdened by the fact that the Commission agreed to relax the Stability Pact, acknowledging of course that the strict Maastricht criteria, such as the 3%, are very hard to achieve in times of serious economic crisis such as we are experiencing at present."
"I should like, first of all, to highlight the fact that, in recent days and weeks, the country which I come from, Greece, has been under attack from a specific credit rating agency, a consultancy firm, as regards its creditworthiness."
"This begs the question of whether we should seriously consider the creation of an EU agency to do this job, so that not just anyone can do it and so that it has nothing to do with hidden commercial or other competitive agendas."
"I wish to voice the complaint that the European Union helps a great many third countries more than its members."
"I also wish to call for the solidarity to be shown which my country, Greece, needs in order to deal with its problems."
"(BG) Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the sensible policy for combating the crisis in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe must be based on the principle of a social market economy, unlike the suggestions made by the previous speaker."
"This is why only a strong economy which respects the freedom of private ownership, the rule of law and personal liability can guarantee the cost of the sustainable social policy which our society deserves."
"I firmly believe that our efforts and responsibility must be focused on a number of basic pillars."
"Firstly, stable public finances."
"An alarming number of Member States have high levels of national debt."
"We need to be very vigilant and disciplined."
"We must aim for budget deficits that are not only within the 3% GDP limit, but also do our utmost to achieve balanced budgets."
"As part of the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Commission and Council must closely monitor Member States for macroeconomic imbalances."
"Secondly, we must support small and medium-sized enterprises."
"The reason for this is not only that they provide more than 65% of employment in Europe, but also that they offer the most flexibility and dynamic growth potential, especially during a crisis."
"Thirdly, it is important for us to support the unemployed and the most vulnerable groups in our society, as well as to provide sufficient investments in education, obtaining qualifications and research."
"The last point, and the number one priority for Member States who recently joined, is the expansion of the euro area."
"I want to ask for your support and thank my fellow Members, as well as urge the European Commission and Member States to review their position with regard to the area's expansion."
"We need your understanding and solidarity, especially in countries like Bulgaria, where I am from, which has made great efforts to comply with the Maastricht criteria and also has one of the lowest budget deficits in the European Union, along with an extremely disciplined fiscal policy."
"Fellow Members, I believe that it is important for us to continue with our joint, coordinated efforts in order to help our economies recover and emerge from the crisis stronger than before."
"(HU) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin my one-minute speech by thanking my fellow Members from countries in the euro area for considering it important to attend this debate."
"Their very presence at this debate is where solidarity begins."
"Without forgetting about Member States' own responsibility, as my fellow Member said, the new Member States are facing general difficulties which definitely seem like objective difficulties to us."
"One such difficulty is the enforced procedure for the twenty-year accession process, which caused serious economic problems for these countries and expected genuine social solidarity from their inhabitants."
"Another one is these countries' lack of the defence mechanism offered by the euro area, which meant that they were in a much more defenceless position when the crisis hit them."
"Lastly, there is the proportion of SMEs and the people employed by them in these countries, compared to the figures for the European Union."
"All in all, I firmly believe that, in order to achieve economic recovery in the countries of the European Union and Central and Eastern Europe, we must join forces and tackle a threefold objective involving employment, financial balance and economic growth."
"I believe that the small and medium-sized enterprises package contained some of these elements."
"At any rate, we ought to overcome somehow the financial difficulties of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector."
"We would definitely need the European Central Bank's assistance mechanisms to achieve this."
"The smaller an enterprise is, the more difficult the access the EU has to it."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ET) Mr President, above all, I would like to draw your attention to the three Baltic States, whose situation is perhaps the most serious of all in this region."
"Here are some examples."
"Estonia's economic output has fallen by over 15%, while the European Union average is -4.1%."
"In no other European country apart from the three Baltic States has there been a drop in economic output of more than 10%."
"In all three Baltic States, unemployment has risen up till now to more than 15%."
"I very much hope that the proposals by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to revive the economy and to improve the financial situation will receive very concrete attention and a response from the Commission."
"Last year, Estonia had to cut the budget three times and shrink public sector expenses, and further cuts will aggravate the already serious social situation."
"I very much hope that Estonia will join the euro area on 1 January 2011, in order to create an area for economic growth and for the resolution of financial difficulties."
"(DE) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are currently in the middle of a financial and economic crisis and I believe that liquidity is the most important factor in a crisis, not only for banks and businesses, but in particular for employees."
"Creditworthiness is, of course, always a prerequisite of liquidity and, therefore, the discussion about the creditworthiness of companies, banks and employees is particularly important."
"Of course, creditworthiness is based on earnings, whether you are an employee, a company or a bank."
"If you are not earning anything, you have, of course, no creditworthiness and no liquidity and this is where the negative spiral begins."
"For this reason, it is highly important for us to ensure that no additional taxes are imposed in future on commodity trading."
"Instead, we should be considering how we can make a financial transaction levy on purely financial transactions which are not based on a service or on commodity trading."
"This levy could be used to refinance the banks and national budgets and could therefore form the basis for creating new jobs."
"In reality, unemployment is completely unacceptable."
"It is ultimately the main factor behind the emergence of the financial and economic crisis."
"(RO) According to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's economy is a social market economy."
"Our main concern must be to create new jobs, reduce unemployment and emerge from the economic crisis."
"Member States in South-Eastern Europe are faced with huge deficits."
"They must stimulate the creation of new jobs, while maintaining a long-term, sustainable fiscal policy."
"Education, health, agriculture and development of the transport and energy infrastructure remain the main priorities for these Member States."
"It is important for the level of agricultural subsidies in these Member States to be on a par with those in older Member States."
"Assistance offered by the EU over a period of five years for balance of payments can be granted if the beneficiary Member States commit to reforming their system of taxes and duties or if they adopt measures to boost their administrative capacity in order to increase and achieve maximum absorption of European funds."
"These Member States also need to be supported in modernising their heavily polluting industrial sectors in order to reduce emissions, but preserve jobs and ensure economic development."
"I would like to add as a final point that I believe that support for these Member States requires the cohesion policy for the 2014-2020 period to continue to help Europe's regions which are less well developed economically."
"(PT) Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the promoters of this debate, because it really is very important that we discuss the situation of economically weaker countries and countries outside the euro area."
"That is particularly so at a time when we are discussing strategies for coming out of the crisis, when we will have to bear in mind the different situations the various countries are facing."
"The situation is difficult in many economies in Eastern and Central Europe, but things are now starting to become difficult in many economies in the western part that are inside the euro area."
"My country, Portugal, is an example."
"The strategy must take account of the various situations, which differ from one country to another."
"Several different paths can be taken."
"It is extremely important to have a suitable monetary and budgetary policy, if possible, one that is increasingly determined by political criteria that take into account the need for liquidity for companies and small and medium-sized enterprises, that do not create or perpetuate obstacles that are very difficult for countries outside the euro area to overcome, and that exert pressure on national governments to carry out the medium- and long-term reforms that are needed."
"To conclude, we have to move on from words to deeds."
"Cohesion has to be effective."
"(RO) Thanks to the successful implementation of the European Economic Recovery Plan, we will notice a slight improvement next year, in 2010, for the European Union's Member States."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have been affected in different ways by the economic crisis."
"On the one hand, Poland has recorded slight economic growth, thereby avoiding the crisis, whereas Romania and Hungary have been severely affected by the economic crisis."
"Romania has experienced an unprecedented economic crisis this year, which has also been exacerbated by the serious political instability triggered by the Socialists, who wanted to leave the government for electoral purposes due to the forthcoming presidential elections."
"The presidential elections were only two months away."
"The Socialists' departure from government and the introduction of a motion of censure in parliament left Romania for two months with a temporary government with curtailed powers, which was unable to finalise and adopt a draft budget in parliament."
"As a result, the International Monetary Fund postponed delivering to us the third tranche of a loan amounting to EUR 1.5 billion."
"However, the Swiss Government decided to grant us a non-refundable loan amounting to approximately EUR 120 million."
"My country has recorded 8% negative economic growth and an unemployment level two points below the European Union average."
"In the future, the EU requires a strategy focused on getting governments to step back from supporting their national economies."
"However, this will not be possible in Romania until 2010 as we are not allowed to do so by the agreement signed with the IMF."
"(RO) I agree with the proverb that if you are coming from a fishing trip and you meet someone on the way, you should teach them to fish instead of giving them a fish."
"However, we have to know that we need to teach them to fish."
"I am referring on this point to the states which have recently joined the EU and still need to learn."
"However, they cannot learn off their own bat."
"We also need to give them the financial resources to do so."
"I personally believe that a healthy economy is mainly made up of medium-sized enterprises."
"As a result, economic, social and territorial cohesion policies must be targeted primarily at allocating European cohesion funds for this type of economy."
"I would like to add that the EU's economic, social and territorial cohesion policy has been neglected recently in terms of defining the European Union's priorities."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(RO) While listening to Mrs Băsescu, I cannot help but declare: 'O, les pauvres!"
"What holy simplicity in the European Parliament'."
"Returning to more serious matters, the economic contraction in the countries of Central Europe has reached drastic proportions."
"The disparities are growing between these countries and the rich countries of Western Europe."
"Furthermore, these countries' capacities to generate economic and financial incentives remains at such a low level that it is almost negligible."
"I want to draw the European Commission's attention to the fact that, as a result of the social costs, the considerable rise in unemployment and swingeing budget cuts, these countries' capacities to provide cofinancing for projects with European funding is also diminished."
"All these factors may condemn the countries of Central Europe..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(ES) I would like to put a few very simple questions to Mr Almunia, without the difficulties of translation."
"What do you think about amending the Maastricht Treaty criteria to perhaps include a new criterion relating to the balance of payments, a maximum limit on the current account deficit and external debt?"
"What do you think about the exchange rate policy?"
"Is it better to maintain a fixed or flexible exchange rate during a recession?"
"Also, with regard to the countries that have adopted the euro without being members of the European Union, is this an advantage or a disadvantage for them in the negotiations for taking on the responsibilities of the euro area in the future?"
"(HU) Mr President, influenza strikes down those who have a weak constitution."
"Therefore, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe not only need a 'vaccination', but also something to fortify their constitution."
"You know what I am referring to here."
"The change of regime should be supported, not only the economy, although that should, of course, be supported too."
"The reason is that, in a large number of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the economy, media and politics are still in the hands today of those who systematically ruined this region over the last 40 years."
"Therefore, we should support what we call European values so that one country will not be debating - in the Europe of multilingualism - the need for a language law and another will not seek to sneak collective guilt as a mere footnote into the treaty, rather than European values."
"Therefore, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"(LT) Thank you, Mr President, Commissioner, at one stage in 2006, we Lithuanians actually also attempted to introduce the euro but, sadly, we missed the criteria by one hundredth."
"Nevertheless, I really want to thank you, Commissioner, for the previous period, for the work done and for very good cooperation."
"As for today's problem, I really think that the conditions have changed and there really were some good proposals to review some things."
"By no means am I proposing Maastricht criteria, rather very elementary things that will give every state some opportunity to regulate prices."
"These are the various exchange rate mechanisms and many other things."
"I would like the European Commission to bear this proposal in mind and thank Mr Verhofstadt who suggested that, in future, we might be able to sit down and calmly discuss how we can help the states of Eastern Europe, the Baltic States, as unemployment really ..."
"(The President cut off the speaker)"
"Mr President, thank you very much to Mr Verhofstadt, who initiated this debate, and to everyone who has spoken."
"I am very grateful to you for your contributions and ideas."
"Allow me to begin with a phrase used by Mr Verhofstadt."
"He said that the fact that there are countries in Central and Eastern Europe that are not part of the euro area means that there is a 'rideau de fer' (an iron curtain)."
"I do not agree, because some of the Central and Eastern European countries that are not yet in the euro are in extraordinarily difficult economic situations, but there are others whose economic situations are no more difficult than those of more mature, more advanced economies."
"The latter have belonged to the European Union for much longer, have been receiving finance from the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds for much longer and are in the euro area, and they have equally serious or sometimes more serious problems than many of the economies of Central and Eastern Europe."
"The problem is therefore not an iron curtain, which has not existed for twenty years, and it is not that the instruments available to the European Union are not being used in that region, because they are being used as I said in my initial speech."
"Some of you have alluded to this while others appear to be unaware that instruments are being used to a much greater extent than we could have imagined when this crisis began in 2007."
"With the greatest respect, the problem is not how the criteria for entering the euro are interpreted, and we have debated this many times in this House."
"That is not the problem."
"There has been criticism in this House of those who, at the time, decided to allow some current members of the euro area to join it when it was not very clear whether the conditions had been fulfilled."
"What we are now seeing is that the economies that are not well prepared to deal with a crisis such as this are suffering the most, both within and outside the euro area."
"This is the problem that we should be concerned with."
"Do we need to cooperate more?"
"Of course we do."
"Do we need to strengthen the European instruments?"
"Of course we do."
"The Commission is asking the Council and Parliament to do so."
"Parliament is also asking the Commission to do so, and what I am asking Parliament is to ask the Council to do so, because the Commission's proposal for the actions of the European Social Fund in 2009 and 2010 to be 100% funded by European resources in those countries that benefit from the European Social Fund has not been accepted by the Council."
"I would be very grateful if you could say this to the Council."
"(FR) This is the last time that I will be here in my role as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and I want to convey your position, which is also my own, to the ECOFIN Council."
"Indeed, I believe that it is important, at times like these, to use the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in a different way from that envisaged under normal circumstances."
"I shall continue in my mother tongue."
"(ES) I agree."
"I agree with many of the ideas in the six points that Mr Verhofstadt mentioned, which he included in a letter to the President of the European Commission and to the President of the European Investment Bank."
"We agree in many respects."
"In many respects, we are already acting in line with the points that he made."
"I cited these straight away when I first spoke."
"However, to think that by using European instruments, it is possible to avoid having to make difficult adjustments in order to deal with the consequences of a recession such as this shows a lack of awareness of the depth of the recession that we have suffered, both within and outside the euro area, in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in Western Europe."
"It has been of such depth that we can imagine how, for example, Ireland has made such extremely difficult adjustments, not because the International Money Fund says so, or because it has been imposed by anyone from Brussels, but because the Irish authorities consider it to be the best way to adjust its economy as soon as possible and move forward with the same impetus that it had before the crisis."
"The social consequences of these adjustments concern us and concern me personally, just as much or even more than they concern Parliament."
"I can tell you, as it is public knowledge, that by using the balance of payments facility, the Commission has reduced many of the adjustments proposed by the governments of the countries benefiting from those resources."
"We are going to continue to do this."
"We have also tried, as far as possible, to preserve the amounts in the national budgets in order to be able to jointly finance the European funds, because otherwise, the reductions in investment expenditure that would have to be used to jointly finance European funds would have had very negative consequences in those countries."
"We are, however, seeing positive signs, which it is also important to say in a debate such as this."
"We would not have been able to say this in a similar debate in October 2008."
"In December 2009, it must be said that there are positive signs, that we are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, including in the countries that are suffering the most as a result of this crisis, such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Ireland."
"We are still facing a great deal of uncertainty, and the obstacles that we have to tackle are very significant, but there is light at the end of the tunnel."
"So once the recession has been overcome, will we go back to doing the same as we did before it?"
"I really hope not!"
"As this is my last speech in Parliament on the economy as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, allow me to give you five points that are not among Mr Verhofstadt's six points, which we should all debate."
"Firstly, in the light of our experience of this crisis, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe need a much more balanced model for growth."
"They cannot depend solely and exclusively on finance from foreign investment."
"Many of you have talked about small and medium-sized enterprises, and I agree with you."
"They also cannot depend solely and exclusively, or almost exclusively, on foreign banks, because when it comes to supervising the actions of the financial system, it is very difficult to have supervisory authorities and a financial policy that serves the interests of each country if practically all the banks are not from that country and take strategic decisions based on the interests of their country of origin."
"Having said that, it must be said that the foreign banks in those countries are conducting themselves extraordinarily well, as I have already said."
"We must increase the take-up rate of the Structural Funds."
"In the current financial perspectives, we have proposed a very large amount of resources for your approval, which can be channelled through the Structural Funds during this financial perspectives period."
"In many cases, countries are not managing to use these resources, and there is still scope for action, in some countries amounting to 4% of their annual GDP."
"4% of annual GDP and this money is not being used adequately."
"We need to provide much more support for the integration of infrastructures, and we need to continue to debate how to do so."
"There are bottlenecks in parts of the region that have not yet been overcome through infrastructures to integrate their economic area and productive fabric sufficiently within Western Europe."
"Finally the consequences of the crisis are being felt more, in social terms, in the countries that do not have a sufficient social protection system or welfare state."
"This is the case partly because they do not have a sufficient level of growth, income or wealth, but it is partly the case because, it has to be said, during the years prior to the crisis, in some of those countries, there was a 'less is more' tax policy, and when money is needed to fund public action there is none, because there is no income."
"This is also something to consider for the future."
"The debate is closed."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"At a time when the global economic crisis is continuing to affect Europe, the states of Central and Eastern Europe are feeling its effects more intensely due to the existing disparities in economic development between the old Member States and those which have joined during the last accession rounds."
"The economic crisis magnifies these disparities, placing additional pressures on the governments in these countries, which have to deal with stringent macroeconomic conditions, the social repercussions of the crisis, while also having to resolve problems arising from the vulnerability of the financial system and the sustainability of the public health care and social insurance systems."
"Taking into account these economic and social policy constraints, I hope that the Commission will adopt an integrated plan focusing on the specific problems in this region."
"It must be a plan which supports the efforts made by these states to maintain an economic and social balance."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have taken up loans granted by the IMF, the World Bank and the European Union in an attempt to overcome their domestic problems."
"However, the financial resources are not supplied at the rate required to support the measures adopted by these governments."
"For this reason, I call for these resources to be made available more quickly and for a plan to be adopted which will support the economies in this region."
"Romania and Bulgaria are feeling the full impact of the global economic recession which has hit the last two countries to join the European Union, against the background of a disparity with the developed economies of the other Member States."
"The latest Eurobarometer survey highlights that the populations of both countries state that they are very greatly concerned about their countries' economic path of development, as well as about the way in which the crisis is affecting every citizen personally."
"On top of the conclusions of the Eurobarometer survey, the crisis's impact, in the middle of winter, is only going to get worse."
"National governments have the duty to adopt the best measures to enable them to get through the winter without any drastic social consequences."
"The International Monetary Fund and the European Commission have been involved in helping Romania and Bulgaria, both financially and through providing expertise, by setting certain macroeconomic indicators."
"Greater involvement by the European Commission in stabilising the Romanian and Bulgarian economies will have a beneficial impact across the whole of the European Union, which cannot afford any major imbalances at the moment."
"All of the European Union's Member States are being affected by the different aspects of the crisis."
"However, it is evident that the new Member States are going through more difficult times than the well-tuned economies of the old Member States."
"Solidarity is one of the European Union's fundamental values, and an economic recession is a good time to show it."
"At the start of the year, we were pleased to note that more than EUR 3 billion were earmarked for energy improvements as part of the economic stimulus package introduced at that time."
"The European Commission rightly acknowledged that support was required for both the creation of alternative supply routes and the interconnection of energy networks."
"However, our delight is mixed with a degree of disappointment."
"If we look at the specific support sums, we can see that the support package neglects Central and Eastern Europe, the very region which is most vulnerable in terms of energy supply."
"The Franco-Belgian gas interconnection receives more support than the Central and Eastern European interconnections."
"While the Franco-Belgian interconnection will be the seventh, joining the existing six, this kind of infrastructure is very often lacking in the new Member States."
"In addition to this matter, we were also unhappy that the energy efficiency improvements were completely left out of the support package."
"However, this was precisely the area where the package's main aim could have been easiest to achieve, namely, job creation."
"Due to the shortcomings mentioned, we believe that two things are of paramount importance."
"Firstly, future support plans must focus on those regions where energy investments have the greatest added value."
"Secondly, energy efficiency, which is frequently mentioned in EU circles, cannot be forgotten when budget decisions are being made in the future, especially if we know that a more efficient use of energy can already produce absolutely spectacular results in the short term."
"in writing. - I congratulate the Commission for the efforts they have made to help European economies."
"The knowledge that the EU provides measures for those most in need reaffirms and ensures that we will all come out of this economic crisis stronger than before."
"I would like to emphasise the importance of losing all currently existing barriers on economy, trade and free movement on the labour market."
"Completing the integration of the European single market must be the main target in the short term."
"Only this helps us effectively stand against any future crisis."
"One of the strongest incentives the EU has is being part of the euro area."
"The euro is an important incentive for investments and economic growth, reducing vulnerability."
"I truly hope that my own country, Estonia, will succeed in fulfilling the criteria necessary for joining the euro area."
"Estonia has one of the lowest foreign debts in Europe and has managed to put aside enough reserves during economic growth to be able now to face the crisis with its own means."
"Furthermore, I am convinced that the current means from European funds and the prospects for joining the euro area soon will allow us to reduce unemployment efficiently next year."
"Ladies and gentlemen, over a year after the greatest shock to American society since 9/11, the declaration of bankruptcy by the Lehman Brothers Bank, we are wiser as the result of further experience."
"What has happened in the last 12 months is clear proof of the erroneous assumptions of neoliberal politics and, as was the case with 9/11, has persuaded us to look at the world in a different way."
"The economic crisis has affected basically every part of the world, but, most importantly for me, it has affected many millions of Europeans."
"The report published by the World Bank several days ago does not leave any doubt that the EU Member States in Eastern Europe need aid, and not only in the area of their internal affairs."
"If the crisis can reduce 11 million inhabitants of Eastern Europe and Central Asia to poverty, with a further 23 million set to follow suit by the end of 2010, under no circumstances can we be complacent."
"Financial support is essential, but so is intellectual support, to establish suitable social programmes for the countries which are feeling the effects of the crisis the most."
"During previous crises, families were able to save themselves by emigrating or by holding down several jobs."
"Today's crisis has a global dimension, which renders this type of solution impossible."
"If we do not want to see more effects of the events of a year ago, we should mobilise significantly more European funds, make it our aim to promote employment and strengthen international cooperation."
"All of these actions should focus on one thing - social policy."
"The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have felt the effects of the economic crisis exceptionally hard."
"Falling economic indicators were a reality of the last year in many countries, and not only in our region."
"However, it should be stressed that different countries coped with the crisis with differing degrees of success."
"The clear leader of countries in the region with favourable results is Poland."
"As Mr Almunia admitted during the debate, Poland is the only country to have avoided a recession, maintaining a positive growth dynamic throughout the crisis."
"Despite the fact that the economic situation in the region is slowly stabilising, it is worth thinking about what measures should be taken to restore economic growth and avoid similar turbulence in the future."
"In the short term, the governments of the countries concerned should adopt more resolute strategies of escape from the crisis."
"They need to balance budget expenditures, actively fight unemployment and social exclusion, and create conditions for the development of businesses, on the one hand, and conditions for an increase in demand, on the other."
"Equally as important as action at national level is external help."
"European and international financial institutions should establish a special credit line for small and medium-sized enterprises and for the support of infrastructure projects."
"These measures would certainly bring a growth in employment and an improvement in the social situation."
"In the long term, the best solution seems to be entry to the euro area and creating the conditions for balanced and stable growth."
"During the past year, the battle against the crisis was waged primarily at Member State level, using Member State instruments."
"The EU's Member States considered taking action mainly at national rather than EU level when it came to economic recovery, providing assistance to companies and preserving jobs."
"In some cases, even the minimum expected level of coordination, agreement and cooperation was lacking."
"The old Member States, with their stronger economies and more room for manoeuvre in budgetary terms, put together packages which primarily focused on their domestic markets and, in many instances, protectionist instruments that distort competition were used."
"One glaring example of this was the support offered by France's President Nicolas Sarkozy to the Peugeot company, stipulating as a condition the retention of jobs in France, while redundancies had to be made at the company's more efficient plant in Slovenia."
"Similar discrimination can be encountered in connection with the financial sector in Central Europe and the Baltic region, as Western parent companies continue to this day to divert profits generated at their subsidiaries operating in the region."
"The credit crunch is having a particularly tough impact on the small and medium-sized enterprise sector, which provides the majority of jobs and is sacking employees in huge numbers as a result of the contraction of export markets and reduction in development opportunities."
"This means that the economic crisis is inevitably turning into an employment and social crisis."
"For this reason, I am asking the EU15 governments once again to do their utmost to block protectionist measures and take a stance against the behaviour of the domestic banks, which is infringing internal market principles."
"in writing. - (HU) The global economic crisis has had a varying effect on the European Union's different Member States."
"The new Member States in Central and Eastern Europe have proven to be the most vulnerable."
"The reality of the situation has shown that Member States have had unequal access to the instruments contained in the European Economic Recovery Plan."
"We have also noticed that Member States in the euro area have enjoyed the best protection against the crisis."
"It is no coincidence that the consequences of the crisis were felt harder in those countries which did not have the benefit of recovery instruments and were not members of the euro area."
"The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has marked the end of the European Union's period of institutional reform."
"Now a joint effort is required to strengthen the European Union's cohesion."
"This is a vital condition for the EU to emerge from the crisis revitalised, as a crucial global player."
"The impact of the social and employment crisis will be felt most in 2010."
"The new Member States will definitely be its main victims."
"What we need is an economic recovery plan that is, in actual fact, equally accessible to all Member States."
"In addition, the terms for joining the euro area must be made more flexible."
"These obvious measures will contribute to creating a strong Europe, making it a community of half a billion citizens who profess the same values and are guided by the same ideas."
"Experience gained in applying the food hygiene regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on the oral question by Horst Schnellhardt, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), to the Commission on the experience gained in applying the food hygiene Regulations of the European Parliament and the Council (EC) No 852/2004, (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 - B7-0237/2009)."
"Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commission warmly for its communication on the experience gained in applying the food hygiene regulations."
"It is very important and the content of the communication is very convincing."
"I would like to give my support to this communication, which describes what has happened in practice over the last three years."
"It is important for us to be aware that the hygiene regulations have undergone a paradigm shift."
"We have strengthened the internal market, we have improved food safety and we have increased the responsibility of food producers and suppliers."
"This is a significant change and therefore we have, of course, identified a few problems, in particular in relation to the licensing of small and medium-sized enterprises."
"Some butchers' shops have ceased trading."
"We should once again review the situation, as this is due to the fact that very often, the flexibility built into the regulations is not being made use of and there has been no exchange of information between the local supervisory authorities and the European Food and Veterinary Office, which I feel is a very bad thing."
"If the Commission now decides that it does not want to make any changes, I will be forced to object."
"I believe that it is necessary, even if these are only cosmetic changes, that we should look in particular at the following issues."
"We should be aware that the information within the food supply chain is being interpreted too narrowly and this needs to change."
"We should consider whether other methods for inspecting meat would be appropriate."
"In particular, we should not continue with the accreditation of trichina laboratories described in Regulation (EC) No 882."
"We need reliable planning for the areas which apply regulations."
"This is specifically why I am opposed to the intended regulation."
"We should be making a brief and concise proposal for changes so that we are not involved in authorising transitional rules until 2013."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Commissioner Vassiliou has asked me to pass on her apologies for being unable to be present to speak on this oral question relating to the Commission report on experience gained from application of the food hygiene regulations."
"On behalf of the Commission, I would like to underline that the report is based on information received from relevant stakeholders, from both the public and private sectors, and the outcome of these consultations has been positive."
"No major difficulties were identified, but in some areas, there is still room for improvement."
"Turning to specific issues, firstly, I am aware of the problem of the reapproval of small capacity establishments."
"Solutions to such problems can be found through the flexibility provisions in the regulations to be adopted at national level."
"Where this approach has not been followed, difficulties have arisen in certain Member States."
"The Food and Veterinary Office is currently carrying out specific missions to identify best practice of such flexibility for small capacity slaughterhouses, with a view to their wider dissemination."
"Due to the fact that Member States have until the end of this year to decide whether to grant or refuse approvals, I cannot say at this stage how many small and medium-sized enterprises were refused approval."
"Secondly, the flexibility provisions aim more generally to protect food diversity and help small scale producers."
"The adoption of national measures to apply flexibility and the notification to the Commission provide legal certainty for small scale producers and acknowledges the specificities of smaller scale establishments."
"At the same time, food diversity, such as traditional production methods for sausages or cheese, is ensured without compromising food safety."
"In order to encourage the correct use of flexibility provisions, the Commission has published several guidance documents."
"This should further contribute to ensuring transparency and legal certainty."
"It is also important to recall that the Commission, in an effort to contribute towards a reduction of administrative burdens, notably for very small enterprises, has already suggested amending the regulation accordingly."
"However, this suggestion is still pending, as you know."
"Thirdly, food chain information includes a written communication from the farmer to the slaughterhouse and its official veterinarian."
"This information provides essential data to ensure a risk based inspection."
"The competent authorities have recently been allowed a derogation from the provision that the information must be delivered to the slaughterhouse at least 24 hours in advance."
"Additionally, I am pleased to announce that next April, the next Commission will organise a round table with all parties concerned on a possible revision of meat inspections in order to consider its effectiveness, taking into account recent trends of hazards."
"Finally, I would stress that laboratories involved in official controls must be accredited to ensure high quality and uniformity of analytical results so as not to jeopardise the safety of food."
"This is essential for the smooth day to day running of intra-EU trade and for facilitating trade with third countries."
"However, the Commission has recently agreed to an extension of a transitional period for trichinella testing until the end of 2013 to allow more time for laboratories to become accredited."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Schnellhardt, for his question."
"This gives us the opportunity to identify positive and less positive experiences of the implementation of the regulation."
"The food hygiene regulation specifies the hygiene rules for meat production."
"The Commission's consultation shows that good progress has been made and that overall, the application of the regulations is functioning effectively."
"The fear that excessively strict regulations would result in small and artisan companies going bankrupt has, in most cases, not become reality as a result of the exceptions for small companies."
"However, the consultation also clearly shows that there are problems in applying the rules in many cases."
"This is confirmed by the information that I have received from companies and supervisory authorities in the region which I come from."
"As a result of the fact that the authorities in the regions have a great deal of leeway in their decision making, they can meet the needs of smaller and artisan butchers' shops in individual cases."
"This is definitely a good thing, as it is the only way in which we can ensure that smaller butchers, which offer a wide variety of products, with the accompanying challenges for freshness and quality, are not crushed under the weight of excessive bureaucracy."
"However, this flexibility does have its limits when it results in exceptions and regulations being interpreted differently according to the whims of the supervisory authorities."
"This causes serious distortions of competition, not only between the Member States, but also within them."
"Therefore, we need to introduce improvements in the food hygiene regulation so that inspectors have more legal certainty and more legal powers."
"The inspectors must have adequate legal measures available to them, for example, in the form of criminal fines."
"Mr Almunia, there is a great deal of legal uncertainty in this area which must be removed and we are expecting a proposal from the Commission."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I would like to congratulate everyone involved in putting in place the food hygiene regulations, because this communication from the Commission gives a mainly positive picture of the experiences of applying the regulations."
"This should not be underestimated, because as has already been explained, these new regulations represent a paradigm shift in food hygiene policy."
"The innovative character of the regulations was the reason why an initial report on the experiences with the regulations was planned only three years after they came into force."
"The Member States and the food suppliers and producers were generally happy with the regulations and have reported making good progress in applying them."
"In the opinion of the Member States and the private interest groups, there are no major difficulties either for the companies or for the authorities."
"They are unanimously of the view that these regulations need some adjustments, but that a fundamental review is not required."
"The challenge of ensuring that consumers receive the highest possible quality and safety with regard to product hygiene and of responding flexibly to the needs of the companies and, in particular, very small companies, is met by the current regulations."
"In line with the saying 'If you stop improving, you stop being good', the problems identified in the process of drawing up the report, as Mr Schnellhardt has already mentioned, will have to be investigated in order to determine the cause and, if necessary, solutions will have to be found."
"It is, of course, also necessary to continue to follow closely the implementation of the hygiene package, as it was too early for some Member States to provide a balanced and detailed evaluation."
"Only when we have a comprehensive assessment in front of us should we decide whether changes should be made to the food hygiene regulations and, if so, which changes those should be."
"Member of the Commission. - Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank everyone for their contributions to this discussion."
"We consider that the July report serves as a starting point for discussion of possible improvements on the regulations and, in due course, the Commission will examine the need to make legislative changes."
"We very much welcome Members' contributions; your inputs are very useful to us for our work to prepare in due course new initiatives."
"We look forward to continued collaboration with Parliament, and also with the Member States, with stakeholders, both from the private and public sector, and I am sure that all of us have a common aim of achieving the highest possible level of food safety."
"This, I think, is the most important conclusion which we can draw from this evening's discussion."
"The debate is closed."
"European Action on victims of terrorism (debate)"
"The next item is the Commission statement on European Action on victims of terrorism."
"Madam President, I echo the remarks made by my colleague, Mr Almunia."
"Victims of terrorism are victims of attacks perpetrated against the democratic values of our societies."
"These victims, of course, illustrate for us this human tragedy that is terrorism."
"We have a duty to support, acknowledge and assist them."
"The Commission has a dual role in this area."
"Firstly, to make our citizens aware of what victims of terrorism go through, how they suffer, and to ensure greater representation of victims' interests at European level."
"Secondly, to strive to ensure that there are no more victims, so that this terrorism can stop."
"This is the terrorism prevention policy."
"Since 2004, the Commission has been providing financial assistance to a number of projects aimed at providing victims and their families with the aid and the social or psychological support they need."
"These projects fulfil the objective of increasing the solidarity shown by European citizens towards victims of terrorism."
"A budget of EUR 2 200 000 was allocated to this initiative for 2008 alone."
"In addition to these actions, since 2008, the Commission has been operating a European Network of Associations of Victims of Terrorism."
"The aim of this network is to encourage transnational cooperation among associations of victims of terrorism and to provide greater protection of victims' interests at EU level."
"We have devoted a budget of EUR 200 000 to it."
"This network operates in several areas: it assesses the support and protection currently offered to these victims, and also promotes activities aimed at disseminating best practices."
"The activities identified by this network constitute a very useful basis for the Commission's work."
"Lastly, in a context in which protection of the citizens must remain at the centre of our policies, the Commission hopes to step up actions aimed at protecting victims."
"It intends to support measures aimed at encouraging victims of terrorism to share their experiences."
"The idea, in fact, is to make European citizens more aware of the reality of terrorism, to prevent terrorism."
"It must not be forgotten that terrorism is often the result of a phenomenon of indoctrination and radicalisation."
"What is more, with these actions, it should be possible to convey a message of peace that promotes democratic values."
"Thus, the Commission intends to draft a charter of the rights of victims of terrorism."
"I personally join with all those who have expressed their anger over all these terrorist attacks and support our efforts to show solidarity with the victims of terrorism."
"Madam President, I am now going to listen to the speeches of the various MEPs and I will respond to them as fully as possible."
"Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to say that the majority of governments and citizens only remember the victims of terrorism after a serious attack such as the ones in Madrid, New York or London."
"Once the wave of emotion has passed, they tend to forget about the terrorist threat and the rights of victims."
"Today, however, there is no doubt about the European Union's commitment to the fight against terrorism."
"As Commissioner Barrot has just told us, this commitment has also been reflected in the recently adopted Stockholm Programme, which recognises the courage and dignity of the victims and the need to defend their rights."
"Despite this progress, the fight against terrorism has always been based on trust and mutual cooperation between the Member States."
"Taking into account the perspective offered by the Treaty of Lisbon, I wonder whether it would be a good idea for the European Union to promote harmonisation of the legislation of the Member States on the rights of victims of terrorism."
"The adoption of a European charter of the rights of victims of terrorism would be a big step forward that would help those fighting terrorism and would be a strong blow for those that defend it."
"It is the courage and dignity of the victims that is the greatest failure of terrorism and therefore the greatest triumph of democracy."
"We should never forget that the only weapon that innocent victims have against terrorism is their word and the recognition of society."
"Therefore, you should also not forget, ladies and gentlemen, that none of us are safe from being victims of terrorism."
"My question is, therefore: would the Commission agree with adopting a European charter to recognise the defence of the rights of the victims of terrorism and to promote those rights?"
"If so, what measures would the new Commission take to drive forward this Charter under its new mandate?"
"Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your heartfelt expression of a commitment that has finally become part of European policy since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"This is subject to the European law in which Parliament is also going to play a decisive role, a more decisive role than ever."
"This is confirmed by the adoption of the Stockholm Programme."
"Its multiannual programme for 2009-2014 includes an express, necessary reference to the dignity of victims of terrorism, the suffering caused by this terrible form of crime, their particular vulnerability, but also, and above all, to the mandate for protecting them."
"I therefore think that it is worth pointing out that as the Spanish Presidency is coming up in the next six-month period, and as the determination of the Spanish Government and Spanish society to fight all forms of terrorism is so consistent and persistent, it will certainly be an opportunity to include this harmonisation, this framework programme for the protection of the rights of victims of terrorism in the action plan."
"As it is a plan for multiannual legislation, it is going to be the responsibility of the Spanish Government to draw it up, which will have to be supported subsequently by the Belgian and Hungarian presidencies in defining the legislation and implementing the objectives of the Stockholm Programme."
"I therefore think that it is time for Parliament to confirm this determination to protect the victims of terrorism in order to close in the fight against all forms of terrorism and establish the dignity that the victims of terrorism need."
"It is time to make a commitment that, in the legislative plan of the Stockholm Programme, and in the action plan that the Spanish Presidency will be responsible for defining, the protection of the victims of terrorism will receive the treatment that it deserves."
"Madam President, I would like to say that this initiative is in line with the amendment tabled by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and myself to the Stockholm Programme, because it was not included in it."
"The victims of all types of terrorism needed it, and what is more, they are asking us for it."
"I have learned a great deal about dignity, public spiritedness and suffering from the victims that I have worked with in recent years."
"Their testimonies drive me to advocate a European standard of looking after the victims of terrorism from a material, emotional and legal point of view."
"We have constructed a common discourse based on four pillars."
"Firstly, recognising their suffering, protecting them and assuming that the victims are not only those who are killed and injured but also their families, those who are threatened and their freedom, which is the freedom of all."
"Secondly, repairing the material damage caused, fostering their memory and working to ensure that justice is done."
"Thirdly, humanising the debate about the victims, who are people who are suffering and need to be protected, defended, recognised, helped and supported."
"In politics, we need to learn to put ourselves in their shoes."
"Finally, de-politicising the debate."
"We need to be generous in order to ensure that we do not make terrorism an electoral affair."
"In Europe, murder has been committed in the name of religion, Marxism, private property, environmentalism, the independence of a region or the unity of the State of which it is a part."
"There have even been governments implicated in terrorist actions."
"This is not, however, a question of principles."
"Totalitarians and fanatics kill, the perversion of the basic values of humanity kills."
"These are the things that lead to violence, but the free exchange of democratic ideas does not."
"I dedicate this speech to all the victims of terrorism."
"(ES) Madam President, the Stockholm Programme contains the following reference, among others, in support of the victims of terrorism: victims of terrorism also need special attention, support and social recognition."
"In my view, the Union must ensure that they receive that support, and promote their full recognition by society."
"Those who have suffered the barbarity of terrorism should be an ethical reference point for our societies."
"Therefore, defending victims and their rights must be one of the European Union's priority policies."
"We need to maintain and strengthen the funds for victims of terrorism with adequate finance, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) proposed in the amendments tabled for the draft European Union budget for 2010."
"For this reason, aid has increased by EUR 1 million, which will be used to fund projects aimed at helping the victims of terrorism and their families to recover, through social or psychological support offered by organisations and their networks."
"It will also be used to fund projects aimed at mobilising public opinion against all forms of terrorism."
"Part of the money is to be used in particular to improve legal assistance and advice for victims and their families."
"Here is some incidental, illustrative information: terrorism equals victims."
"The total funds allocated for preparation for and prevention of terrorist attacks will amount to EUR 21 420 000 next year."
"The idea suggested by Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio of making victims more visible in the Union should have the unconditional support of this House."
"First of all, we need to equip ourselves with the necessary legal instruments, starting with a written declaration and then moving on to a resolution, so that we finally have a political declaration of support from the European institutions for the victims of terror."
"This will also raise awareness among European citizens of the value of those victims."
"Victims provoke in us feelings of solidarity, compassion, recognition, dignity, sustainable support and remembrance, along with feelings of contempt and a desire for justice for the terrorists who caused so much pain and death."
"(ES) Madam President, Mr Barrot, it is no coincidence that a whole series of Spanish MEPs have spoken."
"In the Basque Country, in addition to the suffering caused by a terrorist attack, victims have frequently suffered contempt or silence after the event."
"This is why a movement has been forming seeking the recognition of victims, which I think requires a policy for the victims of terrorism."
"If I may, I would like to add to what has been said by all my fellow Members in favour of a charter or of a common approach to this policy by giving you a very brief summary of ten aspects that I feel are key in this respect."
"Firstly, the victims' policy requires public sympathy, recognition and social support for victims."
"Secondly, it requires swift and effective compensation for the damage suffered."
"Thirdly, it requires equal treatment for all victims."
"Fourthly, it requires a political and social consensus regarding the measures to be used for victims of terrorism."
"Fifthly, it requires a policy of discrediting the social and political discourse of violent people."
"Sixthly, it requires that those guilty of terrorism are punished in exemplary fashion, with swift, efficient access to justice for victims."
"Seventhly, it requires education and teaching against violence in the population."
"Eighthly it requires a guarantee for victims that the attacks suffered will not be repeated, which can also happen."
"Ninthly, it requires policies of remembrance so that the victims are not forgotten."
"Finally, it requires a policy of social reconciliation in order to heal the wounds caused by terrorism."
"These are the ten commandments that I propose for a common policy for the victims of terrorism."
"(EL) Madam President, the attacks in Madrid and London and the recent attacks in my country, Greece, demonstrate the extent of the problem of terrorism."
"Terrorism threatens our way of life and our freedom."
"It targets not only the direct victims and their families, which are also directly injured, but also society as a whole."
"The European pilot programmes referred to for the victims of terrorist attacks are a positive sample in terms of relieving the wounds, but a great deal still needs to be done."
"Help for victims and their families is not only a moral imperative."
"It is an imperative in order to send terrorists a clear message that we do not forget."
"We do not forget disgusting deeds which put a stain on our democracy and cohesion."
"We do not forget that victims of terrorism are often unsuspecting citizens who are injured or killed while they are going about their daily business."
"We do not forget that in the Europe which teaches tolerance and democracy, acts of violence will never be acceptable."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to voice my support for Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio's proposal for a European charter on the rights of families who are victims of terrorism, and stress that this constitutes an extraordinary opportunity for Europe to send an unambiguous message on terrorism, bearing in mind that the lack of this message led to the breakdown of the Barcelona Process in 2005 when the Heads of State or Government of the Euro-Mediterranean countries failed to reach an agreement."
"I would also stress that today this offers an extraordinary opportunity to renew dialogue on a new footing with the other side of the Mediterranean, starting with a clear statement on the concept that is the cornerstone of our humanity and our civilisation, namely the sanctity of life."
"Madam President, I am grateful for your support for the victims of terrorism."
"This is both right and proper and, of course, I do recognise the European Union's support for victims in Northern Ireland through the PEACE programmes that have been funded there."
"The Commission should be aware that Northern Ireland is facing once again a growing terrorist threat from dissident Republican organisations."
"That threat has been described by the Police Service of Northern Ireland as 'critical' and by the International Monitoring Commission as 'very serious'."
"In the most recent brutal attacks, two soldiers just about to go to Afghanistan were murdered, as well as one police officer."
"In its initial funding to victims of terrorism, the Commission identified the key objective to mobilise the public against terrorism in all its forms."
"However, I feel with the transition to the broader CIPS programme, this objective seems to have been lost."
"I am grateful for your proposed work on a Victims' Charter and I would urge that this starts off by making a very clear distinction between the victims of terrorism and the perpetrators of terrorism."
"(DE) Madam President, in Austria we have, thank goodness, not been subjected to terrorist attacks for many years."
"However, Vienna has not always escaped unscathed."
"I would like to add to the remarks made by Mr Jáuregui Atondo."
"On the one hand, we definitely need the victims' charter and the support for victims of terrorism."
"However, at the same time, we need as an accompanying measure to change the environment in which the violence occurs that leads to terrorism."
"In my opinion, we need to start with education and information."
"In addition, this House must clearly reject the brutalisation of language."
"We are constantly calling for tolerance in many areas."
"However, in one area, we must show no tolerance and that is with regard to violence."
"These speeches are full of dignity and emotion, because I believe that you have spoken on behalf of those who can no longer speak today, and I thank you on behalf of the Presidency."
"Madam President, you were right to stress just how emotionally charged this debate is, and right now, we are thinking of all the victims."
"They have all been struck by terrorism in a completely indiscriminate and completely unjust way."
"As Mr López Aguilar said, terrorism is a terrible form of crime."
"What I would like to say to you first of all is that the Stockholm Programme really has taken account of the fate of victims."
"We must, in fact, launch a European policy that takes far greater account of victims of organised crime and terrorism."
"I would like to say to Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio that we are going to take steps to introduce a charter of the rights of victims of terrorism."
"Indeed, you made your desire for this charter very clear, and I believe you did so, Mrs Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, by drawing on all the painful first-hand experience you have had."
"We have analysed, and we will continue to analyse, in 2010, all the gaps that exist today with regard to the protection of victims of terrorism in the various Member States."
"Indeed, you are right: one way or the other, we need to succeed in harmonising our laws on terrorism, on victims of terrorism."
"Europe really must be united in combating terrorism."
"On the basis of this study, we are going to see how we can harmonise and bring together all the measures so as to improve the situation of victims of terrorism in Europe."
"This will be the aim of the action plan, and there is no doubt that we will deal with this problem of victim protection by taking account of what has been said during the debate, namely the need to try, first of all, to make people aware of the tragedy and the suffering of victims, who are often the subject of silence, if not contempt."
"Next, we must ensure that they receive compensation quickly."
"You have rightly insisted on swift compensation for these completely undeserved and unjustified acts of suffering."
"You have also mentioned the delegitimisation of dialogue, since we cannot tolerate a dialogue that could, one way or another, give the impression that killing innocent people, injuring innocent people, can be a way of serving mankind."
"We must be extremely firm with regard to such language, as it denies every single one of the European Union's values."
"In addition, I must congratulate the European Parliament, Madam President, on having provided EUR 1 million for all our victim support programmes."
"Once again, I am very pleased to have Mr Almunia by my side this evening, because we are both genuinely encouraging the Commission to take measures in this regard."
"Indeed, the European Union must equip itself with exemplary legislation on the protection and assistance of victims of terrorism as part of this multiannual Stockholm Programme."
"That is what I wished to say in response to the various speeches."
"Rest assured that they have left neither Mr Almunia nor I indifferent."
"In order to ensure that we do not move straight on to another debate, I propose a minute's silence in memory of the victims."
"(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)"
"Defence of the principle of subsidiarity - Display of religious and cultural symbols in public places (debate)"
"The next item is the debate on:"
"the oral question to the Commission (B7-0238/2009) by Mario Borghezio, on behalf of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, on defence of the principle of subsidiarity;"
"the oral question to the Commission (B7-0239/2009) by Antonio Cancian, Mario Mauro, Fiorello Provera, Elisabetta Gardini, Salvatore Iacolino, Crescenzio Rivellini, Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris, Aldo Patriciello, Paolo Bartolozzi, Cristiana Muscardini, Mara Bizzotto, Barbara Matera, Lara Comi, Antonello Antinoro, Lorenzo Fontana, Roberta Angelilli, Amalia Sartori, Iva Zanicchi, Licia Ronzulli, Giovanni Collino, Marco Scurria, Giancarlo Scotta', Potito Salatto, Pablo Arias Echeverría, Raffaele Baldassarre, Pilar Ayuso, Luis de Grandes Pascual, Pilar del Castillo Vera, Santiago Fisas Ayxela, Carmen Fraga Estévez, Salvador Garriga Polledo, Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines, Esther Herranz García, Carlos José Iturgaiz Angulo, Veronica Lope Fontagné, Antonio López-Istúriz White, Gabriel Mato Adrover, Jaime Mayor Oreja, Pablo Zalba Bidegain, Salvatore Tatarella, Magdi Cristiano Allam, Mirosław Piotrowski and Konrad Szymański, on the display of religious and cultural symbols in public places."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the position of the group that I represent, the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group, is crystal clear: with this oral question, we are asking the Commission to challenge the implementation of the ruling against crucifixes in school classrooms, handed down by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg which, I would emphasise, is not an EU institution."
"In our view, this decision, and I want this to be absolutely clear, is an unacceptable breach of the principle of subsidiarity."
"This principle is a mainstay of the European Union as well as a guarantee of the rights of the peoples and of the Member States."
"The European Union, as we conceive and support it, would be unthinkable without the support and grounding of the principle of subsidiarity."
"I will start with a general remark: obviously nobody - let us look first at the substance of this ruling - could consider the removal of someone and something which was already there to be an act of democracy and freedom, as some have claimed, but rather an action of the thought police, an anti-democratic act."
"If a crucifix is hanging on a school wall and it is torn down, that wall is not a secular wall but an empty wall, with the void intended as a confessional symbol, an act of negative education, the worst kind imaginable, which can be viewed as one of the many signs of the cultural and spiritual suicide of the West."
"The ruling of the Strasbourg Court presupposes a concept of religious freedom which, if taken to its logical conclusion, would go so far as to ensure, to impose a sense of predominance over each citizen, required to live in an environment in keeping with the Court's beliefs."
"I do not believe that this is religious freedom: this distorts the true sense of religious freedom; we are dealing with a negative right, or rather the right to be free of the obligation to perform religious practices."
"There must be no misunderstandings when we speak of religious freedom: we are not talking about something vague by any means."
"We are dealing with something quite different here: displaying a crucifix is not just a matter of faith in our culture, but something much more important, something with a universal value."
"The symbol of the cross, the symbolism of the cross conveys a message that is universal in scope; a message, moreover, of peace and fraternity, as taught to us by René Guénon, the great metaphysicist, to mention just one name."
"From the traditional point of view of these great scholars of traditional culture, this value is extremely clear but, at the same time, it is just as clear that with this ruling, we are dealing with the expression of anti-traditional views which encourage everyone to think in the same way."
"This is something that runs counter to the true spirit of the European Union, and this is what is astonishing."
"It is almost as if there is the intention to turn the peoples away from any reminder of values and symbols that express verticality and spirituality."
"Leaving aside the historical facts, the link to a specific religion, this is, I repeat, a universal symbol."
"The European Union, on the other hand, must safeguard the right of the peoples to continue using symbols, starting with the symbol of the cross."
"Europe must be bold enough to take a metahistorical perspective on these fundamental questions, and resume its role as a cradle and centre, including in spiritual terms."
"It must return to the European peoples the freedom to keep and venerate the symbols of their identity in accordance with a cardinal principle of the legal and political structure of the European Union: the principle of subsidiarity."
"The whole question turns precisely on this aspect, on the fundamental nature of the principle of subsidiarity."
"In conclusion, this issue enables us to reflect on and to debate a key question: what does religious freedom mean for Europe?"
"Well, I would like to say that it is precisely the ruling of the Strasbourg Court that is riding roughshod over the fundamental right to religious freedom, and which wants to prevent a people such as the Italians from keeping the symbol of the cross in classrooms as an indispensable reminder of their Christian roots."
"Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on 3 November 2009, the European Court of Human Rights approved an application from an Italo-Finnish citizen seeking to remove crucifixes from classrooms."
"Similar episodes had occurred in the past in Spain, Germany, France and also in Italy where, in 1988, the Council of State established that the crucifix is not just a Christian symbol but that it also has a value unrelated to that specific religion."
"The Italian Council of State, expressing its opinion again in 2006, specified that the principle of secularity of the state cannot disregard a people's cultural identity and its civilisation."
"With our question, we wanted to highlight the most secular aspect of this matter, not least by pointing out that the next step could even be to take before the Strasbourg Court Catholic symbols which are part of the common traditions of the Member States, as well as the artistic and cultural portrayals found throughout our cities."
"Even the flag of the European Union, created for the Council of Europe, was inspired by Marian iconography according to its designer."
"The decision of the Court of Human Rights seeks to impose from above - so much for subsidiarity - a secular model which many Member States cannot identify with or, worse still, seeks to lead us to nihilism: there you have the empty wall which Mr Borghezio just mentioned."
"The ruling calls into question our very identity, our European values of peace, love and civil harmony, of equality and freedom, and the ruling therefore undermines freedom and equal rights."
"The EU institutions are champions of the prerogatives of freedom."
"Displaying religious and cultural symbols with which peoples identity is an expression of the freedom of thought - and the Sakharov Prize will be awarded in this very Chamber tomorrow - and should be safeguarded as such by the EU institutions themselves and by international organisations founded on democratic principles."
"Madam President, I would have been only too happy to have listened to Mr Mauro, but he will be able to take the floor after me."
"I am obliged to adhere to a number of rules of law."
"The Commission is very committed to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as laid down in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
"However, it is true that the Commission can act only within the context of applying EU law."
"The fact is, within the EU, national laws on religious symbols in public buildings come under the domestic legal system of the Member States."
"The principle of subsidiarity is to be applied within the context of the Union."
"It is true that this principle of subsidiarity does not apply to the implementation of judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, the international court in charge of enforcing the European Convention on Human Rights."
"It is true that the responsibility for implementing European Court of Human Rights judgments lies with the Council of Europe."
"It is also true that the implementation of European Court of Human Rights judgments is mandatory for all States that are party to the European Convention on Human Rights, and Italy, like any other party involved in this case, has the right, under Article 43 of the Convention, to request a transfer of proceedings to the Grand Chamber within three months of the date of the judgment."
"According to the information we have - the information we have read in the press - the Italian State is using its right to appeal before the Grand Chamber."
"Those are the points that I wanted to clear up."
"With regard, once again, to European Union law, we are dealing in this case with the domestic legal system of the Member States."
"That being said, I cannot answer for the Council of Europe or for the European Court of Human Rights, which have issued a decision that I understand may raise some issues for Parliament."
"That is what I can honestly say, but I am going to listen carefully to the speeches that follow."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for his clarity of judgment which effectively puts the power to regulate this area back in the hands of the Member States."
"I must say that I am convinced, more than most, of the need for our institutions to be secular and just as convinced that religion is not the solution to any political problem."
"At the same time, we cannot solve political issues by waging war on religions."
"It is precisely for this reason that I will explain my thinking by means of a paradox: what would happen if we applied the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights, that is, if, at the same time, we applied the reasoning which obliges us to remove crucifixes from Italian classrooms to all places where crosses are displayed on the grounds of public interest?"
"What should be done about this flag, the flag of Sweden, and what should be done about this flag, the flag of Finland, and the flag of the Slovak Republic, and the flag of Malta, and the flag of Denmark, and the flag of Greece, and the flag of the United Kingdom which has three crosses, no less?"
"Because, ladies and gentlemen, the reason why these crosses appear on these flags is no different from the reason why crucifixes are displayed in Italian classrooms, and it is not a religious reason but rather a cultural and traditional one."
"Let us therefore leave it to the Member States to judge, on a case by case basis, the suitability of solutions in line with the sensitivities of their peoples, in keeping with their religious freedom and the secular nature of the institutions."
"This is all we are asking and we are doing so because, above and beyond anything else, it is not the abstract concept of the law which must be upheld, but every individual's personal truth and desire for the infinite."
"Madam President, as a lawyer and a Member of the European Parliament, I am sure that there are many citizens following our debate who share my feeling that it lacks focus."
"We are therefore going to try to clarify a few things."
"Firstly, we are talking about a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which is not a European Union institution but rather a court - one that is part of a concentric circle of the European Union, but is separate - which is committed to the Rule of Law, representative democracy and human rights."
"Secondly, we are talking about a judicial resolution, and no resolution by Parliament can revoke or amend any resolution passed down by a court of justice."
"Thirdly, the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights is highly respectful of religious freedom and its corollary, which is religious pluralism."
"Religious freedom is part of our common constitutional traditions and of the constitutional law of the Member States, and it is also a fundamental right protected by the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms."
"The judgment therefore gives reasons, with a solid legal basis, for the protection of religious freedom."
"It does not deny it at all."
"What is more, it is done unanimously by a prestigious court that has influenced the formation of the culture of human rights for almost sixty years."
"Ultimately, however, and this is important, we need to remember that no judgment of the European Court of Human Rights means that the legislation of any Member State that has signed up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights has to be amended, because the judgment recognises a right in response to an infringement in a specific case."
"It is only on that basis that it is up to the Member States to make the appropriate decisions about amendments to legislation or policies that might be inspired by the doctrine of the European Court of Human Rights, but under no circumstances are they obliged or compelled to do so by any judgment of the European Court of Human Rights."
"There is therefore no reason for any Member State to be concerned."
"None of them are obliged to amend their legislation or its public policies as a result of a specific judgment of the European Court of Human Rights."
"Therefore, neither Italy nor any other country has any reason to adopt any general rules as a result of this judgment."
"Lastly, however, subsidiarity has been invoked."
"We have to say that subsidiarity is a rule of European law that has no application in this case, because its concept and applications have nothing to do with this case."
"I even think that a rule of European law could be invoked that allows a vote to be postponed if there are doubts as to the relevance of a vote that has nothing to do with affairs that concern the European Parliament, which, in my view, is the case here."
"I therefore think that although this debate is legitimate, it is definitely lacking in focus and does not require an urgent pronouncement, and even less a protest or a revocation of a judgment that was passed down by a court of justice that is not a European Union institution."
"on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Madam President, the somewhat misleading title of today's debate includes the word 'subsidiarity'."
"Subsidiarity, as I understand it, means taking decisions at the level closest to the citizen, and that level is the citizen - the individual citizen."
"What you are saying in your resolutions is that the rights of a national state are above the rights of individual citizens."
"It is our job in this House to protect the rights of citizens, not the rights of states."
"Secondly, if we consider - as you claim - that this is not a matter for the European Union, I would like to understand why these matters are included in the Copenhagen criteria, and why we demand from candidate countries that they respect the separation of church and state when we cannot demand that of our own Member States."
"Thirdly, colleagues, if you say that the European Parliament is not competent to talk about these matters, I wonder why we are competent to discuss matters like the shape of cucumbers but not the fundamental rights of our citizens."
"As to the European Convention on Human Rights and the Court ruling, we are now two weeks after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, which requires that the EU accede to the Convention on Human Rights."
"Would it not be incomprehensible if we, at the same time, refused to accept the authority of the Court of Strasbourg?"
"We cannot explain that to our citizens."
"Secondly, I think - and this has been said by Mr López before - politicians have no business interfering in Court rulings."
"Let the judges do their jobs."
"We may have an opinion - we may like the ruling or we may not like it - but we should not interfere in their work."
"My group, the ALDE Group - the European Liberals - is the champion of a Europe that is for all citizens."
"ALDE believes in a Europe of diversity, where everybody has the right to their own conscience, their own religion and even the freedom from religion."
"I will now conclude."
"The states - not the courts, the states - must ensure an environment where all citizens can live freely, according to their own conscience."
"They should be protected by the state, and I think the situation is very serious if they feel the need to go to court in order to defend themselves from the states."
"Colleagues, reject the EPP and ECR resolutions."
"Madam President, in view of the historical fact that the founding fathers of the European Union were Christian Democrats: Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, who based what they built on Christian values and symbols, I will remind you that the flag adopted by the European Union, which shows a circle of 12 gold stars on a blue background, and which is hanging behind you, Madam President, refers to the 12 stars upon the head of the Holy Virgin Mary - the Revelation of St John, chapter 12."
"Over half a century on, it is worth asking if the philosophy of the founding fathers is still relevant."
"In the context of the scandalous judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, which ordered crosses to be removed from an Italian school, it should be stated emphatically that no group of judges appointed by politicians, not even the Council of Europe, can order the removal of a cross, which has universal and religious significance."
"This verdict tramples underfoot freedom of religion and the cultural heritage of Europe."
"In this connection, I would like to ask the Commissioner: do you not think that an attack on Christian symbols is also the destruction of the basis of the European Union?"
"Could you not, on behalf of the Commission, start a debate on the role and significance of Christian symbols in the European Union?"
"(DE) Madam President, I am grateful for the opportunity to hold this debate."
"Mr López Aguilar referred to the fact that in his opinion, as a lawyer, we are not responsible."
"I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a politician."
"Millions of people in Europe are affected by this judgment by the judges in Strasbourg."
"This is why it is a good thing that we are discussing it here."
"The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts."
"It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion."
"This is a good thing."
"However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe."
"France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church."
"We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed."
"For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way."
"I would even like to take things a step further."
"I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion."
"Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East?"
"This is because they are based on our culture and our religions."
"It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith."
"We are proud of our religious freedom."
"There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist."
"That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this."
"However, there is also the right to have a faith."
"In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics."
"Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith."
"They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society."
"This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom."
"Anyone who calls for tolerance must also show tolerance to those who practise a Christian faith."
"(PL) Madam President, the European Court of Human Rights has rightly ruled that hanging crosses in school classrooms violates the religious freedom of pupils and the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own convictions."
"The judges decided unanimously that a cross at school breaks the European Convention on Human Rights."
"The decision is simple, clear and universally comprehensible."
"This is why it has evoked such fury and aggression among the clergy and Right-wing politicians."
"They pretend they do not understand, and demand explanations from the Commission and that Parliament adopt an official position."
"This is unlawful."
"EU institutions are not empowered to evaluate that judgment, or indeed any other."
"Let us not forget that there is a tri-partite division of power, and that the Court is a body of the Council of Europe, and not of the European Union."
"I will answer the questioners, since they have such doubts: the judgment about crosses does not violate the principle of subsidiarity."
"Quite the opposite, it gives help in observing the law to those European states which have forgotten that in their constitution, there is a provision, if not about the division of church and state, then at least about neutrality of worldview."
"The judgment of the Court helps national authorities and courts which are subject to the church to realise the fundamental rights of citizens which are being broken as a result of the clericalisation of social life."
"The citizens of church states cannot defend their rights before national courts."
"It is a good thing that they can turn to the Court of Human Rights and obtain justice."
"The judgment accords with respect for the national identity of Member States and should be implemented."
"It does not concern a ban on displaying religious symbols in public, but only in a very small section of public space, in state schools."
"No one is calling for the removal of crosses from churches, squares or flags, as one fellow Member rashly said."
"It is not interference in church-state relations, but only defence of citizens whose rights are being violated."
"In my country, too, advancing clericalisation is restricting the fundamental rights of Poles."
"I cannot imagine that the European Parliament and the Commission would prevent my fellow Poles from pursuing their just rights before the Court in Strasbourg."
"A critical position of the Commission and Parliament concerning this judgment would be unauthorised interference, and would, in addition, expose us to ridicule."
"I must warn you of this."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the decision of the European Court of Human Rights has upset not only worshippers but also everyone who, for centuries, has viewed the crucifix as a sign of hope and solidarity, something providing solace and freedom from fear and pain."
"We hope that that decision will be modified by the Grand Chamber since it is clearly irrational."
"Should we do away with the very name of the Red Cross?"
"Should we remove the huge crucifixes on mountain tops which tower over cities and valleys?"
"Will it be prohibited for the Queen of England, as has already been mentioned, to be the head of the Anglican Church?"
"Nevertheless, the case invites a very important reflection from a civil and political point of view: are human rights merely the rights of individuals, as parties isolated from a social environment, or is the right to express a specific form of piety also a right of the peoples?"
"Do tradition, history, intelligence and art count for nothing when, for millennia, they have characterised a people's identity?"
"Furthermore, the question also rightly concerns the relationship between subsidiarity and human rights, and I note that the latter, aside from certain fundamental principles which must be considered universal and irrefutable, may be interpreted in different ways, and human rights may even conflict with each other."
"Why should a state be denied the chance, through its laws, to resolve these conflicts and to interpret and implement human rights according to the ethical views of its people?"
"The issue therefore goes beyond the question of crucifixes."
"On other occasions, the European Court has recognised, with regard to the right to life, the exclusive power of the States to decide on the most controversial matters, such as the regulation of abortion and euthanasia."
"Now, the Treaty of Lisbon requires us to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and consequently, as the European Union, also to respect the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights."
"Therefore, we ought to think about the new and different direction currently being taken by the Court."
"It would be a serious matter if a supranational power, especially if exercised by a limited number of people and not as the democratic expression of popular will, were to become repressive and demeaning, insensitive to people's feelings and hearts and therefore ultimately opposed to freedom."
"This is why I hope that the resolution tabled by the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) will be adopted with the votes of a large number of Members."
"(SK) The history of Europe, its individual states and therefore also the EU is, like it nor not, closely connected with the Christian heritage."
"Consequently, even the constitutions of many states contain a reference to Christian traditions."
"Even the Treaty on European Union in its preamble draws inspiration, inter alia, from Europe's religious heritage, from which universal values have developed."
"Fundamental rights in the EU are today guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms but, above all, they arise from constitutional traditions common to the Member States which have developed over centuries."
"I therefore believe that the EU must fully respect national history, culture and traditions and resolutely refuse to penalise Member States who defend their right to their own special make-up and character, including the Christian heritage and Christian symbols."
"In conclusion, I would merely like to add that neither the Charter nor the European Convention enlarge the powers of the Union."
"(ES) Madam President, I would like to start by asking to borrow some words that I am going to make my own."
"The crucifix is not a sign of imposition."
"It is a symbol that represents positive values, which are part of our history, our culture and a society that dates back more than 2 000 years."
"We cannot claim to protect fundamental rights by denying the very values that created them."
"Democracy works through freedom and respect, facilitating the exercise of rights, not through imposition or limitation."
"Yes of course, the principle of subsidiarity must be respected and recognised by all European institutions, organisations and courts, especially freedom, whether it is freedom of opinion or freedom of belief."
"The authority of the Member States to display religious symbols in public places as a symbol that represents the traditions and identity of their peoples should not and cannot be infringed."
"Freedom is an essential element of our society and the basic pillar on which the single area of freedom, security and justice is built."
"If it were to be limited or censored, the very foundations of the European Union would collapse."
"(EL) Madam President, I, too, consider that the Court is wrong to find that having a crucifix in schoolrooms is tantamount to disrespect for other people's religious faith."
"The issue we are debating today is a social rather than a legal issue."
"Obviously we must abide by the principle of subsidiarity."
"The presence of religious symbols is not a sign of religious discrimination or coercion."
"It is a result of the tradition and history of every country and often of its Constitution, as is the case in my country, Greece."
"In Greece, we have religious icons in schoolrooms, not in order to impose some specific religion on pupils, but because it forms part of our tradition and is directly connected to the values and structures of our society, directly connected to four centuries of persecution and religious oppression by the Ottoman Empire."
"(SK) I would like to respond briefly to three points."
"On this evening at the close of the year and in the run-up to Christmas, before midnight on a Tuesday, almost sixty years after the founding of the European Union, we are still discussing one of the pillars of European integration."
"We are discussing the principle of subsidiarity."
"Secondly, the question of Mr Borghezio relates to the decision of the European Court in Strasbourg that the presence of crosses in Italian schools is a breach of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights."
"This decision has provoked fears in many states."
"The Slovak parliament last week passed a resolution in which it stated that this decision is in conflict with the cultural heritage and Christian history of Europe."
"And finally, I did not feel entirely comfortable during the reading of the draft joint resolution on which we will vote on Thursday."
"I am disappointed that we lack the courage to include in a resolution that talks about subsidiarity those points from the Lisbon Treaty that are directly connected to the programme that has been passed."
"(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if we consider that hardly anyone is here right now to talk about the question of crucifixes, given that to discuss crucifixes we must invoke the question of subsidiarity, the only logical conclusion is that we find ourselves in a Europe which is ashamed of the historical truth of its own Judeo-Christian roots and the historical truth of Christianity which, as Goethe said, is the common language of Europe."
"Within the European Parliament, there are 23 official languages which demonstrate that there is nothing that unites Europe if not Christianity."
"I would like to ask Mr Barrot a question: why, after a popular referendum in Switzerland said 'no' to minarets, did the European Commission, the European Union, the United Nations, the Arab League and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference all rally round to condemn the outcome of that referendum - even though Switzerland is not a member of the European Union - yet today, you are taking a neutral position over a question which concerns our roots, our identity and our soul?"
"(HU) As a Protestant clergyman, whose tradition regards the eight-pointed star and not the cross as the most important symbol, allow me to make a brief contribution to this debate."
"I am actually from an electoral constituency where 99% of the electorate are Catholic."
"My four children go to school with Catholic children."
"The cross does not bother us."
"I would like to make a distinction here - if I may, on a technical point - between the crucifix and the cross."
"We must be aware, even though it does not bother me personally, that there are people who are bothered by the cross or crucifix because the cross or crucifix reminds them of the Inquisition."
"I feel that this is appropriate in those countries where the practice has developed because of the Catholic tradition of having a cross in schools, especially in faith schools."
"However, Parliament should not be discussing these matters, but rather poverty, the economic crisis or how Eastern Europe is going to catch up."
"This is an unproductive debate we are having."
"We need to look at who it was who protested in that Italian school and why."
"We should have examined this one-off case rather than discuss a matter here which is already something from the past."
"I want, of course, to emphasise once again that I have nothing against the cross as I, too, live everyday looking at the cross, which does not bother me."
"We must create the right living conditions in Italy or Romania so that this does not become a subject of debate."
"Madam President, in recent years, we have witnessed an ongoing campaign to suppress freedom of religious expression."
"Christian nurses have been disciplined for offering to pray with patients and, only today, Lillian Ladele, a Christian registrar who was told to perform civil partnerships or face dismissal, has lost her case for religious discrimination at the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom."
"Equality laws have failed to protect Christians - indeed, quite the opposite."
"An amendment to the Equality Bill to protect the religious liberty of churches was voted down in the House of Commons two weeks ago, amid accusations of interference from the EU Commission."
"The Commission, in their reasoned opinion, argued that the UK needs to narrow the religious liberty safeguard in its employment laws."
"I say: shame on the Commission."
"There must be a recognition that people have faith and have the right to express that faith."
"Christians ought to be protected, and not punished, by the law."
"Madam President, the country with which I am most familiar has seen some harsh confrontations on these subjects, and I would like very simply, but on a personal level, to express the wish that the European Parliament's policy remains one of mutual tolerance and respect."
"There are, in fact, families that wish to follow a Christian tradition."
"There are families that may question that tradition."
"This religious and cultural diversity is what makes us, is what makes Europe."
"I believe that we must remain very prudent when dealing with an issue such as this."
"I take the liberty of saying this quite simply because I myself have suffered, in the country with which I am most familiar, from extremes on both sides."
"That being said, I am a lawyer and, quite honestly, I do not see how this debate can be held here, when it should have been held first at the Assembly of the Council of Europe and in our national parliaments."
"That is where I believe this debate should really take place."
"Moreover, we are obliged - I am obliged, on behalf of the Commission - to say that the Commission is certainly very committed to respect for the principle of religious freedom and that it would obviously be compelled to react against any form of discrimination against persons belonging to a particular religion."
"Having said that, the Commission may not act outside the legal framework laid down by the treaties."
"Moreover, it may not intervene as guardian of the treaties on issues concerning a Member State when those issues do not relate to European Union law."
"I am obliged to say this, quite simply."
"The Commission can only note the various positions that have been expressed in this House, but it cannot express an opinion on an issue that does not come under European law."
"Once again, these issues come under the domestic legal system of the Member States."
"That is what I can say for my part, as a lawyer."
"Nonetheless, I believe that this debate is useful and that it was interesting, of course, even though I would quite simply encourage all those who have taken part in this debate to keep a necessary sense of proportion and to allow the Council of Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in turn to usefully debate the interpretations that could be given to a European Declaration of Human Rights."
"Quite honestly, however, as guardians of the treaties we cannot intervene in a debate that essentially concerns the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights."
"I apologise for not being able to give you a better answer this evening, but I am obliged, in all honesty and in accordance with the law, to respond in this way."
"I honestly believe that we are talking about problems that are dealt with today in the Union within the framework of the domestic legal system of each Member State."
"I have received six motions for resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure,."
"The debate is closed."
"The vote will take place on Thursday, 17 December 2009."
"Written statements (Rule 149)"
"in writing. - (DE) The ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is the expression of an aggressive secularism and gives authority to those who want the public domain to be religion-free."
"In so doing, they are overlooking the fact that our continent cannot exist without Christianity."
"Christianity has defined Europe, its people, culture and art and its way of thinking to the extent that the continent would lose its identity if all traces of Christianity were to be removed."
"It is certainly not about calling into question the freedom of religion."
"The separation of the Church and the State is a supreme benefit of our democracy and I would like us to take care to ensure that both carry out their own tasks with mutual respect for one another."
"However, this respect is exactly what it is all about."
"The Christian Church must not demand that everyone subscribe to its beliefs, but it is entitled to demand to be respected by everyone."
"Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what does freedom of religion actually mean?"
"The answer is quite simple."
"It is the freedom to practise religion."
"Freedom of religion is not freedom from religion but the freedom to have religion."
"Freedom of religion does not create a religion-free society, but rather gives people the right to practice their religion openly within society."
"A crucifix in the classroom does not force anyone to believe, or not to believe."
"Therefore, it does not violate the freedom of religion."
"Nor have I ever heard of a right entitling someone not to be confronted with religious symbols."
"If this were the case, we would, in fact, immediately have to prohibit all crosses on gravestones and all church spires."
"The crucifix ruling of the European Court of Human Rights is therefore not only an attack on the principle of subsidiarity, but it also violates the right to religious freedom itself."
"We, the European Parliament, cannot and must not accept this ruling."
"The European Court of Human Rights should administer justice and not become a puppet for ideological and anti-Christian interests."
"Otherwise, we will have to seriously consider whether this Court actually still has a purpose at all."
"In my opinion, the ruling of the Court has nothing to do with protecting freedom of religion."
"The presence of a cross in a classroom does not, on its own, exert pressure on a person's worldview and does not violate the right of parents to raise their children in accordance with their own convictions, just as that right is not violated by wearing clothes which testify to the profession of a particular faith."
"A mutual understanding and openness to others lies at the foundation of a common, united Europe, as does respect for cultural differences between countries and the roots and traditions of the nations which make up the European Union."
"It is no secret that the sources of our European identity derive directly from the Christian tradition."
"Therefore, for a clear majority of Europeans, a cross is a religious symbol and, at the same time, a symbol which represents their values."
"I do not imagine that the mutual dialogue which we conduct with each other every day should be devoid of the values which we hold."
"Neither do I imagine that, in the name of religious freedom, we should be forced to deny what is, for us, an important and sacred symbol, irrespective of whether it be a cross, a Star of David or a crescent moon."
"Just as no one has the right to force anyone to adhere to a particular religion or value system, so also no one has the right to compel, in the name of freedom, anyone to remove symbols which are important for the whole of humanity."
"By its ruling, the Court of Human Rights is not, in fact, upholding religious freedom, but is discriminating against all those in whose lives symbols of faith have significant meaning."
"Agenda for next sitting: see Minutes"
"Closure of the sitting"
"Opening of the sitting"
"Mr President, at the beginning of this week's part-session, you answered a question from my Austrian colleague, Jörg Leichtfried, on the new Members joining this Parliament as a result of the Lisbon Treaty and when that could take place."
"You answered that this is now up to the Council."
"I agree as regards them joining this Parliament as full Members, but I am not sure that this is the case when it comes to their status as observers as an introduction to actually becoming full Members."
"I interpret the decision we took recently on David Martin's report on our own internal rules so that we are actually free to let them start working as observers as soon as they are elected and their election confirmed by their Member State, and that we as a parliament can decide ourselves on the conditions for their position as observers."
"Mr President, could you please discuss this with the rapporteur, Mr Martin, in order to come to a solution as soon as possible?"
"It would be unreasonable if new Members who are already elected and whose election has been confirmed by the national authorities have to wait for months and months before they can actually start working."
"Many of them are prepared to start immediately."
"As I said before, I have asked about the decision of the European Council, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs should also take into account and study the problem."
"There is no final decision yet about the number of new seats and from which country they should come."
"There is no final decision."
"I know it is the decision of the European Parliament, but it is not final, so it is not so easy to take observers without having the final decision about the number and from which country they should come."
"So we must wait."
"I am thinking about that and taking care about that very strongly."
"(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I agree that this is a difficult matter to settle."
"I do not think it is impossible, but, from the point of view of my group, I would like to say that, with regard to the discussion in France, we find it unacceptable for observers, whatever their status, to at the same time remain members of their national parliaments."
"We believe that those who come here as observers should relinquish their national mandates."
"(FR) Mr President, in accordance with Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure, we are gathered here to debate the results of the Swedish Presidency - I applaud Prime Minister Reinfeldt, who has given us a courageous, useful and effective Presidency - but we are also here to examine the results of the European Council of 10 and 11 December."
"On this matter, I would like to draw the attention of the President of the Commission, which is the guardian of the treaties and their application, to Article 15(6) of the Treaty on European Union, which stipulates that the President of the European Council must present a report after every European Council meeting."
"It seems certain that Mr Van Rompuy, the new President of the European Council, will not be joining us, and I regret that."
"Indeed, he has been in office since 1 December 2009, he carries out an intense diplomatic role, and I believe that his first political act should have been to come and present himself to the European Parliament."
"It was therefore up to him to come and present the conclusions of the European Council of 10 and 11 December 2009."
"If I may explain: an understanding was made between the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, and the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Reinfeldt, that this last month of the Presidency will be conducted according to the old principles."
"That understanding is in force."
"The President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy, will take up office on 1 January 2010."
"(FR) Mr President, it is not the responsibility of the Heads of State or Government to deal with the application of treaties that have been ratified by the peoples."
"I will explain in greater detail: inviting and working with the President of the European Council and the serving Prime Minister who represents the rotating presidency is a decision which belongs to all Members of Parliament."
"We, too, will decide who is invited and in what order."
"We are also going to agree between the institutions - the European Parliament and the European Council - how we are going to work together."
"In addition, I think your remarks are premature."
"An interinstitutional agreement must be made."
"The European Commission is also involved in this."
"It is too early to discuss this."
"It is very important that we maintain an appropriate balance between the current presidency and Head of Government, and the President of the European Council, Mr Van Rompuy."
"Our presidencies change, while the President remains the same, but we also need to cooperate with the Heads of Government."
"We need cooperation with governments, because as a legislative body, we must have permanent contact with the government of the country which has the presidency."
"Furthermore, the way in which we are going to work together, and whom we invite, is also our decision - in consultation with the European Council, of course."
"We are going to hold talks about this."
"I would like to tell you that it is far too early to be doing this."
"Meanwhile, Mr Reinfeldt is giving the report of the last six months' activity of the European Council."
"Mr Van Rompuy was not involved in this work, because he was nominated only a few weeks ago, so he could not discuss this matter at all today."
"The matter is absolutely clear."
"Implementing measures (Rule 88): see Minutes"
"Results of the Swedish Presidency - Outcome of the European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009 (debate)"
"I would like to warmly welcome Prime Minister Reinfeldt, who has been with us for nearly half a year as President-in-Office."
"I would also like to welcome President Barroso."
"The next item is the joint debate on:"
"the Council statement on the results of the Swedish Presidency;"
"the European Council report and Commission statement on the outcome of the European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009."
"President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, I am grateful for this opportunity to address the European Parliament once again and at such a crucial time."
"As we speak, representatives from 193 countries are gathered in a conference centre in Copenhagen, talking, arguing, negotiating and trying to meet the expectations of millions of people around the world."
"In just two days, the UN climate conference will be over."
"Soon we will be looking back at a meeting that was crucial, not only for the EU but for the world; a meeting that was decisive for those who cannot grow their crops because of a lack of water, decisive for those who have lost their homes in tornadoes or floods, and decisive for those who are vainly building walls against a sea level that rises every year."
"We know what is at risk, so why is it then so difficult to act?"
"Is it because we fear any change of our way of life?"
"Still, we know that if we keep on using the world's resources the way we do, our current way of life will no longer be an option and we will face even more drastic changes."
"We have much greater things than our everyday comfort to fear."
"The fight against climate change has been at the top of the agenda throughout the Swedish Presidency, at all our European Council meetings and in all our summits with the Union's major partners."
"As you probably know, we adopted a comprehensive mandate at our October European Council to keep the EU's leading position in the climate negotiations."
"We agreed on a long-term goal for emissions reductions of 80-95% by 2050 and we renewed our offer to reduce emissions - 30%, provided that others make comparable efforts."
"We agreed on emission reductions for international transport and, despite resistance from some corners, we put figures on the global financial need in developing countries to fight climate change."
"Last week - after weeks of bilateral consultations - we took yet another step: a collectively put-together financial package earmarked for the 'fast start' of climate action in developing countries, offering EUR 7.2 billion for the coming three years."
"I know that this is not enough."
"Therefore I must say that, while I am satisfied that the European Council could agree to this step, the time is now ripe for other developed countries to join us."
"So, what do we need to do in Copenhagen?"
"We need binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, not just from the developed countries, but also from developing countries, to ensure that global warming keeps below the 2 °C target that science tells us is necessary."
"I have sat down with the Indian and Chinese leadership."
"I know what they say about this."
"Why should they agree to develop clean and green, when we have polluted the world for decades?"
"That is one way of looking at it, but the problem is this: the developed world cannot solve the problem alone."
"Emissions from the developing world are already starting to exceed those from the developed world."
"That is why we must work together to solve the problem."
"From our side, we can compensate for years of irresponsible behaviour."
"We can help finance climate action in the developing world."
"The European Union took its responsibility last week."
"It is not the form that matters in Copenhagen but the substance."
"We can be satisfied if we get a deal on emissions reductions and on financing, and a commitment to start immediate action and, more importantly, we can start fighting climate change."
"Last year, we were suddenly faced with the most serious financial crisis since the 1930s."
"The ground was literally shaking under our feet."
"Suddenly it became clear to us how interlinked the financial markets were and how interdependent we all were in finding a common response."
"In the course of only a few months, governments in the EU adopted extraordinary support measures."
"It was a fast and impressive response but it came with a price."
"Our aggregated deficit in public finances now amounts to almost 7% of GDP - over three times more than last year."
"Twenty Member States are experiencing excessive deficit procedures."
"So the follow-up to the economic and financial crisis has, quite naturally, been another main priority throughout this autumn."
"Let me briefly touch on what we have done."
"At the end of October, we agreed on a fiscal exit strategy, and at last week's European Council, we agreed on principles for exiting from financial support schemes."
"In addition, we agreed on a fundamentally new structure for financial supervision in Europe."
"When financial flows are international, supervision can no longer be national."
"Now it is up to the European Parliament to agree to the final steps."
"It was also clear to us that the 'bonus culture' could not continue in the way in which people had become used to."
"I am pleased that the EU managed to convince the G20 to agree on far-reaching changes to this policy."
"The new rules will reinforce the need for a link between result and reward."
"The economic and financial crisis hit us hard but we have shown the ability to act and we have strengthened our resistance."
"Once we have secured our recovery, the EU will stand stronger, thanks to the measures we have adopted."
"The Swedish Presidency took place during a period of institutional change."
"When we took over on 1 July, this Parliament was newly elected."
"We had not yet appointed a President of the European Commission."
"The outcome of the then pending Irish referendum was uncertain."
"It was not clear whether the Treaty of Lisbon would be ratified by all Member States."
"It was not even clear whether it could enter into force during the Swedish Presidency."
"Then the drama unravelled."
"In close consultation with this Parliament, José Manuel Barroso was appointed President of the European Commission for a second term."
"The Presidency now had a stable counterpart in the Commission to work with."
"The outcome of the Irish referendum was a victory for Ireland."
"It was a victory for European cooperation."
"It brought us one step closer to the Treaty of Lisbon."
"But then the unexpected happened."
"At a late stage, the Czech President came with new conditions before he would sign."
"We had to handle these requests in a way that did not trigger similar conditions from other Member States and we managed to do this at the European Council in October."
"A few days later, the Czech President signed."
"Immediately after the signature, I started to consult my colleagues again."
"We had to agree on high-ranking positions - on the President of the European Council, and to nominate the High Representative."
"I am not exaggerating when I say it was a relief when all preparations were finalised on 1 December."
"The Treaty of Lisbon could finally enter into force."
"Now, the European Union will be more efficient."
"It will have better tools to fight climate change and influence the global economic agenda."
"The new President of the European Council will ensure continuity."
"The High Representative will assure coordination in our external relations."
"We will have a more democratic Union with the greater involvement of the European Parliament and of our national parliaments."
"A new era for the European Union has begun."
"When I stood here before you on 15 July, we were still in the throes of the financial and economic crisis."
"There was uncertainty on the transition of the new treaty."
"We did not know whether we would manage to unite ourselves and encourage others on the not so long - but very winding - road to Copenhagen."
"With the European Council meeting last week, the Swedish Presidency has delivered on all five of its priorities: a strong EU mandate for climate change; follow-up of the economic and financial crisis; the EU Baltic Sea Strategy; the Stockholm Programme for justice and home affairs; reinforcing the EU as a global actor, including enlargement, and a new external action service."
"As I said, with the Treaty of Lisbon in place, a new era has begun in the European Union."
"I would like to end by thanking all of you."
"The Presidency needed the help of the European Parliament in tackling the challenges we were facing."
"Thank you for giving us that help."
"I would also like to thank the Commission, and especially José Manuel Barroso."
"I have probably spent more than a healthy amount of time with José Manuel this autumn."
"He has been a tremendous support to me and to the Swedish Presidency."
"Finally, I would like to thank the Member States for their will to put aside differences and start compromising - with the best for Europe at heart - to find solutions that are not only of benefit to them, but to Europe as a whole."
"This unity is our strength."
"President of the Commission. - Mr President, Prime Minister, during the past six months, we have seen a new treaty come into force, ending almost a decade of debate and opening the door to new opportunities for this new, enlarged European Union we have today."
"We have seen the first evidence that decisive action taken to stabilise the European economy in the face of crisis is bearing some results."
"And as we enter the end game in Copenhagen, we can be clear that the European Union has been working hard to maintain the momentum it has championed towards decisive global action on climate change."
"I would therefore like to pay a very sincere tribute to Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and all the team of the Swedish Presidency for a highly successful presidency."
"It is particularly important that the Swedish Presidency has been so effective in ensuring the completion of the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty, managing the transition to this new treaty while achieving all the other objectives."
"We have seen the appointment of the first President of the European Council and of the first High Representative, the Vice-President of the Commission, by the European Council."
"And let us not forget - because it was a very important moment for this Parliament, following the unanimous designation by the European Council - we have seen the election by this Parliament of the President of the next Commission with a qualified majority."
"Last week's European Council was the first time that it has met as a fully fledged institution."
"It was also the first time that the new High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission, Catherine Ashton, has attended."
"The new President of the European Council will be fully functioning by 1 January 2010 and has presented his ideas on how to organise the European Council in the future."
"I very much welcome all the proposals to give the European Council more consistency and more continuity in its work."
"I also welcome the ideas of having more political, frank discussions and short and punchy conclusions."
"There were many other issues that were the object of the European Council."
"I would like to highlight just some, not forgetting one very important one, the definition of the Baltic Strategy, which can be a model for other regional cooperation inside the European Union and with some of our partners."
"On the economy, we are keeping the right balance between maintaining the stimulus and preparing our exit strategies."
"I presented the scene for our European 2020 Strategy."
"I hope the European Council will focus on the discussion of this very important agenda for the future of Europe, namely through discussions in the next meetings, in the formal European Council in February and in the spring European Council."
"I would like to reiterate here my offer to come to this plenary so that Parliament can organise a specific debate on this very important issue."
"I think it is extremely important that there is full ownership by the European Parliament and, on the side of the Council, by the European Council, of this European Union 2020 Strategy, which is where our future will be played."
"On the Stockholm Programme, the Commission's proposals have now been translated into an agreed approach for the next five years."
"I know that many in this Parliament share our determination to use this springboard to seize the opportunities of the Lisbon Treaty for a step change in European action on freedom, security and justice."
"That was one of the major reasons why I decided to reorganise the portfolios of the next College in this area."
"It is going to be one of the most important areas of the European Union's work in the next five years."
"The European Council had a particular significance for climate change."
"In the past few years, the European Union has developed a consistent and ambitious approach on climate change."
"I am very proud that the Commission has been the initiator of this very ambitious agenda."
"The impact of reduced emissions may only be felt in several decades' time, but we are already taking concrete steps, giving our targets the force of law."
"Let us be frank about this."
"Some of our partners are announcing their intentions by press statements; but we have announced our intentions by law, law that is already agreed by all the Member States."
"The developed world must act, but it must also help the developing world to decouple growth and emissions."
"I think that it is right that the European Council last week centred on how we can put this global leadership at the service of an ambitious deal at Copenhagen: by promising help to developing countries not in some distant future but already next year; by making clear that the deal must be comprehensive and must have the verification mechanisms to make it stick; by maintaining our readiness to up our targets, but only if others put ambitious commitments on the table as well."
"I think the European Council achieved very important results, namely on two matters."
"First, on finance, the Council was able successfully to put together a fast-start finance package, bigger than expected and, critically, with every Member State involved."
"Of course, some have said that this is not enough coming from the European Union, but EUR 7.2 billion, more than USD 10 billion in the current circumstances, and for three years, is a very serious commitment."
"I hope the money is now guaranteed, not just an aspiration."
"It is now for others to match it."
"The European Council also reiterated its commitment for medium-term financing, to ensure it gives the fair contribution that is necessary for 2020."
"Second, action on climate has sometimes been a divisive point for the European Council."
"However, the atmosphere this time was different."
"There was a strong shared sense that everyone has an interest in the European Union pulling its weight."
"We should now be getting the benefits from the investment we have made as the pioneers in this agenda."
"What I did find generally encouraging was recognition that the European Union has to stand together."
"Let us hope that this determination holds firm under the pressures of the next two or three days."
"What can we expect over the next few days?"
"Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark will probably put forward a text today - but with a lot of the key numbers still left blank."
"The leaders' task will be to move this forward to a deal."
"This is why I am going to Copenhagen immediately after this debate."
"Together with Prime Minister Reinfeldt, we will do our best for the European Union to lead this debate."
"We know that the atmosphere at the moment is not easy at Copenhagen."
"We also know that this is part of the usual rhythm of a top negotiation."
"However, the arrival of so many Heads of State or Government will be a powerful driver to reach a deal."
"If that deal includes real commitment to cut emissions from both developed and developing countries; a clear commitment on financing to make this happen; and an agreement on how this is to be applied and verified - if this agreement includes the different elements of the Bali road map and can be seen to be in the right ball park to respect the 2 °C limit, then I think we will say rightly that it will be a major achievement."
"We are not there yet, but I believe it is possible to reach that agreement."
"The next few days will show whether the ambitions we have discussed in this Parliament so often are going to be realised, but I sense already that there is a compelling need for change and that we need to make this success in Copenhagen."
"There is a huge amount at stake."
"There is, of course, a balance to be found, but there is also a sense that today's generation knows that there is a challenge which cannot be avoided."
"I believe last week's European Council left the European Union ready to meet the challenge."
"I hope that with European leadership, we will achieve success at Copenhagen."
"Mr President, Mr Barroso, Mr Reinfeldt, ladies and gentlemen, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) identifies with the way in which you, Mr Reinfeldt, have managed the rotating presidency, in accordance with the Treaty of Nice."
"It also identifies with the latest proposals by the European Council, whether on climate change, the crisis or the creation of a Europe of security, of a Europe that protects."
"Indeed, my group supports the honest and responsible management of European affairs, which has been the hallmark of the Swedish Presidency."
"Honest management, because, at a time when so many of our friends, neighbours and relatives are being hit by the crisis because they have lost their jobs or their jobs are still under threat, Europe has not made false promises to them."
"It is building the future, our future, by making sure that businesses once again have the means to create, to innovate and thus to create jobs."
"Responsible management, because, on climate change, on security, but also on employment and the economy, Europe is implementing the social market economy model."
"It is organising the timetable, the arrangements for a concerted, gradual but also difficult exit from the crisis."
"It is cleaning up the disastrous practices that we have seen on the financial markets over the past few decades."
"It is supporting SMEs and strengthening social cohesion, without which nothing lasting can be achieved."
